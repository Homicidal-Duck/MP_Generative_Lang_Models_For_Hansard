fair enough in the case of an adult but what the committee is being asked to do is to say that it should be so in the case of a child <e> <s> in other words the child is being deprived <e>", "<cs>

indeed the noble lord lord mishcon whom i should like to thank for his lucid and courteous approach to this question made what i think is almost the classical argument for conservatism with a big c

case against its enemies on all the opposite sides of the committee <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether that question is addressed to me or to the noble lord lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon said that he would try to explain his amendment in laymans language <e> <s> i am not absolutely sure either that he has succeeded in that ambition or that in my reply i shall be able to use only laymans language in order to explain what the clause is about <e> <s> the background at any rate is a perfectly simple one it is that if somebody has deliberately hidden his own wrongdoing or in certain other cases where his action has been such that it would be unconscionable for him to rely on the limitation period to save him from the consequences of his wrongdoing he should not be able to take advantage of the limitation period <e> <s> the noble lord quite rightly says that it is a new clause but the purpose of the clause is to restate the law more or less as it is in language which is more or less contemporary because the old law has come to be interpreted by the courts in such a way that the old language is no longer contemporary and this is thought to be an easier way of putting it <e>", "<cs> if i may say so the noble and learned lord has made a very reasonable request <e> <s> these are very recondite matters and the last thing i want to do is stand on my dignity if i have

but will ask my advisers to help me in the course of my lucubrations <e>", "<cs> again i am delighted in one sense but surprised in another that this suggestion should come from the benches opposite and not from behind me <e> <s> what the noble lord with all the authority of the law society behind him is saying is that i should use a non-contentious law reform bill as a vehicle for making contingency provision against the possibility of future strikes in the public service <e> <s> i am advised that this might make the bill contentious in another place and unless the amendment is absolutely essential it ought not for that reason to be agreed to law reform being by consent or not at all <e> <s> i think this is really the stage at which the politician takes the place in my heart in preference to the lawyer <e> <s> of course if the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones were to assure me that his party were solidly behind the law society and the noble lord lord mishcon then it is conceivable that my heart might soften towards lord mishcon <e> <s> but unless i get such an assurance i am bound to advise the committee that this is not really a good thing to do in the way suggested <e>", "<cs> these matters are wrapped like others in impenetrable mystery and i can only remind the noble and learned lord of the words of the white knight in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to

this bill with the totally different and potentially more controversial question whether or to what extent we should attempt to imitate the americans in giving the citizen a general right legally enforceable through the courts of access to government files <e> <s> what is beyond controversy is that such an attempt raises totally separate issues outside the scope of the present measure and any

says yes it does <e> <s> that was my opinion because in my original speech i said i regarded it not indeed as minor but as minimal <e>", "<cs> yes i think this was an accidental omission by the draftsman <e> <s> i am told by my noble friend that it is also customary <e> <s> my noble friend is most helpful <e> <s> the extraordinary versatility of my noble friend has more than once been commented upon in your lordships house he is now turning his attention to law <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> as noble lords will see from the table of derivations at the back of this bill its provisions derive from no less than acts of parliament <e> <s> it is accordingly i hope a most useful piece of consolidation which will i believe be greatly welcomed by local authorities who are charged with the duty of carrying out these services <e> <s> there are no changes in the law made by the bill it is therefore pure consolidation <e> <s> if read a second time by your lordships this bill will also be referred in the usual way to the joint committee <e> <s> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the statement has been cleared in the commons <e> <s> would it be the wish of the house that i should put the question now or await the statement now <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords <e> <s> i thought my noble friend lord sandys was going to repeat the statement <e> <s> he had a document in his hand <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not put the question before

word to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i hope he will not take offence at all but i thought of one or two things when i heard the debate in committee and i have been reflecting upon this matter in consultation with others <e> <s> the difficulty is this both my honourable friend in the lower house and the noble and learned lord who has spoken think it is necessarily the case that in appeals on fact all the witnesses must come again so i am perhaps in a minority of one if i question that dogma because the noble and learned lord will know even better than i that in every high court case and in most county court cases there is an appeal on fact brought by way of a rehearing and the witnesses do not come <e> <s> i promise the noble and learned lord that i will let the appeal tribunal themselves know what he has said before third reading <e> <s> i do not think he will get a different answer <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the problems about being <e>", "<cs> the question is that amendment no <e> <s> be agreed to <e> <s> do i see my noble friend the leader of the house about to make a statement <e> <s> i have just put the question <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord mccarthy replies there is a point which i feel bound to put before the house <e> <s> in the legislation the noble and learned lord will remember that he and i had a difference of opinion about the european convention on human rights <e> <s> i begged him then to consider its implication on the legislative provisions that he was then supporting <e> <s> he told me in effect with his usual courtesy that i was not right <e> <s> the result was the humiliating report of the european commission in the case of the three railway men <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perhaps time that i said <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not hear the first question that my noble friend put to me <e>", "<cs> yes i think that we can be sure that they will be entirely free from doubt but if they are in doubt there is always the appeal to the employment appeals tribunal which will resolve the doubt for them <e> <s> that is what the first debate we had this afternoon was about <e> <s> will my noble friend remind me of the second point <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend rather assumes that the european court will go further than the commission and in the direction of my noble friend lord de lisle <e> <s> it might adopt the minority opinion to which the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton gave expression and to which i think three members of the commission gave certain degrees of expression <e> <s> but so far as i know we will not go back on this bill if the minority opinion prevails because that would i think be a retrograde step <e> <s> however if in fact the court comes to a decision presumably we shall have to make a statement of some kind in parliament and that would be free for debate <e> <s> the question of whether clarification may be required and if so what kind must remain in the womb of the future until we know what the court actually decides <e>", "<cs> if that is a deeply-held personal conviction it <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will look at the clause i think he will find that deeply-held conviction includes membership of a particular union <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to pre-empt anything which my noble friend lord gowrie is going to say but i really indicated my own approach to this matter <e> <s> i think it is in fact the thin end of a fairly fat wedge <e> <s> i have been a member of a professional institution for the whole of my life and so has my noble and learned friend the lord advocate <e> <s> i would always put those practices which are based on ethical grounds as matters of conscience with me and therefore directly covered by the bill <e> <s> i know there are certain practices which have mostly been done away with in my profession for instance that you had to charge a special fee for going to quarter sessions which i am not sure i could put quite so highly as that and i think they might be too widely protected if one tried to get them within the terms of the european convention although some people might hold them as deeply-held personal convictions <e> <s> my view is that what is a deeply-held personal conviction what is a matter of conscience is a matter of fact and degree and that we had far better leave it to the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl really means if he will allow me to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to add something because i really think that i ought to correct the noble lord lord mccarthy on the position about the professions <e> <s> what he seemed to say is a very commonly held error but it is a complete error if i understood him correctly <e> <s> the aim of a professional association like any other organisation is to get as wide a membership as possible but it is certainly not the intention of any such membership to have a closed shop <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble baroness was rising when the noble lord sought to withdraw the amendment

short as it is legitimately possible for me to be in regard to the large attendance in your lordships house and the great importance of the matters which we are now discussing <e> <s> but i begin by saying a word <e>", "<cs> my lords when we had this interesting and rather rarefied discussion at committee stage the noble lord lord robbins said that he did not understand what it was about <e> <s> if neither of us could make the noble lord lord robbins understand what it was about i must say it must be very difficult indeed to understand what it is about <e> <s> i think that in a notable letter to <e>", "<cs> by leave <e>", "<cs> my lords the question related to legislation <e> <s> it would be quite improper for me to discuss the use of the royal prerogative in any particular case <e>", "<cs> my lords we might find ourselves turning into a very highly religious assembly with mitred abbots ex-moderators and chief rabbis <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of recommitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful indeed to the noble lord lord blease for what he has just said <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to notify the house in accordance with the royal assent act the the queen has signified her royal assent to the following acts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful both to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and also to the noble lord lord wigoder for their support of the regulations which i have just moved <e> <s> i am very glad of the confirmation which both noble lords have given to my view that the green form scheme is one of the most valuable additions to the legal aid service that has been made since its inception <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i should like to thank the noble lord lord mischon for what he has said <e> <s> i think that lawyers of both <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are at present considering the comments of interested bodies on the main recommendation in the law commissions report that there should be a statutory entitlement to interest and a decision will be announced in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i can think of a great number of arguments on both sides both good and bad but i must tell the noble lord that so far as a result of the various consultations with the parties alleged to be interested no very clear consensus has been arrived at <e> <s> the law society the association of british chambers of commerce and the nfu are apparently so far in favour the cbi the national chamber of trade and most parties representing consumers dislike the proposals and reservations have been expressed generally about the inflexibility of a statutory scheme <e> <s> the noble lord asked me for my private opinion but i cannot give that otherwise i would <e>", "<cs> well my lords what is a substantial period of time is as long as a piece of string <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords i am vastly encouraged <e>", "<cs> my lords i was aware that in most european countries a proposal similar to that contained in the law commissions report was already law and that those countries have not suffered so far from any moral social or economic disintegration <e> <s> but other people apparently take a very different view from me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am terribly sorry i only heard the first three words of that supplementary question which went can the noble and learned lord assure the house <e> <s> from then onwards everything was <e>", "<cs> my lords i have got the question now <e> <s> it is a very common practice to offer discounts for cash and that i think is common throughout industry <e> <s> it is also i think occasionally the practice to insert in a contract penalties for delayed payment <e> <s> obviously if in fact there are a number of bad debts that will reflect itself in an increase in prices but whether that in itself is inflationary or deflationary i shall leave it to the economists to argue about <e>", "<cs> may i take it that the noble baroness has moved that the sitting of the house be suspended during pleasure <e> <s> the question is that the sitting of the house be suspended during pleasure <e>", "<cs> no i have not put the question yet <e> <s> the question is that the sitting of the house be suspended during pleasure <e>", "<cs> my lords the question is that the house do adjourn during pleasure <e> <s> that is the correct question <e>", "<cs> unfortunately my lords the motion did not contain a time at which the house should resume <e> <s> therefore i hope i may do right if i select a time to return to the woolsack <e> <s> if i do it too soon a further motion with a time limit can be put but if your lordships will allow me i would propose to give the house half an hour <e> <s> if i may resume the woolsack then i shall be here and i hope that your lordships will too <e>", "<cs> my lords i ought to remind your lordships that i had proposed to the house on the motion of the leader of the house that the bill should now be read a third time after which there was a procedural motion which was carried <e> <s> we are now back here again <e> <s> there was then a statement <e> <s> the question which as i understand it is now before the house is that the said bill be now read a third time <e> <s> as many as are of that opinion will say content <e> <s> to the contrary not-content <e> <s> the contents have it <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the tribute of the audience in this country to the overseas broadcasting services in english because i am one of the discriminating audience to which the noble lord referred as i imagine are a number of other people in this house <e> <s> i cannot comment on rumours but i must point out to the noble lord whose enjoyment of the service i share that the purpose of the external broadcasts is to broadcast externally <e> <s> if in fact we were talking about the domestic services of the bbc i do not think that it would be me answering the question this afternoon because those services are differently funded <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only endorse what my noble friend says about the best broadcasting news service but the domestic services of the bbc are a matter for the bbc <e> <s> this afternoon we are talking about the external services for which the foreign and commonwealth office is responsible <e> <s> i cannot say what will be the audibility of the orfordness transmitter i am told i cannot at any rate <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend knows so much more about this than i do <e> <s> i only hope that he turns out to be right because i should hate to be deprived of this service <e> <s> there is a limiting factor which i should have mentioned in my reply to the noble lord lord whaddon <e> <s> i think that there is a limitation based on the necessity under which the bbc is constrained not to interfere with the legitimate metre band which some other countries use legitimately under international arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i agree with the noble baroness but i may be making a mistake about this because i am not operating on my own wavelength this afternoon <e> <s> but i think that the orfordness transmitter is designed primarily for western europe <e> <s> i agree that the world services are more widely intended <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that this is desirable but speaking from where i stand i can only repeat that the external services are financed by the foreign and commonwealth office for the purposes of our overall external services <e> <s> i myself derive enormous advantages from listening to the external services on more than one wave length <e> <s> i regard it as very highly desirable that people should be able to do so but i do not think that the foreign and commonwealth office could be asked to provide that very valuable by-product <e>", "<cs> my lords in conformity with the statement of the european council of th june her majestys government believe that the palestine liberation organisation should be associated with peace negotiations <e> <s> her majestys government do not give the palestine liberation organisation any official recognition or exclusive status but consider that the degree of support which they enjoy among palestinians is such that they cannot be ignored in the search for peace <e> <s> one of the principles on which negotiations will need to be <e>", "<cs> my lords if i was not fully audible to my noble friend i can only apologise <e> <s> it must be my fault although we are all operating under difficulties <e> <s> i note with admiration my noble friends association with allenbys entry into jerusalem as part of his army <e> <s> i myself took a humble part in the late operations in the middle east in the second world war and came to know jerusalem fairly well <e> <s> whether our influence is as massive as my noble friend supposes i do not know <e> <s> i only hope that it is more massive than either of us believes <e> <s> but certainly with the venice declaration we regard all violence as abominable and believe that it should be renounced as a precondition of peace <e> <s> i do not think that in that direction i could go beyond the venice declaration but my noble friend can be absolutely sure that violence is as abhorrent to me as i know it is to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i would go along with the noble lord in admitting that the plo is not my favourite body of people but it has a certain amount of support in various international organisations and if what we want is a lasting peace i think that it would be foolish to disregard the feelings of our friends who were assembled at venice and who were unanimous on the points which i made in my original answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i was being rather careful and i hope that i have not departed from that <e> <s> obviously internal legislation by israel at the moment cannot alter the international legal position <e> <s> that would not be possible purely by an internal legislative act <e> <s> but personally i should prefer to say that jerusalem remains a city which is holy in three world religions all of which profess to be in favour of peace <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not see the particular programme to which my noble friend refers <e>", "<cs> my lords when i find that the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts agrees with something i have said i am reassured <e> <s> i hope he is not disquieted if i tell him that i agree with what he has just said <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be sorry to think that i <e>", "<cs> my lords the united nations organisation not only by resolution but by the recognition of the state of israel recognises its right to exist and no lasting peace could possibly be attained in the middle east which was worth having for the civilised world which did not continue to acknowledge this right which is indissoluble for any member of the united nations organisation <e> <s> but one may of course differ as to means and the attempt to make all organisations renounce unilateral action and recourse to violence is part and i should have thought an indispensable part of the search for peace particularly for a nation like ourselves who as my noble friend reminded us in his original supplementary has such an intimate and affectionate relationship with the land to which these questions relate <e>", "<cs> my lords british governments have taken the view since the conflict that israels rights in east jerusalem do not extend beyond those of an occupying power pending an agreed solution on the <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i am aware of the concern of all right-minded people about the state of the holy land <e> <s> those of us who are friendly to israel and i hope that they are the enormous majority are concerned about her diplomatic position <e> <s> but as regards the specific question put to me by the noble lord lord brockway i think that i am right in saying that the new office to which he has referred is not yet there <e> <s> i understand that the united states has adopted a similar stance to ours about existing events and so have our european partners in the main as evinced by the venice conference <e> <s> i think that the question of the new office is still hypothetical <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that as usual i find myself in entire agreement with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord janner whose steadfastness in stating his point of view is i think the subject of admiration of all of us has raised a number of rather different matters <e> <s> i rejoiced at camp david and i would be sorry to see any action taken on either side which jeopardised what was achieved there <e> <s> i think that matters have not gone as well in recent weeks as some of us had hoped <e> <s> it is of course true that the jewish population of israel suffered indignities of an intolerable kind during the years to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> i think that during that period of time the british government adopted a stance in relation to the then occupying power similar to that which we now adopt with regard to the present occupying power <e> <s> i do not think that anyone is more conscious than i of the jewish feelings towards jerusalem <e> <s> the noble lord has movingly expressed them on a number of occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only deal with one supplementary question at a time <e> <s> i think that the whole house realises the depth of feeling that prompts the noble lord lord janner in these matters and is probably prepared to make allowances for that feeling in applying its rules of order <e> <s> the noble lord expressed the very deep feelings which jews have towards jerusalem <e> <s> he was quite right in his earlier supplementary question to refer to the fact that the monotheistic religions of the world which include islam and if i may say so in the presence of the right reverend prelate my own religion too are due of course to the inspiration of the jewish scriptures and to the frequent martyrdoms of the jewish people <e>", "<cs> my lords i did read the press reports this morning but of course one does not entirely found ones political views on the press reports of a single morning <e> <s> i think that i had better be a little careful about that but if it be true i am very glad indeed that a number of arabs and i know that there are a number of such arabs recognise the right of israel to exist because the destruction of a member of the united nations would deal a blow to world peace which would not stop at the holy land it would undermine the whole fabric of international law <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the role of britain as one now happily of the nine is to attempt to instil into the warring hearts of people who are deeply stirred by this question a love of peace <e> <s> by my answers i have tried to do that <e> <s> i do not want to go much further than that <e> <s> of course what mr <e> <s> begin does is no doubt a matter of dispute inside israel and it is also a matter of dispute outside israel but i would far rather not respond to that part of the supplementary in the way that mr <e> <s> begin responded to my noble friend lord carrington the other day <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i would have to have notice of that but i think none of the governments with whom we are in closest touch has done so but i would rather leave that to a question on notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that that was the object of the camp david agreements in which our friends and allies in the united states played such a notable part <e> <s> i hope that it will be recognised that both peace and security are interdependent <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to repeat with your lordships permission a statement which my right honourable friend the attorney-general has made this morning in another place on the subject of jury checks <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the expressions of thanks from the noble and learned lord and the noble lord <e> <s> if he will forgive my saying so i think the noble and <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe the noble and learned lord has the wrong end of the stick here <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord began by saying that he agreed with every word of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and then proceeded to disagree with what seemed to me to be the one unexceptionable statement that the noble lord had made namely that we were not debating majority verdicts <e> <s> since the new proposals whatever they may be and whatever their merits will not alter the powers of the director of public prosecution i do not see the relevance of what the noble lord says on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend and i entirely agree with what he says <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord knows the use of the houses time is not a matter for me <e> <s> i do not see my noble friend the leader of the house in his place but i see the chief whip present and no doubt he will convey the feelings of the noble lord to the leader <e> <s> my own feeling is that this is a complex matter and that it should be carefully considered <e> <s> when we come to debate it as obviously we must we ought to have had a much wider opportunity of seeing the reactions in the press and consulting our friends in the profession <e> <s> we do not want to hurry a debate but of course if the house wants a debate next week i am sure that the leader will pay attention to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that amity has been restored <e>", "<cs> my lords i must here if i follow the athanasian creed while maintaining the substance of my remarks distinguish between lord hailsham and the lord chancellor because as my noble friend will be aware when earlier in this session i was replying to the debate on the bill to which i referred i was relatively favourable <e> <s> but i do not think having been present throughout the debate that it really could be said that the rather frosty reception which it received on almost all hands except from the noble and learned lord lord scarman and myself was very encouraging even from the slightly different point of view which my noble friend put forward in his report <e> <s> i myself have always thought that literalism in the interpretation of statutes had won too complete a victory but one really cannot disregard the almost united feeling of the law lords and indeed i see him looking at me with a basilisk stare the less than enthusiastic reaction of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> my lords quite the reverse <e> <s> i was surprised the other day to find that it was out of print <e> <s> i think the answer is that it was a best seller and was intensely popular with a wide range of people both in the learned professions and outside in the public <e> <s> i should be sorry to think that it was to be buried <e> <s> i have made inquiries as to whether a small reprint could be ordered but whether it will be i cannot say <e> <s> it depends on all sorts of people <e>", "<cs> my lords i think both our minds are open but i think we are slightly discouraged by the preponderant view on the cross-benches <e>", "<cs> my lords the first of the three supplementary questions of the noble lord was about what he referred to as the united nations legislature authorising companies to extract minerals <e> <s> looking at my brief rather carefully i suspect that the noble lord meant the united states legislature <e> <s> the united states have enacted legislation to establish an interim procedure for the orderly development of seabed resources pending the entry into force of an acceptable law of the sea convention <e> <s> similar legislation is in the course of being enacted in the federal republic of germany <e> <s> the so-called group of seventy-seven have repeated at this session their opposition to national legislation <e> <s> her majestys government do not accept that interim legislation is contrary to international law or that it should stand in the way of efforts to negotiate an international deep seabed mining regime which gives effect to the concept of the common heritage of mankind <e> <s> i think that that really is the first instalment <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the whole house will sympathise with the noble lord lord shinwell in his desire to put down piracy on the coast of nigeria but i am afraid that i do not have ready a supplementary answer on that subject since evidently those instructing me did not think that it was likely to be asked in connection with this particular question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for the first part of his supplementary question <e> <s> peanuts is perhaps an unfortunate phrase today <e> <s> however without having noted the particular statement to which the noble lord referred i agree with him that the main outstanding issue before this conference is the question of deep seabed mining <e> <s> i think that it is possible to count ones chickens before they are hatched in this field <e> <s> we do not yet know quite what is there or how to get it <e> <s> it is obviously a matter of contention between those who have the means to get it if there is anything there and those who would like to share the proceeds but cannot have the means to get it as to how the proceeds if there are any will be distributed <e> <s> but i think that is what the conference is about <e>", "<cs> my lords taking account of both the regular programme and special projects outside it we shall still be contributing more in to the united nations childrens fund than in any year except when we gave additional funds in recognition of the international year of the child <e> <s> we are still the fourth largest regular donor to unicef <e>", "<cs> my lords united kingdom support for unicef has been rising rapidly in recent years and i think we would agree that it is one of the most effective of the united nations agencies with a high proportion of staff engaged in field programmes and a good record of activity in the poorest countries of the world and in areas of greatest need <e> <s> but this contribution to this very desirable end must be seen for instance in the light of the last question on another claim on our resources no less urgent i think the noble lord would say and of the total aid programme which in and before zimbabwe was taken into account ran at million <e> <s> i think we must take account of the fact that in borrowing million a year much of which goes on current assumptions we cannot always do as much as we should like <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may read out some figures which i think will give an effective answer to the first part of the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> one must add together the regular contributions and the contributions to special appeals and specific projects <e> <s> in our contribution to the regular programme was million with million to special appeals and specific projects in it was the year of the child the figures were million with million to special projects and appeals and in the current year the figures are million and million to special appeals and specific projects <e> <s> all three are very much the biggest contributions which we have so far made to unicef <e>", "<cs> my lords parliamentary counsel are well aware of these recommendations and subject to drafting instructions by responsible ministers will act on them <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot resist reminding my noble friend of the words of edward gibbon who was faced perhaps in his time with problems not dissimilar to these <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> my lords the same view was expressed even more succinctly by our joint predecessor lord bacon who said <e>", "<cs> my lords i just guessed <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but this would give rise of course to the same dispute as we had the other day <e> <s> the thing will ultimately depend upon our laws of interpretation <e> <s> the literalists have won what is virtually a complete triumph and the purposivists have been in retreat for years <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has spoken <e> <s> the question is that the said amendment be agreed to <e>", "<cs>

midwives who brought it into being <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i absolutely agree with him <e> <s> when complete the edition will comprise subject groups alone and that is an enormous undertaking <e> <s> i hope it will provide if they can afford it the practitioners and the parliamentary draftsmen with a working copy of the statutes which will save them an immensity of time and labour because what they will have will be virtually a loose-leaf copy of the statutes kept up to date <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know about microfilm <e> <s> what we have is an up-to-date technological method of typesetting <e> <s> it is computerised <e> <s> i am not sure whether microfilm would be much help <e>", "<cs> my lords no request has been received as yet from the canadian legislature and i notice from the public prints that it is still going through that legislature <e> <s> so far as i know there is no change in the constitutional position since th july <e> <s> it so happens that the parliamentary answer i have was given in another place by my honourable friend mr luce it would surprise me if it were different from that which was given by my noble friend lord trefgarne <e>", "<cs> i do not as yet feel any embarrassment myself my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord should have received the right paper and the one to which he can refer with confidence <e> <s> my lords may i now <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had made it very clear to the noble lord <e> <s> if i did not i apologise <e> <s> if the document was delivered in the past few minutes then he has the right one <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not know there was anything particularly obscure in what i said but if there was i apologise <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord for evidently having got the point over better than i was able to do <e> <s> may i now turn to clause <e> <s> this is a permanent clause of the bill and it puts beyond doubt the legality of the use of police cells and police constables to deal with the tailback of prisoners <e> <s> i hope and believe that this provision gives rise to small controversy <e> <s> it is the only operative provision except that relating to expiry which i have already dealt with which is permanent <e> <s> i hope that this also will prove non-controversial at this stage <e> <s> the other ones are financial provisions citation and extent and i do not think they require separate discussion <e>", "<cs> i can answer that at once my lords <e> <s> they are strictly temporary <e> <s> i explained that in my reference to clause they are part of part i <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has unravelled this matter with a piece of unrivalled research <e> <s> i do not think i can improve upon it <e> <s> the situation is even simpler <e> <s> the clause applies to persons who are subject to be detained for the time being by the authority of law in any of the named places and the secretary of state has power in relation to an approved place because that is where they will go under clause <e>", "<cs> i quite take the point that my noble friend has made <e> <s> i will certainly

am always very sympathetic <e> <s> i was just wondering whether we have lost perspective in this matter <e> <s> the position is that you are dealing in clause <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene i think i can go that far and that the noble and learned lord can extract that from me <e> <s> it is obviously right <e> <s> but i do not think the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think my noble friend is right <e> <s> i do not think i am over-simplifying it at all <e> <s> i entirely accept the policy which the noble and learned lord has put forward but i do not think i am over-simplifying it <e> <s> this is not a new power <e> <s> our opinion is that it is really a removal of doubt a statement of what the law is <e> <s> obviously it would be quite wrong for me to give the impression that notification would not take place <e> <s> it is the practice and it ought to remain the practice <e>", "<cs> i fully take that point on board too <e> <s> i think the amendment really intended that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones for what he has said <e> <s> i certainly echo his hopes although i do not know with what degree of optimism <e> <s> i should like especially to thank noble lords who have been organising the opposition from the labour and liberal benches for their co-operation and understanding in this matter <e> <s> they have been extremely courteous and very helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to notify the house in accordance with the royal assent act that the queen has signified her royal assent to the following acts <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment <e> <s> it was made in schedule to this bill and its necessity is due to the fact that when the bill was drafted it

debate will be responded to by my noble friend lord belstead and as he will by that time know what it is that noble lords will have said i hope that any questions of detail may be dealt with by him at

should say that i was not trying to restrict your lordships debate but when i am proposing the question it is necessary that i should be able to do so in comparative quiet <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to consolidate with amendments the supreme <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i hate to tell the noble baroness but she has not moved her amendment <e> <s> would she like to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord byers not having been moved the question remains whether the amendment standing in the name of the noble baroness lady birk shall be agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords the original question was that a humble address be presented to her majesty in the terms appearing on the order paper since when an amendment has been proposed in the name of the baroness birk <e> <s> the question that i have now to put to the house therefore is that the said amendment be agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer is no <e> <s> if i have misled the noble and learned lord or the house i will correct my mistake <e>", "<cs> my lords there are three questions <e> <s> first on the year-old records a full appraisal has now been made of the proposal and will be considered in the context of the concentration scheme as a whole <e> <s> the general register office will be kept in close touch with the progress of the study and of course as i have to do in this context i shall be discussing the report with my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services <e> <s> as to alternative uses i have a number of ideas in mind but perhaps it is a little premature to discuss them <e> <s> i am very short of space generally for purposes not connected with the public record office and i am keeping the judiciary informed of the report of the study <e> <s> i have forgotten what the third question was <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i am very worried about the long-term use of the national records <e> <s> i do not know whether it is generally known that since the lord chancellor was given responsibility in miles of shelf space have been utilised notwithstanding a somewhat ruthless policy of shredding <e> <s> there will come a time before long when this nation is entirely composed of those who are making public records and those who are researching into them <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i think that they are a marvellous staff <e> <s> they are very highly dedicated they have my full confidence and i have always had the happiest relations with them <e>", "<cs> obviously my lords i am under very heavy pressure like all other government departments <e> <s> but the idea of closing the reading room which is one of the devices to which i was put is now in abeyance pending the result of the study <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that anything that it does will be unbiased i think unbiased was the adjective used <e> <s> the wilson committee if that is what the noble lord is referring to has not yet reported <e> <s> it is one of the matters which i shall have to take into account <e>", "<cs> my lords the trouble is that some of our records are at kew in the new building there and some are in chancery lane <e> <s> the ones in chancery lane include the legal records up to date and general records in the medieval and what is called the early modern period which ends at the beginning of the th century <e> <s> i will take careful note of my noble friends question but one does not want to move the older things about very much <e> <s> one is worried about their security in transit <e> <s> it would be awful if magna charta was caught in a motor smash or anything like that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the study when made will take account of that <e> <s> but i know that there are advantages in keeping the public records in one place and i do not think one ought to overlook the desirability of concentration <e> <s> but i shall certainly ask the keeper of the public records to consider the noble lords suggestion <e> <s> also of course i am advised by an advisory committee of which my noble friend on my right who asked the original question is a distinguished member and the master of the rolls among his other activities is its chairman <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged for all the helpful questions that i have been asked <e> <s> i shall take careful note of them all and shall pass them on to the study group <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that it has been in process of being planned for rather a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords the question is that the said bill be now read a second time <e> <s> as many as are of that opinion will say content <e> <s> to the contrary not-content <e> <s> i think the contents have it <e> <s> clear the bar <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is right in one sense <e> <s> that charge was a charge of murder <e> <s> the plea was a plea of manslaughter <e> <s> that is what the sentence was about <e>", "<cs> it is purely executive my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord has made a mistake <e> <s> the house of lords as distinct from other courts adopted a different criterion and it was that criterion which was attacked by phillimore and was the only live issue before strasbourg <e> <s> that was the so-called pre-judgment criterion and it is that which we get rid of in this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure how i can sum up this rather rambling debate without transgressing on your lordships patience beyond endurance because what we have really heard except for one speech is very largely a long catalogue of committee points <e> <s> all i can promise is that they will all be taken into account <e> <s> i shall have them very carefully analysed and will see what we can do about them <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> but i think that when the noble lord reads what he said in <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble lord lord gifford is in very good faith but i suspect that he is a little more naive than he knows <e> <s> so far as i am concerned and so far as i think the great majority of members of this house are concerned what we are concerned with is basically a law founded on phillimore <e> <s> those including myself who want to justify deviations from phillimore will have to justify them but if we are not going to found ourselves on phillimore we are not going to have a law at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to notify the house in accordance with the royal assent act that the queen has signified her royal assent to the following act <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to introduce a bill to consolidate the law relating to the english industrial estates corporation <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am happy to say that in this case whatever our views about the merits of the amendment as an amendment there is no difference of opinion about policy between the noble and learned lord and myself <e> <s> i took the view on second reading and i still do that we are talking here about the number of angels that exist upon the point of a needle and that it is quite impossible to consider a case in which a risk of substantial prejudice would not be itself a substantial risk <e> <s> i stick to that <e> <s> however because of what both the noble lord lord wigoder who i am glad to see in his place despite his apology and the noble and learned lord have said i took the trouble to consult the very able retired draftsman with whom we have been operating in this bill and he does stick to the original text of the bill <e> <s> he points out i think with justice that not only does this if i may echo the argument of the noble and learned lord lord gardiner on the previous amendment stick to the <e>", "<cs> since the noble lord lord wigoder described this as a probing amendment perhaps it might be convenient if i took part at the other end of the probe <e> <s> i do not think that this would improve the bill and primarily for the first of the two reasons or the related reasons given by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> phillimore which i am endeavouring to legislate here came down against the imminence test he came down against it very strongly very hard and very firmly <e> <s> the reason was that the expression imminence was too vague and uncertain <e> <s> i do think therefore that what the noble lord lord mishcon says which if he will forgive me i do not particularly want to comment upon for reasons which have nothing to do with the imminence of any proceedings is particularly irrelevant because the fact that we have just listened to those two speeches indicates that phillimore was right in describing the imminence test as too vague and too uncertain <e>", "<cs> i endeavoured to deal with this at length in my second reading speech <e> <s> of course it is active because the conditions are found but i cannot conceive of anything that an editor might wish to say about it or which he is at all likely to say which would either satisfy the test in clause or would not get the benefit of the defence in clause <e> <s> the fact that the man is almost certain well i must not speculate <e> <s> i think that the lucan case is a gigantic red herring here in the context of this particular bill and i explained why in my second reading speech <e>", "<cs> i seem to have received notice of this amendment somewhat late <e> <s> if i may i should like to consider the matter <e> <s> there may be something in it because it corresponds with substantial prejudice in clause <e> <s> i think that if the noble and learned lord would withdraw it at the present stage perhaps we can correspond about it or he could put it down again at the report stage <e> <s> i think that there is something to be said for it because there is an element of consistency involved and it might seem inconsistent if i were to resist it at any rate without further thought <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble lord lord foot <e> <s> at first sight i think that he is right <e>", "<cs> obviously as the noble and learned lord has spoken i shall consider this matter before the report stage <e> <s> but my first feeling about it is as follows <e> <s> the object of the bill is to make things clear for the potential editor and there is all the difference in the world therefore between the test of activation which is in schedule or the test of what constitutes contempt which is in clause and the case which arises where the court has in fact forbidden or ordered the postponement of reports because there the matter is plain subject to innocent publication because of the existence of the order <e> <s> therefore a quite different set of considerations arises in relation to a case where there is a direct order of the court from that which there arises where there is no direct order of the court and therefore the editor may be in some doubt <e> <s> the matter was i think referred to in paragraph or paragraph of the phillimore report and i think that this is the conclusion to which that committee came <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord gifford need not have apologised to the committee <e> <s> we are always glad to see practising members of the bar take part in our debates <e> <s> we all know that they have difficulties which are not shared by ministers <e> <s> therefore he need not think that his courtesy in apologising was necessary either to me or to those who know how difficult life can be for practising members of the bar who want to play a part in parliamentary life <e> <s> however the noble lord is at least consistent in that he wanted to omit the words good faith from the report clause as well as from this defence <e>", "<cs> i should have thought that would not be very difficult <e> <s> one could discuss almost anything in such a way as to cast obloquy on an actor on the scene and i think it would be easy to invent a set of circumstances in which one entered into a discussion of public affairs designed solely to take away the good character of almost any one of your lordships <e>", "<cs> i am deeply grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in this interesting discussion and particularly to my two noble and learned friends on the cross-benches for what they have said because what they have said reflects largely what has been in my mind from the outset of this debate about this particular aspect of the matter <e> <s> i am not so much concerned for reasons which i will give about what the strasbourg court is thought wrongly i think to have decided and i shall say why i think the conception about it is wrong as about the demerits of this amendment itself even though it happens to correspond with something in the phillimore report and i will come to that <e>", "<cs> i know they did and they also said that where necessary and this is the whole point of the case article took precedence over article <e> <s> they explained too what they meant by necessary <e> <s> heaven forbid that i should object to being interrupted in what the noble lord was courteous enough to refer to as my flow <e> <s> i want if i may to come back to the actual decision in the thalidomide <e>", "<cs> i do not belong to the trade union of ex-attorneys general <e> <s> my father did <e> <s> i do not pretend that i have found this absolutely easy to make up my mind about and i am not even sure that i shall not change it to some degree but not absolutely at the report stage <e> <s> so i am not yet dying in any ditches <e> <s> however i should like to make one or two general observations in support of my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson of ewell <e>", "<cs> i hope that i may intervene at this stage because i think that there is a real danger that this discussion is getting a little out of hand <e> <s> this amendment was put down at rather late notice <e> <s> i must say that i was a little surprised to see the name of my noble and learned friend lord scarman on it because as he knows i not only respect his judgment but seek his counsel on a number of matters upon which i require to be informed and assisted <e>", "<cs> i feel i should speak again because unwittingly i misled the committee by not reading the amendment of the noble and learned lord lord scarman with the body of the bill and not appreciating fully that he was limiting his use of the word publication to the special meaning which the bill would otherwise give to the word publication <e> <s> for the purposes of the law of defamation as he is aware the words publish and publication have a different meaning and i can only apologise to the committee for making a mistake on that <e>", "<cs> i should like at this point to take the view of the committee <e> <s> the chief whip came to me a short while ago and wondered whether after dealing with the last amendment this might be a convenient moment for the committee to adjourn for a short time <e> <s> i do not know what the front bench opposite thinks about that suggestion <e>", "<cs> half an hour anyway <e>", "<cs> therefore may i move that the committee do now adjourn until of the clock <e>", "<cs> i am not sure i can meet the noble and learned lord although that is always a most agreeable occasion if i am able to do so <e> <s> what i hope to do in the course of my slightly rambling remarks to is persuade the committee that this is a rather more difficult question than they have yet realised <e> <s> when i was much younger i read an absolutely charming book called <e>", "<cs> not at all <e> <s> everything the noble and learned lord is saying is simply underlining the position that i am in <e> <s> of course i have resources which are not available to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i would not pretend the contrary <e> <s> i have been in his position and he has been in mine and we have been facing each other from opposite sides of the committee <e>", "<cs> then i am iolanthe too <e> <s> but on the other hand the noble and learned lord must not push too far my humble analogies which were intended to entertain as well as to instruct <e> <s> in fact he has quite clearly said in his clause let us have a little list without saying what the list should be <e> <s> i have told him that i do not think one is possible <e> <s> i have also told him that the noble and learned lord lord scarman agrees with me that the disadvantages of having a little list outweigh the advantages <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord formally asks leave to withdraw the amendment i would say that i cannot quite accept what he has said and that if he should want to divide the committee in that spirit i would have to accept his challenge <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i understand that the statement has now been cleared <e> <s> as we cannot finish this debate before the statement and i am not trying to stop the noble baroness opposite if the committee <e>", "<cs> i think perhaps this is a convenient moment at which i should intervene in this debate <e> <s> if it has shown nothing else it has shown the necessity that i should explain to noble lords what the <e>", "<cs> in this case they had nothing to do with each other and so there was no question of a difference <e> <s> they were just quite different things <e> <s> this was a feature article about the activities of a certain group inside the home office but i think that perhaps the thing will disclose itself syllable by syllable as i proceed with my rather boring remarks <e> <s> i have really got to begin at the beginning again <e> <s> i was not quite sure what the noble lord lord hutchinson had to do with the case <e> <s> he said he played a part in it but in my report of the case which comes solely from <e>", "<cs> perhaps i ought to say a word in view of the eminence of the speakers although the word i say will almost inevitably be a reiteration of what my noble and learned friend said from his position beside me <e>", "<cs> and i am going to leak some more before i am finished <e> <s> i am not going to say that there are not things which might be looked at again but i really think we have it about right <e> <s> we have decided in the light of the <e>", "<cs> i followed that and as a matter of fact it happens much more often than one would think but in those circumstances the right course quite clearly is not to prosecute the juror which is what this amendment would do <e> <s> the right course is to tell the judge at once what has happened to discharge the jury and start again <e> <s> that is the only way in which it can be handled and it is not an infrequent happening <e> <s> to my knowledge it has happened in the course of my lifetime on dozens of occasions <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might intervene for a moment in this dialogue from behind me <e> <s> i think <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect to the noble lord lord gifford i think that he is making rather a meal of this <e> <s> i think he has overlooked two important facts <e> <s> the actual wording to which he objects is lifted verbatim from section of the county courts act <e> <s> i have done a little research and i find that the county courts act is now dated but the particular words to which he objects have been in the county courts acts so i am informed as a result of my secondary research since <e>", "<cs> i frankly do not think so <e> <s> magistrates are entitled to have their proceedings conducted in a dignified manner <e> <s> witnesses and counsel who appear as advocates in court should be entitled to be protected from the sort of thing which has happened to me in my own time <e> <s> a form of words which has served county court judges including those whom i have mentioned perhaps disrespectfully from my own youth over years will serve very well at the present <e> <s> i will of course think about the matter between now and report but i am not very much inclined to change these hallowed sanctified words which have served us so well for so many years <e> <s> after all i am a conservative <e>", "<cs> i certainly take on board what my noble friend said <e> <s> i am not sure i would accept his description of it as a flagrant example of non-textual amendment <e> <s> all that this subsection was designed to do was to ensure that for the reasons given by the noble lords lord gifford and lord hutchinson of lullington in discussing the last amendment there should be an appeal by way of rehearing to the crown court if someone suffered any of the penalties under the preceding provisions <e> <s> however i shall of course refer what my noble friend said to the draftsman <e> <s> he is one of the most experienced draftsmen in the business so my noble friend can he sure that the point will be taken and examined in very safe hands better than mine <e>", "<cs> this is a highly technical piece of drafting <e> <s> i do not want to be a bore about it and i will explain it in i hope intelligible language <e> <s> the first thing to remember is that under section of the tribunals of inquiry act contempt of court applies to tribunals of inquiry <e> <s> what is a tribunal of inquiry and what are proceedings in front of it <e> <s> a tribunal of inquiry is not a court and proceedings before it are not judicial proceedings between parties at all and therefore a totally different series of considerations applies to the application of contempt of court to tribunals of inquiry <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly take the advice of the draftsman on this matter but my noble friend must not complain if the advice of the draftsman which i shall probably follow blindly proves to be not identical with his own advice <e>", "<cs> that is perfectly true but sometimes ministers prefer to follow the professionals rather than the amateurs <e>", "<cs> i want to be as discreet as i can about this matter but i think that the speech of the noble and learned lord lord gardiner compels me to say what i am about to say <e> <s> he quoted a very large number of citations including <e>", "<cs> the government have been asked a question and i will answer it <e> <s> yes of course it had nothing to do with sutcliffe which had not then happened which led us to make the decision we did <e> <s> i quite agree that is obvious and that is true <e>", "<cs> i certainly will <e>", "<cs> i must say to that that the noble lord lord hutchinson has missed two absolutely vital points <e> <s> first he has asked a question in relation to the sutcliffe case which in the nature of things i should be quite wrong to attempt to answer <e> <s> prosecution is not for the lord chancellor <e> <s> i make no <e>", "<cs> i take the point which the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton has made and i will certainly ask that it should be looked at again <e> <s> however the noble lord is taking a more generous or a more liberal view than i am of the responsibility of the police who hold press conferences <e> <s> this law applies to publications <e> <s> if you allow yourself to be photographed and give a press conference and statements to the police for the purposes of publication i should have thought that it comes within the law as drafted <e> <s> however i will certainly consider that point and ask that the draftsman shall <e>", "<cs> first i must make a very boring pedantic point to the noble lord lord wigoder <e> <s> it is that if his purpose is to disapply the strict liability rule to appellate proceedings either in criminal or civil proceedings the omission of paragraph would not have that effect <e> <s> it would be totally ineffective <e> <s> the first schedule of which paragraph is a part is concerned solely with the period of time in which proceedings are active <e> <s> therefore no omission of any paragraph in it would do anything other than make doubtful the period during which proceedings were active <e> <s> it would not disapply any rules <e>", "<cs> in view of the invitation which the noble lord lord wigoder has just issued i shall not deal with these points in any detail <e> <s> i have said really all that there is to be said about the question of a serious risk of serious prejudice <e> <s> i still think that it is a drafting point of no substance <e> <s> but i shall as i said at the time re-investigate the point in the light of what i said and what he said on clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> like the last it is a strict consolidation measure dealing this time with the law relating to the english industrial estates corporation <e> <s> again if it is given a second reading it will be referred to the joint committee <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to promote the reform of the statute law

grateful to the noble and learned lord for the gracious way in which he has received this humble offering in the legislative field <e> <s> i do not think he should express surprise that it has fallen to me to repeal the unlawful oaths act <e> <s> it is always left to a conservative government to do really useful work which is left undone by its labour predecessor <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been indicated it is my intention to accept this amendment <e> <s> i do not know if the noble and learned lord or others who participated in the committee discussion remember that i rather took the view that this was a sort of mediaeval monks question as to how many angels stood on the point of a needle <e> <s> i am afraid i still think that but if it makes no difference and if persons of such eminence support it and want it why not give in <e> <s> and so i am doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that although the noble lord lord gifford was unable to be present last time a number of

matter last time <e>", "<cs> my lords no leave is necessary <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble lords interruption <e> <s> i never dismissed the right reverend prelate <e> <s> what the noble lord is doing is to intervene in the lord advocates speech <e> <s> he really must not do so <e> <s> he will have plenty of opportunity of making a speech of his own if he wants to do so <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i can persuade my noble friend that he might possibly be wrong <e> <s> first of all one has to ask oneself what this amendment will do and what it will not do <e> <s> i am sorry to appear to

prison for contempt of court for refusing to disclose the source of their information <e> <s> the answer is no <e> <s> mulholland and clough would have gone to prison just the same because it does not apply to tribunals of inquiry <e> <s> this is not an accident because as the noble and learned lord lord scarman explained on committee and i apologise to him for the fact that because his amendment was put down so late in committee stage i had not had time fully to consider its implications it was not my fault quite clearly it is not meant to save mr clough and mr mulholland from going to prison

virtue and not a vice <e> <s> now may i deal perhaps with a little less brevity with the three main supplementary questions asked by the noble lord <e> <s> he referred to my department as the main provider of grant aid to these centres <e> <s> that is approximately the opposite of the truth <e> <s> there are seven community law centres funded by my department the two centres referred to in the question are among those seven <e> <s> twenty-one centres are funded under the urban aid programme by the department of the environment as to per cent <e> <s> and by the local authorities concerned as to the remainder <e> <s> there are six centres funded by local authorities alone and three funded by charities and other sources <e> <s> so i am not the main provider of grant aid in these respects <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the last supplementary question of the noble and learned lord if he will put down a question i will give him the best answer that i can <e> <s> i am not in a position to give him an answer today because the question now before the house relates solely to the two law centres referred to <e> <s> with regard to the noble and learned lords earlier point the allocation of funds provided between the seven centres has to be undertaken by the local management committee as i indicated in my original answer <e> <s> the money that is available in the lord chancellors department has been increased this year by about per cent <e> <s> but i cannot within the budget fund two particular centres except at the expense of the others <e> <s> one must look at this problem

disproportionately large number of representations to a large number of members of parliament all of whom have made representations in the same terms and have been replied to in identical terms <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the last part of that supplementary question is no <e> <s> the local management committees are responsible and must tailor their coats to fit their cloth <e> <s> as i say i can only give particular aid out of a relatively restricted fund which has been increased this year by approximately per cent <e> <s> and i can only give that particular aid to particular centres at the expense of the others <e> <s> there is absolutely no reason why these centres should not seek local aid or voluntary aid <e>", "<cs> clearly i will my lords but i can only do it within certain limits <e> <s> if these centres fail to get the same local support from the local authorities or other sources as the great majority of law centres one cannot altogether blame the lord chancellors department for not giving them a special advance over the others <e> <s> the noble and learned lord is perfectly right in saying that i am sympathetic to these cases but i have to work under the same constraints as other departments and in this particular case other centres do get support from local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords that may raise a question as to how far the service should depend on salary levels as such <e> <s> as the noble lord will probably be aware the services of all these centres and in that i include i think all those that i have mentioned including the local authority centres the urban scheme centres and the privately-funded ones are in fact partly funded out of payments under the legal aid and legal advice schemes <e> <s> it is not solely a question of salary <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this amendment was originally moved in another place by the opposition and it was

principal amendment of this group the new clause was another amendment moved in another place by the opposition and not opposed there by the government <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to both noble lords for what they have said <e> <s> i am particularly grateful for the words which have fallen from the noble lord lord wigoder who explained the purpose and working of the parliamentary process in a way that i find wholly acceptable <e> <s> the only coda i would add to that statement is that my right honourable and learned friend did of course ask for my approval first before he made the concession and we were perfectly in agreement with one another <e> <s> i rather doubt whether the press quite realised the situation which they have brought upon themselves but still they asked for it

could be made but i think it would be better if i proceeded with my speech which is technical without pursuing my noble friend further along that course <e>", "<cs> my lords i was of course aware that my noble and learned friend was a most distinguished member of that committee but i thought it better not to tease him with that fact because i might have incurred the wrath of the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington who thinks that my most serious remarks if they are intended to be and perhaps succeed in being amusing are also frivolous which they are never intended to be <e> <s> but i

useful bill which would never have seen the light of day if they had not taken the labouring oar and respectively piloted it through each house <e> <s> i think the thanks of the public are due to both

be exactly the sin of which the noble viscount lord thurso was complaining <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord for the correction and i am very glad to have it because he does thereby dissociate himself from some of the other things which have been said in the debate because although there are in fact three categories of citizenship created by the bill these are not first second

renton <e> <s> i also acknowledge with thanks the various constructive suggestions and criticisms which have been made by the few noble lords who have felt able to participate <e> <s> i will take them

two of them now <e>", "<cs> i am sympathetic to these amendments if i may be allowed to say so <e> <s> they are not absolutely in order as they now stand <e> <s> a consequential amendment would be required in clause i am advised <e> <s> the reference to juvenile courts is unnecessary because section of the magistrates courts act makes these magistrates courts in any event <e> <s> i think the

<e> <s> maybe other phrases such as advice and representation are more suitable <e> <s> subject to those criticisms if the noble and learned lord would withdraw his amendment i will undertake to put down amendments at report designed at any rate and i hope successfully so to meet the principle underlying this series of amendments <e>", "<cs> i am glad to take that point on board and to take advice on it <e>", "<cs> again i welcome the principle behind the suggestion in this series of amendments <e> <s> i would regret an exact number of lay representatives above two because this would

text that if for any reason a justice of the peace or justices clerk could not be appointed to a committee the committee could not be appointed at all <e> <s> this would put more than one person in an invidious position <e> <s> subject to these two reservations i welcome the amendments in principle and again i seek leave if the noble lord will be good enough to withdraw the amendments to see how we can give effect to the thinking behind these matters before we reach another stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> as i said on second reading i am anxious not to use the mailed fist on courts if i can proceed by persuasion and consultation <e> <s> i recognise that there are two courts in london which at the moment do not permit duty solicitor schemes <e> <s> i understand that the thinking behind

resented <e>", "<cs> again i will happily take that on board <e> <s> i think perhaps i did not make myself fully plain on the question of reasonable facilities because it deals with only one part of what the amendments <e>", "<cs> again i will take it on board if i may <e> <s> i have already taken certain steps but i think i had better not specify what they are at the moment <e> <s> i hope the noble and learned lord will be satisfied with that <e>", "<cs> again this is an amendment with which perhaps i have a certain amount of sympathy <e> <s> i am told that it is defective in its present form because the phrase <e>", "<cs> there is a very real problem here <e> <s> to that extent i am wholly sympathetic to the amendment <e> <s> i am also rather doubtful whether this amendment finds the

between us at all <e> <s> i should like to do something about this because i recognise that there is a substantial measure of justice in what has been put forward <e>", "<cs> i will certainly take that thought on board <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord gifford for his suggestion and i will certainly take it on board <e> <s> i ought to have said in my principal speech that there are refusals a year <e> <s> one cannot guarantee that there would be appeals but if there were this would present the people for whom i am responsible in the administration of justice with a very serious quantitative problem <e>", "<cs> i think there is a more substantial difference of opinion here between myself and the <e>", "<cs> i think that i can be rather more forthcoming over this proposal than i was over the last <e> <s> the intention of the amendment is to ensure that the free limit for criminal legal aid is not set at an unreasonably low level <e> <s> as a matter of fact that intention is not wholly successfully achieved by the amendment because under it it would still be possible although it would be undesirable for the income <e>", "<cs> they are very reasonable questions but i am not sure that i can answer them all <e> <s> if i do not answer them all i shall either write to the noble lord or give him a more considered reply on report <e> <s> i think that the fraction in civil legal aid is a quarter of disposable income <e> <s> it is envisaged that regulations will apply the same fraction to criminal legal aid <e> <s> it is a quarter of the amount by which the disposable income exceeds a year <e> <s> that is arrived at as is known by making allowances for such matters as tax dependants and housing expenses <e> <s> without going into the figures because i am almost certain to mislead the committee if i try to do so now i think that i had better undertake to write to the noble lord <e> <s> any further information or even the information which i give him in the letter will be available to the house in one form or another by the report stage <e>", "<cs> well it is called on my brief <e>", "<cs> i suppose in cases out of a hundred the noble lord is right <e> <s> i may have to consider this again in which case i shall write to him <e> <s> i think there are occasions in criminal cases where it is thought that the defendant has brought additional costs upon the country and brought the charge on himself <e> <s> but i certainly would think as a general principle that what the noble lord says is right <e> <s> i will write to him again if i may <e> <s> the intention is to put the appellate court in the same position as the court of first instance <e>", "<cs> i think i can give a qualified welcome to this amendment too <e> <s> our intention is that revocation of legal aid for non-payment of contributions should be used only as a last resort and in flagrant cases <e> <s> it will usually be more convenient to leave the legal aid order standing and enforce the contributions after the case rather than revoke the legal aid and have to deal with the unrepresented defendant in a serious case which is a very obvious consideration <e>", "<cs> in view of the fact that i am going to make a number of rather discouraging remarks about the proposed amendment i should like to point out that on my brief there is marked the word consider <e> <s> if anyone does not know what i mean i am sure that the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones whom i am glad to see opposite me will explain <e> <s> therefore i am not being wholly hostile to the amendment though i am not very attracted either to the terminology of the amendment or necessarily to the principle behind it <e>", "<cs> i do not need leave to speak but i do not want to intrude on the committee unnecessarily <e> <s> i should like to comment on one or two of the other speeches which have been made since i intervened earlier <e> <s> i assure the noble lord lord kaldor that this is not a question of moral judgments <e>", "<cs> this has rather taken me by surprise and perhaps i had better express my surprise before there is any debate <e> <s> i was expecting this to extend to a wider range of topics under this head than in fact the noble lord has chosen quite within his proper rights to place together <e> <s> at first sight the question is simply one of semantics though it may be one of taste and sensitivity as well <e> <s> i do not think it really is that because there is going to be and perhaps we can deal with it as and when these amendments are moved a rather more profound debate underlying it as to which i fancy i take a less sympathetic view than i would take simply on the question of nomenclature <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> but what i was about to say has a certain relevance to the question of nomenclature which is all that is technically under discussion because in addition to removing the limit and therefore changing the conception from a conventional figure to one of solatium the noble lord is also going to add to the classes of those who are entitled to the solatium the unmarried child who is a minor <e> <s> i think that the dispute which we are now having may depend ultimately on the decision to which we come subsequently on some of his later amendments <e>", "<cs> again i am not intending the smallest degree of criticism of the way in which the noble lord lord mishcon has chosen to put his amendments to some extent in the order in which they come for which there is normally an overwhelming case but i find myself rather embarrassed in dealing with this amendment because i had hoped that in one way or another we should deal with this sequence of interdependent amendments more or less as a whole <e> <s> with great respect i think one has to make up ones mind what is the philosophy you are trying to introduce into the fatal accidents act when you are trying to introduce any change at all of this kind <e> <s> i entered into this at some length in my second reading speech but in dealing with what is really the question of the unmarried minor child i find myself driven to appeal to the question of philosophy before i deal with the particular case <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that i can change from what i have said because i think to a greater extent than the noble and learned lord has given me credit for that this undermines the philosophy of the bill which i am seeking to pilot through parliament <e> <s> on the other hand what i suggest would be the way forward is that we leave it at committee stage and come back to this sequence of amendments at report stage when we shall have had the opinion of the committee expressed on the whole sequence of amendments so that we can make up our minds on the whole package <e> <s> i believe that the package stands or falls as a whole and if you want to have this you must try a different package <e> <s> i cannot therefore give much prospect of yielding on this reluctant as i am to force the issue until the whole sequence has been discussed and gone through <e>", "<cs> i do not want to intrude on the committee unduly but i do not think it is from any lack of width of mind that i fail to impress the noble lord opposite nor do i think it is from any lack of sympathy <e> <s> i think it may be my own stupidity which has failed to get the point across <e> <s> i do not believe you can reconcile the amendment which the noble lord has put forward with the bill as it stands <e> <s> i believe that in the end it is not a separate point it is part of the same <e> <s> if you decide to insert the unmarried minor child i believe you have killed the conventional sum and you will then have to go either down the road proposed by the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson or down the road of scotland and have unlimited damages <e> <s> but i do not think it can be reconciled with the bill as it stands <e> <s> therefore it is not a separate point and if it is passed you must really make up your mind either that my own instincts are right and it is degrading to human grief to give it money whether million or which is the view put forward by my noble and learned friend or alternatively you must go along the road of unlimited damages <e> <s> i think if you insert this here you are making a nonsense <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord meant to say the opposite <e> <s> what i am saying is that the bill gives this conventional sum to a spouse and a parent but not to a child and i think unwittingly the noble lord put it the other way round <e>", "<cs> i seem to be getting up all the time but i hope that i may be forgiven <e> <s> i think that this really is the kernel of the question which we have really got to decide <e> <s> the law commission and the pearson commission have both decided that damages for bereavement should consist of an arbitrary sum not the same arbitrary sum <e> <s> the noble lord in invoking the law of scotland to my mind might just as well have involved the law of sweden although i know no more than he does about what it says as regards this because we all know that the law of scotland is in some respects vastly superior to our own and in some respects a miserable reflection of the worst features of english law <e> <s> but to my mind this is the heart of the matter <e> <s> let us suppose that a man loses his wife <e> <s> in my case thank god <e> <s> no one was to blame so i would not get anything under this bill and i did not want to get anything under this bill <e> <s> but how do you translate that into money which is not degrading to human nature <e>", "<cs> oh no not fierce <e>", "<cs> he might agree with me <e>", "<cs> this is an amendment which i am sorry that i cannot accept <e> <s> i fully acknowledge the valuable and constructive thought lying behind it <e> <s> as it is not a subject about which i could speak with any great authority i hope i may make rather full use of my notes at least on this occasion <e> <s> the two amendments this and the following one seek to introduce a new paragraph into clause which provides that any saving made by the injured person by reason of his maintenance by a hospital at public expense shall be taken into account in assessing damages empowering the lord chancellor to fix sums or formulae by which a saving may be calculated <e> <s> a further section would then be inserted providing that an injured person who has received benefits at public expense from medical treatment special appliances or certain social security benefits should be obliged to notify the body concerned if he commences proceedings <e>", "<cs> of course i mean no discourtesy to the noble lord <e> <s> it was really for the reason that i hoped he would allow me to make fairly copious use of my notes <e> <s> certainly i shall reply separately to his second amendment when i have heard his arguments on it but in the opinion of those advising me the two correspond rather with his first inclination than his actual progress <e> <s> if we have understood it wrongly it is better that i should deploy the argument as it has appealed to my advisers rather than that i should seek to separate them in my own mind having been previously advised that they are in effect inseparable <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord for his speech <e> <s> he need not at all have apologised for not giving me prior indication because during the course of his speech he very clearly stated that he was ventilating a point <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords who have had the benefit of listening to his speech will thank him for having ventilated it since it is an interesting and important point <e>", "<cs> it is my opinion and i have a good deal of sympathy with some of the thinking behind this rather for the reasons which have been put forward by my noble and learned friend on the cross-benches and my noble friend lord renton that this appears to fall firmly between two stools <e> <s> when i proposed as i did the pearson commission being set up i was very much aware that people got injured through no fault of their own but simply from the presence of motor vehicles on the roads and the same i thought could be applied to some injuries at work where there was no negligence or breach of statutory duty on the part of the employer <e> <s> i understood perfectly the case for saying in such circumstances that the duty of the motor vehicle owner might be turned into an absolute duty of buying an insurance from lloyds or someone else and compensating the victim <e> <s> i was aware equally of what i might call the massachusetts scheme and i need not enter into the reasons why i call it so that is to say the courts will continue to operate compensation or damages and that the liability for the use of the motor-car on the road should be absolute <e>", "<cs> i do not want to turn a deaf ear to my noble friends who have put forward this amendment which deals with a very real problem but i must tell them honestly that i could not allow this amendment in this bill <e> <s> for reasons which i explained very fully on second reading this is a bill designed to improve the administration of justice in a number of non-controversial and to my mind absolutely essential but relatively minor areas <e> <s> i got a place for it on the government programme on the basis that the opposition would agree which they very kindly did to second reading proceeding in another place <e> <s> i do not believe that i could deliver the bacon if i were to go very far along the lines of using this bill as a vehicle for this particular type of amendment <e>", "<cs> i fully agree about that but i thought it might be for the convenience of my noble friends and of the committee since i am told that we are likely to resume the house before the next two amendments are called <e> <s> if that should be the case i think i am rendering a service to my noble friend i am trying to tell him what the attitude is likely to be though i agree with him that in strict logic i should confine myself to the question of trespassers <e> <s> but i think that what i have said so far is applicable to the trespassers because i have correctly described the scope of the present amendment <e> <s> the bodies i have mentioned have been pressing for some time for changes in the law to clarify the liability owed by landowners towards trespassers and to reduce the liability owed by such landowners to visitors who come on to the land for recreational purposes <e>", "<cs> i can say only what i believe to be true <e> <s> i am in favour of the consultations going forward with all possible speed <e> <s> i agree that the law is to serve the public and not the public to serve the law but not entirely that one must press forward with every change which will in fact be controversial <e> <s> i said on the second reading of this bill that i could not take on board a great number of amendments to put into this bill <e> <s> i got it into the governments programme after consultation with various interests in parliament in both houses and i must keep faith with them <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful indeed to the noble and learned lord who is always more kind to me than i deserve <e>", "<cs> my lords it is enough for me to know a very little and all too little about english mortgage practice and i am afraid i do not know the practices in north america <e> <s> their methods of conveyancing i think are far more complicated than ours but i may be doing them an injustice <e> <s> the fact is that if this is preferable in england it would be done in england if the parties wanted it but i do not think we could force it on them by legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak subject to correction but i understand that there is at the moment a scheme being put forward by the abbey national with which i believe i have some personal connection and i should declare this and the law society but that is a matter for them on the whole rather than for the government <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord whether he is moving a motion <e>", "<cs> the question is that the motion standing in the name of the noble lord lord carrington be agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords there was a motion before the house <e> <s> i did not exactly gather what it was but may i take it that it was that this house takes note of the situation in the falkland islands <e> <s> does my noble friend wish to move that or withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords the question is that the motion be agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that is my function and the answer is that i already have a document which i have not issued but of course if in the ordinary way it is thought proper then i imagine that there would have to be consultation between the authorities for everybody <e> <s> i have a document ready in case anything should happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> this has been considered and i think i am right in a saying that we thought there was not a case for the payment of compound interest <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord stanley of alderley likened himself to daniel in the lions den <e> <s> i am afraid that i am cast for the role of darius <e> <s> if my noble friend will recollect daniel emerged unscathed from the lions den <e> <s> he emerged unscathed because the king on the following morning said daniel come <e>", "<cs> i do not want to enter into a long argument about the desirability or otherwise of charging interest on simple contract debts <e> <s> but broadly speaking the departments of government sponsor these various bodies and put forward the arguments which those bodies themselves have already embraced <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that the result of pressing this would be exactly what i have said neither more nor less <e>", "<cs> i can only say i may be a friendly lion but my family coat of arms is three boars and i fancy that this may be the third time that i may be speaking in this debate <e> <s> i am sorry to say that i have absolutely no room for manoeuvre at all <e> <s> if it is any comfort to the noble lord lord mishcon this is not the first time i have held this debate <e> <s> the other debates have all been in private <e> <s> i of course am simply the guardian as it might be of the law commissions reports and i should like to legislate them <e> <s> this is my general policy and i do not conceal my desire to do so <e> <s> but the departments whose business it is to represent businesses take a very different view from the law commission about the popularity or feasibility of this move <e>", "<cs> i thought i had said exactly that that i would report the views which have been so eloquently expressed both by my noble friend and from other quarters in the committee <e> <s> i am less impressed than he is by the fact that other people who take the opposite point of view have not been so forceful or so eloquent because they have got exactly what they want and they know that the government have come to the conclusion that this bill cannot contain this particular provision <e>", "<cs> i can undertake to consider the point <e> <s> the text as it stands is probably ambiguous in the sense implied by the noble lord lord mishcon and his reference to <e>", "<cs> the best and shortest thing i can say to the noble lord is that i accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have received memoranda <e> <s> they are under consideration and i will write to the noble lord about the results of the lucubrations of those who know more about these things than i do <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly take back that point and write to the noble lord <e> <s> i thought that it was now rather the popular thing to think that it was advisable but i shall certainly consider it <e>", "<cs> may i say something <e> <s> i have such fun being on this front bench and not over there <e> <s> i did think that the noble baroness lady jeger was making a speech and when the noble lord intervened i was wondering who was making a speech about what to whom <e> <s> i wonder if perhaps the committee would let the noble baroness get on with it <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether it is time for me to say something or not but i hope that i may be forgiven if i do so <e> <s> i venture to think with great respect that this is a little more difficult than some people have thought <e> <s> everybody who has spoken has said i am not a lawyer i am only a journalist or i am not a journalist i am only a lawyer <e> <s> they all have various coloured axes to grind <e> <s> i am always frightened of disagreeing with the noble lord lord gifford <e> <s> i always feel that if i disagree with anything that he says somebody like jupiter above the ceiling will drop a thunderbolt on my head because the noble lord is always so passionately attached to his causes <e>", "<cs> yes i shall in a moment <e> <s> the point i am trying to make is that you do not realise that this is a little more complex than you think and that it has nothing necessarily to do with the <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the danger is non-existent <e> <s> i have perhaps a wider experience of litigation than the noble lord and i have known it exist <e> <s> since i have been lord chancellor i have had to address a seminar of judges on this kind of problem <e> <s> therefore i do not agree about that at all <e>", "<cs> i had better read out my brief <e> <s> i hope it will make the noble lord laugh because it makes me laugh <e> <s> this is a drafting amendment suggested by the law society which claims that <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend <e> <s> i am sure parliamentary counsel will take to heart his wise and prudent remarks but as he rather anticipated i cannot go into any detail at this moment <e>", "<cs> i could not recite them at this <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to notify the house in accordance with the royal assent act that the queen has signified her royal assent to the following acts <e>", "<cs> my lords my father used to say that many are called to the bar but few are chosen <e> <s> i will certainly bear in mind what has just been said by the noble lord lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that is a consideration <e> <s> i do not think it is envisaged that they should all have court experience but i see no reason why that should not be included <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in fact obliged to the noble lord for reminding me of this point <e> <s> in speaking to the first series of amendments i ought to have said that yes magistrates courts do include juvenile courts <e> <s> i do not know about being unlearned one has to have these cross-references and i can only look this point up but i am advised that juvenile courts are included <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly will give further consideration to this <e> <s> i do not think it will do quite as the noble and learned lord has moved it <e> <s> this has proved a little more troublesome than i hope it was going to be <e> <s> i have of course been in touch with the two courts in question and they feel very strongly that they can always call on a solicitor already in attendance at the court to advise and if necessary represent a defendant who would otherwise go unrepresented <e> <s> they say that that provides a better service to defendants because the solicitors concerned are highly competent and at a lower cost because the solicitors concerned are not paid for the work <e> <s> there is a powerful argument the other way <e> <s> it may well not be thought satisfactory that an unrepresented defendants access to legal advice should depend upon the court recognising that the individual defendant needs legal advice <e> <s> i think that that is a valid point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord gifford for raising this problem again <e> <s> strictly speaking i do not need the powers which are provided by the amendment because i have already got them under section of the legal aid act <e> <s> i should like to repeat what i said in committee that really i do not want to penalise financially lawyers acting under the so-called through legal aid orders by comparison with lawyers acting under separate legal aid orders <e> <s> however it is desirable that at the end of the crown court proceedings the taxing officer should be able to look at all the work done including pre-commital work <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no good news yet at any rate so that is the bad news first <e> <s> i continue to be concerned about this matter <e> <s> i do see that there is a point here <e> <s> there are certain difficulties that i want to stress <e> <s> a very great deal of the work which goes before these petty sessional courts is extremely trivial in nature <e> <s> i do not want either to divert resources from providing service to those who are in fact entitled to legal aid or to give persons with relatively trivial cases an opportunity to delay matters with the result of blocking the business in the courts <e> <s> but i recognise that there is a point and i am certainly concerned as i said i think in committee with the apparently rather startling divergencies in the crude rates of grant and refusal before petty sessional courts <e> <s> there may as i said then be reasons for it which are more respectable than appear at first sight <e> <s> i think that that probably can be dealt with by more precise guidelines to the court than by this particular method <e>", "<cs> my lords i always forget what the rules are but i think i can only reply by leave of the house <e> <s> at any rate i do not think that i can go as far as the noble lord has asked me to go <e> <s> i cannot go further than saying that i would like to do something about it <e> <s> i am not quite sure whether it will turn out to be possible but we can revert to this matter at third reading in this house and i would suggest that that is the best thing that we can do <e> <s> i do not want either to be intransigent but i am slightly baffled because i am finding this a rather intractable problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord need have apologised <e> <s> he quite rightly appreciated that there is a wider difference between us on this amendment than on some of the others we have been discussing <e> <s> he is quite right to put his case at length to the house <e> <s> but i am bound to tell him as he rightly said at a fairly late stage of his remarks that the present arrangements which would effectively be reintroduced with modification into the new system have been criticised as being ineffective not only by my own department but by both branches of the legal profession <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lords pleas to those branches will not go unheeded but the collective wisdom of both branches of the legal profession when they agree is something not lightly to be disregarded <e>", "<cs> my lords i see my noble friend lord belstead suddenly arriving and i am wondering whether he has come here to answer the private notice question in which case with the leave of the house we will allow him to do so and proceed with the legal aid bill afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords we will do what has been agreed <e>", "<cs> i shall reflect on what the noble lord has said my lords <e> <s> if one has to pay at the end of a case in which one has been unsuccessful i have always thought i am told i am rather unorthodox in this respect that there is a good deal of flexibility if a monetary penalty is to be imposed in any event <e> <s> my primary purpose is not to punish defendants but to protect the legal aid fund so as to give a better service <e> <s> therefore i am not wholly unfair in these matters <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that i shall take on board what he said and without commitment reflect on it <e>", "<cs> it may be my fault but it is sometimes not easy to see what is going on <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord even for his description of my eye as being of a slightly heady character which i am not sure is accurate <e> <s> at any rate the noble and learned lord might well have begged to move because he was very largely the moving spirit behind the present amendment and i am very grateful to him for the help he has given <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to all who have taken part in this pleasant and rather desirably concise debate <e> <s> the noble and learned lord who proposed the amendment said he hoped for good news <e> <s> the best i can offer is that i hope there will not be bad news not very bad news at any rate <e> <s> as i think i pointed out in earlier discussions we have had on the same subject i do not find this a very easy subject nor am i implacably opposed to some of the thinking behind the amendment but i am unattracted to this particular amendment in the particular form in which it is put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only utter by permission which i hope i receive <e> <s> i do not know that i can go very much further tonight <e> <s> i take on board the kind of point which the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones has just made because it would cover or might cover the point which i made in my remarks a few moments ago <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord knows i am under various constraints and have to acquire certain consents and concurrences before i can make more than a qualified promise <e> <s> what i can promise is that this matter will be considered along with others <e> <s> the noble and learned lord will not of course be oblivious of the fact that i have in the legal aid field various other causes to promote and they may have a higher priority for me than this and indeed in the interests of justice <e> <s> i shall not go into any greater detail than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> perhaps i ought to say thank you to all those who have played a part in these discussions because i am very grateful to them <e> <s> if it were a little earlier i would have thanked them at greater length <e> <s> i think that we have improved the bill together and i hope that all noble lords who in all parts of the house have played a part will feel that they have had their due meed of attention from the government at any rate on this bill <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged to the noble and learned lord for what he has said <e> <s> i shall do my best to continue to give satisfaction as jeeves might have said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord and my noble friend for what they said <e> <s> perhaps it was not so much an indiscretion as an intention on my part that we should discuss amendment no <e> <s> at any rate to some extent along with no <e> <s> <e> <s> in some ways both my noble friend lord renton and the noble and learned lord have illustrated by their diverse and rather divergent comments what i was trying to achieve by amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> all lord campbells act cases depend so far as regards quantum at least on the fact of dependency that is you find out how much the dependent if he is coming within the class entitled to compensation was in fact dependent financially on the deceased at the time of his death <e> <s> the noble and learned lord and my noble friend as well as the noble lord lord mishcon are very familiar with such cases we must have done in the course of our miserable lives some hundreds of them <e> <s> having ascertained the degree of dependency as at the moment of death one then achieves as it were a multiplicand <e> <s> one then applies a multiplicator by way of the number of years that the dependency would be likely to endure as a matter of fact not as a matter of law <e> <s> it is a matter of how long and to what degree the dependency would be likely to endure <e>", "<cs> my lords i should very much have liked to do more for the noble lord lord mishcon than i am going to do but the more that i think about this matter the more i feel that my instincts about it were originally right <e> <s> i have to go back to first principles <e> <s> lord campbells act and the law remains as it was under that act quite definitely confined a right of action for damages by a deceaseds relative to cases of actual financial loss <e> <s> that was done for a very good reason namely that it is i suppose degrading to human nature in some senses to try to turn the grief that one feels at bereavement into money <e> <s> the noble lord lord foot was kind enough to agree with a number of rhetorical questions that i put at an earlier stage the kind of questions which one would have to go into if this matter were to be taken into account at all <e> <s> the scots have gone down that road but i and the government have deliberately not done so <e> <s> the extreme view which i privately hold was expressed in the earlier debates by my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson who took very strongly the view which i have put and said nothing at all for grief <e> <s> i thought that and i have made that plain throughout <e>", "<cs> my lords i noted that to my alarm and despondency <e> <s> all my briefs say that it is to be taken with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am rather shocked but i do see the point raised by the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i may now be in a position having stalled and visibly so to solve the conundrum which puzzled my noble and learned friend and for the moment floored me <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is paving for amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the entire house is very grateful to the noble lord lord foot for raising again this important matter and especially for his having taken so much trouble to spell out what he wished to enact in the terms of a concrete amendment which could generate a discussion however brief <e> <s> i think i can comfort him in one respect <e> <s> he was not correct in saying that i had not written a letter to him <e> <s> i did write him a letter on the th april and i have just put a copy of it into the hands of his noble friend lord wigoder so he will have the opportunity of reading it <e> <s> evidently the original miscarried and what he is now going to read is a carbon but it was a reasonably encouraging reply and i do not think he need be ashamed of having taken this trouble because it enables one to say several things <e>", "<cs> my lords the original question was that there be an instruction to the committee to whom the bill is committed in the terms set out on the order paper <e> <s> since then an amendment to the instruction has been moved in the terms also set out on the order paper <e> <s> therefore the question that i now have to put is that the amendment to the instruction be agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg my noble friends pardon for having been distracted momentarily <e> <s> if he noticed the source of the distraction he will realise that i had no alternative but to be distracted <e> <s> as i said to my noble friend and on committee i promised to make such consultation as i could and i wrote to him at any rate as at that stage on th april <e> <s> but i think that my noble friend is perhaps underestimating the difficulties which are raised by this amendment <e> <s> to begin with if one looks at it it is an attempt to disapply the unfair contract terms act to anybody who approaches land or enters on land for recreational purposes <e> <s> in parenthesis i notice that the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones has just joined the liberal party <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all three noble lords who have played their part in this debate <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord wigoder for the way in which he introduced the amendment because i appreciate very much indeed consideration for the personal difficulties in which i stand in the conduct of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords again i think that the noble lord lord wigoder has performed a public service by ventilating this particular recommendation <e> <s> i am grateful to him although i tend to take the view of the two noble and learned lords who have contributed to the debate on this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord wigoder could have said that not only did <e>", "<cs> my lords there being no great enthusiasm to speak on either side may i say to the noble lord lord wigoder again thanking him for what he has done in raising this subject that here i am a little less favourable to what he has said on its merits <e> <s> i do not see that as regards striking out or dismissal for want of prosecution a defamation case is entitled to any preferential treatment over any other kind of proceeding <e> <s> that tends to be my opinion <e> <s> there was a time certainly when my father was practising at the bar when the practice at the bar was practically never to apply to strike out or to dismiss for want of prosecution <e> <s> i think that has had a salutary effect on gave me when i went to the bar he said you will only succeed in resurrecting the action <e>", "<cs> my lords we have only a few moments but i must beg the house to believe me when i say that this is a highly controversial amendment and on that ground alone i cannot accept it at all <e> <s> i know that there are those in the law society who favour it and so there are in the british chambers of commerce the national farmers union the association of district councillors the union of independent companies the agricultural suppliers trade association the institute of credit management the consumer credit association and the finance houses association but ranged on the other side are the consumers as we have heard from my noble friend lady trumpington the confederation of british industry the consultative committee of accountancy bodies the national chamber of trade the federation of civil engineering contractors the greater london council the local authorities management services committee the association of independent businesses the national water council the law society of scotland the institute of chartered accountants of scotland and i have no doubt the labour party as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure my noble friend is correct in saying that every possible moral support ought to be given to our task force but i was asked a question of law and i answered it i hope in appropriate terms <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many parts of that supplementary question with which i find myself in sympathy but i think i must confine myself to answering questions of law <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am right in saying that is rather a fast ball if i may so describe it that whether or not a state of war exists is a question of public international law <e> <s> her majestys government on such matters are advised by the foreign office and so far as i know they have not received positive advice in that direction <e>", "<cs> my lords what parliament does is for parliament to say but i must tell the house that it is treason to kill the lord chancellor in the discharge of his duties <e>", "<cs> my lords without notice i am not sure that i could answer that question but i have some reason to believe that in recent cases such a course has not actually been insisted upon <e>", "<cs> my lords without my spectacles i am afraid i have not read the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords i recollect a supplementary question by the noble lord lord jenkins of putney last week in which he accused the government of murder <e> <s> i think he should be very glad of parliamentary immunity and the tolerance which is extended to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a private matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the interest of my noble friend lord renton in the statute law is well known and i think a subject of universal admiration because there is no doubt that there are very many things wrong with the statute book <e> <s> many of the arguments which he presented in support of this particular amendment were of a general character and it may be that i shall give him a little comfort about them <e> <s> but some of them which are of a general character do not really tie in with this particular amendment and i can give him less comfort in relation to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say and that only by leave of the house that i am very much obliged to my noble friend <e> <s> i will try to take the matter on hoard and see what can be done <e> <s> i cannot as he apprehended give him any kind of an answer but it is obviously a point of importance and i shall take it on board <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of any other participant perhaps i had better reply to the noble lord on the cross-benches <e> <s> as he candidly conceded this matter was carefully considered by the law commission when they made their proposals <e> <s> they in fact came down in favour of simple interest against compound interest <e> <s> i am bound to tell the noble lord on the cross-benches that that corresponds with my own judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords the pace of consolidation is being maintained <e> <s> this represents a considerable achievement by the law commission at a time when additional resources cannot be made available <e> <s> apart from specifically scottish consolidations consolidation acts were passed in and in <e> <s> in this session two bills have been passed and three more introduced <e> <s> at least three and possibly five more bills will be introduced later in the session <e> <s> the main constraints on consolidation are the availability of draftsmen the inhibiting effect of current legislation and the lack of resources in whitehall departments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i think it is fair to say that with the resources available one has to draw a balance between the process of law reform and the process of consolidation because they draw upon the same draftsmen <e> <s> the present position is that one full-time draftsman and four part-time draftsmen are wholly engaged on consolidation as well as two full-time draftsmen who give part of their time to this work <e> <s> in addition consolidation is done as time permits by parliamentary counsel in

a remarkable day <e> <s> i think that we have heard no fewer than six speeches from noble and learned lords on the cross-benches and if you count the two ex-lord chancellors eight from law lords <e> <s> in opening may i say something which i forgot to say in our earlier debate <e> <s> i saw the noble and learned lord lord gardiner sitting patiently in his place during the first debate <e> <s> he must i think have been very gratified at the repeated praise which was lavished upon his own achievement during his chancellorship of instituting the law commission for which at the time i thought he had rather negative praise though if i may say so and i was then in another place i tried to redress the balance a little <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it would be for the convenience of the house if my noble friend now repeated a statement <e>", "<cs> my lords that is rather a large number of supplementary questions i hope that i remember them all <e> <s> yes it is obvious that divorce and its consequences cause a great deal of unhappiness and anything which can mitigate the unhappiness is greatly to be encouraged <e> <s> yes i think one can can say that the bristol scheme has done a great deal of good work but the problem of course is to provide if one is to provide a scheme which is applicable throughout the country and the bristol scheme is essentially at the moment a local one <e> <s> i think i said in my original answer that it was hoped that a decision on the application for temporary funding would be announced very soon <e> <s> i do not think i can enlarge on that answer <e> <s> the inderdepartmental committee is in the strict sense interdepartmental but i understand that the secretariat and the officiais come from my department <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there is more in that than meets the eye <e> <s> obviously anybody who knows the situation about divorce knows that a very large number of children are affected by it and i think always traumatically <e> <s> this should lead people to think twice before they allow their marriages to break up <e> <s> anything which can prevent that is much to be encouraged <e> <s> the conciliation service is concerned with the process after the marriage has broken up in principle <e> <s> it is not to be confused with reconciliation <e> <s> again anything which can induce couples who are sometimes embittered to treat one another in a civilised way is to be encouraged <e> <s> i forget what the last part of the question was <e>", "<cs> my lords broadly speaking there are two types of conciliation in use at the moment the in-court service based on the court itself which is concerned with the divorce proceedings and the out-of-court service of which the bristol scheme is part and which is probably the best known or the best publicised <e> <s> one of the purposes of the interdepartmental committee is to assess the rival values of the two methods of conciliation <e>", "<cs> my lord i think i would agree with what the noble lord lord mishcon has <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think the situation as regards bristol is quite so serious as the noble baroness thinks but of course the time factor is very much in our minds <e> <s> it is not simply a question of money <e> <s> it may be that the committee will come to the conclusion that an in-court service is best <e> <s> i have not any idea of what the committee is likely to decide <e> <s> i had hoped that its report would be out by the end of january but as far as i know it has slipped by about two months <e>", "<cs> the question is that leave be not given <e>", "<cs> my lords is it your lordships pleasure that the motion be withdrawn <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether i ought to put the question now or whether the noble lord wants to make the statement now and have the division afterwards <e> <s> if i do not receive any indication i shall put the question now <e>", "<cs> my lords personally but i speak of course from this place as a member of the government i respect the sanctity of marriage as much as my noble friend but i think that he should ask himself one or two simple questions <e> <s> we live in a society in which there are moslems who have an establishment of four wives and they can divorce any one of them by <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for his contribution <e> <s> i try to stick to facts <e> <s> what he says about the legislation is entirely correct <e> <s> i think it is true indeed i know it is true that second marriages are not infrequently more happy than first marriages <e> <s> having said that i would also agree with him that you cannot go on tinkering with the law of marriage and divorce every years <e> <s> marriage whatever its values and whatever doctrine apples to it is not something with which one ought to tinker from time to time it ought to have a certain degree of durability <e> <s> it is bad for the law to be messing about with fundamental institutions <e> <s> i agree with all these propositions <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord will probably remember i have referred various questions to the law commission and made public speeches to the family division and to family lawyers on the <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that to be the case and i am much obliged to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for raising this subject and for the way in which he has done so <e> <s> i do not think that the amendment will do in itself <e> <s> to begin with i do not see how one can represent data subjects when data subjects are in fact every one of us whatever our peculiar qualifications may or may not be <e> <s> there is not a person in this committee there is not a person in another place and there is not a person in the whole country who is not potentially a data subject and therefore the question of representation except through parliament can hardly arise <e>", "<cs> on a point of order my noble friend must remember that the question before the house is that the clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> this is no moment for moving a manuscript amendment <e>", "<cs> i was not only equating it with the position of the lord chancellor i would equate it with that of any lady or gentleman in the public service <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might just add a word because i am really rather shocked by what the noble lord lord mishcon has said <e> <s> the purpose of this bill is largely to protect the data subject from misbehaviour by the data user <e> <s> the kind of code of conduct in what i might call the ten commandments although there are only eight of them is set out in the first schedule to the bill <e> <s> it must be obvious and i see two of my predecessors sitting opposite that there can be contraventions so severe and so serious that an enforcement notice is utterly inappropriate from the start <e> <s> my noble friend lord mottistone quite rightly referred to the fact that it is a general principle in penal provisions of any kind that one gives a man another chance before the ultimate penalties are exacted whatever the ultimate penalties may be whether he be the tenant of a landlord enforcing the covenant of a lease or a criminal who has committed an offence <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for having put the point in such a succinct manner <e> <s> as i understand the bill it would alter the whole philosophy on which this piece of legislation is founded <e> <s> as was brought out very clearly just before we adjourned the committee stage at about seven oclock the registrar is partly an inquisitorial figure and partly a policeman to ensure that data users do in fact register if they are qualified for registration under the bill and are bound to register under it and also to ensure by his own discretion that they keep to the eight commandments in schedule and that they do not damage the rights of the data subject <e> <s> those are the functions of the registrar <e>", "<cs> i always reflect deeply upon what the noble and learned lord says but i think that i shall have another go at him before i give an undertaking <e> <s> our theory is and this is why i am trying to persuade him that our approach to the bill is right and that this amendment is misconceived that the registrar is the friend of the data subject and potentially the policeman and inquisitor of the data user <e> <s> the structure of this bill as we conceive it is that the data subject has two parallel ways of recourse <e> <s> he has recourse to his friend the policeman and inquisitor who is designed as a weapon targeted on the data user and he has resort to the courts and for that purpose i invoke part iii of the bill and not judicial review and that is the ultimate resort that he has <e>", "<cs> i hope to persuade my noble friend that this proposed amendment is really a fifth wheel to a coach inspired by a false analogy <e> <s> i had observed and my noble friend has already drawn attention to the fact that the clause is based on the analogy of section i think of the consumer credit act from which its language is largely drawn <e> <s> but with respect it is a false analogy <e> <s> there is no general power in the director-general of fair trading to whom this procedure applies under the consumer credit act of acting on his own initiative to correct or erase inaccurate data <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has i think perhaps knowingly introduced what is a very interesting and what has until fairly recently been a fairly debateable constitutional issue namely the appropriate minister to make tribunal rules <e> <s> just in passing i must remind the noble lord lord wigoder that the registrar is independent both of the lord chancellor and of the home office <e> <s> he can i think be removed only by a resolution of both houses and he is much more like a high court judge the comptroller and auditor-general or one of those characters who are above ministerial influence <e> <s> therefore i do not think that the registrar can be considered in any way as a minion of the home office or indeed of the lord chancellor and i should be very sorry to think that that heresy could be promulgated at all <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble and learned lord i thought that i had answered his question in my original remarks <e> <s> i cannot imagine an area which is more sensitive to the home office than immigration and the immigration appeals tribunal <e> <s> i gave that as an example of where the home office drafts the rules <e> <s> of course the noble and learned lord is entitled to say that that is a bad show but he is not entitled to ask me whether i can give him an example because i can and have done so <e>", "<cs> i think i can offer some comfort here or at least i hope that i can <e> <s> i am grateful to those who have propounded this amendment both the noble lord lord wigoder and the noble viscount lord craigavon who spoke from the cross-benches <e> <s> in one respect the amendment is inappropriate but there is a respect in regard to which i should like to take it away and think about it <e> <s> if there is a need for amendment and i am not at all sure that there is not it is in connection with the testing of data material <e> <s> paragraph <e>", "<cs> i shall have to think about that point and inform my noble friend at some other time <e>", "<cs> the government are not a corporation <e> <s> i take it that the bill applies to government departments and presumbly they are the data users for the purposes of the bill <e>", "<cs> i think i can best answer the noble lord <e> <s> lord mishcon whose reasons for moving this amendment i can understand by referring back to clause of the bill which reads as follows <e>", "<cs> i can see very well that such a situation can arise and i will make inquiries as to what the answer is <e> <s> it seems clear that under the terms of the bill as drafted he is not as such entitled to that information but speaking off the cuff and without prior notice i can conceive that circumstances could arise in which the mere fact that he was given the information about himself might make it difficult not to disclose other information to which he was not otherwise entitled <e> <s> therefore if i may i will take that point up though i shall not have time to seek the answer this afternoon <e> <s> i am told by my ever ready noble friend lord elton that some clue to the answer to this question of the noble lord <e> <s> lord wigoder is that the point is dealt with in clause <e>", "<cs> i think that for once i have the answer offhand which is contained in clause of the bill <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> of course i will take note of what the noble lord has said <e> <s> my first and instantaneous reaction to the question now raised is that what is proposed to be left out in the suggested amendment is the word constituting and i think that word does effect the position which the noble lord lord mishcon desires to see effected that is to say a <e>", "<cs> i do not know that at the moment there is anything in the bill about welsh <e> <s> but as regards the amendment i had divined the fact that the noble viscount had drawn his amendment from the wording of the consumer credit act which uses the term plain english <e> <s> it is a conception which i heartily support but which i would be in some difficulty in defining <e> <s> that act requires credit reference agencies as the noble viscount tells us to provide a copy of the file <e> <s> the copy of the file is the actual thing which by the terms of the act is required to be provided <e> <s> in that context it clearly was necessary to require the copy of the file to be translated into english of an intelligible kind because of the way in which it might have been recorded <e>", "<cs> there may be something rather ironic about a member of the present administration resisting an amendment which would allow the higgling of the market place to determine the price of the service provided <e> <s> none the less that is the position in which i find myself <e> <s> the purposes of the bill are to protect the data subject and to enable us to ratify the convention <e> <s> the convention provides that access should be available without excessive expense to the data subject <e> <s> the words without excessive expense are written into the convention <e> <s> it follows from that that we must be able to control the maximum which may be charged and we cannot permit the data user to set his own fees and leave it to the courts to decide <e>", "<cs> i think my noble friend has misread the amendment <e> <s> there are two amendments the second one omits the words not exceeding the prescribed maximum <e>", "<cs> again i have to walk a tightrope between the legitimate requirements of the data user and the necessary protection of the data subject <e> <s> the first point i would make is that on the whole we hope that we shall not be compelling local authorities as my noble friend lord digby suggests or big organisations like bp or ici necessarily to concentrate all their various computer-contained data in one central organisation <e> <s> that would impose upon them the kind of expense which my noble friend lord mottistone was seeking to avoid in his last amendment <e>", "<cs> i now tilt my balancing pole on the opposite side and the tightrope i hope remains beneath my feet if somewhat precariously <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> the answer to that is once one has given access and a copy of the information in writing one has given access and therefore discharged ones duty <e> <s> so i do not consider that that last point is a residual point of substance although i will try to see whether between now and report stage there is more to this than at first meets the eye <e> <s> i will of course consider seriously that which has been put to me by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones about the functions of the registrar <e> <s> however the general philosophy of the bill which i tried to outline at our last meeting is that the registrar is the users friend and is the policeman there to enforce the obligations but the court is the authority under part iii which is the part we are now discussing which gives the remedy to the data subject <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e>", "<cs> i think that like st john at the end of st johns gospel what happens to peter is nobody elses business except peters <e>", "<cs> i think it does if the noble baroness will study her holy scripture which i know entrances her at every moment because the fact is that the data subject is only entitled to his own data <e>", "<cs> in this case i can give my noble friend lord mottistone at least modified rapture <e> <s> if he will withdraw his amendment i will consider this matter again <e> <s> i believe that a period of days is probably too short but that days is probably too long <e> <s> i think that we may be able to do business on those lines <e>", "<cs> i believe that my noble friend meant that the data subject should not be kept waiting any longer <e>", "<cs> i have two speeches to make in reply to this amendment one short and one long <e> <s> the short one is i accept this amendment and the long one is i accept this amendment with thanks to my noble friend for moving it <e> <s> i have now made both <e>", "<cs> as i am going to accept amendment no <e> <s> i hope that the noble and learned lord in his courtesy will not press this amendment because otherwise i shall not be able to accept no <e> <s> which goes with no <e> <s> <e> <s> this is touching on a problem which we discussed a moment or two ago <e> <s> the amendment applies to clause which gives the right of access <e> <s> we were rather puzzled to know at first what the purpose of it was <e> <s> in the interests of efficiency almost all data users plan very carefully the way in which their workload that is the data to be processed is matched to their human processing resources <e> <s> one of the effects of this is that particular activities tend to be scheduled in daily weekly or monthly processing cycles as my noble friend was telling us a moment ago <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is like a barrister with numerous clients of somewhat incongruous and incompatible kinds <e> <s> he reminds me rather of a cuckoo chick fed with a bundle of incompatible worms by two or three rival sets of meadow pippets <e> <s> the consumer credit act is not i would respectfully say to him a guide to the data protection bill of this year the analogies are not always good ones as we have already had reason to see this afternoon and as i think we adverted to last time <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the amendment is defective in the particular way which the noble lord lord wigoder suggests because in fact the registrar already has power to do what this amendment would require him to do <e> <s> if it had not been for amendment no <e> <s> which was a government amendment proposed by my noble friend lord elton there would have been some purpose in this amendment <e> <s> now that we have given the committee amendment no <e> <s> which was i think passed at our last committee sitting the only effect of this amendment would be to deprive the data subject of the right to go to the courts at all and compel him to go to the registrar who already has without the amendment the power to do what the amendment proposes <e> <s> it therefore restricts the rights of the data subject and does not add to them <e> <s> for those reasons i hope that the noble lord lord wigoder will accept our view that the amendment does not add to the powers of the registrar nor give the data subject facilities which he would not otherwise have <e>", "<cs> the question of whether and when you turn subjective feelings of unhappiness into money is one which has puzzled lawyers for centuries <e> <s> indeed those of us who had the privilege of practising at the common law bar for donkeys years know that we have often underlined or sought to minimise according to which side we were on the amount of distress and what its value in hard cash is likely to be <e> <s> i myself have always viewed the right to compensation in money for distress on rather conservative lines and i have also always associated it with conduct which is blameworthy <e> <s> i want to emphasise that in what i am going to say <e>", "<cs> it would not cause him much distress <e>", "<cs> i respond to all noble lords who have taken part in this short debate <e> <s> it is of course true that there is a kind of falsehood which can cause either damage or distress but which is not defamatory <e> <s> but at common law at any rate that is actionable only when it is malicious and i had that very much in mind when i made my initial response to the amendment <e>", "<cs> i must apologise to the noble lord lord perry on the back-benches because i answered neither the point which he made nor the point which the noble viscount made <e> <s> to deal with the medical point first the ultimate remedy for that must be deregistration and enforcement notice and not compensation unless it causes damage <e> <s> but i entirely agree with the sentiment that the noble lord expressed <e>", "<cs> i very much agree with the noble lord lord mishcon except on one important particular <e> <s> i agree that if the word had simply been inaccurate or incorrect in subsection it would be open to lord mishcon to say there are plenty of things which may be accurate but which may none the less be incomplete <e> <s> but the phrase used in the draft is inaccurate or misleading and our view is that any information which in a material particular is incomplete and is calculated to deceive which would certainly be the case in the example he gave is misleading because it leads to a false conclusion and that is what i understand misleading to mean <e>", "<cs> again we are dealing with the question of balance and i think we have it right <e> <s> the point is however worth discussing and i am grateful <e>", "<cs> i should like to consider that question at greater length because instant law is almost always bad law but i should have thought that there was a point to be made there <e> <s> however beyond any question of doubt the subsidiary company would be liable for any defamatory material that the computer contained <e>", "<cs> that i do not agree with <e> <s> there would be a publication if it was published to the holding company in any form <e> <s> but if the noble lord lord avebury wants a longer and possibly more considered reply perhaps he would forgive me for the moment <e> <s> however the last point i feel no doubt about <e>", "<cs> the point is that in clause we are dealing only with compensation against the data user <e> <s> we are not dealing with other questions such as damages for libel and there are of course remedies for that <e> <s> all that one can tell here is that as regards the claim for compensation referred to in clause the data user has a defence if he uses in good faith material from a third party which turns out to be inaccurate <e> <s> if the noble lord thinks that there should be some further qualification to subsection i should certainly be prepared to ask my advisers whether it is necessary to identify the source more particularly than is provided for in the subsection and either i shall let the noble lord know or he can return to the matter on report <e>", "<cs> i think that the fatal flaw in the amendment is that it would not include use by the dater users own staff <e> <s> whereas under the bill as drafted the inaccuracy leading to damage would render the user liable to pay compensation if the information was used by his own staff under the proposed amendment the liability would arise only when it was disclosed and that i assume means disclosed to a third party <e> <s> that would i think enable the staff of the data user to use the information as if it were substantiated fact and cause all the damage that the data user might thereby cause without being liable to pay the data subject compensation <e> <s> i think that this is a fatal flaw in the amendment <e>", "<cs> this is a very highly technical question but i will give the best answer i can on the draftsmanship of the bill <e> <s> the noble lord asked me a question about clause <e> <s> i think that we shall probably be holding quite a long discussion on clause when we come to it <e> <s> whatever clause does it provides only that the personal data therein prescribed in subsection are

disablement <e> <s> one such view was put very well by the noble baroness <e> <s> lady lane-fox when we had the vaccine damage debate <e> <s> the view put forward then was that we ought to use our resources to help all disabled people depending upon the nature of their disablement and the extent of their disablement <e> <s> the other view is that we should select particular groups of disabled people for instance people who are vaccine damaged or people injured on the roads as the noble lords supplementary question implied and concentrate on particular groups of the disabled not according

<e> <s> is not entirely financed by local authorities <e> <s> it comes out of the rate support grant which as the noble lord knows is very largely central government money from a different source <e>

absolute bar instead of a discretionary bar we must have a shorter period rather than a longer period <e> <s> let us get that absolutely plain <e>", "<cs> i shall comment although i was trying to

roman catholic view of marriage <e> <s> they have holy scripture very largely on their side <e> <s> i did not quote it because it was not relevant <e>", "<cs> i thought i had made it clear on second reading that i agreed with that standard <e> <s> i did also say on second reading and i hope the right reverend prelate will take this to heart too that the church has every right to legislate for its own communicants <e> <s> all churches claim that right and they have all got it <e> <s> what they have not got the right to do is to impose their views about marriage on the kind of marriages which the state has to celebrate <e> <s> we have to celebrate the second third fourth and fifth marriages we have to celebrate marriages between jews and atheists we have to celebrate marriages between quakers and presbyterians and methodists all of whom have different views of marriage from that of the right reverend prelate <e> <s> the suggestion behind the right reverend prelate was that i was trying to suppress something <e> <s> i promise the committee that i am not trying to suppress anything <e> <s> i say as i said on second reading that the church has every right to legislate for its own communicants but we can have only one law of marriage in england and wales even if it is not to be the same as scotland and it must cover all the types of marriage that we have to celebrate <e>", "<cs> at second reading the noble and learned lord pointed out that many children remain dependent on their parents beyond the age of for educational medical and other reasons <e> <s> of course in the majority of cases the children will cease to be dependent on their parents on leaving school at the age of or shortly thereafter <e> <s> these two first matters are dealt with in the principal act in section <e>", "<cs> of course i will do exactly that but i would go on to say that my own feeling is that in the ordinary case when a child has reached the age of rightly or wrongly at the time i thought wrongly but irreversibly parliament having made the age of majority i rather doubt whether the childs interests should any longer have the same priority as we would all tend to give it in its period of pupilage before the age of <e> <s> but obviously the existing act does deal with the situation which i think the noble and learned lord had in mind <e>", "<cs> i do not rightly know either whether there is any difference of principle between us or whether the noble lord lord mishcon realises quite the effect and the rather radical approach of his amendment which he seemed to speak of as

between me and the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i must tell him if only to amuse him that he was reading from a different document from the one that i was reading from <e> <s> our bill is founded on

still prefer paragraph where they come to a conclusion <e> <s> however i shall of course refer this matter back to those who advise me on such things <e> <s> i really do not think that there is any difference of principle between us <e> <s> i think we would probably decide the same cases in the same way whatever form of words we used <e>", "<cs> i suppose i have to say something <e> <s> one is never quite sure whether there is a difference of principle here <e> <s> the fallacy of what the noble lord lord foot has said is that he was always talking about the wifes earning capacity and not that of the husband <e> <s> as it stands the bill is even-handed to both <e> <s> i expect he has had in his extensive practice as i have had in my rather more modest one experiences where the husband has deliberately limited his earning capacity especially where he has not married again to avoid paying maintenance to the wife <e> <s> in the extreme case it is not uncommon for a husband to go on to public assistance rather than pay maintenance to his wife and instead of trying to work <e> <s> in periods of unemployment this is a comparatively easy thing to do <e> <s> sometimes he avoids promotion and sometimes he avoids an increase in earnings <e>", "<cs> i do not need to be reminded of that <e> <s> i am dealing with the terms of the bill and with the effects of the amendment <e> <s> i am only saying that my humble experience such as it is is that the thing requires to be fairly evenly handed between the two parties to a marriage the variable factors in each of which are almost infinitely variable <e>", "<cs> i hope i will take everything into account <e> <s> but i still think that a man who goes on supplementary benefit rather than help his wife and children ought to have that fact taken into account by the court <e>", "<cs> i think they would treat his application for variation in a downward direction in a somewhat less enthusiastic way <e>", "<cs> that is exactly what i think the noble lord lord foot was rather overlooking <e> <s> he quoted the law commission in the opposite sense <e> <s> people rather assume that it is the wifes earning capacity which is being hit at and that it is not an even-handed attempt to stop people not earning in order to get more money or to give less money to the persons with whom they are embittered i think with great respect that one is trying to be even-handed as between the two parties to an unhappy situation and not to take sides <e> <s> that is what i am trying to impress upon the noble lord lord donaldson <e>", "<cs> i am glad to know that it does not include the noble lord <e> <s> it rather defeats the purpose of his argument <e> <s> of course we take into account all possible fears and anxieties which may occur but we try when we legislate to achieve the result which in spite of those fears will prove to be equitable <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble baroness has ventilated this amendment

unsettled and upset people who <e>", "<cs> yes it is the first amendment <e> <s> each of these amendments is duplicated <e>", "<cs> i do not want to make a second speech but in the light of what the noble lord lord mishcon has said i think i must because i do not think he quite understood my point to begin with <e> <s> of course like the poor the media are always with us and of course they have distorted this bill <e> <s> they have done so in exactly the sense the noble lord expressed with rather greater indignation than i felt it right to express from the government front bench but which i share <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is entitled to do it himself but i think it would have been a greater courtesy if he had allowed the noble baroness lady lockwood to take an attitude before rising <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to repeat myself but there are two quite separate classes in this amendment one of which is acceptable in the sense that i should like to consider it again and the other which is objectionable in principle <e> <s> i shall not explain again exactly why because i thought i had explained it clearly enough <e> <s> if i did it can be read in <e>", "<cs> i do not want to hold matters up but if by any chance i did not make it plain my objection in principle applies to section a in its entirety <e> <s> i mentioned particularly subsection but the same objection i will not reiterate it applies throughout the orders under section a <e> <s> it is asking the court to apply a set of criteria which at the stage at which it considers the matter in the new section a would be inappropriate because they already would have been taken into account for the purposes of section <e>", "<cs> i wish that the noble viscount on the cross-benches had told me in advance of the point which was worrying him because whatever else the law does the question of pensions and particularly occupational pensions looms very large in the law of ancillary provision to divorce <e> <s> but it does not arise in this particular paragraph <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether i can quieten the committee and perhaps i ought not try to do it <e> <s> at any rate i can tell the noble lord that work is going on to produce a consultation paper on the question of the allocation of pension rights on divorce <e> <s> it should be ready for publication in the spring <e> <s> i underline what the noble lord has just said <e> <s> the last sentence of paragraph is that we do not think it necessary that the reforms which we propose in this bill should be delayed in the meantime <e>", "<cs> i can really only give the same sort of answer to the noble viscount on the cross-benches as i gave him on the last amendment <e> <s> he is perfectly right in saying that the need to rehouse himself is one of a divorced husbands financial needs and if he has remarried it is one of his responsibilities <e> <s> that is therefore mentioned in the new section <e>", "<cs> it is of course a matter of everyday practice in the courts that for whatever purpose the welfare of a child includes his educational needs <e> <s> the proposed new section gives the matter priority and in dealing with the child subsection <e>", "<cs> i have had to consider this matter in another connection in court and with great <e>", "<cs> i would not in the least claim to be infallible on these things and i shall of course reflect upon the point that the noble and learned lord has made <e> <s> i insist however that education is part of welfare and that the factors in subsection of the clause relate back to subsection <e> <s> education is a part a most important part of the welfare of a child <e> <s> of course you get the father who turns nasty as it is <e> <s> in that case under the bill as drafted the court has to decide whether it is reasonable for the child to continue where he is putting the welfare of the child first which means in this context putting his educational needs first <e>", "<cs> i cannot think why the noble lord lord donaldson should have thought that i said that nursery education could do harm to the child <e> <s> i was not saying that at all <e> <s> if he reads <e>", "<cs> i am a little puzzled by the speech to which we have just listened <e> <s> the first point alleged was that the first two subsections of the new section a were unnecessary because they corresponded with the existing law <e> <s> the second point was that we ought to tie the courts down more completely by omitting them <e> <s> i find a complete lack of cohesion between those two parts of the noble lords argument <e>", "<cs> i was not familiar with the case of <e>", "<cs> that is a little tactless <e>", "<cs> after such an invitation from two such powerful sources i feel perhaps that i ought to

thing is that if you were able to say in advance exactly what question you were going to research into you would probably only be able to do it if you already knew the answer <e> <s> the more one reflects on research the more it is clear that it is concerned with the business of acquiring new knowledge <e>", "<cs> yes i will <e> <s> the noble lord is quite entitled to say to me that the law commission referred to section of the children act <e> <s> i was not necessarily intending to accept that as my model <e> <s> i do not want that to be covered by any undertakings to look at this

shall once more try to rehearse the arguments which led the law commission after a prolonged period of consultation which proved virtually unanimous to include the clause in its report no <e> <s> and which led the government to accept the commissions advice <e>", "<cs> my lords i must make it absolutely plain that i do not agree with that <e> <s> in the first place the test is when one can commence proceedings <e> <s> in order to do that one has to get a hearing and then one has to clear up the ancillary proceedings <e> <s> secondly as i understand it the right reverend prelate and the noble lord lord robertson of oakridge have always stood for an absolute bar of two years <e> <s> therefore the first part of the right reverend prelates intervention is incorrect <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house perhaps i may shortly reply to those comments <e> <s> my remarks on the radio had nothing whatever to do with the subject about which we have been talking in this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can offer the noble lord lord hatch of lusby and his various supporters at least modified rapture but in one respect without agreeing with the noble and learned lord <e> <s> lord elwyn-jones i do not think that this is an important omission from the bill <e> <s> the law commission at page of the report which this bill embodies drew attention to this particular matter most specifically and this is what they said <e>", "<cs> of course my lords i said it was closely allied to the problem we are now considering <e> <s> if the noble lord will forgive me i said that i am issuing a consultation paper which is one of a series of papers which will deal with the specific question we now have under consideration <e> <s> my department is producing a paper on the options for reform on the allocation of pension rights on divorce as i indicated earlier <e> <s> a wider review of retirement pensions is that by the dhss and that has been announced by the secretary of state for social services <e>", "<cs> my lords what i said in reply to amendment no <e> <s> was intended to apply to both amendments <e> <s> i think that amendment no <e> <s> is the more important of the two <e> <s> as i said there are ways round the problem which amendment no <e> <s> was designed to deal with but there is no way round this one <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord scarman said the court has no power to order the trustees of a pension fund or whatever they are called to apportion the value of the pension between husband and wife when they divorce <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble and learned lord would like to speak to amendment no <e> <s> at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene at this stage without prejudice to some leave that i might have later <e> <s> i believe that this debate has got off completely on the wrong foot <e> <s> before i elaborate my reasons for saying that i ask only two questions <e> <s> why is conduct always assumed to be bad <e> <s> it is not always bad <e> <s> secondly what sort of conduct are we talking about <e> <s> are we talking about conduct which is relevant to the question of maintenance <e> <s> the answer is yes <e> <s> are we talking about who is responsible for the breakdown of the marriage <e> <s> the answer is no <e>", "<cs> my lords i do no want to interrupt this very interesting speech but if the noble lord reflects upon the passage he has read he will see that what is being said is what i was saying namely that of course there are cases where the relevance of conduct to the breakdown of marriage can be taken into account <e> <s> but the commission goes on to recommend effectively what is in the bill namely that the only test of whether one takes it into account or not whether it is in relation to the breakdown of the marriage or subsequent conduct or continuing conduct or apprehended conduct is its relevance to maintenance <e>", "<cs> my lords i said it again this time <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps he will allow me to say that every case that i cited was i think a decision of the court of appeal <e> <s> i think he gave the impression that i was saying that the court of appeal was wrong <e> <s> every case that i cited with approval was a post- <e>", "<cs> my lords i must be totally honest to the noble baroness at once i was in new zealand at the time and i have not read the article <e>", "<cs> in this deafening silence my lords i suppose i ought to say something <e> <s> i am a little puzzled by the speeches which have been made <e> <s> i just do not understand nor did my noble friend lady gardner of parkes understand why the noble baroness lady lockwood should think that this particular clause or these particular words which she proposes to omit are aimed at wives <e> <s> it is a scattergun which applies equally to either sex <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but the speech was entirely about wives and so it was understood by my noble friend on the back-bench opposite <e> <s> in fact i should have thought that as the normal payer of maintenance is more often a husband than a wife husbands had more to fear than wives statistically though wives are no doubt equally concerned with husbands to have justice done to them <e>", "<cs> the question is that the house do accordingly proceed to the next business <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one aspect of this matter to which attention has not been drawn and which i venture to think is fundamental to the discussion of this amendment <e> <s> paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords no it was necessary for me to remind the house of section because section is the general law which deals with tertiary education <e> <s> it would of course be totally inappropriate to introduce section which already exists and which deals with tertiary education and we went into this in considerable detail in committee into this particular subsection except in so far as it affects

house is indebted to the noble lord lord mcgregor of durris and also to my noble friend for their contributions to this debate <e> <s> however there is one statistic to which i must draw the attention of the house and it is one of vital importance to me <e> <s> this amendment was put down so late that having been processed by my department it arrived on my desk somewhere between and pm <e> <s> i have to change my clothes during that quarter of an hour and in the nature of the case i have had to sit here almost continuously dealing with other amendments since pm with only a brief interval <e> <s> i should have liked to deal with this important amendment in rather greater detail and in a more constructive way than i am perhaps able to do <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord mcgregor of durris and my noble friend lady faithfull will acquit me of any intentional discourtesy <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course always possible to put down amendments for third reading though it is not for me to indicate to the house whether or not it is desirable to do so <e> <s> but if an amendment is put down in good time i shall try to deal with it if that is the wish of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i too have been considerably inconvenienced by the late hour at which this amendment was brought forward <e> <s> i must begin by apologising to the noble baroness and to the noble and learned lord for not realising to the full the political friendship which existed between them <e> <s> the noble baroness lurks on the mappin terraces somewhere at a bearing of from the woolsack and i had not normally associated that with ardent support of the labour party but rather with support of the other occupants of that block of benches <e> <s> however that is a mistake for which i can only apologise <e> <s> it is our business to know as much as we possibly can about as many as possible of our noble colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say in advance that all the government amendments are either technical or drafting <e> <s> i am willing to go at very great length into all of them but i shall try not to unless i am pressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can respond in at any rate a friendly spirit to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> there is a sense in which i am a family courts man but it is not government policy at the moment and therefore i cannot do more than express a certain friendly interest <e> <s> when i was first faced with this bill i recognised that there were three stages each independent of the other but which could be followed <e> <s> the original plan which i had was the more ambitious one but intermediate between the full family court system and the <e>", "<cs> my lords i give the noble baroness that assurance <e> <s> i had hoped to get something done for report stage <e> <s> if she will withdraw this amendment i can give the noble baroness an assurance that a government amendment to give effect to her proposal will be put down at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot think how my noble friend can draw such a conclusion <e> <s> it means that the department wants to use the documents <e>", "<cs> my lords the question related to the statutory provisions under which these <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a question of opinion <e> <s> but if the noble and learned lord puts down a question no doubt the appropriate minister of the crown will answer it <e> <s> i am myself unwilling again to traverse the ground which was so well traversed by my noble friend lady young a week or two ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the appropriate department will note what the noble lord has said <e> <s> however on st december in a written answer i was able to tell my noble kinsman the noble lord lord hylton that documents had been returned to the departments under the provisions of the subsection in the year ending on i think th september last <e> <s> so a good deal of photostating would be required <e>", "<cs> my lords all the documents have to be returned <e> <s> the section provides for temporary return to the departments from which the documents had originally been obtained <e> <s> as i read the word temporary it does not mean the same as the word permanently <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always glad to have the approval of the noble lord lord jenkins of putney rare as it is but i think that my written answer referred not to documents returned to the originating department under section but to the delivery to the public record office from the originating department in the first place <e> <s> however i am <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always the servant of parliament and on that interesting subject the act is totally silent <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> it is a straightforward consolidation bill that seeks to consolidate the law relating to the general dental council and to the training registration and disciplining of dentists and dental auxiliaries in the united kingdom <e> <s> the law on this subject was last consolidated in the dentists act but since it has been extensively amended as a result of the dentists amendment act and the dentists act <e> <s> it has also been affected by a number of instruments made under the european communities act <e> <s> in order to produce a satisfactory consolidation it is necessary to make the recommendation that is set out in the law commission report on the bill laid before this house on th january <e> <s> if your lordships give this bill a second reading it will be referred in the usual way to the joint committee on consolidation bills <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> in the light of our previous exchange at question time i hope that this may be a little better than a temporary filling <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged to the noble baroness for her kind words <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i will be as brief as i can because i think we have discussed the bill exhaustively and i know the house is waiting for a statement <e> <s> however i must answer some of the points which have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for what he has said <e> <s> of course the praise goes to the law commission but i attach a great deal of importance to the work of consolidation which makes the duties of the legal profession and those who have need to know the text of the law so very much easier than it would otherwise be <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there will be an opportunity <e> <s> i have only the privilege amendment in front of me at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords with permission i will repeat the answer which has been given to a private notice question in another place on the behaviour of english soccer fans in france <e> <s> i believe that my honourable friend mr macfarlane gave the answer which was as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness and the noble lord for the way in which they have treated this statement <e> <s> there is no difference in the house either about our feelings on this subject or about the seriousness with which we treat outbreaks of violence of this kind <e> <s> i entirely agree with the noble baroness that there is what i might call a law and order dimension in this and i apologise for the english of that but it is at the moment a matter of international agreement between ministers for sport <e> <s> i am sure that my right honourable friend the home secretary will agree that in this country his responsibilities are closely involved as indeed are the responsibilities of his appropriate counterparts in france and other countries where these matches take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a great deal of sympathy with my noble friends suggestion <e> <s> i did not read the word fan with any great enthusiasm when i repeated the statement <e> <s> i noticed other expressions such as hooligans and mindless louts were also used <e> <s> i rather deprecate the use of jolly expressions about people who misbehave in this way <e> <s> they are offending against the criminal law of any country in which they perform <e> <s> some of the offences are undoubtedly punishable by imprisonment and would be covered by the extradition acts <e> <s> i take the same view as my noble friend <e> <s> he is quite right in expressing our feeling that to describe them as just friendly supporters of the side playing away is not quite enough <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only agree with the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i have no idea whether our miscreants are the worst <e> <s> whether they are the worst or not they bring grave discredit upon <e>", "<cs> my lords it did not happen yesterday at any rate <e> <s> however the miscreants bring great discredit on the sport and on our nation <e> <s> i cannot give the noble and learned lord any information with regard to arrests within our jurisdiction but i note what he says <e> <s> there was a certain amount of damage on the train and i think that the other damage was either on the french boat or in france <e>", "<cs> my lords i remember but i think the noble lord should have used the first person singular rather than the first person plural about what took place <e> <s> i was a perfectly innocent witness on that occasion <e> <s> so as far as i remember the worst that happened was that top hats were smashed and jumped up and down upon <e> <s> i do not think there were many casualties <e> <s> my own view about what did happen then which i think he was right in saying was the last or almost the last of such occasions which had hitherto become almost a tradition was that the force of public opinion made people realise that there was no justification for such behaviour and that it brought great discredit on those who participated and those who were associated with them <e> <s> the parents of those concerned and the school authorities conveyed that message quite sharply to those who could be identified <e>", "<cs> my lords that would depend of course upon parliament but i fancy that some members of parliament might think that this was rather drastic action to take <e> <s> i must say that it is a very serious matter but curiously enough it reminds me tremendously of what took place in ancient rome between the blues and the greens <e>", "<cs> curiously enough my lords the last words of the answer read as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather gathered from the original answer that my honourable friend the minister responsible for sport was contemplating urging european countries to impose stringent penalties upon british hooligans if they misbehaved abroad <e> <s> the courts in this country do not have jurisdiction to impose penalties of any kind on foreign offences except murder <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that the french authorities will take careful note of what my noble friend has suggested <e> <s> i do not think that we could compel them so to act if they did not want to <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know quite how to comment on that <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord could have complained about the tone of the press this morning which was universally condemnatory of what took place <e> <s> as regards the british government dealing with such disorders in this country it is of course our responsibility but it is not our responsibility to punish offenders abroad <e> <s> speaking generally and from the point of view of the general jurisprudence of europe of course the offences themselves are not classed as hooliganism or football hooliganism they are classed as assaults criminal damage offences against sections and of the offences against the person act and so on and the equivalent offences abroad <e> <s> the offenders must be punished for the offences which they commit which are that class of offence <e> <s> the penalty must suit the crime and the record of the offender <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i was asked to repeat the answer of the minister with responsibilities for sport in my capacity as lord chancellor <e> <s> i think it was probably because i had once been a minister for sport myself <e> <s> i should probably not be consulted about law and order problems <e> <s> my function as lord chancellor is to administer the courts and to deal with the judicial side of matters of this kind <e> <s> i studiously avoid saying anything about prosecutions <e> <s> whether the attorney-general or the solicitor-general should be called in i think would be a matter for my right honourable and learned friend the home secretary who is principally responsible in this country for law and order <e> <s> i suppose that in france although the distribution of offices is somewhat different it would be the minister of internal affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful indeed to the noble lord for his kind words <e> <s> of course the work of consolidation is something for which we ought constantly to offer our congratulations to the law commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> again this bill is purely consolidation consisting of the food and drugs acts to and certain other measures which contain between them most of the legislation relating to the preparation advertising and sale of food for human consumption <e> <s> if your lordships give this bill a second reading it will be referred in the usual way <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to notify the house in accordance with the royal assent act that the queen has signified her royal assent to the following acts <e>", "<cs> my lords when i was a very young fellow of all souls i knew a very much older fellow of all souls and he knew so he claimed a man who had known napoleon <e> <s> so i asked him the obvious question as he had intended and imitating the voice of a very old man he replied he said to me it was easy to see that napoleon was not a university man <e> <s> next saturday or thereabouts is st patricks day he was not a university man either and nor was my father who became lord chancellor <e>", "<cs> my lords will it be convenient if i repeat the statement now before there is a debate on the motion that the bill do now pass <e> <s> with permission i will repeat a statement made by my right honourable friend the home secretary in another place about the picketing that has taken place at collieries in various parts of the country in the last few days <e> <s> the substance of the statement begins as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their comments <e> <s> first of all may i answer the question which was asked by the noble lord <e> <s> lord mishcon about the identity of mr jones who unfortunately died <e> <s> the statement refers to him as a miner from yorkshire <e> <s> that is the only informa <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear that what has happened in connection with the archway inquiries and in particular the events which led to the resignation of the last inspector is quite intolerable and should not be permitted to happen again if it is at all possible to prevent it <e> <s> i divide my answer into two parts first what it is possible to do to prevent the next inspector suffering from the kind of harassment and persecution which led to the last inspectors resignation and secondly what it is possible to do to prevent disruption at the inquiry itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i agree that this is not a totally isolated incident <e> <s> my own belief is that some minor clarifications in the law might be desirable and i have discussed this with relevant colleagues <e> <s> i do not think that i have anything much further to say at the moment but my general conviction is that this is a question of administrative and preventive action rather than of a defect in law <e>", "<cs> my lords i share and i am sure the house will share my noble friends disappointment at having been unsuccessful in the ballot <e> <s> he has wide experience of these inquiries <e> <s> i shall certainly refresh my memory about the rules and pass on what he said to the relevant colleague who will be more immediately responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords as a matter of fact i have thought rather deeply about this <e> <s> under the tribunals of inquiry evidence act one can set up an inquiry which attracts some of the contempt provisions but that requires a resolution of each house of parliament and therefore would not normally be appropriate to inquiries of this kind but they could be in theory invoked <e> <s> it so happens that i was sitting judicially in the privy council some months ago when we had to consider the situation of an inquiry of a somewhat different kind in one of the dependencies which still has appeals to the privy <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not studied the history of these inquiries in any detail but from what i hear there is every reason to believe that what the noble lord lord wigoder says about the past inquiries is correct <e> <s> i myself rather question whether it is a matter of clarifying the law <e> <s> the inspector has certain rights and i shall try to take steps to see that he is adequately briefed as to his rights about it <e> <s> the police are naturally reluctant to interfere unless they are called upon but if they are in the neighbourhood the inspector has rights to summon assistance and if the inquiry is properly stewarded which can be and usually is arranged it is possible to summon them <e> <s> i believe that in fact in the recent inquiry which gave rise to this question the police were sent for and at the instance of the inspector persons were removed successfully by the police <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly draw that to the attention of my colleagues <e> <s> i can see difficulties about giving costs against a person who is not a lawfully-present objector to the scheme which is being inquired into <e> <s> an order for costs against a non-party to the proceedings would i think give rise to difficulty but i take note of what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord but i should have thought not <e> <s> obviously the next inspector will have to be somebody who is aware of the past history and the fact that he has to be told of these rights indicates that he has to exercise his existing rights <e> <s> you do not necessarily create greater order by passing a new law but you do create better order by enforcing rights and obligations which already exist <e>", "<cs> my lords i am duly reminded but i think that we are in danger of straying rather far from the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to have a go rather later than this when i shall deal with the question of consolidation from the technical point of view <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend would find it more convenient to himself if i did my best whether acceptably or not to speak about this matter then <e> <s> there is a complication which i wish to expound at rather greater length than will be possible by means of an intervention in my noble friends question <e>", "<cs> my lords

spirit <e> <s> there are objections to the amendment <e> <s> my noble and learned friend on the cross-benches made what was rightly described as a formidable speech about the bill in its present form

a valid one as far as it can be <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for the slip of the tongue <e> <s> but i have the picture of this poor boy doing hours community service in an old persons home or

snaresbrook <e> <s> this is cloud cuckoo land <e> <s> surely the noble lord lord wigoder was right in committee when he swept that argument aside and blew it sky high by saying at column <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to thank both the noble and learned lord and the noble lord for supporting me <e> <s> of course i consulted the law lords and i have appeared before both of my noble and learned friends and i can endorse what the noble lord lord wigoder has said <e>", "<cs> i do not care one way or the other <e>", "<cs> this is rather a curious bundle of amendments because the arguments for

noble twin <e>", "<cs> i will say it should be in the code and not in the bill but i have lost the place in my brief if it is there <e>", "<cs> are we on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> did the noble lord say he had withdrawn it <e>", "<cs> it is not moved then <e>", "<cs> the only effect of this would be to make the thing be done without delay instead of as soon as practicable which means that it

clarity of mind due to the lateness or earliness of the hour because i was reading what it says in my brief <e>", "<cs> i had intended to deal with this in conjunction with amendment no <e> <s> with which originally it was agreed to group it <e> <s> this was an amendment by my noble friend lord donaldson <e> <s> i was going to explain at much greater length why this was not an acceptable view <e>

profession could never easily acquiesce in the view which apparently is contained in amendment no <e> <s> a that the unfortunate suspect should be represented by a solicitor nominated by the custody officer within six hours of the relevant time <e> <s> that seems to me to put the legal representative in a totally impossible position and one which i could not accept <e>", "<cs> i think that the answer is no <e> <s> there are other european codes which are rather more draconian than ours <e>", "<cs> let me make it absolutely clear and i speak in the presence of my noble friend the leader of

amendment on report but apart from that he cannot speak more than once <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments look more formidable than they are <e> <s> in moving amendment no <e> <s> i will speak if i

improving the bill but in removing a great deal of <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be possible for me to intervene at this stage <e> <s> i hope to persuade noble lords opposite and indeed the noble and learned lord lord edmund-davies that this amendment is based on a confusion of thought <e> <s> it is an amendment to clause of the bill <e> <s> if one looks at clause one will see that it refers back only to those documents relating to conviction which are admitted by virtue of clause <e> <s> so one is limited to clause <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to do so because i hope that i am right <e> <s> we are dealing with matters of very considerable complexity and technicality <e> <s> the best advice that i could get from those advising me was that the only conceivable case where the seriousness of the third partys previous offence could come into question by reason of clause was where he was called as a witness and the issue arose as to his credibility and he was cross-examined to the effect were you not on th january convicted of stealing from a woolworths shop <e> <s> then he would be entitled to give evidence himself as to the seriousness or otherwise of the offence and he would be able of course if it became sufficiently important for both the defendant in the case under trial and for the witness either to call for or refer to the circumstances of the offence <e>",

not arise <e> <s> let us conceive of a trial exactly in the terms just postulated by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> what would happen in fact is that the prosecution would have the record of the conviction in the form of a certified copy and would put to the witness even now and under the existing law were you not convicted of such-and-such an offence on such-and-such a day <e> <s> as it goes to credibility if the witness said no then the prosecuting counsel would in fact be bound because it would be cross-examination as to credit only and if the witness said yes which is probably what he would do he would probably not wish to put a lot of detail before the prosecuting counsel went on with his cross-examination because in fact the issue even there would basically be the fact of conviction <e> <s> the last thing that the trial judge would wish or desire or allow would be a re-trail of the old case <e> <s> in my view this is so imaginary <e>", "<cs> as i indicated in my last remarks i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i am very concerned to hear that the noble lord lord hutchinson is in hospital <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord donaldson will

because it is possible that i may have misled the committee myself <e> <s> if i have i will write to the noble lord between now and report <e>", "<cs> i am at a little difficulty in handling this amendment because i find that on the order paper there is quite a sequence of amendments which although they are not identical in purpose because some them do not expressly deal with mental handicapped persons have a broad similarity in object and have various advantages and disadvantages which i think ought to be basically the subject of a single discussion <e> <s> it may very well be that at the end of them all we shall want to come back on report to the subject of these confessions rather than decide between a number of rival theories how this matter should be dealt with <e> <s>

sense of freedom any of the succeeding amendments <e> <s> obviously one after the other they would not have made any sense at all in a consequential series of sections <e>", "<cs> i can see that there is an important distinction between what one admits as evidence and whether a conviction results <e> <s> but it is the same territory and it deals with the same problem though in a different way <e> <s> i had thought that this afternoon at any rate we could possibly blur the difference to that extent <e>", "<cs> yes my noble friend is always right <e> <s> i agree that they are alternative ways of dealing with the same kind of problem but i do not think that if you wrote a bill with amendments nos <e> <s> and in it people would say it was a very good bill <e>", "<cs> that is really what i was saying <e> <s> it was for that reason that i suggested this method of progress <e> <s> i think frankly that amendment no <e> <s> is a little too artificial and formalistic <e> <s> equally amendment no

in amendment no <e> <s> must be discussed at length this afternoon before we come to a conclusion <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should say a few words although i have already intruded on the committee for perhaps too long on an earlier <e>", "<cs> the noble lord <e> <s> lord wigoder is making a perfectly sensible point if he will allow me to say so but i think that it is more than that <e> <s> among the law lords trying <e>", "<cs> i very carefully note what the noble lord lord mishcon has said <e> <s> i do not think this has much to do with the right of silence <e> <s> the right of silence in the accused consists of an accuseds right to say nothing when he is cautioned when he is charged or when he is tried <e> <s> he need say nothing at all <e> <s> he can say to the prosecution prove your case and if you cannot bad luck on you <e> <s> this has been a fundamental rule of english law for a very long time <e>", "<cs> i am not absolutely sure that that is quite true but i will not go into that <e> <s> that is a clear example of where we have changed the rule by statute <e> <s> i have known cases where if you produce a number of facts of which you could have given notice at an earlier stage it is the subject of very adverse comment from the bench and sometimes unjustified comment from the bench <e> <s> at any rate that has been the development since the war <e>", "<cs> in response to the noble lord lord hooson i agree absolutely that they have to be drafted with great care and scrutinised after they are published <e> <s> but subject to that i do not think that any injustice would be incurred by this <e>", "<cs> obviously one cannot complain that identification questions have been raised in connection with criminal evidence <e> <s> i would agree with the noble lord lord elystan-morgan that one of the identifiable areas in which miscarriages of justice have taken place has been cases of misidentification <e> <s> perhaps that is not surprising since any system of criminal law depends for its effectiveness however excellent in other respects on getting the right man and not the wrong one <e> <s> we know of a number of cases and it would be idle for me to pretend that we did not in which on really overwhelming evidence juries have convicted when it was proved later that the accused was innocent of the offence <e> <s> i say was proved later that he was innocent because having accepted that there must be some such <e>", "<cs> oh he was in a charabanc on the way to whitley bay <e> <s> as one kind of common law jury advocate once said in my fathers hearing it matters not my lords the principle is the same <e> <s> at any rate he was innocent and proved himself to be innocent <e> <s> this must obviously give rise to anxiety <e> <s> if i have it right the devlin report raised a number of other possible or actual cases <e> <s> i do not think that it matters because one knows that this is one of the areas of the law which must give rise to anxiety <e>", "<cs> again it falls to me to speak at this point of time <e> <s> if i may i comment first on the speeches which have been delivered <e> <s> i say respectfully to the noble lord lord elystan-morgan that this has nothing to do with <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord elystan-morgan <e> <s> the reason why i ventured to say this is that the existence of <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that amendment no <e> <s> excludes unfair and oppressive means <e> <s> to some extent as i indicated before my hands are tied because the only instructions i have are to resist all of these amendments <e> <s> however for the reasons i gave during our earlier discussions i do not feel that it is proper to pursue those instructions in too pedantic a way <e> <s> however what i can do is to include this amendment in my report to my right honourable and learned friend in relation to the others <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will recollect that there have been numerous amendments to the sale of goods law in recent years one as recently as <e> <s> the matter was referred to the english law commission <e> <s> they and the scottish law commission took the trouble to issue a joint consultative paper <e> <s> the document to which my noble friend refers was the response of the national consumer council to that paper <e> <s> i think it would be discourteous both to the law commissions and to the numerous other persons who would wish to make a response to the consultative paper if we were to give priority to any one respondent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure how far that is a supplementary question <e> <s> the noble baroness will not have forgotten the provisions of section of the sale of goods act which gives effect to the desire of consumers to see that what they buy corresponds both with description and with quality and fitness <e> <s> the question is how that can be improved if at all <e> <s> as regards my weight i should think it is adequate for almost every purpose <e> <s> however i am sure that my honourable friend who is as the noble baroness says responsible for these matters will take very careful note of what she has said <e>", "<cs> my lords what is or is not complex is a matter of opinion <e> <s> there were between and recommendations in the consultative paper which are germane to this question and over pages of the report to which my noble friends question relates <e> <s> but of course it was a sequel to that that i think the noble and learned lord on the opposition front bench probably had in mind when he made the reference to the law commission in january <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can anticipate the queens speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose of course that this is one of the very questions that the law commissions will wish to consider in their final report <e> <s> i think that there is some difficulty in defining what is a consumer <e> <s> supposing that you are the owner of a fleet of lorries and that you have paid tens of thousands of pounds for over a hundred lorries are you a consumer or is that a commercial transaction <e> <s> is the charterer of a large ship a consumer of services although not of goods when he charters the ship <e> <s> there must be some intelligible line of demarcation in order to describe what is a consumer contract and what is a contract for the sale of goods or provision of services of a commercial character <e> <s> i do not think that the issue is quite as easy as is assumed in the noble baronesss question <e>", "<cs> my lords am i right in thinking that the time has come to put the question <e> <s> the question is that amendment no <e> <s> be agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to notify the house in accordance with the royal assent act that the queen has signified her royal assent to the following acts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am just wondering whether the noble baroness wishes to reply to the debate on the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the next amendment is amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords the mover must move the amendment first <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have called amendment no <e> <s> and that it has been moved <e> <s> let me be sure where i stand <e> <s> i understand that amendment no <e> <s> was moved <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the noble lord lord mishcon

question of degree or by talking about the police telling lies with <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i am not going to make a false point to

grateful to my noble and learned friend who moved the amendment for the immense care that he has given to this subject <e> <s> i am sure that the house is greatly indebted to him both for the art with

had been changed <e> <s> god moves in a mysterious <e>", "<cs> my lords i am entirely in the hands of the house but i think a discussion on the mentally handicapped is what we want <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand absolutely by what i said on committee namely that the question of mental stability handicap or illness is a separate issue whether you deal with it generally in relation to interrogation or whether you deal with it specifically as does clause in relation to confessions which is what we are actually talking about on these two amendments <e> <s> i think amendment no <e>

"<cs> my lords i am not quite sure that i see the purpose of that partly for the reason that i have already given and partly because what we are obviously considering in the light of clause is a true confession made in those circumstances <e> <s> the police have acted perfectly properly a true confession has been made and the noble lord lord gifford says we are concerned to see it is not given in evidence <e> <s> i wonder why <e> <s> the general umbrella protection is there and i note the point that the noble lord lord elystan-morgan made again in this connection that if it is unreliable it has to be excluded <e> <s> but if it is reliable true and made perfectly properly in the circumstances which i have described i am not sure that i quite understand the noble lord lord giffords point or i do understand it but i am not sure that i quite agree with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i disagree profoundly <e> <s> the clause clearly says that if it is unreliable it is automatically excluded under the clause <e> <s> the question that we have to consider is the case of a conceivably mentally handicapped person who is interviewed perfectly properly by the police and makes a full and absolute confession <e> <s> i ask the house whether it is really in the interests of society of truth and of justice that with this safeguard in the bill and these provisions in the code of practice such a confession should not be given in evidence <e> <s> after all one has occasionally to think of those who are killed by these mentally handicapped people <e> <s> one has occasionally to think of their true interests which may not lie in being let out at large to commit another offence <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord lord gifford is taking a pedantic and wholly perverse view in both the interruptions he has made <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may start at the reverse end i should like to say that i am grateful to the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey for reminding me though he did not do so directly that i failed to redeem a promise to the noble lord lord elystan-morgan when he asked me the meaning of the word reliable <e> <s> of course what i say speaking from this particular position carries no more weight than that of any other member of the house but by reliability i understand basically truth but of course truth in relation to the circumstances in which the confession was obtained and truth in relation to the due performance of the code of practice <e> <s> i understand it basically as being a statement that in so far as it implicates the accused the confession is likely to be true <e>", "<cs> no my lords i think that i have probably already gone further than my instructions permitted <e> <s> i am sorry <e>", "<cs> my lords i do congratulate the noble lord on his succinctness and on the persuasive way in which he has moved the amendment <e> <s> i cannot offer the noble lord a great deal of hope as regards this amendment <e> <s> it is of course another amendment designed to identify as vulnerable a particular group on the grounds that they have made a request to consult a solicitor under clause and delay in compliance was authorised by subsection

intervened <e> <s> i naturally asked myself when was passed whether my amendment was consistent with it <e> <s> my provisional view is that it is consistent with it because if in fact they stood together in the bill on the specific matter with which deals would prevail and on the rest of evidence would prevail <e> <s> i was in fact provisionally of that view <e>", "<cs> my lords that was the view that i provisionally took <e> <s> this is a purely technical question about which one must be guided by advice from a certain source <e> <s> the provisional view that i took almost identically with my noble friend lord renton but which i now hear rather more authoritatively from my noble friend lord swinton was that although it is obvious that good draftsmanship will demand some further drafting one way or the other the two amendments are not in the technical sense inconsistent and the second amendment in numeration has not fallen by the carrying of the first <e> <s> that is the technical rule of order that we are considering <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say something it may avoid the necessity of troubling the noble and learned lord <e> <s> it is clear to my mind that on a

bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall almost certainly forget this point that the noble and learned lord has made if i do not answer it now briefly <e> <s> he is of course aware that excessively severe sentences are already the subject of applications for leave to appeal and get legal aid <e> <s> the court of appeal at the moment does not have the power to deal with too lenient sentences <e> <s> he will know as i know that of say complaints about sentencing that we receive in our morning post probably more than complain of excessive leniency <e> <s> one must have consistency in sentencing and the absence of this power of reference without causing double jeopardy has caused both the home secretary and myself a good deal of anxiety

his side <e> <s> instead with perfect legitimacy he embarked upon new fields and ventures which i do not think i can follow him in completely or it would occupy the greater part of the time which the

i am grateful to all noble lords who have participated in this discussion for the knowledgeable comments they have made <e> <s> i make only two remarks of a general nature <e> <s> one is that all

extremely grateful to the noble and learned lord my predecessor for having given a very warm welcome to this bill and i am very grateful for what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of

whether such an act constituted <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to speculate as to what would get through parliament <e> <s> if one reads the treason act one is i think slightly puzzled by the norman french of stratford atte bow <e> <s> if one delves rather deeply into the various meanings <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say that they were both charged with and convicted of murder in that

of <e>", "<cs> my lords the question on the order paper related to treason and not sedition <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i desire to repeat a statement which has now been made by my right honourable and learned friend the attorney-general concerning the indemnity which he gave on behalf of the government to the sequestrators of the assets of the national union of mineworkers <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may deal in inverse order with the points raised <e> <s> with the greatest possible respect to the noble lord lord wigoder he is onto a thoroughly bad point <e> <s> what is at stake is the payment of a fine <e> <s> the sequestrators are appointed by the court in order to enforce the payment of the fine and they are therefore officers of the court <e> <s> the law of maintenance has no more to do with this matter than the rule in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the attorney-generals statement had nothing whatever <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not at all sure what the answer to that is because i have never worked as a treasury minister <e> <s> i know the noble lord lord diamond knows a bit about these things <e> <s> but my understanding of it was that the earliest and indeed for this purpose the latest moment at which it could be done was by putting it in the supplementary estimates in the way that it was <e>

question and to the noble lord lord mishcon for ventilating it in the committee <e> <s> as the noble lord has told the committee as drafted the bill allows the donor the power to appoint an attorney <e>", "<cs> this is again a matter in regard to which i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for ventilating <e> <s> it involves a slightly more technical and possibly a slightly longer reply on my part <e> <s> it is not easy to explain this in words of one syllable but i shall try to be as simple as i can <e>", "<cs> i would accept the premise of the argument presented by the noble lord lord mishcon at once <e> <s> there was a medieval philosopher <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house be now resumed for the purpose of repeating the statement <e>", "<cs> i am grateful again to the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> this amendment was proposed i think not because it was believed that the provision was objectionable in substance but precisely and the noble lord lord mishcon has confirmed it because there was a similar provision in clause and it was believed therefore that clause <e>", "<cs> again i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> in this case if i may i should like more time to consider the matter and if he will be good enough to withdraw this particular amendment i would hope to see whether further discussions can find a satisfactory solution before the bill leaves this house indeed i hope at the next stage <e> <s> there is one error but only one that i have been told about and i think it is either a misprint or a <e>", "<cs> i give notice that at the report stage i may have to return to clause <e> <s> but subject to that i naturally support the question <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord had really wanted a detailed answer to that question he should have put down that question and not the question which he did <e> <s> the facts are that the l code is being revised and it will honour section of the legal aid act <e>", "<cs> my lords i think not but if i am wrong i shall write to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords two very different questions <e> <s> as i said the question of the l code is primarily a question for the department of health and social security and if the question is put down we shall answer it <e> <s> as regards the second the matter is under discussion within the government and with the trade union side <e> <s> there is the suggestion that the matter should be transferred to my department <e> <s> i am not very keen on it but that decision has not been taken <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as regards civil legal aid the overriding responsibility for the administration of civil legal aid is with the lord chancellors department but it consists of two parts <e> <s> one is the assessment of means to discover financial eligibility and one is the reasonableness of the application which is made from the point of view of the merits of the proposed case or defence <e> <s> the latter is dealt with by the law society through its area and regional committees the former is dealt with under the dhss because it has the means of assessing financial eligibility which at the moment my department has not <e> <s> i thought that that was fairly generally known <e> <s> so far as criminal legal aid is concerned it was transferred to my department during i think the present administration <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to notify the house in accordance with the royal assent act that the queen has signified her royal assent to the following acts <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by thanking the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones for the kind personal reference with which he began his speech <e> <s> i am suffering from a slight disability but i hope that neither my attention to the speeches nor the quality of my performance during the debate has suffered unduly from it <e> <s> if it has then i can only apologise <e>", "<cs> i think i can reassure both the noble and learned lord who proposed this amendment and the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington who spoke particularly for the bar <e> <s> it is our intention that the standards of behaviour which govern a prosecuting officer in the new service should be exactly identical to the standards of behaviour now observed by prosecuting barristers and solicitors in the courts of the land <e> <s> it is our policy that it should be so <e> <s> i hope also to be able to reassure both the noble and learned lord and the noble lord that it must be so <e>", "<cs> i hope and believe that i can comply fully with the request of the noble lord lord wigoder <e> <s> as the committee will remember i was responsible for passing through parliament the supreme court act when this question of the right of audience was canvassed at rather greater length than we shall need to do this evening <e> <s> i hoped and believed and in the result i think i hoped and believed with reason that so far as then regarded the rights of audience in the crown court we had laid to rest any sense of grievance on either side of either branch of the profession <e>", "<cs> i think that the broad answer to that is frankly no <e> <s> not necessarily <e> <s> like i suppose every professional member who has spoken in the debate i have taken part in dozens of cases probably hundreds in the course of years where either civil or criminal cases have been perfectly properly brought but have broken down for just the kind of reason that the noble lord has suggested namely that the witnesses did not come up to proof were torn to pieces in cross-examination or something went wrong so that a vital element in the case failed <e> <s> i am afraid that i take the broad attitude limiting <e>", "<cs> everyone hearing those remarks will understand why the noble lord lord mishcon was called the attorney-general of lambeth <e> <s> the eloquence with which he has defended his position does him nothing but credit <e> <s> it is true that i must take the responsibility for giving the figure of million and i do <e> <s> however i am hound to tell the noble lord and the committee that i did not do the sum myself and that those who did do the sum are much more qualified than i am to give it <e> <s> i should perhaps say to the noble lord lord airedale and to the noble lord lord mishcon in so far as motoring cases in particular are concerned i belong to the aa or the rac and probably both the costs of ones defence are borne by those societies <e> <s> and so they should be <e> <s> very often that is also the case if one is a member of a trade union or an employee <e> <s> at any rate suppose we leave it like this that i will take the matter back and consider it <e> <s> we can then return to it on report in the light of such instructions as i may receive from my instructing solicitors <e> <s> perhaps we may now move on <e> <s> we have had a very good debate <e>", "<cs> my motto is <e>", "<cs> the prosecution service and not just the straight central funds <e> <s> it may sound rather absurd and i quite sympathise with my noble and learned friend <e> <s> it is rather an abstract proposition that it matters in government out of which pocket you pay the taxpayers money but the fact is that it does <e>", "<cs> i think probably not it is a question of accounting discipline which is not quite purely an accounting matter <e> <s> perhaps we could leave it at that for the moment while hope dawns eternal <e> <s> i think we have explored this matter as far as we can go this evening <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon was of course quite right <e> <s> although this raises issues which are very similar to those which we have recently discussed the point is a slightly different one because the amendment would have the same effect in respect of the court of appeal as the previous amendment had in respect of the crown court <e>", "<cs> i think that my noble friend lord campbell of alloway has almost taken the words <e>", "<cs> i do not think that there is any question here of justice or injustice <e> <s> i agree that there is a question of accountability in the sense in which the matter was raised a moment or two ago by my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> but there is also a point of principle and a practical point <e> <s> the point of principle is that legal aid is intended just as much for defendants who in the outcome are acquitted as for those who in the outcome are convicted <e> <s> that is a point of principle of some importance and i think that this amendment runs counter to it although i would be the first to agree that it is a question of from which government pocket the money is to come <e>", "<cs> i shall bear that in mind but i ought to have pointed out and perhaps i may be forgiven for doing so now that in addition to promising to bear it in mind unfortunately i had two briefs on separate pieces of paper and i only delivered one <e> <s> i must tell the committee that as drafted the amendment appears to be technically defective <e> <s> it does not deal with the situation where the defendant is in receipt of more than one legal aid order for example because he now has an order covering post-committal work which preceded a separate order for work in the magistrates courts prior to committal the amendment appears to act only on the existing order and to remove any right of solicitor and counsel to payment under the legal aid act in respect of the earlier work <e> <s> the amendment appears to assume that every defendants costs order is for the full amount of costs whereas clause would allow the court to make partial orders <e> <s> if the amendment were accepted a defendant granted a partial order would lose all his legal aid but only recover from central funds the parts of his costs covered by the defendants costs order <e>", "<cs> i am happy to go some way to help the noble and learned lord <e> <s> ministers are of course concerned to avoid significant additional burdens on local authorities and it is recognised that the removal of provision of awards from central funds might result in some local authorities bearing a greater proportion of such expenditure than at present <e> <s> but we are concerned to avoid such additional burdens <e>", "<cs> the last point made by the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington had escaped my notice and does not directly arise from this amendment <e> <s> i will therefore take it on board and write a letter to him which will give the right answer instead of giving him the wrong answer that i should undoubtedly give if i attempted to give it now <e>", "<cs> i do not want to allow the candle of hope to burn very much in this case <e> <s> curiously enough it has been a very long time since i appeared in a magistrates court myself in any capacity may i add i hope it may be a long time before i appear as a defendant <e> <s> i rather question from my own recollection whether the noble lord lord mishcon is being quite fair to magistrates in these cases <e> <s> my recollection it goes back many many years and therefore people may have become more slapdash in the interval is that if i had won a case and said that i asked for costs they would ask how much do you want mr <e> <s> hogg <e> <s> i would say in those days a fairly modest sum because there was no inflation then <e> <s> i would say we have had to call three witnesses there has been a conference there are counsels fees and solicitors instructions i think i ought to ask for or or whatever it was <e> <s> they would always knock something off but i always realised that before i mentioned my sum and on the whole i think that fairly good justice was done <e> <s> it may have been rough but i think it was probably cheaper to the parties over a period of time or at any rate to the parties viewed as a class than having taxation in these cases <e> <s> i will not refuse to reflect about it but i do not want to light this candle which i lit on a previous occasion <e>", "<cs> in response to my noble and learned friend on the cross-benches i shall of course arrange for a copy of any letter which i may write to the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington to be sent to the noble and learned lord as well as have it put in the library or anywhere else that we may think it right to put it <e> <s> in response to his second question what has to be disregarded is not the fact that the legally assisted person is legally assisted <e> <s> it is the order that is to be disregarded in determining the amount of the costs <e> <s> i had thought that this was possibly plain <e> <s> if what i am now about to say is wrong or inconclusive i shall try to supplement it by letter but it is i think clear once one appreciates that what is to be disregarded is the amount of costs in the legally aided order and not the fact that the man is legally aided <e> <s> all else i think follows from that <e>", "<cs> i think that is a question of draftsmanship about which i should have to take advice <e> <s> however those who are listening or who will read elsewhere what i may have said will cause me to write to my noble and learned friend <e>", "<cs> again i am not absolutely sure that i am completely in touch with the precise question which the noble lord is asking <e> <s> the situation envisaged by clause arises where an offence a summary offence is laid but not proceeded with or is dismissed <e> <s> then the court may make such an order as to costs to be paid by the prosecutor to the accused as it considers just and reasonable <e> <s> the amount must be specified in the order and in arriving at the order which includes the amount the legal aid order shall be disregarded in determining the amount of his costs which i suppose means that he pays what is not included in the legal aid order <e> <s> i shall of course review what i have said in the light of any advice that i may receive <e>", "<cs> the short answer to this amendment is that it is unnecessary for the reason given by my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> but there is a little more to it than that because i think that particularly the noble lord lord hutchinson has muddled himself a bit as to what this is about <e> <s> there are three types of monetary payment which can be ordered by a summary court against a defendant who is convicted <e> <s> one is compensation to the victim another is the costs which have been incurred to bring the case to trial which may be more or less according to the course which the case has taken at the hearing and another is the fine if that is thought to be the appropriate penalty to be inflicted for what the defendant has done <e> <s> the court has to consider the ability of the defendant to pay and that is the point which has been made by my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale <e>", "<cs> probing or not this amendment is clearly right and i am very happy to accept it <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for proposing it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is not quite right in saying that we are not concerned with magistrates courts <e> <s> clause clearly envisages a magistrates court <e> <s> clause as a whole enables a magistrates court and a crown court to order a convicted defendant to pay just and reasonable costs which the clause requires the court to specify in the order to the prosecutor <e> <s> the amount is contained in clause in the terms which i have just set out <e>", "<cs> so far as concerns consultation which is really independent of the terms of either of the two amendments to which the noble lord has spoken it is certainly my policy to consult both with the law society and with the senate on any matters in which they are legitimately interested <e> <s> i certainly shall subject to anything that i may be told that i have said out of place give the assurance that the noble lord lord mishcon requires <e> <s> of course these regulations will have to be considered in conjunction with the profession and the judiciary and the ordinary parties with whom consultation is made <e>", "<cs> i take note of what the noble lord lord airedale has said <e> <s> i do not think so <e> <s> we want to confine the affirmative procedure to matters of greater consequence than this but i take note and will consider it <e>", "<cs> i should have thought that the word unnecessary was easier to construe than unreasonable <e> <s> unnecessary means unnecessary to the conduct of the proceedings and to the result achieved <e>", "<cs> i think that for once the noble and learned lord has not appreciated the policy behind the clause <e> <s> it is that irrespective of the result of the proceedings unreasonable behaviour should be penalised in the costs <e> <s> that may not depend on the result of the pleadings at all <e> <s> a person who is acquitted may be guilty of unreasonable behaviour adding to the costs unnecessarily just as much as a person who is convicted may have spent not a penny more than is necessary <e>", "<cs> the amendment as it is drafted i hope that this is the last i shall say on this point would apply both to civil and criminal proceedings <e> <s> this would cause great difficulties in the civil courts since the civil courts have no facilities for making payments out of central funds even when such payments are justified in civil cases <e> <s> to that extent the amendment must be condemned as defective <e>", "<cs> at present regulations provide that when a central funds order is made a defendant may recover his fares and subsistence as if he were a witness but a defendant is not for some reason entitled to recover his loss of earnings <e> <s> i sympathise with the intention of this amendment <e> <s> it would allow defendants awarded costs from central funds to claim loss of earnings but i should have to look more closely than i have already done at the cost implications <e> <s> strictly speaking the amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> as it stands at the moment the bill enables the lord chancellor to make the regulations which could allow such payments <e> <s> i therefore invite the committee on my undertaking to consider the matter further not to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> there is one point at which i cannot submit to the blandishments of my noble and learned friend if i may be so allowed to call him lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> my noble and learned friend asked me not to treat this as a challenge to my debating skill <e> <s> i should be mad if i did not <e> <s> i have had about speeches fired at me no bishops this time <e> <s> and i am supposed to lie down and wag my tail with my paws in the air <e> <s> i shall not do it <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord will see as i go along that i have not missed any of the more obvious points and that is one of them that i shall not miss <e> <s> i am not quite so silly as he takes me for <e>", "<cs> i have not spoken to the lord chief justice <e> <s> i quoted him in a public speech directly and i know that if he were here whether he would approve this particular formulation or not i know not he would go at least as far <e>", "<cs> to the contrary not-content <e>", "<cs> clear the bar <e>", "<cs> my lords the question has been put the voices have been collected and i have ordered the bar to be cleared <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the second of the two alternatives put by the noble lord is probably the right one <e> <s> i shall write to him if i am wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i do not wish any disrespect at all to my noble and learned friend who is a noble and learned friend in every possible sense of the word but we have before us only amendment no <e> <s> and i think that it would be more convenient to deal with the other amendments separately because they raise totally separate points <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say something now because we are really getting into an awful muddle <e> <s> may i start with a brief bleat of protest <e> <s> this amendment was put down at yesterday afternoon <e> <s> as thursday is cabinet day i saw it for the first time at this afternoon during the lunch hour <e> <s> i read it carefully so did my staff <e> <s> we could not make head or tail of what was the purpose of it <e> <s> i am still more baffled after having heard the discussion which has gone round from all quarters of the chamber <e> <s> i should like to explain why it cannot assist the committee to discuss it at very much greater length although of course every noble lord has a right to speak for as long as he or she likes and why in itself the amendment does not make very much sense <e>", "<cs> there is absolutely no truth in the suggestion that solicitors will not act against solicitors <e> <s> it is a myth held by many laymen but there is not a word of truth in it <e>", "<cs> it retains all sanctions but it retains a discretion to consider whether it is reasonable to select one or more of them <e> <s> quite obviously it was never intended that for instance an action for for negligence could be dealt with under this clause at all <e> <s> it has to go to the courts and i would say quite frankly to my noble friend lord maude that i was not attacking him or attacking him bitterly but i have had years experience <e> <s> i have sued solicitors not myself but for clients for negligence and i have defended them against charges of negligence <e> <s> in fact it is not suitable for the summary remedies involved in this clause to go by this route at all <e>", "<cs> i have already said that i shall do so <e>", "<cs> it is always attractive to offer avenues by way of appeal but i must emphasise that the purpose of this clause is to give the council a fairly summary remedy in relatively unimportant cases <e> <s> for instance it is not intended to substitute the powers of the council for the demand that a solicitors remuneration be taxed it is not suggested that the powers of the council should be substituted for the right of a certificate of remuneration to be obtained by the existing route it is not suggested that it should substitute for an action for negligence and it is not suggested that in grave cases the council should act in cases of professional misconduct <e> <s> the objective is that shoddy work should have attached to it one or more of the additional sanctions placed in subsection paragraphs <e>", "<cs> i say quite frankly and sincerely to my noble friend that when he made his speech on second reading my heart absolutely bled <e>", "<cs> again i point to the fact with some sense of complaint in my voice that this notice was given at yesterday afternoon <e> <s> but i think it must be clear by now to the committee from the discussions that we have had from the speech made by the noble lord lord hatch of lusby and from the speech which we have just listened to from my noble and learned friend on the cross-benches that there is really nothing in common among the three sets of critics of this clause nothing in common at all <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether it is my turn but perhaps it may be considered a suitable opportunity for me to reply <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham asked who it was who had asked me to put this subsection into the bill <e> <s> the answer can i think be given in this way <e> <s> paragraph of the farrand report with which the noble lord will no doubt be familiar because it gave birth to part ii of the bill drew attention to the potential difficulties in which legal executives and unadmitted staff would be put if section restrictions were extended to take in the contract stage of a conveyancing transaction <e> <s> that is where it comes from <e> <s> as the noble lord will remember from our second reading debate one of the things <e>", "<cs> i hope neither my noble friend nor the noble lord lord hatch of lusby bears any grudge against me for having pointed out the somewhat late period at which these amendments were put down <e> <s> i would ask them to take into account the rather special position in which i find myself in relation to this bill <e> <s> most bills of this complication and covering such a wide range of subjects are run by ministries with about six different parliamentary secretaries ministers of state and ministers in both houses <e> <s> but in regard to this bill i am the only one i am the boy who stood on the burning deck <e> <s> if an amendment goes down at such a time and it happens to be a cabinet day i am in cabinet and cannot read my brief <e> <s> although i issued a slight bleat of complaint i hope no grudge will be borne against me because i am in a rather difficult position <e>", "<cs> may i ask leave to consider this further <e> <s> i find it hard to envisage circumstances in which real harm would result from leaving out the words which the amendment would insert but there can be no objection in principle to the noble lords amendment <e> <s> therefore if the noble lord will agree to withdraw it i will undertake to consider further whether there is a potential <e>", "<cs> may i on rather similar lines ask leave to consider this further <e> <s> i agree that the provisions of section of the solicitors act should not apply to unqualified clerks working under the direction and supervision of a solicitor <e> <s> if my noble friend would care to withdraw his amendment at this stage i shall undertake to consider further whether an amendment is necessary to put the matter beyond doubt and what form if any such an amendment would take <e>", "<cs> i think there is an amendment <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord has gone <e> <s> i think he has gone but there was down a proposal to oppose the question whether clause shall stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> oh good <e>", "<cs> this is a more substantial matter which i shall probe at a little greater length <e> <s> it is quite true as the noble lord lord mishcon said that the farrand committee assumed rightly that what we were primarily dealing with under the original austin mitchell bill and its terms of reference was domestic conveyancing <e> <s> that is a perfectly fair comment to make <e> <s> but it did not recommend that licensed conveyancers should be restricted to only domestic conveyancing work however that expression is to be defined <e> <s> therefore although it had its sights on domestic conveyancing it was not restricted in that way <e>", "<cs> i shall do my best although i am not sure how good it will be <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mishcon may know without my disclosing <e>", "<cs> what i can do at any rate is to assure the noble lord lord mishcon that clause is not intended to enable licensed conveyancers to prepare instruments relating to the legal proceedings <e> <s> the other points are rather technical and i should like to consider them further before i give the noble lord a definite reply <e> <s> certainly it is not our intention to allow licensed conveyancers to prepare instruments relating to legal proceedings <e>", "<cs> i do not think it makes a great deal of difference because as i understand it all the training rules and rules of conduct will require the lord chancellors concurrence and there is little point in also requiring the lord chancellors approval for criteria within which the rules have been made because that will follow <e> <s> the larger embraces the smaller <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord graham in his earlier sequence of amendments said that in that sequence at any rate his intention was that the new council and the new profession should be on the same footing as solicitors <e> <s> i must point out that in laying upon the council the duty to report in the way he suggests he is laying on that council an obligation when no similar obligation is laid upon the law society and no similar obligation is laid upon any other professional body <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for reminding me of that <e> <s> i should have mentioned it in my speech <e> <s> i had not forgotten it but i have not accepted it <e>", "<cs> my noble friend should bear in mind that this amendment if it were passed would compel the council not merely to prescribe the minimum standards of general education that is o-levels and such-like but also to recognise a course of study as being adequate for preparing candidates as for example at the north london polytechnic or the polytechnic of central london prescribe post-qualification training for licensed conveyancers charge fees and make different provisions in relation to different classes of persons in those respects <e> <s> in other words they would be made to do all those things <e> <s> i do not think it is desirable that they should be made to do all those things <e> <s> i recognise the general fun of talking about may and shall but i think i have explained sufficiently why the word may is in the clause <e>", "<cs> of course we do not desire to see licensed conveyancers made subject to unnecessary restrictions in their capacity to compete with solicitors <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that the concurrence of this lord chancellor and maybe of subsequent lord chancellors though i cannot always speak for them will not be forthcoming for rules which might lead to that effect <e> <s> i am sure that the two bodies namely the law society and the council will wish to have regard to each others training rules <e> <s> but it would be undesirable to make the new councils functions dependent upon what the law society may decide for its own members <e> <s> i am not sure that that would achieve an object which would be within the target sights of the noble lord lord graham <e> <s> the council might wish to cover matters which form part of a solicitors qualifying examination by way of post-qualification training instead <e> <s> that would be perfectly legitimate for it to do <e> <s> on the whole i do not think that it is desirable to fetter the freedom of manoeuvre of the new council in the manner which this amendment would achieve <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord having heard that explanation will not be too disappointed <e>", "<cs> i think i can give that assurance <e> <s> i would expect of course that the council who will bear the primary responsibility for these training rules will have read the farrand committees recommendations and will themselves pay very close attention to them <e> <s> i am very anxious that the new profession should not be fettered unduly but i can assure him that so far as i am concerned consumer protection is very much at the top of my priorities in this matter <e> <s> certainly i think i can assure the noble lord that i and those who advise me will pay very great attention to any deviation from the standards proposed by the farrand committee although it is a matter of deliberate policy by the government that the intitial draftsmanship of the rules shall rest with the council <e>", "<cs> i think the best thing that i can say is that i will look into the matter <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the amendment appears to be to ensure that the register of licensed conveyancers to be established by the council is comprehensive enough to enable someone inspecting it to locate the business name and address of a conveyancer practising by means of a company or as an employee of someone else <e> <s> it is intended that the register will enable anyone to discover the location of a licensed conveyancers practice or practices <e> <s> while the existing clause does not provide for corporate practitioners or employed conveyancers specifically to register their practising addresses the requirement on the council to maintain a register of all persons holding a licence will cover them and therefore no additional provision is thought to be needed <e>", "<cs> here we are with may and shall <e> <s> i will certainly consider the point before report <e> <s> i think that may does mean shall in practice in the particular context and if all the rules are shown to be inadequate i can see future shadow lord chancellors saying to the lord chancellor why did you let that through <e> <s> the lord chancellor has to concur with it all and is fully accountable to parliament in general through this chamber <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i fully appreciate the total implications of what my noble friend has just suggested <e> <s> but my noble and learned friend on the cross-benches omitted to note that what i said was not that it means shall but that it means shall in practice which is not quite the same thing <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can be asked to do much more than say in the friendliest possible way that i shall consider it because all i have ever said at the moment is that may means in practice that they have got to <e> <s> that seems to me to be quite enough to satisfy the most exacting requirement here without going into the amendments which my noble and learned friend on the cross-benches suggested <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can be tempted further to go down the primrose path <e> <s> a lot of water will have flowed under the bridge before a future lord chancellor has to consider the matter <e> <s> but i cannot conceive of any responsible lord chancellor and may they always be responsible allowing licensed conveyancers to associate with inappropriate persons <e>", "<cs> i think the best thing i can do is to promise to write to the noble lord otherwise i am sure to make a mistake about this <e>", "<cs> i have listened with fascination to this discussion <e> <s> this was one of the amendments which appeared on the marshalled list for the first time at pm on th january and which i saw for the first time at lunch-time today <e> <s> if i may intervene in this discussion i should have thought that the words <e>", "<cs> the mandatory provisions in the bill provide that consumer representatives shall be appointed to the council and they will of course be eligible to serve on the committees <e> <s> the bill does not fetter the councils discretion in the matter of the detailed composition but i would certainly expect it to ensure that lay persons are properly represented on the committees <e>", "<cs> if you have a council of relatively small composition and committees of perhaps smaller composition then anybody who has been on the selection committees of either house knows how difficult the problem is <e> <s> but i point out to the noble lord that there is a safeguard <e> <s> the composition of the committees has to be laid down in rules <e> <s> the rules will require the lord chancellors concurrence and there you have parliamentary accountability <e>", "<cs> that was one of the briefest and most attractive speeches that i have heard in this house for some time <e> <s> it caught me almost unguarded <e>", "<cs> first there is absolutely nothing about legal learning in this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord monkswell is perfectly right this is a question of machinery <e> <s> i do not want to offer very much hope here but in view of the appeal that has just been made i shall obviously have the matter looked at again <e> <s> i do not want to offer a great deal of hope because the noble lord lord mishcon did not deal with what i though i had put at the forefront of my case namely that if you once allow an unlimited appeal from the investigating committee to the other and higher committee you eventually have a coach with five wheels you have destroyed the investigating committee altogether <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i am following my noble friend <e> <s> i am not contemplating and i think i made that clear in answer to an earlier amendment by the noble lord lord graham that the lay members and the professional members will vote as a party so to speak inside either the committees or the council <e> <s> i do not think that that is going to happen <e> <s> if it did happen i doubt whether the machine would work at all <e> <s> it would then be a coach without horses <e>", "<cs> they probably are <e>", "<cs> we are engaged on a rather elaborate exercise in semantics <e> <s> nor am i now altogether clear about how many of these amendments we are dealing with together <e> <s> they seem to me to deal with two quite separate points and both are semantic <e> <s> the first is whether one should call a person who is defending a proceeding a defendant or something else <e> <s> the second is whether one should describe fees as costs or costs as fees or both as the same thing or as different things <e>", "<cs> perhaps i had better stop here <e>", "<cs> we are now in very highly technical waters <e> <s> i am not sure that i wholly understand the matter but i shall do my best both to expound and to understand it myself <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> which we are now discussing would make provisions in respect of licensed conveyancers paralleling those in clause and clause relating to solicitors <e> <s> it is obviously right starting from principle that licensed conveyancers whose fees have been reduced under clause should be prevented from recovering the full amount from the customer consumer client or what-have-you <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may deal with the points in inverse order because i think that my noble friend possibly overlooked what the benson commission had said in relation to practising in a corporate form <e> <s> the benson commission i think that this is relevant to what my noble friend said and it is also a direct answer to the noble lord lord mishcon recommended that solicitors should be permitted to practise through companies but with unlimited liability <e> <s> the law society has informed my department that it would wish to see a suitable provision brought forward in this bill <e> <s> i think it is therefore right to say that i intend to table a government amendment in due course to give the law society power equivalent to those powers being given to the council for licensed conveyancers to permit solicitors to practise in corporate form <e>", "<cs> i do not have the documents before me but my understanding is that government policy is that it should be done if it can be done without impinging upon the dangers of conflict of interests <e> <s> but at any rate that is a separate question <e> <s> it is a dispute about tomorrow <e> <s> i do not know where i would wish to stand about that <e> <s> what i am trying to assure my noble friend and the noble lord lord mishcon about is that i am not going to use this as a device for missing out on this totally separate question <e> <s> the point is that both solicitors and probably licensed conveyancers will want to operate in corporate form <e> <s> i have made my statement about solicitors <e> <s> the like will apply <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> his question will be borne in mind <e> <s> on unlimited liability i think that i share the view of the law society <e> <s> they have also said that they do not want me to preclude the possibility of limited liability in a statutory form and at the moment i am falling in with their request <e> <s> it is one of these funny things <e> <s> perhaps i am talking a long time and boring the committee but the other day there was an argument at which i was not present about directors in connection with insolvency <e> <s> what the public do not really understand and what i think they have got to understand is that from the very start limited liability limited companies and bankruptcy for that matter have been of great benefit to the development of trade and industry in this country <e> <s> from the middle of the nineteenth century from onwards parliaments have smiled on this development and it would need a very great deal of tergiversation to go back on that <e> <s> but what they do not realise quite so clearly and what they ought to bear in mind is that every legal practitioner knows that they have also been the vehicle for fraud of various kinds <e> <s> numberless unsatisfied creditors to this day from the start to the present have gone away unsatisfied and sometimes ruined as a result of these basically beneficent devices of the th century <e> <s> it is from time to time the business of parliament to consider how best one can protect the public against fraud against dishonest or insolvent debtors and how one can do so without depriving the entrepreneur or whatever of the advantages of limited liability and the bankruptcy acts <e> <s> it is in the background here i hope not to introduce it too much into this debate but it is something which people must keep in their minds when they talk about limited liability <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord foot always puts his case so persuasively <e> <s> i am always very impressed with the extraordinary depth of experience he has <e> <s> therefore it is always difficult to argue the case against him but i am bound to do so on this occasion <e> <s> the great danger about political argument is that one either goes on a false premise or on a false analogy <e> <s> this is a case of false analogy <e> <s> when the part of lay observer was introduced i do not believe that i was in the government who introduced it i have an idea that it was introduced by the party opposite when in government but i may be wrong <e> <s> however i thought originally that the lay observer was a piece of cosmetic mechanism if indeed cosmetics can be mechanised <e>", "<cs> did i say it <e> <s> then at any rate i am guilty of consistency for once <e> <s> but i now recant entirely <e> <s> i have my experience from the other end of the gun of the lay observer <e> <s> in particular i had experience of reading although i will not go into the detail of it because it is not relevant to this amendment the glanville davies case from beginning to end <e> <s> i was immensely impressed with the way in which the lay observer had in the great mass of irrelevant detail and invective uncovered what was really the kernel of truth in that case <e> <s> he may have been helped but he did it <e> <s> he has been answerable to <e>", "<cs> i am very much suspicious of five wheeled coaches <e> <s> originally i thought that the lay observer was a piece of cosmetics and i now publicly recant <e> <s> i do not think he was <e> <s> i think he performs a useful function <e> <s> most people have thought that as a form of ombudsman in this field he has justified his existence one hundred times over <e> <s> one is sometimes wrong and this is one of the times when i was wrong first time round <e> <s> at any rate whether i said it or not that is my present position <e>", "<cs> i think that in those circumstances and subject to what my noble friend on my right says we had better resume the house now and adjourn <e> <s> i am entirely in the hands of the committee because i am not fagged out <e>", "<cs> i am content either way but i thought what was being said was that the noble and learned lord lord denning and my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale would wish to air these matters at the committee stage and that we would take the amendments at the next sitting of the committee <e> <s> i am in the hands of the committee <e> <s> i shall go on if noble lords want me to go on but i shall not go on if they do not <e>", "<cs> i think that we had really better resume now if i may say so <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning has the next amendment <e> <s> i think that these are matters of substantial interest <e> <s> it may be that we would wish a more representative attendance at the committee <e> <s> i think that we would be wise to stop now although i am perfectly willing to go on if noble lords prefer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the order of recommitment of the business names bill be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the order of recommitment of the company securities insider dealing bill be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the order of recommitment of the companies consolidation consequential provisions bill be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords we have first to put the question unless the noble lord wishes to speak on the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i believe a member of the committee wishes to speak <e>", "<cs> before my noble and learned friend takes his proper place in the proceedings may i tell the committee for its convenience that i propose to speak somewhat early because it would be wrong for me to let the debate proceed on a false premise <e> <s> of course i do not want to curtail the debate after that <e>", "<cs> i am sure that we have all listened with very great respect to my noble and learned friend on the cross-benches <e> <s> i intervene at this stage in the debate out of courtesy to the committee and not in order to curtail the debate in any way but it would be quite wrong to let the committee continue on a false premise until it knows what i propose to do <e> <s> i should like to explain to the committee perhaps at a little length what it is that i propose to do <e> <s> i must say in passing that some of the things that my noble and learned friend has just spoken require perhaps a little amplification if not an occasional point of correction <e>", "<cs> i would agree with the noble lord lord paget but the direct answer to his direct question is no i have no estimate and no figures but it must have been a very high cost <e> <s> but what is even more alarming is that the court of appeal has been prevented from carrying on its proper work <e> <s> to indicate the kind of pressure that it is under my recollection which may be wrong is that when i first went to the bar the court of appeal in its civil jurisdiction it did not then have a direct criminal jurisdiction because there was another court called the court of criminal appeal just after the war or during it sat in three courts <e> <s> they took over the old bar reading room <e>", "<cs> what it means is what i read out from the court of appeal namely that the present clause requires drastic amendment so as to provide for recourse to a fully constituted divisional court of which the president would be a member of the court of appeal <e> <s> that is what it means <e> <s> i was paraphrasing but the actual phraseology which i used before was read from a document <e>", "<cs> it would of course make no substantial difference either way but as i was going to amend the existing clause and as the formula which i read out indicated that clause in its present form but with the amendment was the one which the court of appeal would not approve it seemed to me far more reasonable that we should postpone this discussion by leaving this matter undivided upon until i had had an opportunity of revising and amending the clause <e> <s> that can be done at report stage <e> <s> the house will then have complete jurisdiction over the future of the clause in whatever form when that happens <e>", "<cs> i do not want to be accused of bad faith in this matter at all <e> <s> if i bring in a new clause and it contains a substantial part of the clause as it stands in the bill i do not wish to be accused of bad faith <e> <s> i have explained i hope with the very greatest clarity what i propose <e> <s> how we do it is a pure matter of procedure in which i would be very much guided by the feeling of the house <e>", "<cs> i think what my noble friend has said exactly illustrates the point which i was trying to make to the noble lord lord hooson <e> <s> it is of course true that the clause radically amended would reappear under either proposed procedure but it will still stop at the divisional court if the formula that i have read out is ultimately accepted by the house on report <e> <s> i ought to have added that when the case comes on if it does come on on the merits there will be as there is now and as there was not before when the court of appeal assumed total unlawful jurisdiction a further recourse to the court of appeal if the divisional court turns the matter down on its merits <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend who has just spoken both for the friendly tone he used and also for some appreciation of the difficulty under which i am labouring <e> <s> but the fact of the matter is that i said at the beginning of my speech that clause in its present form would not have appeared in the bill without my consent and approval <e> <s> it was put before me from an appropriate source <e> <s> i do not think i ought to go further into the matter than that i think i should be guilty of a breach of faith if i did <e> <s> i would only say that i will put forward at report a proposal on the lines i have suggested <e> <s> as a matter of fact it will not necessarily matter very much in what form i put it but i will put forward before the house a proposal on the lines i have suggested <e> <s> the only reason why i hesitate to say that the particular motion before the committee might be misunderstood is that it is very important indeed that in doing this and in saying this i should not he accused of a breach of faith <e>", "<cs> i think that that sounds all right as far as i am concerned and i hope it satisfies the noble lord lord hooson and my noble and learned friend on the cross-benches <e>", "<cs> if that is the wish of the committee let it be so as long as my position is retained intact <e>", "<cs> i do not see any virtue in recommittal <e> <s> i must say that i far prefer the formula proposed by the noble and learned lord opposite and i propose to stick to it <e>", "<cs> i am glad to have been reminded of our former exchange on this matter <e> <s> it is nothing like as easy as either the noble lord lord mishcon whose polite words flatter me beyond my deserts or my noble friend seem to think <e> <s> i must make a general observation which is intended not only for this amendment but also for others which may or may not come forward during this stage of the bill or on report <e> <s> i hope the committee will realise that one gets a slot in the legislative programme from ones colleagues with very great difficulty <e> <s> i obtained my slot in the programme for this miscellaneous bag of useful or useless reforms according to what view one takes of them on the understanding that it would not cost the government additional money <e> <s> therefore i cannot in all good loyalty to my colleagues impose on them additional expense simply because the long title of the bill and the scope of the bill enable everybody with a bright idea as to how to spend the taxpayers money to come forward with a plausible plea <e> <s> i do not specifically refer to the noble lord lord mishcon and this amendment when i say that <e> <s> i am acting under very considerable restraint perhaps constraint is the right word <e>", "<cs> i think it is really betwixt and between <e> <s> i cannot say and i am not free to say as of now that the principle is admitted <e> <s> i have said that it will be considered and i hope in a friendly spirit because i have tried to show a friendly spirit <e> <s> i have also said that in its present form the amendment cannot be accepted because its drafting is defective <e> <s> therefore the noble lord with full honour retained is perfectly at liberty to produce his amendment or an improvement on it next time if i do not come forward with an amendment of my own <e> <s> but i would rather urge him not to have a division now <e> <s> he might find himself worse off if he loses it than if he withdraws the amendment now <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to seem disagreeable about this proposal especially when it has had so many distinguished friends <e> <s> however i really must say to noble lords that i am not in a position to add to public expense at the present time <e> <s> i am a minister who is responsible as a member of the cabinet for the cost of my own office <e> <s> i am also a minister responsible as a member of the cabinet for imposing restraint on a number of people whom i would place vastly in front of this proposal in my scale of social priorities in the fields of national health education and pensions involving the kind of expenditure that is constantly urged upon us by the other side <e> <s> i would put them vastly in front of the proposal that people should be entitled to litigate at the public expense <e>", "<cs> it is absolutely wrong for me to accept something even if expense were the only point that i would wish to raise <e> <s> i must however go a little further than that <e> <s> i yield to no one in my respect for the late lord evershed and the noble lord lord benson <e> <s> both in their day and in this connection have done a very good job <e> <s> i hope therefore that no one will accuse me of the smallest discourtesy or intended discourtesy <e> <s> but the governments policy in relation to this matter has already been announced <e> <s> our response to benson was that the government do not accept that the coincidence of public importance need necessarily result in public funding <e> <s> the importance of the case to the individual litigant is however a relevant consideration for the granting of legal aid which is available to those of small or moderate means to pursue any reasonable action <e> <s> to that extent the costs of a case that might include the point of exceptional public importance are met <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington has put his finger on a rather important point which i shall develop in my own way in a moment <e> <s> i hope that the committee will remember three things <e> <s> the first is that as recently as st january a closely related amendment was moved <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i really can do much more than i have said <e> <s> i gave him a very friendly reply when i was speaking on a bill which dealt with criminal law when he put forward a related amendment on a home office bill <e> <s> but the home office is responsible for changes in the criminal law and not the lord chancellor <e> <s> this bill is about civil law <e> <s> obviously there are problems some of which we discussed rather fully then and i have never denied it <e> <s> but this is not the way to do it and in response to what he rightly described as a slightly impassioned reply i have to remind him courteously but i am afraid firmly that his amendment is dealing solely with the contempt of court act provisions and has nothing to do with estreating recognizances or the other matters which he mentioned <e> <s> this is a general problem of <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say that the amendment would limit the persons who may be bound by the new notice procedure to those affected by actions relating to trusts or to the estates of deceased persons <e> <s> this is the intention of the clause <e> <s> of course the sidenote is something from which judges have to avert their eyes on occasion and the explanatory memorandum dies with the bill when it becomes an act <e> <s> on the other hand i think that this raises a point which deserves consideration <e> <s> it raises a point about the scope of the clause which has substance in that subsection and subsection could be construed to give the clause a wider scope than is intended <e> <s> however the wording of this particular amendment is defective <e> <s> if the noble lord agrees to withdraw his amendment i will undertake to <e>", "<cs> this amendment would restrict the exercise of the county courts jurisdiction in contested probate matters to courts specially designated by the lord chancellor for that purpose <e> <s> there are of course parallels as the noble lord lord mishcon has rightly pointed out for a suggestion of this kind divorce bankruptcy admiralty and race relations <e> <s> these are specialised areas of the law where jurisdiction is assigned or confined to particular courts but in this field of contested probate matters county courts have exercised jurisdiction to handle them for well over years and the amendment would in effect remove the jurisdiction from all but specially designated county courts <e>", "<cs> like the administration of justice bill through your lordships house <e>", "<cs> i can well understand and to a great extent sympathise with the wish to derive the maximum benefit from the recommendation of the insolvency law reform committee regarding bankrupts property and i say at once as i think the noble and learned lord divined that their recommendations have greatly influenced the shape of the insolvency bill which is racing through your lordships house neck and neck with the present piece of draft legislation <e>", "<cs> i think that the committee would do very well to heed the warning given by the noble lord lord graham <e> <s> obviously i have every sympathy with the desire to save debtors distress and damage which they may suffer by failing to apply for a certificate of satisfaction but the statistic quoted by the noble lord lord mishcon means something very different to me from what it seemed to mean to him <e> <s> i absolutely agree that in a very large number of cases satisfaction is not in fact registered and therefore the registration is not cancelled <e> <s> this can only really be because neither party bothers to do it and because no very great harm is done when they do not <e>", "<cs> i was a little surprised to hear the noble lord lord hutchinson say that he did not expect me to give a very sympathetic reply to this <e> <s> i always try to be as sympathetic as i can but i have to say one or two things to him <e> <s> i think that to begin with he overstated his case <e>", "<cs> there is one point i should like to make at the outset <e> <s> the reason why this clause is in the bill is because there is a defect in the law which needs to be remedied as soon as possible and cannot wait for a full review of the law of arbitration which i believe will be carried out <e> <s> as the noble lord on the cross-benches has said until where two parties agreed that a dispute should be referred to three <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to amend section of the county courts act which derives in its immediate provenance from the supreme court act <e> <s> i start therefore with a slight assumption against changing i shall not use any pejorative word legislation that parliament has enacted as recently as that <e> <s> the section provides for transfer downwards if under subsection <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon has perfectly accurately described the relationship between my department and myself as regards this amendment <e> <s> i am sure that he would therefore wish when i have said the little that i have to say to take on board what has fallen from my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> if i have it right this is really a matter which would be more proper for the law society itself to draft if they have the amendment slightly wrong than for the government draftsman <e> <s> but i shall inquire from my department about whether i ought to intervene in the matter to which my noble friend lord simon has referred <e>", "<cs> i think i can promise that although i have not asked anybody <e> <s> it sounds very reasonable <e>", "<cs> as the noble and learned lord says he has raised this question before <e> <s> i think that perhaps this is based on a misunderstanding of the situation <e>", "<cs> i fully understand and would endorse the desire on the part of my noble friend to ensure that members of the council are suitably qualified and experienced to devise and administer the regulations governing licensed conveyancers <e> <s> a balance has to be struck between having self-regulation for the new conveyancers and ensuring adequate consumer representation <e> <s> accordingly the bill provides for the scheme governing membership of the council which will be provided by the initial council whom i think i appoint or at any rate approve and i may modify the scheme as i think fit <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend has said the amendment would empower the council to intervene in the practice of a licensed conveyancer in any case where a licensed conveyancer has not complied with any of the rules made by the council <e> <s> the power for the council to intervene in a licensed conveyancers practice is related to the circumstances where there might be some danger to the consumer <e> <s> that is what it is there for and it is thereby related to that issue <e>", "<cs> the issue here is again rather esoteric but the point is that one ought to draw a distinction between the draconian powers of intervention in practice which is possessed by the council and the more general powers of discipline and process for incompetence or negligence <e> <s> of course it will be necessary for the council to take appropriate disciplinary action through the committees established for the purpose following complaints or allegations of negligence or gross incompetence <e> <s> that is not in dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot give the noble lord who has brought this amendment forward again a very different answer from that which he received on the last occasion <e> <s> i am sorry to disappoint him in this way but the arguments are the same and the views of the parties including for what it is worth myself also remain the same <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am afraid we are in disagreement with one another <e> <s> the subsection sought to be amended is line of page which provides that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord denning has again placed before us the same amendment <e> <s> he still has only one reason that i have been able to discern for his support of the amendment even though he rather than the formidable team on the opposition front bench has now gone into bat first <e> <s> it is that the matter is already covered by section <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to my noble and learned friend <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand from my noble friends that the statement is now ready <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for raising this question again <e> <s> indeed i think that it was i who suggested in correspondence between us that it would be fair to do so <e> <s> i rise really only to confirm what he has said and to tell the house as i think the house is entitled to be told that the revenue has agreed to help in encouraging the establishment and use of enduring powers of attorney by so modifying its normal practice as to allow the acceptance of tax returns submitted on behalf of a donor by an attorney holding a registered enduring power <e>", "<cs> my lords as saint thomas more said on a famous occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that this would be a convenient moment for the statement to be repeated and if so i shall now do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord and the noble lord lord wigoder thanked me for repeating the statement <e> <s> i must say i was in some doubt as to whether constitutionally i ought to do so <e> <s> i thought it had been established beyond doubt that when an attorney-general instituted proceedings for any offence whatever he was acting in his official capacity sometimes called quasi judicial but i think unfortunately as a law officer and that the government had no responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had made it clear so that even the noble lord would understand that the statement related to the question of why prosecutions were instituted <e> <s> if he thinks he is going to divert me into the king charless head of the sinking of the belgrano he is greatly mistaken <e> <s> i am not such a fool as that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can understand what has led my noble friend to ask that question <e> <s> but i think i must pursue a policy of strict consistency in this matter <e> <s> we are not dealing with the merits of the ponting case but with why proceedings were instituted <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not go along with the noble lord at all <e> <s> the statement shows that the case was very carefully considered in the light of a report from the ministry of defence police by the solicitor-general and the director of public prosecutions in consultation with one another <e> <s> of course since the attorney-generals personal consent was required anyhow in a case of this importance and i think explicitly if my memory does not deceive me under section of the official secrets act they communicated their advice to him with the material upon which they had arrived at it <e> <s> i think that my right honourable and learned friend was positively entitled to rely upon that material in giving his authorisation as he said he did <e>", "<cs> my lords i am concerned to reply only in relation to the statement of my right honourable and learned friend <e> <s> the obervations of the noble and learned lord will obviously reach the ears of my right honourable friend the home secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful that my noble and learned friend on the cross-benches who has the additional experience of having held a law officership under the crown should have raised this question <e> <s> it was clearly established in the aftermath of the campbell case that it was utterly unconstitutional for the cabinet to attempt to intervene or to give directions either to prosecute or not to prosecute or even to give instructions to the attorney-general <e> <s> i hope that any government likely to occupy a responsible position in this country will adhere to that clear decision given at that time which was followed by the labour government when sir hartley shawcross as he then was made an important statement about the role of the attorney-general during that labour government <e>", "<cs> my lords it is no part of my duties to advise the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to give assurances of that kind it is for my noble friend the lord president of the council <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been suggested to me in regard to the companies bill and the other consolidation bills named on the order paper that the amendments should be taken together <e> <s> in that respect i am of course entirely in the hands of the house <e> <s> i will move them separately if need be if any member of the house desires <e>", "<cs> my lords then what i propose to do is put amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> is it your lordships pleasure that amendment no <e> <s> be withdrawn <e>", "<cs> my lords we now come to amendment no <e> <s> to which i think the noble and learned lord has spoken <e> <s> he has indicated that he wishes to divide the house on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i see that the noble lord lord simon of glaisdale is now here but my noble friend lord renton indicated that amendment no <e> <s> might not be moved <e>", "<cs> my lords i agreed in committee to take this back for further consultation <e> <s> i am now able to tell the noble and learned lord and any other noble lords who might otherwise have spoken that i am able to accept the amendment in principle <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord will be good enough to withdraw this amendment i shall come back on third reading with an amendment that i hope will embody that principle <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it that on the same undertaking amendment no <e> <s> is not moved <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is yes <e> <s> i give the same undertaking in relation to that <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> i take it is not moved on the same undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords not until i have put the question <e> <s> the question is that amendment no <e> <s> be agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i may have jumped the gun as regards the questions of my two noble friends to the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> if so i apologise to them <e> <s> i should perhaps not have put the question at the time i did <e> <s> i am afraid however that i cannot be as benevolent in relation to this amendment as i have been to the previous three or four amendments <e> <s> the amendment seems to me to be wrong both in principle and in practice <e> <s> the bill sets out straightforward arrangements under which a defendant who is legally aided and receives a defendants costs order looks to the legal aid fund for his legal aid costs and to central funds for any additional expenses he has incurred which are not covered by the legal aid order <e> <s> this ensures that he and his legal advisers already receive what is due to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that we had discussed this matter adequately in committee <e> <s> perhaps i may remind the house and particularly the noble and learned lord lord denning of the actual background to this matter <e> <s> the bill enables any court in indictable cases to order payment out of central funds of costs properly incurred by a private prosecutor <e> <s> that is part of the policy of the bill <e> <s> the power cannot however be exercised in favour of public authorities <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend below the gangway that the definition of public authority in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for reverting to this matter <e> <s> as he reminded the house i agreed in committee to take further counsel with the draftsmen to ensure that the clause as worded provided that costs could only be awarded where the improper act or omission occurred in the proceedings <e> <s> i am happy to say that on this occasion i am advised that i was right <e> <s> i am advised that the provision goes no wider than is necessary for this and that the amendment is therefore unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am again grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for reverting to this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a point here but it is not the point made by the amendment which in terms of <e>", "<cs> my lords with this amendment i think goes amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i thought it was in the name of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e>", "<cs> my lords what i think is right is that in view of the decision of the committee to remove the original clause from the bill i cannot resist these amendments but i do so without prejudice to what my right honourable and learned friend may do in another place because i reiterate my opinion that this house did a real disservice to the administration of justice to consistency in sentencing and to the protection of the innocent and vulnerable people of this country and i think it has public opinion against it <e> <s> but i do not resist the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords what i said if i may by leave of the house repeat it is that i spoke without prejudice to what my right honourable and learned friend might do in another place <e> <s> i did not say that i am not filled with indignation at what happened on committee because i am <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope so <e> <s> as your lordships know there is a special provision about consolidation bills they virtually go on from session to session although invariably they do not <e> <s> i must thank my noble friend and thank him sincerely for what he said at the beginning of his remarks <e> <s> there will be one main housing bill of nearly clauses two smaller bills one of about clauses and the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> consolidation will not be by april which was the hope that i originally expressed but i hope it will be before the end of the session <e> <s> i realise the importance of this matter <e> <s> we have a lot more consolidation coming too i am glad to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of recommitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to restrict the circumstances in which the rights of persons in occupation of registered land constitute overriding interests for the purposes of the land registration acts to and in which purchasers of unregistered land are affected with notice of the rights of persons in occupation of the land <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not want to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> what he is saying about me is quite right but i should like to place it on record although i have not looked up <e>", "<cs> my lords i will first thank the noble lord lord mishcon for the gracious way in which he began his speech <e> <s> i am on my feet again although whether i am on particularly good form is another matter <e> <s> i am glad that my noble and learned friend lord wilberforce was able to take a part in this debate <e> <s> he put a very clear perspective on the scope and purposes of the bill <e> <s> there is only one observation i would care to make about what he has just said before i read it again in <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point that the world will not come to an end if i may borrow my own phrase if the bill were not passed at all <e> <s> it is a bill of very limited scope for exactly the reasons which my noble and learned friend lord wilberforce has stated <e> <s> but in so far as it is valuable i would rather press it upon the house <e> <s> i point out that it is quite hopeless expressly in the light of the scottish law commissions report to try to revert to the co-ownership package to which the noble lord lord mishcon took some exception in the debate of <e> <s> time has passed by that for the time being at any rate so i do not consider that that is any kind of objection to this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i think again that is out of order <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons amendments be now considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> while the bill was in another place the government made the three amendments listed on the amendment sheet <e> <s> each arises out of clause of the bill application in northern ireland and is designed to protect the application of united kingdom legislation in northern ireland <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to notify the house in accordance with the royal assent act that the queen has signified her royal assent to the following acts <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my task has been rendered easier by the various contributions that have been made <e> <s> i would accept the general thesis presented by the noble lord lord mishcon on what the clause will do <e> <s> it is not with respect to my noble and learned friend on the cross-benches a substitute for an action for damages for negligence <e> <s> painting with a broad brush it is a shoddy-work clause which has a very limited number of rather limited remedies <e> <s> i think with respect to my noble and learned friend that he has repeated the error which i sought to expose in the first amendment <e>", "<cs> again my lords my task has been rendered rather easier by two contributions made to the debate <e> <s> the fallacy behind the amendment lies in the fact that my noble and learned friend lord denning has completely misunderstood the subsection and has misconstrued it in law <e> <s> my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson of ewell and the noble lord lord mishcon are perfectly right in what they have said about it <e> <s> the procedure envisaged by the clause viewed as a whole and by the subsection in particular is a self-contained procedure <e> <s> the council of the law society can tell the solicitor under subsection what he must do <e> <s> he must disallow part of his costs pay back part of them or take some remedial action <e> <s> he then either does it or he does not do it <e> <s> he is supposed to do it <e> <s> if he does not do it then the client goes to the tribunal not as a court of appeal but as an enforcement agency <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose the answer is that the order of the high court would be appealable to the same extent as but to no greater extent than any other order of the disciplinary tribunal under its existing powers <e> <s> all that it does is to make the procedure complete as regards the short sharp remedy <e> <s> it does not alter the value of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i must point out that this is the report stage of the bill and it is very highly inconvenient to ask a minister to speak twice when he can only do so once except by leave of the house <e> <s> it may be that i was to blame in answering the noble lord lord mishcon and not turning through <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of my noble friend making again the suggestion that i was only a poodle for the law society a suggestion which i rather welcome because i like poodles at the risk of facing that charge which i believe in this case to be unjust i must say to my noble friend almost what the noble lord lord mishcon has said <e> <s> it is not desired by this procedure before the tribunal that the tribunal should act as a court of appeal <e> <s> the effect of his amendment is in effect to make it a court of appeal by ensuring that it should re-hear the case <e> <s> that is not the intention <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that all i can tell my noble friend is that i undertook to consider further whether any amendment was necessary to deal with his point and if so what form it should take <e> <s> i say again at this stage that i do not disagree with the principle of the amendment but i am afraid i must add that it is still under consideration <e> <s> i am so sorry but that is the best i can do at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me to some extent some moral satisfaction to announce that the poodle is now off his leash <e> <s> the effect of these amendments which were courteously and moderately proposed by the noble lord lord mishcon is designed to restrict licensed conveyancers to undertaking domestic conveyancing work but to give the lord chancellor power to relax the restrictions so as to enable licensed conveyancers to undertake other types of conveyancing where the council has made rules to ensure that they are competent to do so <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon as he reminded us moved a less elaborate arrangement at committee which was designed merely to restrict licensed conveyancers to domestic work with no provision for any relaxation of the restriction and that amendment as he told us was withdrawn after discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely understand the noble lords concern that the council should ensure that adequate arrangements have been made to compensate clients who suffer loss through the dishonesty or fraud of licensed conveyancers before a licence is issued to any applicant <e> <s> there is therefore no issue of principle at stake here <e> <s> however i do not think that an amendment is required to achieve the aim which noble lords have in mind <e> <s> in fact section of the solicitors act which relates to the issue of practising certificates requires the applicant to comply only with indemnity rules in much the same way as clause does in this bill in respect of licensed conveyancers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to be associated with my noble friend <e> <s> i do not find it strange at all <e> <s> i am very glad to see his name there <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mishcon has said the amendments would in a <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon in moving his amendment very fairly said that it was moved in committee and that although i promised to look at the matter again i did not open the door to hope very wide <e> <s> the amendment which we are discussing would empower the discipline and appeals committee in the new structure to hear and determine any allegations or complaints against licensed conveyancers which the investigating committee had turned down and declined to refer to it <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two rather different aspects to this group of amendments amendments nos <e> <s> and which are really associated together <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he is quite right to raise the point <e> <s> i hate to say that my instructions were one gets into the ways of advocacy very easily on these occasions that these amendments were being taken together <e> <s> however as i pointed out there are two separate issues <e> <s> it is a matter for the house <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> raises the first question of principle which i raised <e> <s> if the house wants the amendments moved separately only one has been moved and my noble friend lord morris will be free to move the others in due course and to speak to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i think amendment no <e> <s> has already somehow mysteriously been dealt with <e> <s> however as i was told the batch includes amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> but when my noble friend moves amendments nos <e> <s> and the noble lord will be quite entitled to make any point he wishes to make on that <e>", "<cs> though i am having some difficulty in tracing the point i have an idea that amendment no <e> <s> has somehow already been disposed of <e>", "<cs> my lords it will now be moved by the noble lord lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment would provide that only licensed conveyancers could participate in the establishment of a recognised body but it would not prevent them subsequently selling their shares to unqualified persons <e> <s> i cannot believe that this at any rate would be exactly what the noble lord lord mishcon would want <e> <s> it would not restrict the services that the bodies could offer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that under a mistaken apprehension i already explained in the discussion on amendment no <e> <s> why these particular amendments are not acceptable to the government <e> <s> the discussion on them has ranged a little more widely than i had anticipated and i think i must therefore remind the house of what i said last january and establish what i believe to be the present situation <e> <s> when the austin mitchell bill was going through we undertook to set up what subsequently became the farrand committee <e> <s> part ii of this bill is our view of how the recommendations of the farrand committee ought to be brought into effect and it is therefore the implementation of a pledge <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather agree both with my noble and learned friend on the cross-benches and with the noble lord lord airedale <e> <s> it is of course a mistake to suppose that in the lord chancellor giving concurrence to rules or withholding his concurrence he will not have any negotiation and discussion with the council <e> <s> he will explain to the council what he objects to if he objects he will explain to the council what he wants put in if he thinks that there are omissions <e> <s> to that extent i wholly agree with what has just been said <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly there cannot be any objection in principle to what my noble friend has proposed <e> <s> it is clearly desirable that a building society should be able to instruct licensed conveyancers as well as solicitors to carry out the societys side of mortgage transactions <e> <s> i understand that not all the societies will find themselves in the difficulties that my noble friend has described although he is understandably concerned at the position of those which without amending legislation will be put to unnecessary expense and inconvenience <e> <s> i understand without making any promises i hope i shall not be construed as making any promises that there may be a building societies bill next session <e> <s> i doubt whether it will be in force in time early enough to avoid the difficulties described <e> <s> what i will do if my noble friend will allow me is to give further consideration to whether a suitable amendment can be included in this bill <e> <s> i understand that it probably would be within the scope of the bill this would be a matter on which i would have to take advice or the building societies bill if one is produced next session <e> <s> if this bill were to be amended the necessary provisions could not be moved until it reaches another place <e> <s> i take it that my noble friend would not find that an insuperable objection should he decide on that kind of assurance to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if accepted this amendment would have a somewhat bizarre effect <e> <s> the word consumer appears in two places in part ii of the bill which are relevant to what i am about to say <e> <s> clause requires the council <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill as drafted permits regulations to provide for the capital limit for assistance by way of representation to be different from that for advice and assistance <e> <s> that is in effect a tidying up of a loose end in the legal aid assessment system <e> <s> the amendment radically alters the nature of the entire clause by abolishing capital assessment altogether for both advice and assistance and assistance by way of representation <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to deal with what i fear is a rather more complex question than the three first speakers would lead us to suppose <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think my noble and learned friend indicated whether he was pressing the amendment and wanted me to put the question or wanted to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords the question is that amendment no <e> <s> be agreed to <e> <s> but in spite of what my noble and learned friend has just said i must tell him from the woolsack that if he carries this amendment he cannot propose the next one <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking now not from the woolsack but from my theoretical place in the house provided by statute of henry viii and therefore making no pretence of being impartial perhaps i had better begin by explaining what these two amendments are about <e> <s> the purpose of amendment no <e> <s> is to remove the whole of section of the legal aid act <e> <s> amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the last question of my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale is somewhat bizarre <e> <s> having decided that we were not going to omit subsection altogether my noble and learned friend lord denning says well let us at least leave out paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully accept the rebuke <e> <s> i shall now give an answer the answer which i would have given <e> <s> i think it depends on this <e> <s> as we are given no kind of indication of the circumstances in which a court without guidelines would come to award costs against the legal aid fund on the basis of what is just and equitable i think it would be quite impossible to make an estimate of what the charge on public funds would be <e> <s> it would be equally impossible for me to say and i should have to ask myself this were this amendment passed what other provisions for legal aid criminal or civil i would have to leave out to accommodate this particular amendment <e> <s> we have had the agreement of my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale though not the agreement of my noble and learned friend lord denning as to what to leave out <e> <s> i am really being put in an unfair position <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say before i discuss the merits of the proposal that the legal aid fund is primarily there to provide legal aid and advice to assisted litigants or those seeking legal advice <e> <s> the question is really whether it would be an inappropriate use of that money which is designed to help those who are entitled to legal aid legal advice and legal assistance to provide this network of committees whether or not it is desirable to do so <e> <s> my own provisional view is that it would be <e> <s> i should however like to go back to the beginning <e> <s> the noble and learned lord in proposing the amendment was right in reminding us that in as lord chancellor he gave his approval for the law society to appoint a solicitor employed in the legal aid administration as a liaison officer to promote and co-ordinate legal services in the legal aid area centred on manchester <e> <s> that liaison officer was to act as secretary to the greater manchester legal services committee which had recently been formed with the same aims as a voluntary experiment <e> <s> the lord chancellors department has continued to take a close interest in the work of that committee and i have permitted the continuance of the modest funding of the committee through the legal aid fund on the basis that it was a one-off experiment <e> <s> in so far as the noble and learned lord gave me credit for goodwill which i hope i have <e>", "<cs> my lords we have heard two attractive speeches one on each side <e> <s> on this occasion i think it is a battle between logic and common sense and i come down on the side of common sense on very much the same grounds as my noble and learned friend lord denning has just spoken about <e> <s> i perfectly well agree that at first sight it looks anomalous and in logic it must appear anomalous to select one common law cause of action and say that it shall be outside the scope of the legal aid scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to tell both the noble lord lord foot and the noble lord lord mishcon that in so far as they are relying upon funds provided by the police federation my information is that the money used in connection with the defamation cases referred to is solely the product of members subscriptions <e> <s> if i am right in that the amendment would be wholly useless for the purpose and the only purpose with which they supported the amendment <e> <s> it is true of course and i must say in qualification that the home office provides public funds by way of specific contribution towards the salaries of three officials of that organisation <e> <s> but the money in defamation cases comes from the subscriptions of members and therefore the persons who are defendants in those proceedings however many or however few they may be are not in fact having to face public funds in order to defend the cases <e>", "<cs> my lords i am to blame <e> <s> if my noble and learned friend could just pause with me patiently having put the question i should have called the next amendment which is an amendment to my amendment and which is in the name of the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> i apologise to my noble and learned friend the fault was entirely mine <e> <s> i forgot the procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords the original question was that amendment no <e> <s> should be agreed to <e> <s> my noble friend lord campbell of alloway has now moved amendment no <e> <s> which is an amendment to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the question now therefore which i have to put is that amendment no <e> <s> be agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect two facts are quite certain in this tangled skein <e> <s> the first is that the original amendment and even the original clause which was deleted had nothing to do with criminal cases which stop at the divisional court stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe the correct procedure is for me now to call amendment no <e> <s> which is consequential upon amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that what the noble and learned lord means is that amendment no <e> <s> as an amendment to amendment no <e> <s> is not moved <e>", "<cs> my lords the question is that amendment no <e> <s> be agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i understand my noble friends question <e> <s> i shall however try to deal with it when i deal with the other arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been utterly bemused by some of the speeches to which i have listened because they can only be explained on the basis either that noble lords have not read or that they have not understood amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> anyone listening to this debate would have assumed that amendment no <e> <s> reduces the right of the applicant for leave to apply for judicial review by the removal of something that he already possesses <e> <s> that is contrary to the truth and the most superficial reading of my amendment would tell them that quite plainly <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite see the noble lords question but it is a purely drafting point <e> <s> what it is intended to mean is that the court of appeal may give leave to renew the application and then grant it <e> <s> if there is any point in that it is a purely drafting point <e> <s> the effect of the amendment as proposed is i think perfectly plain <e> <s> it is that you must first go to the judge and if you get leave the case will be heard on its merits if you do not get leave you have the additional right to go to the divisional court <e> <s> i am afraid i must be allowed to say what i intended <e> <s> you go to the divisional court and if leave is granted it is argued on its merits <e> <s> if you do not you renew your application to the court of appeal and if it is granted it is reviewed on its merits <e> <s> that is what the amendment says <e> <s> i think and that is what it means <e> <s> i do not think there is any ambiguity about it at all but if there is i will take it away for that purpose and consider any drafting which may be necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not the present procedure only because i have added a right intermediate between the single judge and the court of appeal <e> <s> that is the only deviation from the present procedure <e> <s> what i think the noble lord has failed to apprehend is that when you go up the chain on an application for leave to apply for a judicial review what you do on each occasion is to ask leave to renew your application and it is either granted or refused <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i can give it some quite favourable consideration on the basis of my letter to the noble lord but only in that sense <e>", "<cs> my lords we discussed what was very much the same amendment at the committee stage <e> <s> when the noble and learned lord first moved this amendment he quoted from the payne report <e> <s> since then that has been overtaken by the cork committees report on insolvency law reform <e> <s> on the specific point of the need to prescribe a list of exempt goods the committee concluded that it would not only be difficult to compile such a list but would entail the trouble and expense of taking detailed inventories <e> <s> the way forward that was adopted is admirably suited to the case of insolvency instead of lists of exempt articles the categories of exemption are broadened the monetary limit of exemption now is dropped and all the exempt goods are made <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see difficulties about this amendment <e> <s> it is quite acceptable that unqualified persons whether they are legal executives or not shoud prepare probate papers under the supervision of a qualified person <e> <s> that is quite acceptable although i do not think that this amendment would be necessary in order to make it acceptable <e> <s> i think it already is <e> <s> however it gets stuck in two respects first it will enable people to take the initial instructions <e> <s> my present view is that the person who takes initial instructions ought to be a qualified person <e> <s> it is not an easy thing to do <e> <s> nor am i satisfied with what my noble and learned friend has said about it nor am i clear in my mind what is meant by taking instructions under supervision <e> <s> i can well understand what is meant by preparing papers under supervision but i cannot quite visualise what actually goes on on the ground if an unqualified person takes the instructions how does he get the supervision <e> <s> if he goes there with the qualified person i should have thought that this amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> if he goes without i do not think he is getting supervision and i think it is objectionable <e> <s> so that is one difficulty that i have <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful both to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones who proposed this amendment and to my noble and learned friend on the cross-benches who made his comment on it <e> <s> i tend broadly to accept the view of my noble and learned friend in preference to that of the noble and learned lord but i should like to add a comment of my own <e> <s> i do not myself see the paradox in the difference in approach between criminal and civil legal aid <e> <s> the whole of criminal legal aid is within the grant or refusal of the court trying the case or committing it to the crown court <e> <s> in the case of the first instance of a committal proceeding or of a summary jurisdiction case it would of course be a lay magistrate or lay magistrates <e> <s> but as a matter of fact they have the fairly well known so-called widgery criteria to go by which involve that legal aid is granted if liberty or reputation is at stake i am speaking from memory or difficult points of law are involved or perhaps the defendant does not understand english very well or does not seem to be able to hear very well or something like that and the lay justice grants legal aid <e> <s> in fact in the crown court and in the court of appeal i think that over per cent <e> <s> of the cases get legal aid and of course there is no very elaborate procedure there for the assessment of means <e> <s> but when <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to confirm that these amendments in their present form are acceptable to the government and are indeed the result of a considerable exchange of correspondence with my department <e> <s> i am very happy to accept them <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the most important thing in the world i beg to move the privilege amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the said bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps we should take the statement first <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords after that unsolicited testimonial i hardly know what to say <e> <s> in the first place i am grateful to the noble and learned lords and the noble lord who have participated in this debate <e> <s> i must make clear to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones something that i think he already knows but i think perhaps i should make it clear for the benefit of those who are less well informed than he is <e> <s> the law centres are not part of the lord chancellors department they are part of the urban programme and therefore come very clearly within another department <e> <s> i do not know how he got round his colleagues but when he was lord chancellor he saved the lives of several law centres but without any statutory authority at all for funding them so far as i know <e> <s> well good luck to him <e> <s> i am a more law-abiding lord chancellor than that but he will at least give me credit for having continued in the iniquity which he performed <e> <s> i did not cut them off in their prime <e>", "<cs> before we get into a worse muddle i think that perhaps i ought to intervene at this stage <e> <s> despite my noble friends very considerable experience in the courts and the powerful support she has received from the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones i must point out exactly where we are going and what this bill is about <e> <s> i tried to get it across on second reading but evidently i made no impact at all in what i was trying to say <e> <s> i shall try once again <e>", "<cs> i should like to try once more because this really goes to the heart of the bill <e> <s> i really must try once more <e> <s> of course i do not deny that under article of the convention of the hague and <e>", "<cs> i must i am afraid try once more <e> <s> the convention provides a method by which the court can require a report <e> <s> that is article <e> <s> the amendment says that the court must in every case require a report <e> <s> that is contrary to the convention <e> <s> there are four other ways in which the convention is breached <e> <s> but really the case is i would have thought plain almost beyond argument that if you want to ratify a convention you must follow the words of the convention and not think of something better for yourself <e>", "<cs> the last thing i would suggest is that the noble and learned lord is engaged in a conspiracy <e> <s> the trouble i believe is that like one of the babes in the wood he is wandering about among the trees and being covered with leaves <e> <s> i give him nonetheless an unequivocal assurance that if the bill is passed i shall have all the powers to perform the duties imposed upon me by the convention without the amendment <e> <s> i think that this is the assurance for which he asks <e>", "<cs> through article <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may answer for my noble and learned friend the lord advocate that sisting means the same as stay but the scots have a learned language of their own in order to keep out the english lawyers <e> <s> i do not know whether anyone else wants to speak about this but i must plead not guilty to being hoist by my own petard <e> <s> i am getting out of being hoist by my own petard as the noble lord lord mishcon suggested i was <e> <s> the object of this elaborate amendment is to put right a mistake in the bill and not to put right a mistake in the convention <e> <s> i realise that the noble lord lord mishcon was really leading up to a leg-pulling exercise based on the previous amendment and i take that in very good part <e>", "<cs> it is a small point <e> <s> i think the answer is no but i will ask those advising me to correct me if i am wrong <e> <s> i very much objected to having to put right what ought to have been in the bill at first but i have done my best and obviously as the defect was brought to my attention i had to put it right <e> <s> i must apologise once more to the committee <e> <s> i will take on board my noble friends point but i will not attempt to answer it off the cuff <e>", "<cs> no it is for you to say the question is that clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> i shall then say not content when the question is put <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord meston raised this question on second reading and my noble and learned friend who is now sitting beside me gave what i thought was a wholly adequate answer to it <e> <s> may i say that i think the noble lord lord meston inadvertently misled the committee when he said that we were not ratifying the whole of the convention <e> <s> we are ratifying the whole of the convention and this bill enables us to do so <e> <s> this is what we are going to do <e> <s> the point between us is really one of draftsmanship <e> <s> my noble and learned friend on second reading at col on th march said in answer to the noble lord lord meston <e>", "<cs> i do not think that my noble friend is making a non-point at all <e> <s> i think that he is raising a difficult point of statutory interpretation precisely because in practice as my noble and learned friend on the cross-benches said in connection with this point a little earlier it is the practice nowadays of our courts to look at international conventions by which we are bound in order to construe our existing statutory law <e> <s> so i do not in the least think my noble friend is making a non-point <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful indeed to the noble lord lord mishcon and what he says will be considered <e> <s> i am very grateful to him for his suggestion <e> <s> i have not the slightest idea what the answer will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the land registration and law of property bill on which i think i owe the house a brief explanation <e> <s> the main object of the bill is to provide certainty and to restrict to a minimum the inquiries which it is necessary to make on the purchase of a house <e> <s> the amendment put down by the noble lord lord mishcon and the noble lord lord foot if passed would defeat the main purpose of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords is it your lordships pleasure that the bill be withdrawn <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to consolidate certain provisions of the housing acts relating to housing associations with amendments to give effect to the recommendations of the law commission and of the scottish law commission <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my

that i have been given an impossible task <e> <s> the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale has raised the whole question of compensation and i limit myself to that matter by which i understand him to mean financial compensation for various misfortunes which can overtake a man a woman or a child during the course of his mortal life <e> <s> it would take me more than the minutes or so that i have available to answer even one of the speeches which has been delivered including that of the noble and learned lord who has just preceded me <e>", "<cs> my lords i should never have thought that it was

this debate and to reply to some of their excellent points <e> <s> it is true that the statute volume for will be greatly enlarged by this legislation if it passes its remaining stages but the number of statutes on the statute book will be comparably reduced by virtue of this consolidation <e> <s> that is a step forward because instead of having to look in many places the practitioner and the subject will be able to look in one place alone namely the statutes <e> <s> the main process of the reduction of the number of statutes on the statute book is the work of the statute law revision committee whose work was begun before my first term of office from the term of lord gardiner onwards <e> <s> the number of statutes on the statute book has contrary to general belief diminished rather than increased <e> <s> i sympathise with the other remarks made by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> i should greatly like to see a simplification of the law indeed a reform of it

<e>", "<cs> my lords changes in the criminal law are essentially matters for the home office <e> <s> i do not therefore think that i can give a ready-made reply <e> <s> personally i think that a great step forward has been taken in bringing into effect section of the criminal justice act which as the noble and learned lord on the opposition front bench will know was something for which i campaigned when i was in opposition <e> <s> that will enable potential defendants at least to know what the prosecution case is <e> <s> i am satisfied that quite a substantial number of <e>", "<cs> well of course my lords the number of remand prisoners will increase with the number of committals though they will not be identical as the majority of prisoners are on bail <e> <s> but as the number of charges rises so the actual arithmetical number of remands will rise <e> <s> the bail act passed through this house by the noble and learned lord puts into effect what i had always advocated that the presumption is in favour of bail <e> <s> in the remaining cases there is legitimate anxiety on the part of the public that offences may continue to be committed if there is a long period between committal and arraignment when prisoners are on bail <e> <s> therefore there is a limit to what can reasonably be done in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with the noble lord that it cannot usefully be explored at question time because it is a matter for debate <e> <s> but a lot of the controversy i believe is unnecessary and due to a misunderstanding of what is really at issue

be put before the parole board <e> <s> but in fact it is made quite often and in the great majority of cases it is meant in order to ensure that the original rape is committed without resistance or without calling for help and does not really involve a serious threat for the future <e> <s> i think myself if i am asked for a personal opinion that the parole board should always be given this information but this is not the view which is universally held and i think the view which i ought to put before the house is the one which is the wisdom of the many which is that the police in

effect of it is to make the long stop provision absolute even in cases where the defendant has deliberately concealed damage from the plaintiff to enable him to raise the defence of limitation <e> <s> the defendant would thus benefit from his own wrong doing by escaping liability to proceedings in negligence <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can respond in very great length to what the noble lord lord hacking has said <e> <s> of course we are all deeply indebted to him for putting forward a view in various forms which members of the constructions industry in particular wish to say in criticism of this bill <e> <s> but the genesis of this bill as he rightly surmises was the <e>", "<cs> no i do not think that is quite right <e> <s> the list i read out were those which backed the -year period

published in some sort of document and so i do not think we need swap names <e> <s> but there is a formidable list of people in support of this bill and what is much more important is that it is really a case i think of this bill or nothing else <e> <s> the law can be left in its present unsatisfactory state otherwise you have to make some sort of balance between potential plaintiffs and potential defendants when the law reform committee has said that the present law does justice to neither <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in any way dissenting from what my noble friend the leader of the house said on th february <e> <s> however i think that the noble lord has momentarily forgotten the provisions of the honours prevention of abuses act which was passed through parliament i believe when my father was attorney-general <e> <s> section of that act reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i did not hear the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the answer <e> <s> it seems to me to be highly unlikely <e> <s> when i was chairman of the conservative party there was a man going about london saying that if anyone was prepared to pay me i would get him a knighthood <e>

a misdemeanour at law <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that would come within the terms of the honours prevention of abuses act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that i should have to water the brandy a bit <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can answer that question but i thought that the question originally asked in february and probably that which was asked by the noble lord lord hatch of lusby referred to the potential use of honours as an inducement <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord wants a definitive answer to the question he has just asked i am afraid that i cannot give it to him now <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to correct one thing that he said <e> <s> it is this <e> <s> he is wrong in thinking that the legal aid regulations have gone on for years <e> <s> they are constrained by rules of which i cannot change <e> <s> what has happened since is that registrars and others who have had to work the system have had to do it without the limits of discretion because the levels are wholly out of date <e> <s> if clause with whatever disadvantages or advantages it may have goes through as i hope it will the discretion element in the taxing master will remain <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that perhaps my noble and learned friend is straying into a discussion of the merits of a case which is <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i have particulars of the other bodies <e> <s> the period of five years was given by my noble and learned friend but my original answer gave the end of or the beginning of as a probable date for the end of the first instance proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not very well briefed in this matter because it is basically a question for the charity commissioners and the general law rather than for her majestys government <e> <s> i may be wrong but i think that the question demands an analysis of what on paper are alleged to be the objects of the foundations in question <e> <s> should it turn out that i have misled the house i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i am responsible originally for the reference to genesis <e> <s> perhaps i may enlighten the noble baroness <e> <s> there is a story in genesis about when jacob led his rather blind old father isaac to believe that he was esau by tying a goats skin on to his hands <e> <s> isaac was slightly puzzled and said the voice is the voice of jacob but the hand is the hand of esau who was a hairy man <e>",

<e> <s> basically it is a drafting amendment and it is based on a false assumption <e> <s> those who were responsible for amendment no <e> <s> have made the false assumption that the effect of the reference in section a of the proposed new clause to any potential plaintiff is to cause the starting date for the provision to run at large against all potential plaintiffs as soon as any potential plaintiff has actual knowledge that he has suffered damage <e> <s> the starting date they say is the earliest date upon which any potential plaintiff has knowledge of the facts referred to in subsections <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill contains two principal proposals <e> <s> one has to do with the principle of discoverability which provides potential plaintiffs with an <e>", "<cs> my lords i have ascertained that the statement has been cleared but from what inquiries i have been able to make the consensus i gather is that we should continue with this amendment until the end of the debate and take the statement afterwards <e> <s> if that is the will of the house and only if it is the will of the house i now say that the question is that amendment no <e> <s> be agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords as to one of the remarks made by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran i heard the noble and learned lord lord wilberforce say that the terms of reference were too narrow <e> <s> however as they took four years on their existing terms of reference i shudder to think what would have happened if those terms had been enlarged <e> <s> i believe that on the whole the noble and learned lord lord scarman was not unduly constrained by those terms of reference <e> <s> indeed he rather says so in the course of his report so i do not think that i need trouble too much with that particular point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am dealing now with amendment no <e> <s> and not with some other amendment that the noble lord has not thought fit to repeat at this stage of the bill <e> <s> i think that that is enough to say in reply <e>", "<cs> my lords before we have the statement does the noble lord lord hacking intend to move amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> they have already been spoken to <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the chorus of approval which has greeted my second reading speech and i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for his kind words <e> <s> he asked me two

the accountant general cannot be anybody other than the permanent head of the lord chancellors department <e> <s> there is a section in some act which says so <e> <s> the object of this bill as regards that is that he shall be joined with the public trustee which would not otherwise be possible unless the permanent head of my department became the public trustee which the noble and learned lord would consider almost unthinkable <e> <s> i may be going to receive enlightenment on this <e>", "<cs> my lords this is in a sense a committee point and i must have heard it debated about or times since when i first entered one or other of these chambers <e> <s> the fact is that the word may confers a power on somebody <e> <s> circumstances may exist and the noble lord will note the use of the auxiliary verb in this case in which the person who has the power to do something has a duty to exercise the power but not in every case <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to consolidate certain enactments relating to the disqualification of persons from being directors of companies and from being otherwise concerned with a companys affairs <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now

reading debate <e> <s> i should be doing the house a disservice if i merely repeated the arguments that i put forward on second reading in committee and on report especially in the light of the two last speeches from the noble and learned lord lord silkin and my noble and learned friend lord denning which summarised in a compendious form the case that i was trying to put <e> <s> it is basically that this is a law reform committee bill <e> <s> it is not as it were a main government programme bill <e> <s> it is based upon the report of the noble and learned lord lord scarman and his friends <e> <s> after four years of deliberation they dealt with the problem which my noble and learned friend on the cross-benches has just adumbrated <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for what he has said <e> <s> i do not think that what is proposed about subordinate legislation is altogether unprecedented <e> <s> it is obviously convenient and slightly unusual and probably this applies on a bigger scale than at any rate has been normally the case either in recent years or before <e> <s> it is convenient because it enables one set of subordinate legislation to be used by reference to the consolidated legislation when it is passed rather than two sets which would be both inconvenient and if the consolidation is passed rapidly unnecessary <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for drawing attention to this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i do just in time <e> <s> if i may have the leave of the house there is no present intention to reconsolidate the companies act <e> <s> the procedure which has happened is the inevitable result of acts which consolidate a very complicated piece of law and which require discussion that is followed by a reconsolidation in order to make it convenient for practitioners to go through the ordinary consolidation procedure <e> <s> i think that that is the position <e> <s> at present i do not think it will be necessary to reconsolidate the companies act <e> <s> so far as it is necessary it will be done under the present exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the second bill standing in my name on the order paper be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords the motion has been put that the house do now again resolve itself into a committee upon the said bill <e> <s> i beg the noble lords pardon i did not see him rise <e>", "<cs> my lords we have to observe the rules of the house and i now have to ask a question from this position two paces to the right of where i was a moment ago <e>", "<cs> my lords that is just what i was going to do <e> <s> does the noble lord wish to withdraw his motion <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene at this point <e> <s> i really think that some degree of reality ought to be brought into this debate <e> <s> every speaker who has supported this amendment so far has wholly misunderstood the current position and the purpose of clause and its effect <e> <s> i know that the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones is aware of how much i respect and like him and my words are not intended in any way to wound but he spoke as i think did three noble lords on second reading as if the taxing authority at the moment can and ought to fix the amount which is allowed on taxation <e> <s> that is wholly wrong <e>", "<cs> let me pursue that point because i think it is worth saying that the supreme court act contains exactly the same provisions <e> <s> it is only one of many acts which does so <e> <s> on second reading the noble and learned lord said oh it has been going on since <e> <s> that is not long enough <e> <s> in fact the same provision verbatim goes back to years <e> <s> so far as i know it has not given rise to one complaint <e> <s> that is not surprising considering that the rule committees are composed as i have said and considering that parliament is in control as i have also said <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord is correct to ask me the direct question and i shall try to anwer it <e> <s> of course the intention is that unlike the present rules any future rules will allow unassisted litigants to have their costs taxed by the taxing master because there will be no prescribed scales for them at all <e> <s> if they choose to employ three counsel let them do so <e> <s> i have no interest in what they charge nor should i have nor have i in relation to any other class of work <e>", "<cs> sound <e>", "<cs> i should like to detain the committee for a couple of sentences

members are <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed flattered to be compared to elijah <e> <s> i seem to think that the noble lord lord mishcon was aiming even higher when he compared his own voice to a still small voice <e> <s> i would not aim so high myself <e> <s> i am completely unconverted but i thought i would bow for peace and quiet <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on re-commitment on this bill <e>", "<cs> i raised exactly the same point when i first saw this amendment and was assured that it was all in order <e> <s> but i cannot really go into the technicalities of it because i do not understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of re-commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to notify the house in accordance with the royal assent act that the queen has signified her royal assent to the following acts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble and learned lord who has been this way before <e>", "<cs> i certainly would <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord reflects for a moment that if he borrowed money on the security of a house he would lose the house and his money if things went wrong he might come to a rather less superficial view <e>", "<cs> i heard very clearly what the noble lord was saying <e> <s> what he did not reflect upon was what would happen to him if he entered into an unwise mortgage and failed to keep up his instalments <e> <s> the number of repossessions is rather high this year <e>", "<cs> in the light of the noble lords reference to my difficulties which have been acute because of the date on which the debate takes place i thank him for giving way <e> <s> once the terms of the loan are agreed and the terms of the mortgage drawn up the interests of the purchaser and of the proposed mortgagee are identical <e> <s> at that stage they are concerned only with whether the vendor of the house <e>", "<cs> at this hour i do not think we should wholly neglect the fact that what we are discussing is whether clause shall stand part of the bill and nothing else <e> <s> of course it is clear that from the start the bill has contained provisions of importance to solicitors and other institutions which include building societies and other corporate entities such as banks and possibly estate agents <e> <s> the provisions raise questions of principle but the policy of the bill has always been to allow such institutions to provide conveyancing services as defined but subject to conditions <e> <s> what is at issue here is the balance between competition though i hate to use the word and in this context i would rather use a phrase such as facilities available to the public than competition which is so agreeable to others and the protection of consumers <e> <s> it seems to me that what we have to defend is the protection of consumers in relation to the policy of the bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond to what my noble friend lord morris has said without seeking in any way to anticipate what we shall be saying on the amendments of the noble lord lord foot <e> <s> i think my noble friend made a false comparison when he compared the new profession which was stage two of the governments policy the licensed conveyancers with this kind of provision <e> <s> the licensed conveyancers are necessarily small bodies of individual people rather comparable and perhaps in competition with the solicitors practices <e> <s> it is an essential part of the architecture of the licensed conveyancers apparatus as recommended by the farrand committee that as the council of the law society is in charge of solicitors the council in charge of licensed conveyancers should lay down the guide rules for their performance and qualifications <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord foot for the way in which he has moved this long series of detailed amendments <e> <s> i may say at once that i am perfectly sure that the course he has taken which is in a sense paradoxical is absolutely the right course that is to speak to all the amendments together <e> <s> that obviously places me in a difficult position but it is a position in which the noble lord was perfectly justified in putting me i make no complaint about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> and which are drafting amendments <e> <s> in this house the noble lord lord hacking on the cross-benches and in another place mr alex carlile expressed doubts about the meaning of the words potential plaintiff in the clause to which the amendments relate <e> <s> i promised to consult the draftsman <e> <s> i did consult the draftsman and the law society and the amendments are the result <e>", "<cs> my lords unfortunately i have only a typescript of the amendments <e> <s> the amendment as it appears in the typescript reads <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord is wrong for once but he can get wisdom from the noble lord immediately behind him <e> <s> i have read out what the amendment is intended to be and i think that it corresponds with the printed words <e> <s> so far as concerns the other matters they hardly arise on the amendments and so i cannot say anything more about them <e> <s> the opposition supported the amendments in the commons and in this house through the noble and learned lord lord silkin <e> <s> the law society and the noble and learned lord lord scarman also had the benefit of consulting the draftsman <e> <s> i

set forth in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the concise and friendly way in which the noble lord lord foot moved the amendment and also for the following speeches <e> <s> i must however point out one fundamental fact that all speakers have failed to understand <e> <s> of course it is true that the object of the clauses to which reference has been made is to increase the <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not intend to pass strictures on either my political friend on the conservative benches or my noble and learned friend on the cross-benches <e> <s> certainly no strictures were intended <e> <s> yes i have paid full attention to that <e> <s> but i was pointing out that the object and structure of the scheme was such as to render the policy proposed by the amendment inappropriate <e> <s> i think that this point has been taken by the house <e> <s> i was pointing out that the employees who will do the work are already bound and the employers being multi-million corporations in many cases although some of them as my noble friend lord coleraine said need not be in theory are subject to a different discipline and the public requires against them a different kind of protection from that which is contemplated by the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend could hardly have put better the point that i have already made to the labour front bench on the labour amendment <e> <s> i absolutely agree with him but i hope that the bill will meet his point <e> <s> i said at greater length but less well what he has said when i was answering the noble lord lord jacques and one of the proponents of the labour amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that the office was very efficiently and economically administered <e> <s> unfortunately it was underused by the welsh people <e> <s> they called there hardly at all <e> <s> they made their applications by post <e> <s> so the case on that ground is not as strong as the noble and learned lord would lead one to think

very eminent persons have written to me about it but i have never seen any wide outburst of feeling and i do not believe that it exists <e>", "<cs> my lords mr roderic bowen who retired i believe some time around the end of march ended his career with universal approval from everyone who knew him both inside and outside the profession <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had made clear that the oral hearings will take place as before <e> <s> therefore the oral hearings of claims are not in question in this matter <e> <s> what is in question is the use of accommodation when most of the applications are made by post with only the occasional personal visit <e> <s> we are not talking about the oral hearings which will go on <e>", "<cs> my lords the advantage of a welsh-speaking commissioner is well appreciated and there is and will be one <e> <s> as i have said the oral hearings will go on as before <e>", "<cs> my lords no i do not believe that the noble lord has got it

am grateful to those noble lords who have played a part in this debate <e> <s> i must tell the noble lord lord hutchinson and also with respect the noble and learned lord on the opposition front bench that in the view which certainly i have formed and the government have formed the amendment involves a serious constitutional solecism <e> <s> the bill as it stands without the amendment already achieves the purpose which if i understand him correctly the noble lord lord hutchinson desires to achieve but without committing that solecism <e>", "<cs> i do not need to have not sat down in order to reply to that point because we are in committee <e> <s> i start by explaining that because i shall have to repeat some part of what i have said <e> <s> the second and what the noble lord describes

review in the three sets of circumstance which i sought to summarise from lord diplocks judgment <e>", "<cs> out of courtesy i should have said to the noble lord lord monson that i did not deal with

disabled magistrates are in service and perform their duties to general satisfaction <e> <s> as regards the building of new courts as the noble and learned lord is well aware i am not departmentally responsible for them but i am assured that the local authorities which are take into account the needs to which he has referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that that is more a question of opinion than of fact <e>", "<cs> my lords disability takes many forms and is of many degrees <e> <s> the difficulty with the physically disabled is that magistrates courts have rather elderly and archaic buildings which are not well suited to disabled people <e> <s> that is a matter which can be remedied only by a good deal of effort in individual cases over a period of time <e> <s> i am assured that in those cases the needs of the disabled are remembered and that where one can one makes alterations wherever one can the needs of disabled people are considered <e> <s> even where the courts are unsuitable

its report make it much easier for a lord chancellor to persuade his colleagues to give up valuable government time to it <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has probably had as much difficulty as i have in securing a niche for law reform which seldom has much sex appeal about it in the governments programme and in the queens speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this is the third measure of law reform that i have introduced since the beginning of the session <e> <s> since the bill applies to the whole of the united kingdom including northern ireland and contains a provision by which it may be extended to the isle of man any of the channel islands or any colony my noble and learned friend the lord advocate will wind up what i hope may be a short debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the right reverend prelate and to all noble lords who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> i am also grateful for the general welcome which i think i can claim the bill has now received <e> <s> i noted what the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones said and what the right reverend prelate said about wales <e> <s> i love the english but i have hardly a drop of english blood in my veins and only one great grandmother out of all my great-grandparents could claim to be english <e> <s> my loyalties and culture are english but i have always thought the english rather funny <e> <s> i have thought that one reason that they are rather funny is that despite what was said by the noble and learned lord on the cross benches in the main the english think that brains are wicked and that the stupid are good <e> <s> this i regard as an amusing heresy which i do not altogether share <e>", "<cs> will the committee forgive me <e> <s> i was slightly startled by the brief speech of my noble and learned friend on the cross-benches <e> <s> i am rather tied up in white tape <e>", "<cs> with those powerful words from the other side of the house in my favour i must tell my noble and learned friend and my noble friend that i am very reluctant to think about this matter again not because i disagree with every word that they have said because i do not but because in this instance the matter is not worth discussing at great length <e>", "<cs> i agree with one matter in what has taken place that i ought to speak to both this amendment and the next which are aiming at the same target but missing it both times <e> <s> at first sight both these amendments appear absolutely reasonable <e> <s> however there is more in this than quite meets the eye at first <e> <s> i should like to begin by repeating what i said in answer to the previous amendment namely that these words of the bill were considered by the law commission more minutely than almost any others and far more minutely than usual <e>", "<cs> as no one else seems too anxious to embark on this discussion perhaps it is my turn <e> <s> this amendment suffers from one defect <e> <s> it first appeared upon my desk after i had left the cabinet at oclock today <e> <s> i should have liked a little more time to consider it <e> <s> there were criticisms on second reading of the wording of this clause as being difficult to understand <e> <s> both before and after my noble and <e>", "<cs> this amendment also fell upon my desk after i had left the cabinet at oclock today <e> <s> i inquired of parliamentary counsel and this time i think that he is definitely cleverer than any of the noble and noble and learned lords who have so far participated in the debate <e> <s> i am a very old man now and i learn more about the facts of life every day in connection with this bill and in connection with other matters which i read in the newspapers <e> <s> the noble lord lord kilbracken my noble friend and my noble and learned friend are guilty of a scientific error <e> <s> i learned to my surprise that the period which elapses between the act of intercourse and the resultant conception can amount to or even hours <e>", "<cs> i should like time to consider that question <e>", "<cs> i suppose that the right reverend prelate is like me always learning <e> <s> it was solon was it not <e> <s> the right reverend prelate will correct me who wrote in a poem <e>", "<cs> i should like to say to my noble friend whose expertise on the form and content of statute is i think unrivalled in this house and therefore what i say is not intended by way of criticism in the least that it so happens that a number of noble and learned friends and i were listening to an appeal upstairs less than six months ago and we had to consider an act of parliament of which had its conception if i may borrow the word in a law commission report <e>", "<cs> we briefly adverted to this question on second reading when i had the pleasure of acknowledging the extremely helpful speech given by the noble and learned lord lord silkin of dulwich in support of the principles of the bill <e> <s> for reasons which he courteously explained to me he was unable to hear my comments because he had a long-standing engagement elsewhere <e>", "<cs> i think that among these amendments examples of all three probably could be found but i will make inquiries <e>", "<cs> i must look at it first <e>", "<cs> yes i understand that it is <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon adumbrated this discussion on second reading <e> <s> the question for decision by your lordships is a simple one <e> <s> is the bill to incorporate a provision recommended by the law commission in as the noble lord lord mishcon wearing his hat i fear as the spokesman for the law society but helped by his noble and learned friend lord silkin wearing his hat as a member of the opposition front bench urges or is it to take the form recommended by the law commission three months ago <e>", "<cs> to deal first with the observations of the noble and learned lord lord silkin yes the court already has inherent power to deal with cases where the rights of a minor are abused and they are considered to be adequate <e>", "<cs> with great humility i must again put the noble lord lord kilbracken right on science <e> <s> the noble lord quite candidly explained that the thinking behind his amendment was that the mother of an illegitimate child will never be in doubt except when two babies are mixed up in hospital <e> <s> this is wrong although it is likely that paternity will more often be in issue <e> <s> if the noble lord will look further up the page to new subsection <e>", "<cs> the noble lord seems to have forgotten the case of moses in the bullrushes <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether it was the intention i thought not from the noble lords speech but the effect of the amendment eliminates the idea that the parentage of a person can be determined in legal proceedings <e> <s> but if that were the intention and i gather it was not it would be wrong <e> <s> where the noble lord is certainly wrong is in thinking that the government are not fully aware of the relatively new techniques which enable paternity to be proved if not quite beyond doubt at any rate almost beyond doubt <e>", "<cs> as i explained in my answer to the noble lord on his last amendment the clause as drafted indeed contemplates the use of blood tests which ascertain that a party to the proceedings is or is not the father or mother of the person whose parentage is being determined and the wording of the bill is therefore entirely appropriate as it stands <e>", "<cs> i am glad to see that the noble lord lord meston is back in the chamber and i hope he won his case <e> <s> at any rate he has put his finger on one point <e> <s> however the amendment will allow tests to be ordered only from the person whose parentage is in issue the mother and the putative father <e> <s> quite apart from the point that the very question at issue may be whether a particular person is the mother of the person whose parentage is at issue it would be wrong to limit in this way the persons from whom blood tests can be ordered <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly bear that in mind but i shall need time to take advice on it <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry but i did not hear the vital word in the question of my noble and learned friend <e> <s> will he say it again <e>", "<cs> i will first of all read it in <e>", "<cs> i shall not need to ask my solicitor about that <e>", "<cs> i hestitate to intervene in these great matters but there are one or two things i must say <e> <s> first referring briefly to what has just fallen from my noble kinsman on the cross-benches i should say that neither of the amendments would achieve its purpose <e> <s> i explained on second reading that the bill was without prejudice to the more detailed recommendation of the warnock committee to which the noble and learned lord on the cross-benches referred <e> <s> the one thing these amendments would not do is to tell a child its true genetic parentage <e> <s> they would simply say that a particular method was used or may have been used to engender him <e> <s> that simply will not do <e>", "<cs> i am rather surprised at my noble and learned friend <e> <s> he is suggesting in the amendment that if a child is engendered by donation it should be mandatory to have that stated on the birth certificate <e> <s> if that happens it would not go on <e> <s> what my noble and learned friend has said would have been germane and i shall deal with it on that basis on the motion whether the clause shall stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> that may be but we are discussing the amendment <e> <s> i was saying quite frankly to my noble and learned friend that first it is not germane to the amendment which would make it mandatory to insert this particular phrase <e> <s> if my noble and learned freind is speaking to the motion that the clause stand part albeit at an inappropriate time but still he is entitled with the freedom of the committee to do so all i am saying is that he is encouraging perjury and in that respect i am against him <e> <s> i do not encourage perjury <e> <s> if the clause is passed in its present form it will not be perjury <e>", "<cs> i must say to the noble baroness that when i said that this was not a religious matter i meant exactly what i said <e> <s> it is not compulsory on a member of any religion to indulge in this particular practice of engendering children <e> <s> they can follow their own religion in this free country and i would respect them for doing so <e> <s> but what is sought to be said is that those who do should be given the rights that this clause gives them and that is not a religious matter it is a matter for the secular law <e>", "<cs> i am astonished to hear that argument <e> <s> the previous clause we discussed was a clause about an application by a child to ascertain its true parentage <e> <s> what is the noble lord on the cross-benches suggesting <e> <s> that they should be compulsory in such cases <e> <s> i should like to know because i should regard that as a gross infringement of personal liberty <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend has misunderstood what the warnock committee said <e> <s> this clause embodies the main recommendation of the warnock report <e> <s> the main recommendation was that the status of aid children where the husband consents should be legitimised <e> <s> that is what it said and that is where i stood <e>", "<cs> i cannot let it be said that i am against the status of marriage or that others who oppose this amendment are against the status of marriage <e> <s> let me state plainly <e> <s> if anybody thinks i am a prude i am willing to be called a prude but i am not prepared for it to be said

that it will not be thought that i am in any way unsympathetic to anything that fell from my noble and learned friend on the cross-benches if i say that i hope that he will not pursue this amendment in connection with illegitimacy <e> <s> a general rule of the interpretation of statutes <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendment has been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord has misunderstood two points <e> <s> in the first place this relates to peerages called out of abeyance where her majesty has a discretion and in the second place far from being novel it has been copied from the original resolution which is under amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it would take me a rather long time <e> <s> there are a few peerages in the english peerage and i dare say in the scottish peerage too which are held in what is called coparcenary <e> <s> that is a technical term of medieval land law <e> <s> it arises for instance in baronies by writ of which there are still a few <e> <s> if there are male heirs the peerage descends in the ordinary way from the last holder of the peerage to the oldest son or oldest male heir but if there are no male heirs but a number of female heirs it is held in what is called coparcenary <e> <s> the peerage then goes into what is called abeyance until there is only one person left of all <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble and learned lord for having introduced theology into the argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i must have misunderstood the purpose of the noble lords question <e> <s> i had not regarded it as a reference to collective responsibility in which case it would have been a constitutional solecism <e> <s> i regarded it as a rather clumsy attempt at a personal smear <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two points <e> <s> first i was not a member of the cabinet until january <e> <s> secondly the question relates to those records which have been published and not to those which have not been published <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is for me to answer the question <e>", "<cs> my lords as the house will

interest did not arise <e> <s> there have been files to which the usual criteria were applied but in any case in which my own actions were in question i made quite certain that the decision would be taken on the advice of an impartial third authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i was given no advance notice of this matter <e> <s> i am instructed and believe that the amendment to which i am speaking does not alter the sense of the bill as it stands <e> <s> i will look into what the noble lord said and see the draftsmans comments on it <e> <s> that is the best i can do in the circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say that i am rather puzzled but i will do as i promised to do <e>", "<cs> my lords if noble lords have all quite finished i shall do my best to deal with the points that have been raised <e> <s> first i was going to deal with the rather complicated point raised by my noble friend lord campbell of alloway when we came to amendment no <e> <s> when i hope to give him and possibly even the noble lord lord kilbracken satisfaction <e> <s> i was going to say if the house will permit me to do so that there is now a defect in clause <e> <s> if when he comes to move amendment no <e>

noble and learned friend with his special experience is almost certainly right but i referred to the possibility of hours again a moment ago <e> <s> i was pointing out that there is not only a maximum period after the act of intercourse there is also a minimum period <e> <s> this was what rendered the prospective amendment no <e> <s> an unsuitable vehicle for changing the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords

guinness <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i will consider everything that has been said so learnedly from whatever quarter <e> <s> i think we are in danger of muddling ourselves <e> <s> we must start with the proposition that the very largest majority of children are born as a result of an ordinary act of sexual intercourse between a man and a woman done in the old-fashioned way <e> <s> the very elaborate suppositions of the noble lord lord kilbracken and even those of my noble friend lord campbell of alloway are the exception rather than the rule <e> <s> some of them are extremely unlikely to occur at all <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may obtain the leave of the house to say just a word it was very largely for the kind of reason that the noble lord lord mishcon gave that i suggested that we had better do what my noble and learned friend has suggested we should do that is leave the thing as far as possible in my rather ignorant hands <e> <s> my hands may be ignorant but i have available very good advice which i shall take <e> <s> i think that would be best <e> <s> one has to remember the sort of practical question which the noble lord lord mishcon put forward <e> <s> how is one to verify these facts <e> <s> in the end they would have to be verified by the courts and when anything has to be verified by the courts there is the prospect of litigation <e> <s> the definition which we have accepted in amendment no <e> <s> at least makes things rather easier for those who come after us and i hope we shall stick to it <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose and effect of this amendment are mainly drafting but it is totally unnecessary <e> <s> section of the act interpretation to which the noble lord has drawn attention is amended by paragraph of schedule of the present bill so that it is made clear in the act itself that references in that act to the parents of a child being or not being married to each other at the time of his birth shall be construed in accordance with clause of this bill if it becomes law <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords <e> <s> the addition of the words or was in the amendment is of course an improvement but it is carried into effect also and alternatively by my amendments nos <e> <s> to in the appropriate places <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall consider what has been said but i am not wholly convinced by all this <e>

<e> <s> i have already unequivocally said that i shall consider it but i do think that at report stage we had better get on <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that <e>", "<cs> my lords before i call amendment no <e> <s> perhaps it would be convenient for the noble lord lord kilbracken if i tell him in advance that i intend to accept his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i make no apology for trying to save the time of the house by telling the noble lord in advance that he is pushing at an open door <e> <s> the reason why i would ask him to consider withdrawing the amendment is that it does not go far enough <e> <s> he is perfectly right in saying that his amendment has revealed a lacuna in clause but it does not go far enough because it will not cover bodily fluids such as saliva or semen <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with every word which has fallen from the noble and learned lord on the front bench of the opposition <e> <s> i believe we are all agreed that the court should only be empowered to give directions as to the taking of blood samples from persons party to the proceedings for the reason given by the noble lord lord meston that it is an intrusion to take blood samples

of the present amendment of the noble lord lord kilbracken which i thought we had discussed fairly fully in committee is in fact to rule out parties to the proceedings either the applicant or others

only saw rather late <e> <s> on the first point a person cannot be described as the father of the child until the proceedings are at an end <e> <s> therefore to call him the father of the child in advance is to beg the question which the proceedings are about <e> <s> in fact in new section of the births and deaths registration act which this clause intends to insert in that act the words that

<e> <s> well he would know in exactly the same way as the magistrate at bow street would know because the magistrate at bow street is not to decide the case <e> <s> he is not there to try the case <e>

circumstances and he might well feel that the representations were sufficiently strong for him in the exercise of his discretion because he has no duty to order extradition not to allow this person to be extradited <e>", "<cs> my lords i am perfectly prepared to give an undertaking to the house that we shall look again at the precise wording of clause m in order to ensure that it has only the

consent to a person who has been extradited being tried in the foreign country on another charge than that in respect of which his extradition has proceeded <e> <s> a similar provision is a feature of the fugitive offenders act as presently in force and it has been a feature of our arrangements with the commonwealth for some years <e> <s> when these matters were under review the possibility of making this change to our foreign extradition provisions was set out plainly in the green paper on extradition <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps your lordships will allow me to say that i shall copy to the noble lord lord hutchinson any correspondence that we may have on that particular question <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may attempt to deal with that when i deal with the questions raised by the noble lord lord harris of greenwich <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that it is of value for me to go over the ground that was covered in committee on this point and the matter does not really arise under the european convention <e> <s> it is in the united states that the problem has arisen and it arises from the federal nature of the united states <e> <s> as i understand the position the federation the united states is the requesting state for extradition and is not able according to our information to give an undertaking that the state concerned will in fact not carry out the death penalty on someone extradited and facing a capital charge <e>", "<cs> my lords no one knows more about these matters than the noble lord lord harris of greenwich learned as he is with his experience at the home office <e> <s> his remarks and those of other noble lords who have spoken will be taken into consideration by my right honourable friend <e> <s> this has been before my right honourable friend on a number of occasions as the noble lord lord harris of greenwich said <e> <s> certainly until now we have not been able to find an answer but we are not giving up <e> <s> if the assurance that we will continue to look for a solution is acceptable no doubt the noble lord will feel able to act accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to notify the house in accordance with the royal assent act that the queen has signified her royal assent to the following acts <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave of the house i am not in a position at this moment to indicate exactly how this might best be attempted <e> <s> the law commission is an obvious candidate for carrying out such a review <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mishcon well knows there is also in existence the criminal law revision committee which has considered this matter <e> <s> the best form in which this issue might be taken forward is a matter upon which the government have not been able to reach any decision <e> <s> this afternoon i am not able to say precisely what ought to be done <e> <s> i submit that something ought to be done before the amendment would be regarded as right to pass <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perhaps an interesting comment on the difficulty in this area of the law that in support of the last amendment some noble lords argued in favour of giving a very wide discretion indeed to judges when passing sentence ranging from small sentences up to life imprisonment in cases of murder whereas when parliament gave a discretion to the judges whether or not to declare a minimum period a degree of uncertainty arose about the uniformity with which the judges exercised that discretion <e> <s> that is illustrative of the difficulty in this area <e> <s> but i do not press the point further than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i intended to try to deal with that point <e> <s> i agree that the development of the practice of correspondence which has been necessary between the trial judge and the secretary of state right from and which as one would expect has been entirely accurately described by my noble friend lord windlesham is a circumstance which might well change the situation <e> <s> certainly for my part i should have been glad to hear the views of experienced judges upon the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment which seeks to give a right of appeal in respect of the minimum recommendation obviously has something to be said for it as my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter observed <e> <s> however there is the problem that this minimum recommendation is entirely discretionary <e> <s> the right of appeal here in question does nothing therefore in relation to those cases in which there is no minimum recommendation <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak for the committee since i was its chairman until recently <e> <s> i am sure that the gratitude of noble lords is much appreciated <e> <s> i see that my immediate predecessor as chairman of the committee the noble and learned lord lord brightman is in his place <e> <s> i am sure he is equally grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that my noble and learned friend is disappointed with our very open approach to the question <e> <s> i am aware of what was said by mr justice hirst and i am also aware of the difficulties which exist in that area of the law <e> <s> the reform which was introduced by way of a provisional award of damages is a step in the direction that the noble and learned lord wishes us to take <e> <s> the pearson report has been considered <e> <s> the subject is large i am not sure whether the noble and learned lord wishes me to go into the detail of the report this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree that the present situation is properly equated to a lottery it is generally based on fault which is a matter of principle <e> <s> it is possible to think of other bases for compensation <e> <s> however every basis has its own difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear that all noble lords agree that if irreversible brain damage can be prevented that is better than any system for awarding compensation following such damage <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of no-fault compensation has been the subject of a number of considerations <e> <s> it is presently the subject of consideration by the department of health and social security in conjunction with the british medical association <e> <s> i understand that the association has requested discussions with the department about a possible pilot scheme <e> <s> however i am not certain that it would be right to link that matter with the white paper on primary health care <e>", "<cs> my lords the house as the noble and learned lord lord ackner has said has to some extent already discussed this matter <e> <s> with regard to the principle on report the house decided on the basic form that extradition proceedings should take assuming that the bill becomes law in situations where the government consider that the law and legal system operating in some other country are ones in which sufficient confidence can repose to enable such an arrangement to go ahead <e> <s> as we have heard it is not easy to be sure that we are getting the precise detail absolutely right <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of going for second best i must say that if the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the undertaking that i have given is carefully to consider this matter <e> <s> there are difficulties which i did not feel it necessary to enter into but which i can elaborate <e> <s> one must remember that this is a stage <e> <s> assuming that the extradition goes ahead in a criminal process which will carry on in another place and therefore there are serious questions about how far it is proper to go in an intermediate stage where one might prejudice the accused <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for making that clear <e> <s> i am glad that we were able to meet his concern <e>", "<cs> my lords when i spoke in relation to amendment no <e> <s> i intended also to cover this amendment <e> <s> perhaps your lordships will remember <e> <s> i think amendment no <e> <s> was in essence part of the same philosophy that some form of reason should be given with a certain amount of basic material to support it <e> <s> my position as regards this amendment is the same as it was in relation to amendment no <e> <s> namely that i undertake on behalf of the government that it will be given sympathetic consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords much as i like the elegant phraseology of the noble and learned lord on this occasion i prefer my own which is that i undertake that my right honourable friend will give the amendment sympathetic consideration <e> <s> if he is persuaded that it is possible to amend the bill to advance the matter in an appropriate way then he will propose such an amendment in the other place and i shall inform noble lords who have taken part in the debate by letter of the result of that consideration when he arrives at it <e> <s> but i am not in a position to commit him at this stage to the principle of the amendment and i think that is perhaps what the noble and learned lord is seeking to push me to do <e> <s> i am not prepared to go to that length <e> <s> i am prepared to say that my right honourable friend will give sympathetic consideration to this amendment in the light of all that has fallen from your lordships and his further consideration of it and if he is persuaded in the light of all that that some amendment on these lines is appropriate he will endeavour to bring that forward in the other place <e>", "<cs> as i understand the noble and learned lord there is no point of principle between the government and himself <e> <s> i had i must say understood at one stage that there was a desire on his part to remove the option to a person who wanted to go away immediately but i understand from his statement that that is not so <e> <s> i noted carefully his submission and i must say with great respect that it seems to me there is some substance in the point <e> <s> we shall certainly have that looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords when we proposed amendments on report there was reference to a subsection which now appears as subsection <e> <s> that in itself perhaps has some significance <e> <s> at an earlier stage it came under the heading m <e> <s> it was criticised by a number of noble lords including the noble and learned lords lord denning and lord ackner my noble friend lord campbell of alloway and the noble lords lord mishcon and lord irvine of lairg <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the general position is that the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may respond to that <e> <s> that is an option which my right honourable friend the secretary of state will have very much in mind as a possibility <e>", "<cs> my lords in these amendments we are in a very difficult area <e> <s> when parliament decided to substitute the mandatory life sentence for the previous sentence in respect of murder it put the responsibility on the home secretary to decide how long a person should serve before he was released and on the home secretary that decision still rests <e> <s> it is his responsibility to take the decision <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend is very much concerned to see that a just system prevails <e> <s> i undertake to bring to his attention all that has been said today including the suggestion by my noble friend lord windlesham of a select committee to examine the position which i shall also bring to the attention of the leader of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that

i regard as an extremely important bill <e> <s> i am grateful to all noble and noble and learned lords who have taken part and who have expressed their views <e> <s> i assure the house that those views will be very much taken into consideration <e>", "<cs> at the moment i am not quite clear about how the matter might otherwise be arranged <e> <s> one would need to know to some extent how people were prepared to react to the possibility of taking on this work by some form of tender <e> <s> i do not think that the matter is the subject of expressed provision and if the noble and learned lord has some other method in mind i would certainly be very interested to hear about it as we get into committee <e>", "<cs> the government support this amendment moved by the noble and learned lord

fair to the noble and learned lord lord templeman to say that he had the assistance of parliamentary draftsmen in the preparation of these amendments <e> <s> no doubt he would like parliamentary draftsmen to have an opportunity of reconsidering the position in the light of the noble and learned lords comments <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support amendment no <e> <s> and

for producing the valuable report upon which the bill is based <e> <s> the consideration which has gone into the formulation of the bill is typical of the thoroughness with which the law commission addresses its task and i therefore feel that the solution which it has proposed is probably wise in the circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly true that the statute law committee consists of very eminent people <e> <s> at the present it supervises the work of the statutory publications office and the production of statutes in force <e> <s> it receives reports from the law commission

consider the technical aspects of printing statutory material and the creation of a database of legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the reason for scrutiny of delegated legislation is that the attention of parliament is not devoted to delegated legislation in quite the way it is to primary legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are aware of the difficulties and that is why the

say that as it was being explained to us by the various persons who have appended their names to it i was not absolutely certain that all had precisely the same idea of what the amendment would achieve <e>", "<cs> the amendment incorporates the definitions of advice assistance and representation not the conditions under which they may be available <e> <s> the subsection to which the noble lord has just referred may be part of the definition but regulations will determine the conditions under which legal aid in the shape of advice assistance and representation will be available <e> <s> therefore with great respect to the noble lord his point is not well taken in this situation <e> <s> if a general duty of the kind that is here described is to be imposed on the lord chancellor it would have to deal with this aspect of the matter and deal with it precisely <e>", "<cs> just before my noble friend replies perhaps i may say to my noble and learned friend lord ackner that that comes not from a statutory provision but from a response <e> <s> it may well provide material from which provision for a statutory purpose could be built <e> <s> i doubt very much whether it would be adequate as stated for that purpose <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i particularly understand what the noble and learned lord is asking <e> <s> if i can devise a suitable statement of purpose with help such as i have available to me then i would have in mind if it were ready in time for the report stage to put it down as a proposed amendment as part of the proceedings for the report stage <e> <s> if perchance i was to have it ready very early and there was an opportunity to consider it before the report stage i would certainly be happy to let your lordships have it <e> <s> but i do not think that the prospect of that is sufficiently great for me to offer it especially at this stage <e>", "<cs> i am grateful that the precise aim of the amendment has been made clear <e> <s> my noble friend has made it clear <e> <s> therefore i shall endeavour to produce with assistance to which i have already referred a statement in the simplest terms that we can devise which i hope will be comprehensible of the purpose of the bill <e> <s> at the moment i do not go beyond that <e> <s> i shall have a try at <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord meston has just said i indicated at second reading the sort of search i would have in mind in trying to get people for the board <e> <s> as many members of the <e>", "<cs> the problem of securing the right people to be members of the legal aid board is not altogether an easy one <e> <s> in response to the earlier amendment i sought to indicate the kind of legal aid board that i have in mind <e> <s> i understood from the reaction from all sides of the committee that generally speaking noble lords were in agreement with that <e>", "<cs> there is no question of people being invited to carry out this work free <e> <s> they will receive remuneration on a stated basis but as the noble and learned lord knows there are different levels of remuneration according to the different work that people may be doing <e> <s> i need not go into the detail of that just now <e> <s> no doubt we shall hear more about that later and we have perhaps read something about it recently as well <e> <s> all i need to say in answer to the noble and learned lord is that it is anticipated that members of the board will be paid for the work they do <e>", "<cs> this is a changing situation <e> <s> we have correspondence with the bar and have not yet received a reply <e> <s> this is an interim stage and i should not like to prejudice any hope of securing suitable members of the bar <e> <s> however if we can achieve it we certainly shall <e>", "<cs> i should like to say how much i appreciate the work of the law society in administering this scheme <e> <s> i am sure that that is true of those who have been my predecessors since the legal aid scheme was introduced and those noble and learned lords who are here have indicated so to me <e> <s> it has been a great service to the nation and the legal aid board when established will have a great deal to learn from the society <e> <s> i am sure that the experience gained over the past years will be immensely valuable <e>", "<cs> the invitation of the noble lord is very enticing but i have considered this fairly carefully and i do not feel able to depart from the suggestion that the bill should be left as it stands as an acknowledgement of the position <e> <s> of course as i pointed out the bill says at least two and we are in no way bound to restrict it to that <e> <s> i feel that the provision of at least two is sufficient and i am not in favour of increasing the number to three on the information and consideration which i have been able to give to this matter <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones for what he has said and also to the other noble and learned lords who have spoken namely my noble and learned friends lord hailsham lord ackner and lord simon of glaisdale <e>", "<cs> i am not absolutely certain that i understand precisely the amendment which the noble and learned lord is proposing <e> <s> if i am not mistaken there is more than one different in line <e> <s> i am not sure whether it is the first or the second one from which he means to start the deletion <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> we are including the provision which he seeks to probe because we think that it may be wise to retain flexibility in this matter the social conditions and conditions in which legal advice is sought may be different in different parts of england and wales <e> <s> we fear that unless it is made plain that different arrangements could be made in various parts of the country to take account of those differences it may be held to be illegal to make such differentiation <e>", "<cs> i think it is fairly easy to see that in some situations a particular kind of arrangement for the provision of services would be appropriate whereas in another part of the country where perhaps that particular type of service is remote some other form of arrangement would be appropriate <e> <s> i do not think that i want to speculate too much on what might give rise to this power but it does seem a suitable power to include <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> clause of the bill sets out the general functions of the new legal aid board <e> <s> they are to secure that advice assistance and representation are available in accordance with the bill and to administer the bill when enacted <e> <s> in the white paper announcing the establishment of the board the government made clear that they saw the board as initially taking over no more than the functions currently performed by the law society <e> <s> in time however the board might take on further functions <e> <s> the power to do this is set out in clause which we discussed in relation to the regulation-making power <e> <s> all of these functions both initial and future relate to the operation of the legal aid scheme <e> <s> i regard this as vitally important <e> <s> the main source of legal advice and legal aid is and will remain the independent legal profession and as such the priorities must be for the board to concentrate on improving the operation and administration of the legal aid scheme <e>", "<cs> my responsibility so far as i am seeking to discharge it at the moment is in relation to legal aid <e> <s> these agencies may well have something to contribute in the area that approximates to legal aid <e> <s> if so this bill may be of some help to them <e> <s> i certainly do not consider it part of my function in relation to this bill to go beyond it and to deal with matters as my noble and learned friend has said and as the committee has heard quite outside the legal aid field matters with which for example citizens advice bureaux are concerned <e>", "<cs> i entirely accept the point that the noble and learned lord makes <e> <s> my impression which is perhaps the same as his is that this is probably comprehended in the bill already <e> <s> however as he has made the point perhaps he will allow me to check that for certain and i will come back on report <e> <s> it is certainly our intention that the board should have power not only to undertake but also to commission somebody else to undertake inquiries or investigations <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord should feel that a contracting-out option is dangerous <e> <s> i hope that it may prove an extremely useful and cost-effective option <e> <s> however i recognise the concern that he has expressed that the service provided by those contracting with the board to provide advice and assistance should be a good service of a proper quality <e>", "<cs> i shall try to write to the noble lord if we manage to overtake all the matters which we have to consider in the time available to do so <e>", "<cs> i know well the work pioneered by what is now the north-west legal services committee a venture which the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones was instrumental in establishing <e> <s> i also know of representations i have received for the funding of a committee in south wales <e>", "<cs> i should make it absolutely clear at the outset that it is the governments clear intention that duty solicitor arrangements <e> <s> both for magistrates courts and police stations should continue to operate <e> <s> the administration of them will be transferred to the board which may well have its own views on how they should best be organised and run so i cannot guarantee that the precise details of the present arrangements will stand for all time <e> <s> what i can however say is that this amendment is quite unnecessary to continue the duty solicitor arrangements <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment may i take this chance to say what i should have said on other occasions <e> <s> if as a result of such consultations a point arises that i have not covered if the noble lord felt able to draw my attention to it before we come to report stage it might save time at that stage just as he has asked me if possible to give him my results <e>", "<cs> the legal aid advisory committee has been operating for some time and from the reaction to its reports which the noble lord lord irvine of lairg and others have expressed it has been operating satisfactorily to them at least and i think also to others <e> <s> it has no power to require the law society to furnish such information as it may require <e> <s> it is perfectly able to operate successfully without such a power <e> <s> if the legal aid advisory committee seeks any information from the law society it would in the normal course of events without any such power ask for it <e> <s> if for any reason the information was not forthcoming it should be possible for the lord chancellor to obtain that information if necessary <e> <s> at the present moment it does not appear to me to be right to give the legal aid advisory committee a formal power of this kind when it has not proved necessary in relation to the law society <e> <s> the legal aid advisory committee has functioned perfectly well without such a power <e>", "<cs> the idea of this particular provision is to exclude interference by the lord chancellor in a grant or refusal in an individual case <e> <s> that is the primary thing that is attacked here <e> <s> the noble and learned lords amendment would insert the phrase or categories of cases <e> <s> it seems to me at the moment that it might be perfectly appropriate for the lord chancellor to give directions in relation to categories of cases so long as that did not involve guidance in relation to particular cases <e>", "<cs> it is fairly apparent these days that good administration whether by the lord chancellor by the legal aid board or anyone else requires consultation with those who are affected and does not need as my noble friend lord renton said to he constantly written into statutes <e> <s> the noble lord <e> <s> lord mishcon explained what took place in scotland <e> <s> all i can say is that one result of the speed with which matters happened in scotland was that statutory improvements to the scottish act which were seen to he necessary in the light of experience are set out in schedule to the bill <e> <s> had it not been done speedily that opportunity would have been lost and who knows when another opportunity might have arisen <e>", "<cs> i am greatly obliged <e> <s> in my view this particular provision whether or not one depends on that consideration does not need to be written into the bill <e> <s> for the reason that i mentioned a moment ago i think that it creates a slightly unfortunate impression of the balance of the bill as a <e>", "<cs> i accept there is no doubt that some times if cases were better prepared in a lower court the result would save unnecessary expense <e> <s> i may be wrong but i have come across a case or two of which that might be said in which there was legal representation <e> <s> if one could incorporate that with legal representation perhaps the point that my noble and learned friend makes might be powerful <e> <s> as it is we have to see whether the amendment focuses on cases of that sort <e>", "<cs> i have already made comment on the north-west legal services committee and i have also referred to the south wales steering group for such a committee and its eloquent desire for help <e>", "<cs> first of all with great respect i think that my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale is perfectly right that <e>", "<cs> i have endeavoured to explain the purpose of the provision in the general remarks that i made in answer to amendment no <e> <s> of the noble lord lord mishcon which the committee has approved <e> <s> i am accepting that for the time being <e> <s> i construe what we are doing here in the light of that <e> <s> i doubt whether in fact that makes any difference to the scope of this provision as the noble and learned lord lord silkin of dulwich proposes to amend it <e>", "<cs> when moving this amendment the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones referred to the legal aid legislation which we have had for some time <e> <s> i think i am right to say that from its inception the legal aid legislation has contained wide powers of regulation <e> <s> those powers have been exercised fully over the years as the handbook which is well known to legal practitioners shows <e> <s> generally speaking it is also true i am subject to correction if the noble and learned lord has a case in mind that those have been subject to the negative resolution procedure <e> <s> at the outset of the bills consideration in committee i indicated that the thing to do would be to look at each exercise of the powers in question to see whether the affirmative or the negative resolution procedure was appropriate <e>", "<cs> i wish to make my position absolutely plain <e> <s> this part of the bill has been amended by an amendment moved by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i personally do not feel entirely satisfied that i understand the effect that that amendment has made on this part of the bill <e> <s> i have indicated to the committee that in the light of that and in the light of all the circumstances i am prepared to reconsider this matter and consider whether the affirmative rather than the negative resolution should be applied to regulations made under this particular part of the bill <e> <s> that is my position <e> <s> i am trying to be as reasonable as possible but i do not at all dispute that the noble and learned lord is quite entitled to take this matter to a division if he wishes to <e> <s> i should not regard that as in any way discourteous <e> <s> that matter is entirely up to him <e> <s> i merely wish to make it clear to the committee what my position is <e> <s> i am trying to be consistent with what i said on second reading <e>", "<cs> it would be part of good administration on the part of the lord chancellor to consult the law society on any changes that were being proposed by any regulation in relation to the green form scheme <e> <s> i have already undertaken that the profession would be consulted over all such regulations <e> <s> when i say the profession i include not only the law society which is mentioned in the amendment but also the general council of the bar <e> <s> that would be the general intention in relation to all the provisions in the bill on regulation-making power <e>", "<cs> as the noble and learned lord lord silkin of dulwich has pointed out the bill as drafted contemplates the possibility of the regulations with regard to eligibility for advice and assistance providing for entitlement by reference to receipt of the benefits <e> <s> it is desirable to have that flexibility in the formulation of the regulations <e> <s> however at present the supplementary benefit capital limit is whereas the green form capital limit is <e> <s> for some time it has been felt that as the average green form bill is approximately it is not unreasonable to ask someone with capital of over to pay towards legal advice <e> <s> the purpose of the capital limit for supplementary benefits is as a test of entitlement to income benefit <e> <s> it is a different point from whether or not the claimant for advice should be entitled to have it free if the claimant has over of capital in reserve <e> <s> the present position would not be covered by the clause and i do not wish to restrict the regulation-making power for the future in such a way as to exclude the present position <e>", "<cs> i am not absolutely certain that i have completely understood the problem to which the noble and learned lords amendment is directed <e> <s> clause gives power in prescribed circumstances and subject to prescribed conditions for advice or assistance to be available to persons without reference to their financial resources <e> <s> that is a general provision which might well have the effect in particular circumstances to which the noble and learned lord has referred <e> <s> however this amendment as i understand it adds to clause <e> <s> clause deals with the financial resource limits for eligibility for advice or assistance under this part of this act the matters which the noble and learned lord lord silkin of dulwich considered in the last amendment and with which i endeavoured to answer <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that further explanation <e> <s> the situation of course is that advice given in a law centre as a result of arrangements made under part ii of the bill contract arrangements with the law centre will not be covered by the advice and assistance provisions <e> <s> therefore the contract arrangements may well be different from the eligibility for advice and assistance arrangements <e> <s> that is really the problem that i have <e> <s> part iii is dealing with advice and assistance under the ordinary system <e>", "<cs> i sought to explain the position <e> <s> the clause into which this amendment is sought to be inserted deals with advice and assistance which is legal advice and legal assistance in terms of the statutory definition which we have in clause <e> <s> it is not intended to have any bearing at all on advice in a citizens advice bureau on matters of a general kind <e>", "<cs> there are very few areas in which private persons can incur public expenditure and expect it to be reimbursed without prior approval <e> <s> on the other hand for the green form scheme to work it is highly necessary that where a person wishes advice he should be able to go to a solicitor and get some without having to go for prior approval <e> <s> it is the limit to be set for that that is in question in these amendments <e>", "<cs> the last alteration on review was in <e> <s> i certainly intend to keep the matter under review but it might be rash of me to promise the particular intervals at which the reviews would take place <e> <s> as i have said already and as the noble lord knows there are a number of matters of competing priority that require ones attention <e> <s> certainly these limits will be kept under review in view of the considerations that go to show that they must be related to some extent to present circumstances <e>", "<cs> the subject matter of the amendment has been plainly stated by a number of noble lords and i do not wish to weary the committee by a repetition of it <e> <s> as my noble and learned friend lord hailsham explained the origin of the matter is the lien of the solicitor for his charges over property recovered or preserved by virtue of the litigation on which the charges arose <e> <s> when the law society came as the legal aid authority in place of the solicitor it seemed reasonable that a similar charge in favour of the law society should arise <e>", "<cs> i suppose that advocates are not employed to advance easy arguments either <e> <s> in that way they have a chance to develop their skills <e> <s> the provision which is sought to be amended here has applied to litigation in terms of the statutory provisions for some time <e> <s> that is why the noble and learned lord lord denning is able to illustrate his argument by two cases in the history of legislation <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may take up one very small point of detail which the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones mentioned towards the end of his speech <e> <s> my understanding of the amendment is that the phrase <e>", "<cs> i was hoping that the noble and learned lord would be prepared to withdraw the amendment on the understanding that i should like to have it looked at by the parliamentary draftsmen <e> <s> i am sorry that i did not make that plain <e> <s> i accept the principle of the amendment but i should like to have it looked at before it is incorporated into the bill <e> <s> i am sorry if i was less than generous <e>", "<cs> for some years now it has been the usual practice to raise legal aid eligibility limits in line with increases in supplementary benefit limits <e> <s> this has had the advantage of convenience and i expect the practice to continue <e> <s> certainly there is often justification for doing that <e>", "<cs> i hope i made it clear that i think there is often a good case for doing that in practice <e> <s> what i am objecting to is a formalisation of it making it into a requirement <e> <s> in practical terms it may well be so and i should like to be free to consider that in relation to the various changes in the other regulations that may occur <e> <s> at the moment i would certainly anticipate that it would be quite a strong consideration to try to keep the two in line as they have largely been in the past <e> <s> the only thing i want to preserve is the flexibility not to do that if the circumstances suggest that it would not be right in particular situations <e>", "<cs> so long as the committee keeps in mind that the subject matter of clause and amendment no <e> <s> c is rather different from this amendment if it suits the noble and learned lord as it seems to do to take these together it would be churlish of me to offer any objection <e>", "<cs> i wish to intervene at this stage not to deal with the whole matter but to deal with the point that arose at the opening of the speech by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> he began by suggesting that we might take amendment no <e> <s> c along with this one <e> <s> there is a tremendous difference and i wish to emphasise that right at the outset so that there will not be any misunderstanding <e> <s> i feel responsible for some misunderstandings in the past and i do not wish to be responsible for any more if i can avoid it <e>", "<cs> as it happens i was raising a question about wardship myself <e> <s> it may well be that some further special consideration might be required in relation to wardship proceedings <e> <s> certainly at <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down will he be kind enough to explain how his amendment meets the difficulty for the individually legally-aided litigant to whom the master of the rolls referred <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all noble lords and noble and learned lords who have taken part in this discussion <e> <s> i am bound to say at the outset that i do not understand that this amendment addresses the difficulty to which the noble lord lord mishcon and the noble and learned lord lord ackner referred <e> <s> it is normally my privilege to understand very well what the noble and learned lord lord ackner says <e> <s> i can follow his argument extremely well the same is true with regard to the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> but on this occasion i very much regret that i cannot see how the amendment begins to address the only problem in relation to this matter which they have brought to our attention <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> however i may not have put my question as accurately as i should like <e> <s> i well understand the restrictions held in the authorities to apply to order rule <e> <s> the point i am trying to make is that he refers in his amendment to a class or representative action <e> <s> i want to know what action it covers other than the action in order rule of the orders of the supreme court <e> <s> i wish to know how such an action is to be defined <e>", "<cs> clause establishes that the legally-aided person may be required to pay a contribution towards his legal aid if he is assessed as eligible to do so <e> <s> the clause then allows the financial arrangements relating to contributions to be set out in regulations <e> <s> this seems the most sensible way to proceed when dealing with such detailed matters as these <e>", "<cs> we have had a very extensive debate on the amendment <e> <s> as the committee will know there are more amendments to follow which deal to some extent with the same matter <e> <s> i should like to summarise the position as i see it <e> <s> i do not <e>", "<cs> perhaps it may help to say that i undertook to make such provision in that clause <e>", "<cs> as members of the committee know the purpose of setting up the legal aid board is first to take over the functions at present with the law society in relation to legal aid <e> <s> that is clearly the first step <e> <s> however there is a lot to be said for legal aid being administered by one authority <e> <s> at the moment legal aid in criminal cases is administered in effect by the courts <e> <s> if my memory is correct on a past occasion i have heard the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones mention the discrepancies <e>", "<cs> the situation so far as concerns england and wales and so far as the statutory provisions apply is that the phrase here has been in the interests of justice <e> <s> it is from that phrase that lord widgery developed these factors <e> <s> in other words the authority was that phrase <e> <s> we are really duplicating the issue when one examines the matter thoroughly by putting in in the interests of justice and these factors as well <e> <s> as i have said the factors in the amendment are simply an explanation of factors which would be taken into account according to the criteria <e>", "<cs> as i mentioned a while ago there was a complaint about the divergence between courts in relation to the granting of legal aid <e> <s> the legal aid act provided for the establishment of criminal legal aid committees of the law society whose purpose is to hear such appeals in certain circumstances <e> <s> those committees will transfer to the board once it takes over <e> <s> however an appeal does not lie in all circumstances <e> <s> an appeal from a magistrates courts refusal to grant legal aid could be made if the applicant had been charged with an indictable or either-way offence and if the application had been refused on interests of justice grounds <e> <s> there is also a restriction on the timing of applications which effectively means that if an application for legal aid is made too close to the date fixed for the trial there can be no appeal <e> <s> obviously that would be an easy way of postponing the trial <e>", "<cs> i am saying that we intend the present system as enshrined in the legal aid act to continue and regulations will be made so to provide <e> <s> the bill does not lay an obligation on us to do that but it provides us with the power to do that <e> <s> i am telling the noble lord that i intend that that power should be exercised in that way <e> <s> i think that the result will be a happy one <e>", "<cs> i am certainly happy to consider something along those lines <e> <s> i am not absolutely certain whether it will add anything to the bill but i am willing to consider the noble lords proposal <e>", "<cs> amendments nos <e> <s> a and b are related to amendments nos <e> <s> d e and f to the second schedule <e> <s> as i sought to explain in answer to an earlier amendment part vi places in a separate part those care proceedings which are currently entwined with criminal proceedings in part ii of the act <e> <s> the generality of care proceedings was entwined with criminal proceedings <e> <s> some care proceedings were not entwined with criminal proceedings and they remain under part iv of the bill <e>", "<cs> like the noble and learned lord i do not think it at all likely that if the court has power to do that and it appears to the court to be desirable to do so in the interests of justice anything more need be said <e> <s> if it has the power and it seems desirable one can reasonably expect the court to grant legal aid <e> <s> i think the word may is slightly better as one is dealing with a court <e> <s> however i shall be glad to draw what the noble and learned lord has said to the attention of parliamentary counsel and take his advice <e>", "<cs> the purpose of clause is to make it quite clear that nothing in the bill except where specifically stated should affect the normal solicitor-client relationship <e> <s> the relationship of a solicitor and his client is governed by well-established rules and legislation and is generally well understood <e>", "<cs> the <e> <s> powers to which the noble and learned lord has referred are designed to enable the regulations to produce the present result that is the result that presently obtains in practice <e> <s> in practice at the present time the assisted person chooses his own solicitor in criminal proceedings as in civil proceedings in almost all cases <e> <s> however the formal position is that the court assigns a solicitor and counsel in criminal cases <e> <s> this is provided for in section of the legal aid act <e> <s> section c of that same act establishes that regulations may make provision with respect to the manner in which counsel and solicitors are to be assigned to legally assisted persons in pursuance of legal aid orders <e> <s> so that provision which is very like the concluding part of clause is to be found in the existing statutory provisions <e>", "<cs> those are the provisions that regulate the level of representation rather than the individual who is to represent <e> <s> the regulations may prescribe the circumstances in which representation may be by counsel only or solicitor only and they also regulate representation by more than one counsel <e> <s> that does not affect the choice of an individual counsel or solicitor where counsel or a solicitor is to be the representative <e>", "<cs> as i sought to explain earlier a good number of these powers are very much along the lines of existing powers <e> <s> the novelty is principally in subsection referring to what the noble and learned lord described as a mysterious panel <e> <s> the idea is that there might be a possibility of having people with particular expertise for particular types of work <e> <s> the law is not getting simpler as the days are passing <e> <s> a time may well come when it is appropriate that solicitors with particular expertise should be the <e>", "<cs> as the members of the committee know the government issued a white paper a considerable time ago and indicated in a number of ways that legislation on it would follow <e> <s> that white paper stated that the government would continue to have regard to the principle of fair remuneration for work actually and reasonably done and also to the public expenditure that would be involved in remuneration for the legal profession <e>", "<cs> i am perfectly content with that <e> <s> the noble and learned lord is moving amendment no <e> <s> on its own but the noble and learned lord has on the marshalled list the amendment in his name to leave out line <e> <s> line is paragraph f <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should answer the questions in the order in which they have been put to me <e> <s> as regards the question of my noble and learned friend lord ackner my view is that the governments position is still as stated in the command paper <e> <s> i see no reason to depart from that <e> <s> one of the factors if engaged in private litigation is that one is able to make an agreement in advance if one wishes to do so as to what the rate of remuneration might be <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to delay the committee unduly <e> <s> the amendment proposed has more in it than shall have regard <e> <s> if that was all it contained it would be easier to accept <e> <s> as i have tried to explain the reason it is not easy always to have regard to all those matters in detail in determining the regulations is that from time to time one would wish that to be done by way of uprating <e> <s> the basic considerations would be those <e> <s> however one would not every time one made new rates or regulations for rates have to consider all of them on the basis of various factors <e> <s> that is a big job as the noble lord must know <e> <s> accordingly it seemed to me to be right to make it clear that those were the basic factors in the consideration and that they will remain so <e> <s> however it may not be necessary every time to have regard to them <e>", "<cs> i explained to members of the committee that in drafting the clause in this way i had in mind that we should have a workable formula <e> <s> it is fair to the departmental officials to say that this clause was drafted in its present form as a result of instructions given by me <e>", "<cs> at this time of night and having regard to what i said in respect of the earlier amendment i shall certainly take this matter into account <e>", "<cs> i do not think i can improve on the statement of the position given by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale for wishing to retain this factor among those which are to be considered <e> <s> there is no question of our taking money out of the pay otherwise agreed for the legal profession as the noble lord lord benson has suggested <e> <s> my pay and anyone elses pay which is fixed for the public service takes account of the fact that it is paid out of the public funds and that is what we seek to do here <e> <s> that was made plain in the white <e>", "<cs> i do not think that this type of regulation should be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure <e> <s> i have gone a good way with the noble and learned lord on matters where novelty is involved but these regulations are comprehensible and can easily be attacked by the negative resolution procedure if any point has to be raised about them <e> <s> i am not disposed to put the affirmative resolution procedure into the clause <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord is perfectly right <e> <s> i think it might be wise to leave these provisions to parliamentary counsel to draft the implementation of the undertakings and the matters consequential <e>", "<cs> we have dealt with some of these and the principle that i have tried to follow is to apply the affirmative resolution procedure where some explanation is likely to be necessary in putting forward the regulations <e> <s> so far as i have been able to judge the regulations which are covered by these clauses apart from the ones to which i have already agreed would be self-explanatory <e>", "<cs> as i said i think it is highly likely that something on those lines would be acceptable <e> <s> but i think it would be part of the consequentials and it might be right that parliamentary counsel should be invited to draft the whole of the consequential provisions <e> <s> if we do some of them we may find that something goes wrong so i should prefer that the matters be left together to deal with <e>", "<cs> we have dealt with it already <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord will allow me i think that amendment no <e> <s> went along with no <e> <s> <e> <s> so the noble and learned lord has already dealt with that <e> <s> i think we are now at amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> this is a common form of provision <e> <s> it is necessary for me to adhere to it in relation to statutory instruments which affect the public revenues and under which payments are to be made out of the public purse by virtue of regulations <e> <s> the words are necessary on that account <e> <s> the reality of the matter as has been said depends upon securing treasury consent <e> <s> a workable formula for arriving at the remuneration will be an important factor in enabling that consent to be forthcoming <e> <s> the need to have that provision on the face of the bill is in accordance with the ordinary practice with such regulation-making powers <e> <s> therefore i cannot accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have considered the arguments available to me prior to this evening and the arguments that i have heard this evening are substantially to the same effect <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for the spirit in which he has welcomed the amendments and also for the constructive questions that he has asked about the wording <e> <s> he raises a doubt about whether the cloak of confidentiality has not been drawn too far to cover information <e> <s> i looked at this point myself in relation to the amendment and the other amendment of the same kind to which we shall come shortly <e> <s> in the light of the exceptions in paragraphs a to f it seemed to me that we had got it right <e> <s> however this is an important question and if the noble lord will allow me i shall certainly consider further what he has said <e> <s> it may be that he will want to enlighten me even further and in more detail about the particular risks that he has in mind <e> <s> i am sure that we could conveniently do that without taking up the time of the committee <e>", "<cs> the journalist case may be of some importance <e> <s> i want to draw attention to the possibility of general information being handed out by the board under subsection <e> <s> the idea is that information about activities and so on can be furnished in such a way as not to identify the circumstances of a particular case <e> <s> that is put in with a view to trying to help to ensure that the public investigation and interest in these matters can be furthered without damage to individual confidentiality <e>", "<cs> although it does not arise out of the terms of this particular amendment since my noble friends have raised the question i should say first that of course we shall do our best to make the regulations as explicit as possible <e> <s> where information is required from applicants that is done by means of forms that they have to fill up and again we shall endeavour to have those forms absolutely plain so that the questions they have to answer are clear to them <e> <s> it is normal in such forms to draw attention to the possibility that the giving of false information may have criminal consequences <e> <s> one does not want to frighten people unduly but on the other hand it is right that they should be informed <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for the sentiment which the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge has just expressed in a sense <e> <s> but i <e>", "<cs> i am obliged for that reminder <e> <s> as regards conditions on the payment of sums it is not easy to give precise details <e> <s> one does not know how such matters may arise <e> <s> it may well be that particular payments should be made conditional for example on the use of a particular method of dealing with administration <e> <s> it may well be that the condition on payment of sums would be that they were required at a particular time <e> <s> it may be that particular situations which had been envisaged as possibly requiring a certain amount in fact obtain <e> <s> in other words it may be possible to make a condition that certain sums should be paid only in certain contingencies for example as a result of some situation which would require them <e> <s> there are many types of condition that might be appropriate in certain circumstances of efficient administration <e>", "<cs> i can assure my noble friend that there is no question of that <e> <s> i fear that my explanation even if it was closely reasoned has not been clear enough if that impression remains <e>", "<cs> the answer is that if the board sued the lord chancellor under the provisions of the first part of clause a he would have no defence that he did not have the approval of the treasury whereas if the board sued the lord chancellor under clause b for administrative expenses he would have a complete answer that the approval of the treasury had been refused <e> <s> in that case it would have to join the treasury the minister responsible for the treasury and his department to the matter <e>", "<cs> i wish to reply because i have not dealt with this <e> <s> i understand the request now is that the whole of this provision in clause b be left out <e> <s> i have sought to give an example i can give another <e>", "<cs> the only difficulty is that in clause in the brackets it says <e>", "<cs> i am certainly anxious to bring into force as soon as possible the part which gives to the legal aid board the responsibility for the administration of civil legal aid <e> <s> i think that is as far as i can go at the moment <e> <s> as i indicated at second reading i hope that we shall be able to establish the board as a shadow board before it has formal statutory responsibility <e> <s> progress thereafter will depend upon consultations with the members of the board once it is established <e> <s> experience has taught one over the years that when one is making a major change it may be wise not to go too fast but to consult fairly widely in the course of making these arrangements <e> <s> that is as far as i am able to go at the moment <e>", "<cs> i sympathise with the spirit of this amendment <e> <s> very trying circumstances may prevail when families are involved in proceedings before a coroners court <e> <s> as the noble lord lord wigoder has pointed out the coroner is not necessarily legally qualified <e> <s> i think that that suggests the nature of the tribunal in question it is intended to be relatively informal from a legal point of view <e> <s> the coroner has the responsibility of inquiring into the matters <e>", "<cs> when decisions were taken many years ago to take certain cases out of the courts and send them to various forms of extra-court tribunal the ideal was some informal sort of proceedings in which ordinary people non-lawyers could go along to take part <e> <s> it is still surely the ideal that that should happen <e> <s> as the noble lord lord wigoder said and he speaks with the authority of his experience on the council on tribunals a degree of formality that may not have been intended by those who originally set up these tribunals has crept in <e>", "<cs> i heed my noble friends admonition which i take to be an admonition to be rather brief on this amendment and i adopt what has been said by the noble and learned lord lord denning and my noble and learned friend lord hailsham <e> <s> so far as concerns <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord who moved the amendment knows it has never been law for defamation actions to be included in civil legal aid <e> <s> the people who set up the scheme were no doubt wise and they did so for wise reasons <e> <s> as the noble lord said it is uniquely difficult to forecast the outcome of defamation proceedings and that makes it especially difficult to apply the merits test normally applied to such proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords it is important at the outset in seeking to respond to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and the noble lord lord harris of greenwich that i should emphasise that i am repeating this statement which was made by my right honourable and learned friend the attorney-general in his capacity as an independent law officer with responsibility for prosecutions <e> <s> the statement deals with that as fully as it was in his judgment proper for him to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the correct course for me to take is to undertake to bring to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for northern ireland the observations made by your lordships about the matters falling within his responsibility including the matter to which the noble lord has just referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very heartened that in his response to the statement the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones made it clear that he was in no way questioning the attorney-general or the director of public prosecutions in their ultimate decision <e> <s> i shall certainly indicate that as being the situation in any report of mine <e> <s> what i was proposing to draw to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for northern ireland are the suggestions as to how the matters which lie within his responsibility should be taken further <e> <s> i do not think that there is a suggestion from any noble lord who has spoken so far that anything in the responsibilities of my right honourable and learned friend the attorney-general or the director of public prosecutions northern ireland is open to further question <e>", "<cs> my lords i perceive no lacuna in the statement of the attorney-general which i have read <e> <s> the other matters fall outside the responsibility of my right honourable and learned friend and i undertake to report the suggestions that have been made to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all members of this house appreciate the circumstances in which the royal ulster constabulary are called upon to act <e> <s> i am sure that we all very much appreciate the personal dangers to which so many of them are for such a high proportion of the time exposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the noble lords observations inevitably follow but consideration of whether a statement made by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for northern ireland should be repeated in this house is a matter that we can leave until the problem arises <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of your lordships i beg to move that this house do agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington for his helpful intervention <e> <s> the government especially those who were involved in this very large exercise will be grateful for his kind remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the introduction of this matter by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> it has proved to be a fairly difficult task but as i stated in the letter read to your lordships i am hopeful that at third reading we shall be able to bring forward a satisfactory statement of purpose clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to noble lords who have welcomed these amendments <e> <s> of course i entirely accept that the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and the noble lord lord hooson may want to reserve their position with regard to individual amendments <e> <s> i have sought to explain mmy amendments together for the reason that the principal amendment comes very late <e> <s> it is a new clause to provide in effect for the affirmative resolution procedure since there was no such clause in the original bill <e> <s> therefore i am grateful for what has been said and i will be happy to try to deal with any matters of detail that may still arise when amendments proposed by noble and noble and learned lords are reached <e> <s> in the meantime i am grateful for the present welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may take first the question posed by the noble baroness lady phillips <e> <s> the legal aid board will have responsibilities which are central to the work of solicitors and of the bar <e> <s> hitherto solicitors and barristers have played a very significant and important role in the discharge of the responsibilities for the administration of legal aid for example the granting of legal aid applications refusing them and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i propose to invite my advisers to consider the matter <e> <s> i hope that i shall be able to bring forward something which will be acceptable to all of your lordships <e> <s> as the house is aware that is not always the easiest thing to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords when i wrote to the noble lord lord mishcon that the spirit of his amendment was one that i shared i had in mind that we all wanted the advice and other work done under contracting out to reach an appropriate standard <e> <s> what this amendment does is create a statutory obligation on the lord chancellor in every exercise of the power to which it is affixed to include <e>", "<cs> my lords we discussed this matter as the noble and learned lord has said in committee <e> <s> i wish to pay tribute to the work of the north-western area committee indeed i have already done so <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord has remarked i have said before and i now say again that under the bill the board has power if it thinks fit to establish and fund regional committees to help in the discharge of the boards functions <e> <s> but the amendment goes a great deal further <e> <s> it places a duty on the board to establish such committees and would give them the task of ensuring and facilitating the development of legal and advice services <e> <s> it would also require the board to provide financial and other resources to the regional committees for the performance of their obligations <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always open to your lordships to vote against the advice of the minister <e> <s> i share my noble friends view that on many occasions it may not be wise to do so <e> <s> however on this occasion i accept as fully as i can the words of the amendment and i am making the consequential amendments which i am advised are necessary in order that the bill be technically correct <e> <s> i appreciate that there will be an argument about amendment no <e> <s> and i reserve what i have to say about that until we hear it being commended by the noble lord lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> my lords part iii of the bill deals with advice and assistance <e> <s> part ii enables the board to contract out for example to solicitors legal advice agencies and law centres the obtaining and giving to clients that is persons who wish to avail themselves of advice and assistance of that particular kind of advice or assistance <e> <s> under part ii if the board contracts out a particular service it would seem right that it should not also be provided under part iii by way of duplication <e> <s> subsections and therefore embrace necessary provisions to exclude from part iii what is provided under part ii <e> <s> otherwise there is a waste of time <e> <s> if one sets up a contract with a law centre for legal advice on let us say social security benefits and these provisions are made then anyone can go along to a law centre and obtain advice on social security benefits <e> <s> that is the arrangement <e> <s> if at the same time anyone with the appropriate qualifications and means goes along to a solicitor under the green form scheme for the same kind of advice there is a quite unnecessary duplication in the service <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of your lordships i should like to say that the white paper makes the governments thinking plain in general terms <e> <s> i see no reason on this aspect to depart from that thinking subject to the need to qualify those exclusions by reference to cases such as i have already mentioned <e> <s> there may be other similar cases which have not yet been brought to our attention on consultation <e> <s> i want to make it plain that those powers exist to be considered not only immediately after the bill has been passed but from time to time to ensure that the money which the taxpayer contributes towards legal aid is used to its best advantage <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the amendment would have the effect of removing the merits test altogether in respect of proceedings before the mental health review tribunals <e> <s> the merits test applies not only to the nature of the proceedings but also to the respresentation that is in question <e> <s> in the case of mental health tribunals the merits test presently applied under the existing system which would continue to be applied in the future so far as concerns the general statutory provisions and regulations is this <e> <s> the ordinary merits test is that the applicant has a reasonable case and that it is not unreasonable to grant aid in the particular circumstances of the case <e> <s> under the regulations so far as concerns mental health review tribunals this form of representation shall be approved unless it appears unreasonable that approval should be granted in the particular circumstances of the case <e> <s> in other words there is a strong onus in favour of the applicant but it is not absolutely compelling <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house as far as i can see as the noble lord lord renton said the present arrangements are satisfactory <e> <s> if i understood correctly the effect of the amendment proposed by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones it would simply remove the present merits test <e> <s> it is a very restricted merits test indeed in the sense that it is very easy for the applicant to pass the test <e> <s> in the vast majority of cases apart from the exceptional one which i mentioned the applicants seemed to have passed the test <e> <s> there may be some point which the noble and learned lords amendment focuses upon which i have not completely understood <e> <s> in that case no doubt we can confer later <e> <s> but at present my understanding is that the arrangements are as i have described <e> <s> they seem highly reasonable and only give scope to cut out utterly unreasonable applications they work well and could be left as they are <e>", "<cs> my lords the point raised by the amendment was raised in a somewhat similar <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am sorry that i have not made the position clear <e> <s> the bill provides the power to link eligibility for advice and assistance to entitlement to benefit under social security regulations <e> <s> it enables us to couch the regulations in that form in the future but it does not necessarily tie us to giving free legal advice and assistance to those who are on supplementary benefit <e> <s> it would enable us to do that but does not bind us to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord tempts me again <e> <s> in the bill we have provided scope for doing so but i think that it would be wrong to be bound to do it <e> <s> after all no one can say how liberal social security benefits may be in the future and i think that it would be wrong to go any further than i have done <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee i said in answer to the amendment to which the noble lord lord irvine of lairg has referred that i would consider the matter <e> <s> theoretically an amendment of <e>", "<cs> my lords the position which i have described has obtained in the legal aid system since its inception <e> <s> the three words contained in the phrase severe financial hardship are reasonably common <e> <s> the question of their application to particular circumstances is a matter for judges but judges are accustomed to making decisions applying simple words to a variety of circumstances <e> <s> in this case they have the additional provision that <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall seek to deal with that point in due time <e> <s> what i said about the earlier amendment applies also to this matter <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale for correcting me <e> <s> i believe i began with the phrase for a long time it has been part of the legal aid system and then slipped into saying from the beginning <e> <s> my noble and learned friend is right <e> <s> i think that originally the balance was even worse and was improved in favour of unassisted persons by the amendment to which he referred <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the last point made by my noble friend lord coleraine i appreciate that if one has limited resources and is faced by the state either in the form of a legally-aided litigant or otherwise there is a certain amount of difficulty in resisting if one can settle reasonably within ones means <e> <s> if the cost is too high then perhaps it does not matter anyway <e> <s> if one can settle within ones reasonable means it is obviously a wise precaution <e> <s> i am not at all clear how this particular amendment if it were given effect would alter that situation because one has to win a case before it applies <e> <s> therefore it is necessary to fight it out <e> <s> i believe that the same problem would still arise <e>", "<cs> my lords as has already been said the intention is to introduce a system under which a person against whom action is proposed to be raised assisted by public funds will have an opportunity to make representations before a decision is taken in the ordinary case to grant the application <e> <s> that was announced by the government in the white paper <e> <s> the intention is to alter the present regulations to give effect to that <e>", "<cs> my lords the argument put forward by the noble lords lord allen of abbeydale and lord morton of shuna suggests to my mind that it is based on the idea that where there is open a rather costly line of defence the plaintiff should be entitled to legal aid <e>", "<cs> these regulations on financial eligibility and criteria for determining whether it is more appropriate for the applicant to be given assistance by way of representation rather than civil legal aid for the amount of contributions and in respect of the statutory charge have been covered by the ordinary procedure in the past <e> <s> the regulations on that sort of matter are very largely self-explanatory and to bring the matter to the house in order that an explanation be given affirming the reason for them would be wasting your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill as it stands creates as the basis on which representation should be granted in this part of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for this promising start and i hope that it augurs well for my securing the agreement of your lordships to the rest of the amendments that i shall be proposing <e> <s> i should like to mention that this point was raised in particular by the noble baroness lady seear in committee <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord wigoder for signifying his position with regard to it <e>", "<cs> my lords in seeking to deal with this amendment as fairly as i can i should like to make it abundantly plain that in my opinion a proper basis for negotiation with the legal profession on the remuneration to be paid to the profession for publicly-funded work under the legal aid fund is that the formula should be clear should be plain and should be capable of application to the problems in hand <e>", "<cs> my lords in my judgment what regulates the question of what is relevant is the context in which this phrase occurs <e> <s> it is a determination of remuneration <e> <s> therefore everything that is in the judgment of a court if it has to decide that is properly relevant to determination of remuneration in the circumstances of the case will in my view be appropriate to be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that a clause of the kind that we have in this bill would certainly make the lord chancellor open to judicial review in decisions that he took under it <e> <s> however the doubt was expressed by my noble and learned friend lord ackner and others including the noble baroness lady seear that the way in which it was expressed might have the effect of making a successful judicial review unnecessarily difficult because of the phraseology <e> <s> i am anxious to make it as plain as possible that it is intended to exercise this clause in a fair and proper manner <e>", "<cs> my lords as i undertook to consider this i have done so carefully since we debated it at committee stage <e> <s> there is a slight difficulty in the wording of the amendment proposed in relation to competent barristers and solicitors <e> <s> precautions are taken by both branches of a united profession on this matter to ensure competence in the <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the intention of including paragraph d is to cover this point <e> <s> if i have not done that correctly it may be necessary to alter the paragraph <e> <s> with respect to the noble lord lord mishcon what he has said leaves out of account the fact that the regulations relate to the future <e> <s> in other words i am making regulations for remuneration for work to be done <e> <s> they will affect work done after they come into force and i look to the number and general level of competence of barristers and solicitors undertaking the work <e> <s> the idea is that i must produce a level of fees in relation to a particular type of work which will provide the number and general level of competence of barristers appropriate for that work <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house all i can say is that in my view a proper working of clause d will have the effect of making that a relevant consideration <e> <s> if the noble lord lord mishcon has in mind particular examples of work being done by persons of inadequate competence under the legal aid scheme i should be glad to have details of that <e> <s> however at the moment we are seeking to set up a general framework <e> <s> the purpose of paragraph d is to take account of the nature of the work so that under the regulations an adequate fee will be fixed in order to ensure that the work will be undertaken by a satisfactory number of barristers and solicitors with a general level of competence adequate for the work <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i have demonstrated that i am far from being immoveable on these matters apart from where necessary and i am happy to look at this matter again <e> <s> i have considered it carefully since the committee stage and i had reached my conclusions <e> <s> however in the light of what has been said today i am happy to reconsider the issue <e> <s> i do not promise that i shall be persuaded that the paragraph should be changed but i promise to reconsider the matter with the kind of open mind which your lordships might expect <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will remember that very early in the legal aid administration a deduction of a percentage was made from civil legal aid in respect of remuneration which otherwise might be payable on the ground that it was legally aided <e> <s> i believe it is important to remember that because in the various arguments that we have had this point is sometimes forgotten <e> <s> the government recently announced that this particular percentage would be cut <e> <s> it could not be cut altogether because of the legislation under which legal aid was paid <e> <s> it was to be cut from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> and it will be cut altogether if and when this bill becomes law because the possibility of doing that lawfully would then occur <e> <s> i believe that in all the discussions connected with remuneration it is worth while to bear that in mind <e> <s> one might gather from the atmosphere and from what we have heard in some of the speeches that there is a suggestion that the government are concerned only to try to reduce and reduce and reduce whereas as regards civil legal aid we have at a stroke increased remuneration by per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i adhere to the object that i expressed earlier of obtaining a workable formula which will be reasonably plain <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that this particular point was not raised at committee stage but i am subject to correction if anybody has raised it and i have allowed it to slip from my mind <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i said that a number of noble and learned lords for whose opinion i have the greatest possible respect have said that this is unintelligible <e> <s> in the face of suggestions of that kind it must be responsible of me to ask parliamentary counsel to have another look at the clause to see whether he can make it more intelligible to my noble and learned friends and to those who will have to operate it <e> <s> i desire however to make it clear that i wish to retain what i have sought to explain as the purpose of the clause <e> <s> what i am offering is to attempt to improve the wording to meet the difficulties on which my noble and learned friends and others appear to have stumbled <e>", "<cs> my lords just so that there is no mistake about this matter clause is what i have agreed to make subject to the affirmative resolution procedure and not clause <e> <s> clause has to do with the numbers <e> <s> clause deals with the extension of the boards powers <e> <s> there may be a misprint or perhaps the noble and learned lord intends to subject clause to this power <e>", "<cs> my lords it was clause <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may take the regulations that are outstanding in the amendment and try to deal with them in the order in which they appear <e> <s> clause deals with the power to specify what may be included in advice assistance and representation in particular circumstances <e> <s> it also provides for regulations to allow for work done otherwise than under the act to be included within its provisions <e> <s> that kind of regulation will be self-explanatory and though important can certainly be adequately dealt with by the negative resolution procedure <e> <s> if there is an objectionable matter your lordships would have the chance to raise it <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by paying tribute to the noble lord lord benson who moved this amendment and to his work as chairman of the royal commission on legal services <e> <s> i agree with him that it is of fundamental importance that proper data should be available to whoever has the responsibility to determine legal aid remuneration <e> <s> however it is done that is the first and fundamental requirement <e> <s> my predecessor but one the then lord chancellor the noble and learned lord lord hailsham together with the bar council and the law <e>", "<cs> my lords i can anticipate a perfectly proper dispute between both branches of the legal profession and the lord chancellor about what is a relevant factor to be taken into account in the light of the applicable statutory provisions <e> <s> i have heard arguments of that kind before between perfectly dignified people and such disputes will have to be determined <e> <s> i would hope that such circumstances would not arise as long as i have the responsibility <e> <s> in my view it is necessary to have machinery which is likely to function reasonably <e>", "<cs> my lords like noble and learned lords who preceded me as lord chancellor in administering the legal aid scheme i have welcomed the advice of the legal aid advisory committee <e> <s> i heartily endorse the tributes that have been paid to its work <e> <s> over the years its reports have been extremely valuable <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall answer that by saying that the legal aid advisory committee may be described as a watchdog but i am not sure that that is a particularly appropriate name for a body of this distinction <e> <s> its reports are not the reports of a watchdog exactly they are more the reports of independent persons of constructive mind indicating ways in which the legal aid system as a whole might be improved <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have understood the observations that have fallen from your lordships since i last spoke not much doubt has been cast on the propriety of approving amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am glad about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i undertook to consider these matters between committee and report stages <e> <s> in response to a letter from my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale to which he has made reference i replied to him in some detail although he kindly said that his letter did not call for a reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i endeavoured to explain in committee in answering a very similar amendment that i do not feel that arbitration proceedings are very high on the list of priorities to which legal aid might be extended <e> <s> since then there has been a development which is perhaps worthy of note and that is that a member in another place has proposed a private members bill called the consumer arbitration agreements bill and it has been given a second reading in another place <e> <s> the effect of that would be to open up the courts to small arbitrations to some extent <e> <s> i put the matter fairly generally and not as precisely as mr pawsey has done or may yet do <e>", "<cs> my lords in the sense that any family court will come after this i suppose it is true that this is a precursor to the family court but i have to say that the contribution that this amendment makes to that is minimal <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to empower the high court to transfer to county courts certain matrimonial proceedings and to validate certain high court orders purporting to transfer such proceedings to county courts and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i too must take the same attitude <e> <s> to include leases within the general right to inspect and make copies would be to impose a very considerable burden on the registrys manpower resources without in my view giving any significant benefit <e> <s> the benefits suggested by my noble friend are i would suggest more apparent than real <e> <s> it would not for example be realistic to expect a solicitor advising a client about a lease in a block of flats to read through or other leases of flats in the same block <e> <s> it certainly would not be conducive to speedy and efficient conveyancing <e> <s> leases often run to or pages and can be as long as pages and i am sure that is not an absolute maximum <e> <s> to allow general inspection and copying of copy leases held at the registry would be immensely time-consuming and would seriously hamper the registrys work <e>", "<cs> my lords if amendment no <e> <s> is agreed to i cannot call amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> my lords in calling amendment no <e> <s> i must tell the house that if that amendment is agreed to i cannot call amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs>

bringing the bill forward and for the skilful and eloquent way in which he has piloted it through the house <e> <s> there is also the added bonus that his words may have had the effect of soothing the anxieties felt among a minority of the legal profession as the noble lord lord mishcon has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble and learned lord for his felicitous welcome to this bill <e> <s> i fear that he is right and that we are dealing with what is to me an unknown number of cases <e> <s> the noble and learned lord was kind enough to ask me some little time ago how

say how many there are but obviously it is a finite number which could be <e>", "<cs> my lords if amendment no <e> <s> is agreed to i cannot call amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> was proposed by the noble lord lord beaverbrook <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i gave the noble lord lord mishcon the feeling that i have nothing to say on the amendment <e> <s> i was seeking to give a full opportunity to anyone else who had not yet taken part in the debate to speak before i responded to the noble lords amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for that support <e> <s> as i have said the problem was originally highlighted by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones in his amendment <e> <s> all we have sought to do is to carry forward that thinking in detail <e> <s> therefore i am grateful that your lordships feel we have reached the right conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all perhaps i may say that i referred to a class action simply because that was the way in which the problem was originally introduced <e> <s> the phrase class action is nowhere used in these amendments and i certainly did not intend to use it to describe what is covered by the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> obviously i was seeking to summarise as fairly as i could what he had said and i had made rather an inadequate note of it <e> <s> so if it was not entirely fair that is my fault not his <e> <s> one can see that procedural directions might well be required from the court in actions of this kind and nothing in this amendment is intended to preclude that <e> <s> as to whether there are common issues in actions i should have thought that that was something which the legal aid board would be capable of identifying and it is that kind of question that it might have to face <e>", "<cs> my lords before preparing the white paper consideration was given to the effective use of the money available for legal aid and one of the areas that was considered was that of making a will or other instrument <e> <s> it was thought and i entirely agree with this approach that in the generality of cases if one was making a will disposing of property on the whole that property should bear the cost of the will <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to surprise my noble friend on this occasion <e> <s> the social security commissioners in certain circumstances appear to me as i said at committee and repeated on report to be in a situation where perhaps a high priority exists if there is to be an extension of the scope of legal aid <e> <s> on the other hand a research project has been commissioned by my predecessors to be carried out on behalf of the department into the effect of representation in tribunals fairly generally <e> <s> it is also possible that the board itself might have a view on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for her observations <e> <s> i also value the work of the committee and as i have said i certainly intend it to remain in operation and functioning as well as hitherto at least through the transistional provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is probably correct in the circumstances <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will allow me to proceed with this without commitment and we can have it corrected in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to take up much of your lordships time because your lordships have been most generous in your remarks about the bill <e> <s> however i should like to say at the outset in reference to the point just raised by my noble friend that for my part when the bill passes from this house i am happy to commit it to the wisdom of those in another place and leave to them the choice of who may consider it there <e> <s> i do not think it would be wise for me to express any view upon the matter <e> <s> all i can say is that i am sure it will be considered with wisdom <e>", "<cs> my lords clause incorporates the recommendations of the committee on patent litigation which were issued in december <e> <s> i understood that a copy of the committees report has been placed in the library <e> <s> although the government are still considering the details of its recommendations it seemed appropriate in this clause which marks the governments general intention to create a patents county court broadly to follow the reports recommendation as to the conferral of patents and designs jurisdiction on one or more county courts <e>", "<cs> my lords clause at present enables a financial ceiling to be imposed varied or removed entirely from claims falling within the special jurisdiction of a patents county court <e> <s> the report of the committee to which reference has been made recommended that this financial limit should be waived if the parties so agreed <e> <s> the government accept the recommendation of the committee and in principle therefore they accept the amendment which my noble friend has just proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said a moment or two ago clause as at present drafted does not cover the more detailed procedural points raised in the report which was received only a short time before the bill was in committee <e> <s> i can assure your lordships that the government intend to introduce provisions which will allow the court in proceedings within its special jurisdiction with or without the application of any party to order the patent office to inquire and report on any question of fact or opinion so that there is a flexible power in the court to get reports such as the report envisaged in my noble friends amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a modest measure aimed at tidying up the legislation relating to marriage abroad <e> <s> we are concerned with two types of foreign marriage first the consular marriage that is a marriage celebrated before or by a british marriage officer and secondly marriages performed by services chaplains or other authorised people <e> <s> the principal act governing this area although somewhat amended is now only four years short of its hundredth birthday <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to both noble lords who have spoken on this bill <e> <s> as has been pointed out the main matter with which the bill deals is in clause <e> <s> clause is important but clause is the one to which attention has been drawn in the speeches of the noble lords lord mishcon and lord meston <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill does not touch on that question <e> <s> this bill is the foreign marriage amendment bill and it relates to marriages which are foreign <e> <s> within the context of this bill the marriage of an english person at gretna green even if it had advantages would not be a foreign marriage <e> <s> therefore this provision does not operate on it <e> <s> this gives the benefit of their own law to people who use the arrangement of the foreign marriage act <e> <s> i believe that your lordships would think this just equitable and right <e> <s> therefore with i think the support of noble lords who have spoken i renew my motion that the bill be read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i cannot give the precise location of the european list at the moment <e> <s> i think there are copies of it in a number of places and perhaps the noble lord would allow me to write to him on the point <e>", "<cs> they are not in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the two amendments are closely related <e> <s> however i moved amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we shall come to amendment no <e> <s> in due course <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams of elvel asked two questions about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> he asked whether the lord chancellor will be able to find or nominate the right person to be a judge of this court <e> <s> i do not doubt that that will be a difficult operation and one that will not be contemplated until first the primary legislation is in place and secondly an order under it is made <e> <s> it will be quite difficult to find the right person but i believe that it will be possible <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to be my lot tonight to be one step behind <e> <s> i think that the point raised by the noble lord lord morton of shuna is at least to some extent covered by amendment no <e> <s> which i propose to move in a moment <e> <s> however fast i go i cannot catch them up <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely accept the point that has been raised by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> it may not be easy to obtain a suitable judge but one of the characteristics that one would like to see in the judge is not only that he be an excellent judge but that he has the firmness that the noble lord has described <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords who have spoken in connection with this matter <e> <s> on the points raised by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones i am sure that the scots would regard his voice as sufficiently close to their own to be highly acceptable to them <e> <s> in any event i am certain that they would be glad of his eloquent support in any matter that was of concern to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second of the two motions standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the application of scottish law in england i do not believe that the bill affects the proposition <e> <s> it allows a person domiciled in scotland and who is married abroad under the provisions of the foreign marriage act to be married in accordance with the rules of scotland <e> <s> i believe that to be very just <e> <s> i believe it is right that hitherto the scots person being married abroad under these provisions was required to conform to the english law <e> <s> although i know that many noble lords will consider that to be a great <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords on the opposition benches will understand that my answer would be the opposite to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i can answer the first part of that question absolutely plainly <e> <s> there is no question whatsoever of a transfer of property by virtue of a power given by this clause <e> <s> it contains no power to transfer a single iota of any property whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave of the house could my noble friend point to the power which is given to the minister in this clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am wondering whether perhaps my noble friend would be kind enough to point to the power that he says is given to the secretary of state by this clause <e>", "<cs> my lords the pcw case has recently been taken over by the serious fraud office <e> <s> since march substantial progress has been made in the police investigation and in particular swiss witnesses have travelled to london and made statements <e> <s> regrettably however notwithstanding the personal intervention of my right honourable and learned friend the attorney-general at a meeting with the swiss head of the federal justice and police department it is still proving very difficult to obtain important documents from switzerland <e> <s> strenuous efforts continue to be made <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable and learned friend the attorney-general who has responsibility for the matter is satisfied that adequate legal accountancy and police expertise are available to the serious fraud office for the conduct of the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly not conscious of having made any such statement <e> <s> i can see that such statements might in some circumstances carry a certain degree of risk <e>", "<cs> the governments consultations on the higher education white paper produced two different views on the size and composition of the boards of governors for the higher education corporations <e> <s> some argued as my noble friend has just done that the proposals in the bill did not go far enough to limit the size of these boards <e> <s> others argued that these plans went too far that the board should be as fully representative of staff students and other bodies as many governing bodies now are <e>", "<cs> the governments plans as set out in <e>", "<cs> in case the noble baroness has been rather quick in that perhaps i should say that i was taking it that the amendment meant and <e>", "<cs> that the student body may have an important contribution to make is recognised by the fact that we have made the proposal to have a student <e> <s> it is said that a single <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble baroness lady seear that in my first response i concentrated on that aspect of the matter because i understood it to be the main aspect being concentrated upon in support of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not sure what part the quality of imagination will play at this juncture <e>", "<cs> i could make some reference to experience but i do not propose to do so <e> <s> however i shall point out the experience that has already been referred to by the noble lord lord grimond <e> <s> he has told us as i understand the position that as rector of the university of aberdeen he had the right to appoint one person as his assessor to be a member of the university court <e> <s> he did that <e> <s> the result was that there was in this distinguished body the university court of the university of aberdeen during his tenure of office as rector one student and one student <e>", "<cs> we have had a very interesting debate and it would only be fair for me to draw the attention of my right honourable friend to all that has been said and perhaps when we come back on report i shall be able to answer the question that my noble friend has just put to me <e>", "<cs> it was not intended to be ungracious <e>", "<cs> the polytechnics and colleges will be independent statutory corporations <e> <s> the bill therefore deliberately allows the boards of governors to amend their subsequent composition within the broad constraints of the legislation <e> <s> it is highly possible that something that might be called the broad balance may continue but it does not appear right to put any limitation on the boards independence to require them always to maintain the initial balance established by the secretary of state <e> <s> furthermore circumstances may alter in the future and it may not be appropriate to retain the initial balance in all changes of circumstance <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness may feel able to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> the government are very happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for drawing attention to the provision in higher education for the special educational needs of disabled students <e> <s> generally speaking special courses for the disabled are the province of the schools and the further education colleges <e> <s> disabled students entering higher education study alongside their able-bodied peers but they may need special facilities to gain access to buildings or aids to study <e> <s> i pay tribute to those disabled students whose determination to overcome handicap wins them places in higher education and to the institutions which provide for them <e>", "<cs> i sought to deal with the point made by the noble lord lord hylton and i think that my comments also dealt with the point made by the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> special courses for the disabled are the province of the schools and further education colleges <e> <s> that is the general position <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to follow the noble lord in that direction <e> <s> however the clause proposes the vesting of these properties without any compensation <e> <s> the argument for not compensating local authorities is that for the most part the assets now used in local authority higher education were acquired under arrangements which shared the cost between ratepayers and taxpayers on a national basis <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the words sought to be deleted is to make it plain that the mere change of employer would not in any way detrimentally affect the right conferred by this subsection <e> <s> i should have thought that clarification was desirable but if the noble lord thinks it is not i certainly will read what he said <e> <s> but it seems to me that it is highly desirable to make that plain <e>", "<cs> what it means is this <e> <s> the employee will have a right against a new employer as if the new employer was the old employer <e> <s> but if on the change something detrimental to the employee is introduced the employee will have a right to terminate <e> <s> however the mere change of itself will not confer a right to terminate and it is that last point that these words that the noble lord has sought to delete make clear <e> <s> that is the position and perhaps i may repeat it <e>", "<cs> the intention is that the funding councils we are dealing here with the universities funding council will be executive bodies <e> <s> they need to be small enough to reach effective decisions <e> <s> the maximum of members for the ufc including the chairman and chief executive was recommended by the committee which reviewed the university grants committee chaired by the noble lord lord croham <e> <s> we believe that that number is right <e> <s> a body of members with the number of academic and lay members increased accordingly would be too large to be effective <e>", "<cs> i think it very possible that a trade unionist might have shown capacity in industrial matters <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> i have already said most of what i should like to say as regards the amendments <e> <s> however the idea that the government are not distinguishing between the universities and the technical colleges is not well founded <e> <s> we have gone to considerable lengths to distinguish between the funding arrangements for universities and those for higher educational establishments which are not universities <e> <s> that is an important distinction which is enshrined in the bill and emphasises the governments commitment to the universities <e>", "<cs> first perhaps i may say that so far as concerns northern ireland the reason for that is rather technical <e>", "<cs> the principal power in the bill relating to this matter is contained in clause <e>", "<cs> i do not know the precise extent of the growth in the detail that has been required and would not from my own experience be able to vouch that it was exponential over the past five years <e> <s> but i think i am entitled to point to the fact that my right honourable friend intends to appoint a universities funding council made up of persons as i tried to describe earlier with a good deal of experience of life as well as of university life <e> <s> they will be responsible for the administration of the system <e> <s> i believe the committee can have reasonable confidence that men of experience in business do not wish to waste money on detail for details sake <e>", "<cs> i yield to none in my respect for the work of nobel prize winners <e> <s> however i believe that the amendment which the noble earl has <e>", "<cs> the government have made clear as the noble lord has said that they are seeking to encourage higher education institutions to be enterprising in attracting funds from sources other than the ugc now and the ufc in the future <e> <s> a diversified funding base is one of the best safeguards of institutional autonomy <e> <s> some university interests assert that the government encourage private funding solely in order to spare the public purse <e> <s> that is not so <e> <s> we have consistently made clear and i confirm now that our annual settlement of overall public support is entirely independent of university success in raising more private funds taking the matter as a whole <e>", "<cs> i am just about to deal with that very point <e> <s> the total amount that the government pay out is not affected by private funding <e> <s> that is the fundamental point <e> <s> if private funding to university x is high and the research grant to university x is higher as a result a university which has not been so successful in attracting research money from outside will receive less out of the total <e> <s> theefore there is an implied reduction <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should answer the second point first <e> <s> this is a provision which gives the council power to provide the secretary of state with information <e> <s> in other words it gives it an initiative <e> <s> it is not dealing with whether the secretary of state can ask the council for information <e> <s> it is the initiative of the council that is here in question <e>", "<cs> certainly i believe that it is quite a normal phrase and what i say is that it is a very appropriate phrase in the circumstances of this provision <e>", "<cs> it means that among other things <e> <s> for example it could be verbally or in writing <e> <s> it could be at a meeting although the precise manner may not be as restricted as that <e> <s> however private or public would be one of the possible options <e>", "<cs> that is an important point and in answer to the noble lord i should like to say that the council has power <e>", "<cs> the situation is that a determination is required and it seems right that that should be a determination by the secretary of state <e> <s> i do not see that it could be an alternative to the council in the way in which this clause proceeds <e> <s> as i said on the earlier amendment sir mark richmond appeared to believe from the quotation that i read from him that this was a reasonable arrangement <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will feel that someone has to determine the manner and where it has to be someone the secretary of state would be the appropriate person <e>", "<cs> there may be some misunderstanding between the noble lord lord dainton and myself and possibly also the noble earl lord halsbury <e> <s> the universities funding council will have the right to take the initiative <e> <s> the only question is on the manner in which the communication should be done <e> <s> that could be determined by the secretary of state through a much more general determination than in relation to particular pieces of information <e>", "<cs> i certainly agree that parliament will want to know what the ufc is doing <e> <s> i would expect the decisions of the council to be announced rather as the ugc decisions are announced at the present time <e> <s> it is provided that the ufc will report formally to parliament by accounts on the use of the funds at its disposal <e> <s> the necessary provision is made for this in paragraph of schedule under which both the councils statement of accounts and the comptroller and auditor-generals report on them will be required to be laid before both houses of parliament <e> <s> to require anything more than this seems at best superfluous and at worst the kind of time-wasting distraction that none of us would like to see <e>", "<cs> perhaps the best thing i can say is that my right honourable friend has no intention of unreasonably pressing for information <e> <s> the information that he would like given to him is information that it would be reasonable to require <e> <s> i do not believe that it is necessary to express that point in the way it is in the amendment <e>", "<cs> the purpose of clause is to define the powers of the ufc having established the ufc <e> <s> at present the universities are funded by the secretary of state by means of the ugc with no statutory backing whatsoever <e> <s> large sums of public money are disbursed annually to universities and it is proper that those arrangements should be put on a statutory basis <e>", "<cs> there are no other purposes in setting up the universities funding council than to create a universities funding council with statutory powers accountable to parliament <e> <s> that is the reason for it as i understand it <e> <s> it is to make efficient arrangements along the lines suggested by the croham committee which studied the situation in the universities <e> <s> after all the university grants committee has been running a long time <e> <s> the amount of money now going through it is very large indeed <e> <s> it seems right that there should be proper arrangements and that is the reason for these provisions <e>", "<cs> this amendment raises the important question of the future of certain nationally significant lower level courses of further education currently provided in polytechnics and colleges transferring to the polytechnics and colleges funding council sector <e> <s> the government recognise that this is a matter of concern both within the ilea polytechnics and more widely <e>", "<cs> i note what the noble lord says and i hope that perhaps we may be able to reassure him eventually <e> <s> there is a fair amount to say about these amendments grouped together and certainly i shall listen to anything that the noble lord has to say in due course <e> <s> i understand that tonight may not be the most convenient time <e>", "<cs> on behalf of the government i sympathise with the sentiments behind the <e>", "<cs> i believe that there is some misunderstanding about the significance of the mode of attendance weightings in schedule to the bill <e> <s> i should like to try to put the true position on record <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to notify the house in accordance with the royal assent act that the queen has signified her royal assent to the following acts <e>", "<cs> in moving the amendment the noble lord lord morton of shuna illustrated at least one difficulty which may arise in defining the idea of academic freedom in the faculty of divinity in the university of edinburgh <e> <s> however that is not the main purpose of the amendment <e>", "<cs> if members of the committee are anxious to get home i am very anxious to speak <e> <s> i can see that there are one or two others who wish to make a contribution and it is in deference to them that i have not i am grateful for that which i might take as a welcome <e> <s> the government have always been committed to the view that the concept of academic freedom is a valuable one <e> <s> it has been expressed eloquently in words which have been adopted in the amendment moved by the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead <e> <s> the government have no desire whatsoever to damage that concept or put it in peril <e>", "<cs> i believe that that is a slightly different point from the general one and depends on the precise definition of redundancy which is used and which is the subject of amendments to which we shall come later <e> <s> if the noble lord will allow me i would rather concentrate on the general case <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that is not the way that my mind was working on that occasion <e> <s> i was saying that justice and fairness applied to the question of an academic dismissal would also imply the need to respect academic freedom as i would understand it in general terms <e> <s> therefore to add to the concept of academic freedom to the concepts of justice and fairness would in the circumstances add nothing at all <e> <s> if one added that concept the court in accordance with the ordinary construction would have to say we have justice we have fairness but parliament has added this extra academic freedom <e> <s> what extra effect does that have in this context <e> <s> that is a difficulty <e>", "<cs> for brevitys sake i mentioned that we were proposing to bring forward agreements procedure which would have an effect on that <e> <s> i therefore concentrated on dismissals as the paradigm case <e>", "<cs> what i was seeking to say was that on analysis of the concept of academic freedom the most appropriate expression for it in the context of the bill would be an expression of matters which were excluded as grounds for dismissal to take the paradigm case and also grounds for other adverse actions such as not allowing classes to be taught and so on points to which the noble lord lord peston referred <e> <s> that is what i have in mind <e>", "<cs> that is certainly my intention <e> <s> it is my fervent hope that we shall have such an amendment by that stage <e> <s> i cannot give a cast-iron guarantee as the noble lord will understand but it is as near that as i can properly do <e>", "<cs> i think it is important in considering this amendment to understand the job of the commissioners <e> <s> that job is to make appropriate provisions in the statutes of each of the qualifying institutions for procedures for dismissal which are just and fair <e> <s> the reason for having commissioners is that each of the universities is somewhat different <e> <s> there are differences between the institutions which are important in considering what their statutory procedures should be for the dismissal of academic staff <e> <s> but that has nothing whatever to do with how long the courses are or what the school education system is and even less to do with questions of a more general kind <e>", "<cs> it is quite obvious that the commissioners have to have regard to the need <e>", "<cs> the powers of the commissioners are clearly laid down subject to any amendments that may still be made in clause <e> <s> certainly the purposes of the commissioners on this occasion do not include anything like those to which the noble lord referred <e>", "<cs> i think that quality is important <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the clause is to give a brief reference to the provisions that the qualifying institutions are to be engaged on in relation to questions on procedures for the dismissal of academic staff <e> <s> the charters statutes or constitutions of universities are the documents to which one must look to see what is being provided in detail <e> <s> i should have grave difficulty in believing that one could provide education in any proper sense of that expression which did not include teaching and the exercise of judgment <e> <s> i should have thought that that is at least one distinction between providing education and simply imparting information <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord referred to a later amendment i think he was drawing a distinction between paragraphs c and d of amendment no <e> <s> b <e>", "<cs> these provisions would require an institution to demonstrate that there was a genuine economic necessity before it embarked on any redundancy programme and that the selection of persons for redundancy was fair and just <e> <s> i would accept that that is in general a reasonable requirement but we are meeting it in a different way under government amendment no <e> <s> zab which we shall come to in due course <e> <s> the commissioners are already required in exercising their functions to have regard to the principles of justice and fairness <e> <s> they must do just that when they propose modifications to statutes enabling institutions to dismiss staff for redundancy <e> <s> the commissioners must also establish just and fair appeals arrangements for staff under notice of dismissal or who are dismissed <e> <s> that should ensure that staff have an effective means of testing the grounds for their dismissal <e> <s> the removal of the jurisdiction of the visitor to which i referred earlier has the effect that staff would now be able to go to the courts like anyone else <e>", "<cs> yes i think that so far as concerns the provisions of the employment protection consolidation act there is no burden at <e>", "<cs> i quite appreciate that the problems facing a university might be different from those facing some other types of organisation <e> <s> but i believe the need for the dismissal itself to be just and fair which is enjoined by the procedures which the commissioners are to determine has the effect that in a redundancy situation the procedure by which the person is selected for redundancy should be just and fair <e> <s> the precise way in which it should be done may vary according to the circumstances of the different university institutions <e> <s> i believe that this matter is sufficiently covered by the provisions which we already have in the bill <e>", "<cs> i believe that the question was directed to the noble lord before he sat down in the accustomed way <e> <s> as regards the point raised by the noble lord lord annan clause a requires that the statutes of the university should have inserted in them a provision enabling an appropriate body or any delegate of such a body to dismiss any members of the academic staff by reason of redundancy <e> <s> in other words if the university was hit by hard times it would be possible to dismiss anyone subject to the scheme if it existed <e>", "<cs> perhaps it might be wise for me to start by saying what i understand the procedure to be <e> <s> the commissioners powers are set out in clause <e> <s> they <e>", "<cs> clause is only required if something more than an ordinary exercise of the commissioners powers is required <e> <s> the commissioners powers are referred to in clause <e> <s> that may be sufficient in most cases but the exercise <e>", "<cs> the powers that parliament is giving to the commissioners are fairly closely defined <e> <s> there has to come a stage at which the business stops <e> <s> the noble lord complained about the complexity of the procedure and he now seeks perhaps it is unfair to say that because it is on a slightly different footing to add another stage <e> <s> if the powers are sufficiently clearly defined as i believe they are then it is appropriate that the privy council should be the body to deal with those matters <e>", "<cs> the amendment moved specifically by the noble lord lord peston in effect takes away the possibility of having untenured positions <e> <s> that is really the point we debated in respect of whether clause should stand part of the bill which could have been the place for this argument if it was wanted <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> i take these two amendments together as both propose in slightly different ways that the universities should be able to offer tenure in respect of particular appointments <e> <s> the difference between the amendment of the noble baroness and the noble earl lord halsbury and that of the noble lord lord pender is that the latter would allow dismissal on the ground of closure either of the department or the whole institution <e> <s> if such a drastic situation should occur it seems necessary that something of the kind should be provided <e>", "<cs> i do not think many members of the civil service are accoladed with tenure certainly certain offices are not <e> <s> the question is whether that particular form of accolade is the appropriate one <e> <s> at the very best the accolade must reflect something about the person up to that point <e> <s> tenure looks forward and those with the best possible reputations <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if the noble baroness cannot see the distinction between the accolade of tenure which after all is a rather rare accolade and other forms <e> <s> it seems to me to be a perfectly reasonable distinction <e> <s> i do not see why in this field new distinctions between the available accolades should be introduced <e> <s> once the th november has come <e>", "<cs> it is certainly a possible alternative accolade <e> <s> people who do well in academic life sometimes become professors <e> <s> that is a very large accolade <e> <s> occasionally they become vice-chancellors and principals and so on <e> <s> there are all sorts of accolades available by which to distinguish people <e> <s> why choose this particular one which makes it impossible to take account of changes of circumstance afterwards <e> <s> i can see that there are distinctions between people in respect of their history on appointment but not many people can foretell the future completely <e> <s> therefore it is in respect of lack of flexibility in the future that i say tenure is an unsuitable accolade <e> <s> i hope the committee will agree with me <e>", "<cs> i regard myself as having addressed the matter about which we are talking <e> <s> i understand the point <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will at least agree with that <e> <s> whether this is an appropriate form of distinction is the question <e> <s> some forms of distinction are appropriate i agree <e> <s> i think that i am right in saying that merit awards of pay are in place in at least some universities <e> <s> i know of one university where i learned something about the possibility of discriminating in pay between different members of the university <e> <s> and a fairly invidious job it was found to be <e> <s> however it is a possible way forward <e> <s> the advantage is that it is more flexible than accolade or awards of tenure <e>", "<cs> that is a forecast <e> <s> i believe that there are attractions in this country for some academics that would be sufficient to draw them back without the necessity of that security <e>", "<cs> it is difficult to give evidence about what will happen in the future which is what the noble earl is talking about <e> <s> if the noble baroness can indicate that it would be helpful <e> <s> the best i can do is to suggest that the mere fact that there is no tenure does not mean that no people of academic distinction will wish to take positions in the academic life of this country <e> <s> i do not believe it for a moment <e>", "<cs> i shall also speak to amendment no <e> <s> c in this group <e> <s> the bill at present in clause a requires the commissioners to exercise their powers with a view to securing that the statutes of each qualifying institution include provisions enabling an appropriate body or any delegate of such a body to dismiss any member of the academic staff by reason of redundancy whether or not in pursuance of a scheme established for the purpose <e> <s> that was open to a certain amount of misunderstanding <e> <s> it was thought that if there was a scheme it could be disregarded <e> <s> we have concluded as a result of the reconsideration of this that the last words <e>", "<cs> the essential amendment is that to which the noble earl has spoken and which creates the possibility of fixed-term contracts <e> <s> it would be fair to say that in the circumstances to which he referred where the research is funded in a particular way the likelihood of redundancy in respect of that research is very much reduced <e> <s> the view that the government have taken and which i venture to suggest is reasonable is that one ought to have a situation in which the general provisions are as we have put them that is preserving the possibility of redundancy but in many of the cases to which the noble earl has referred that would be theoretical only <e> <s> if one introduced fixed-term contracts one would have the same sort of rigidity in respect of changes of circumstances as is occasioned by tenure <e> <s> there has been a growth in recent years of fixed-term appointments due to the difficulty created by tenure especially in those universities which confer tenure <e> <s> i therefore hope that the noble earl will feel able to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not think i said that the possibility of redundancy was limited altogether <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> i said earlier that we had put down amendments on grievance procedure which were withdrawn after representations from the vice-chancellors <e> <s> the grievance procedure relates to complaints by members of the university staff <e> <s> i explained that that had been put down and withdrawn <e>", "<cs> i sought to explain this point in my speech at second reading in answer to a point which the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton made in his speech at that time <e> <s> there may be some misunderstanding here <e> <s> it has to do with the amendments which in due course we shall have moved as amendments to the amendments we are considering now <e> <s> before i come to that perhaps i should say in answer to the noble lord lord morton of shuna that the words which i used a moment ago are read a little short the words that are in this amendment <e>", "<cs> that rather depends on what he is suggesting <e> <s> let us assume that he is not complaining about the propriety of the internal procedures and that he accepts that he has been effectively dismissed by the university <e> <s> in that case he has the industrial tribunal open to him and there is nothing in this provision that cuts out the industrial tribunal procedures <e> <s> he has the right to go to the industrial tribunal <e>", "<cs> i never said that justice fairness and academic freedom were synonymous <e>", "<cs> i do not mind doing that if the committee thinks that it would help <e> <s> this is a reasonable procedure to have in the bill <e> <s> if the committee feels strongly about it i would wish to go along with the committees views <e> <s> the provision is distinct <e> <s> we are talking about complaints against members of the university <e> <s> it would seem reasonable to have a procedure subject to justice and fairness by which they could be dealt <e>", "<cs> i must be becoming short of the ability to explain <e> <s> what i said was that these are <e>", "<cs> i believe that i did answer but i am always willing to answer again not for the first time <e> <s> having put down the amendment and members of the committee having seen it i do not feel particularly anxious to withdraw it unless the committee feels that it would be particularly helpful <e> <s> but as the noble earl lord halsbury said we have these other amendments to consider as well <e> <s> i should have thought that no harm would be done by keeping this amendment in and looking at the others which will be amendments to amendment no <e> <s> zab <e>", "<cs> i do not see any particular harm in doing that <e> <s> i certainly intend to bring it back in due course <e> <s> i may be that it will look better and even be easier to understand in the light of the other provisions of which i think it originally formed part <e> <s> in that situation i shall not invite the committee to agree tonight to amendment no <e> <s> zaa <e>", "<cs> i shall start at the beginning <e> <s> clause a confers power on in effect a university to dismiss a member by reason of redundancy <e> <s> clause b empowers it to dismiss a member for good cause <e> <s> it provides an appeal procedure with the object of ascertaining whether there was either redundancy or good cause <e> <s> if there is neither redundancy nor good cause there is no power to dismiss <e>", "<cs> that is my understanding and it has been since i spoke on second reading <e> <s> i took up this very point in my speech because i thought from what he said in his speech that the noble lord lord wedderburn had not grasped it <e> <s> i think that i was perhaps anticipating these amendments <e>", "<cs> yes the noble lord is correct <e>", "<cs> the answer is that if the complaint is that the internal procedures have not been properly followed the remedy would be judicial review as the noble lord lord wedderburn said <e> <s> if the person wishes to challenge dismissal the alternative is not to challenge dismissal but to go to an industrial tribunal on the basis that such dismissal is effective but gives rise to the remedies available in an industrial tribunal that is reinstatement re-engagement or damages according to the situation <e>", "<cs> i shall try to put the point as briefly as possible <e> <s> if i employ someone and dismiss <e>", "<cs> i do not think i am capable of explaining it any further than i have done already <e> <s> the position is quite clear <e> <s> i do not believe that the ordinary case for judicial review would be on rationality <e> <s> it would be on some procedural failure <e> <s> one would expect the merits of the appeal system would be such as to test the merits <e> <s> there might be an extremely exceptional case but it would be extremely exceptional <e> <s> i expect noble lords wish to proceed <e>", "<cs> i dealt with this earlier as i did also the amendment of the noble lord lord pender which follows immediately <e> <s> the idea was that it might be possible to give special people tenure <e> <s> i explained why i thought that that was not a good idea <e> <s> i have therefore sought to answer this <e>", "<cs> the bill contains a definition of redundancy which includes the situation where an institution suffers financial stringency and decides that one way to meet that deficiency would be to have certain work done at a lower level than it is in fact normally done and thus save money for the university <e> <s> after all redundancies are all in a sense directed to saving money in a situation of financial stringency <e> <s> the extension here allows for a university where necessary on grounds of financial stringency to employ a junior employee to do a job previously carried out by a more senior person who would thereby become redundant <e>", "<cs> if i may say so with the greatest possible respect that is an excellent question <e> <s> the university may have a person at a high level <e> <s> when financial restrictions come along and it looks round it may ask why on earth it appointed a professor when the job could be done by a junior lecturer <e> <s> universities are fallible and they can make mistakes <e> <s> the point that i made earlier is that the decision must be reasonable <e> <s> it is not a case of the university arbitrarily saying we have a professor who we want to get rid of <e> <s> lets put a junior lecturer in his place <e> <s> it must be a reasonable decision <e> <s> it must also be against the background of financial stringency looking round for savings to try to <e>", "<cs> one expects that as he gets more expensive he will do different work <e> <s> the point that arises here is a difficult one <e> <s> i speak with a certain amount of recollection having been in universities for quite some time <e> <s> i found that there was a difference between a lecturer and a professor and a lecturer and a recently appointed junior lecturer <e> <s> the junior lecturer does not have the same job as the professor <e> <s> the noble earl shakes his head but this has certainly been my experience <e> <s> i have listened to professors and to junior lecturers <e> <s> i must say not without exception that i would have rather listened to the professors <e> <s> as the noble earl says a junior lecturer gets older he goes up the scales and he becomes a professor <e> <s> the reason for his increased status is that he is doing a different job <e>", "<cs> in the light of those observations and having regard to the time it is only right that i should agree to reconsider this matter without commitment <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> it was grouped with that amendment <e> <s> there are other considerations but as i have taken the other amendment back i shall also take this amendment into account <e>", "<cs> i have covered most of the matters arising from this amendment <e> <s> as i have taken back the amendment of the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for further consideration perhaps i may also take back this amendment <e>", "<cs> to deal first with amendment no <e> <s> a i intend to accept in principle that something along these lines may be necessary <e> <s> precisely what is not absolutely clear but i am prepared to undertake without any qualification that the church of scotland would be informed about changes connected with the chairs in which it has an interest <e>", "<cs> i indicated this afternoon in response to the amendments moved by the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead that i proposed to do this very thing as in my belief this was the area in which academic freedom was most important and in which amendments were likely to be effective <e> <s> the committee did not feel able to accept that in full satisfaction of what was going on this afternoon <e>", "<cs> i shall deal first with the general point <e> <s> the governments general intentions on the matter have been discussed for some time <e> <s> once the proposals were intimated it was thought right that that should be the cut-off date <e> <s> there are <e>", "<cs> the explanation is that the position is changed in such a way that the person receives a new rate of remuneration <e> <s> that is as i understand the position <e> <s> in other words his former pay scale relates to the pay scale that he had in the appointment he held immediately before the change <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that that is the effect of the amendment <e> <s> i am happy to look at the matter again in the light of what the noble lord has said in the interests of trying to make progress <e>", "<cs> it is often possible to make a bargain subject to adjustment of certain things later <e> <s> the point that arises here is that th november has been clearly stated as the date at which tenure would be stopped <e> <s> people have taken decisions i have no doubt in the light of that <e> <s> while i see the force of what has been said it is always possible to take account in discussion and in deciding what to do of the probability of action that is to happen <e> <s> as the noble lord lord peston said people might have reached the conclusion that it was quite likely that this legislation would ultimately reach the statute book with th november in it <e>", "<cs> yes unless there was simply a change of name which is possible <e> <s> however the amendment makes it clear that if the salary change is of a kind which is described in paragraph b then the situation will be covered by the amendment <e> <s> the mere fact that a person is called a senior lecturer does not necessarily mean that the salary is improved <e> <s> if the lecturer and senior lecturer grades are quite different the promotion to the senior lecturer grade would in the normal case mean that tenure was lost <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord adrian said there are a number of important colleges in respect of which the lord chancellor is the visitor and in a personal way i am sorry that there should be any diminution of those relationships <e> <s> on the other hand one probably has to take a decision in a broad way and then apply it fairly generally <e> <s> this view was taken in consequence and also because of the widening of the matters referred to in this bill <e>", "<cs> i thought that i ought to move the amendment and ask the committee to approve it and tell my right honourable friend about <e>", "<cs> it is somewhat gratifying to the government to find that there is so much enthusiasm for the procedures in relation to tenure that they have proposed for the universities that the noble earl and the noble baroness wish them to be extended to polytechnics and those other institutions which receive funds from the colleges funding council <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to consolidate certain enactments relating to the prosecution and punishment including the punishment without conviction of road traffic offences with amendments to give effect to recommendations of the law commission and the scottish law commission <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to make provision for repeals including a repeal to give effect to a recommendation of the law commission and the scottish law commission consequential amendments transitional and transitory matters and savings in connection with the consolidation of enactments in the road traffic act and the road traffic offenders act <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords for the reason that i sought to explain in my opening submission i beg to move that the bill be referred to the joint committee on consolidation bills <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for what they have said about the statement <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has found himself in rather a unique position but for me a most important one in that he has no criticism to offer of my right honourable and learned friend the attorney-general nor of his officials in the matter <e> <s> it is quite clear that they have meticulously followed what they were asked to do <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble and learned friend lord hailsham of saint marylebone recognised it is not for me to offer any comment on the judical decision <e> <s> i have of course told the house that the attorney-general said that the result was deeply dismaying <e> <s> i am sure that we can all agree with that <e> <s> i also mentioned just to confirm the point that out of the urgent consultations has come the decision taken on behalf of the irish state to appeal that decision <e> <s> we look forward with expectation to the disposal of that matter <e> <s> it is right for me to emphasise once again the appreciation of my right honourable and learned friend of the action taken by the irish state in the circumstances with which it was faced by that judicial decision <e>", "<cs> my lords it is comparatively easy to make technical changes which might increase the flexibility of the orders a court may make on divorce <e> <s> i am considering that point carefully <e> <s> the essential difficulty is that in relation to pensions the event to be dealt with must be funded <e> <s> the provision that has been made in most pension schemes this applies to the point about which my noble friend lady young is principally concerned relates to marriage and widowhood and does not apply additionally in respect of divorce <e> <s> the problem is that further funds are required if an additional arrangement is to be made with regard to divorce <e> <s> the courts on an order in respect of divorce cannot deal with that problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord draws attention to a difficulty of which i am well aware <e> <s> the representations that were made to me by my noble friend lady young and the representatives that she arranged should see me would have alerted me to that difficulty if i had not already known about it <e> <s> i shall give a typical case of where a husband is working and the wife not having worked is divorced <e> <s> of course the matter operates the other way round as well <e> <s> where the husband and wife are divorced there will be a provision in the pension scheme for the husband to enjoy a pension <e> <s> some part of that pension can be diverted from him to the wife and the court has power to arrange that <e> <s> if he is not married at his death the provisions which normally exist in a pension scheme in favour of a widow do not operate so there is no money available to divert to anyone at that stage <e> <s> that is the real difficulty <e> <s> pension schemes provided by third parties <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly it would <e> <s> perhaps i may elaborate a little <e> <s> the point is that when the state scheme says that a person can opt out of it provided he makes a guaranteed minimum provision which includes widows then the people who are operating that private scheme have to pay for it <e> <s> there has to be a provision which gives rise to contributions of money for that purpose <e> <s> if in addition there were to be a provision that divorced wives had also to be provided for that is a further provision which would require the contributors both the employee and the employer to provide additional money <e> <s> it is not usual although it may not be impossible for people to provide for their divorced wives in the same way as they do for their widows <e> <s> it is that requirement which underlies the difficulty highlighted here <e> <s> nothing that i can do by way of changing the law with regard to rights on divorce can meet the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords a proportion of the husbands pension could certainly go in part to the divorced wife <e> <s> there is no problem about that <e> <s> so long as that money is there it is for the court to say how it is divided <e> <s> there may be some slight technical problem about the precise form in which that result could be achieved <e> <s> that is an aspect of what this paper was about <e> <s> but that result can be achieved perhaps not in the most elegant form by the powers which the court now has that is to say diverting from the divorced husband part of his pension <e> <s> there is no problem about that <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble and learned friend is aware the consultation paper was dealing with the situation after the death of the husband <e> <s> of course it is possible for arrangements to be made in which existing money part of the joint estate is used for a particular purpose <e> <s> it would be perfectly possible to achieve the result that some part of the husbands money should be used to provide an annuity for his divorced wife after his death <e> <s> that of course would be at the expense of his estate <e> <s> it can be done <e>", "<cs> i venture to intervene because i think that the noble lord <e> <s> lord morton of shuna may not be taking account of the fact that paragraph of schedule provides for a demand note in a situation other than the ordinary situation which is provided for in paragraph of schedule to the act of <e> <s> in effect it says that to take the paradigm case where there is joint and several liability and one of the persons has not paid there will be a possibility of a demand in respect of that persons liability against the person who is jointly and severally liable with that person <e> <s> that is the demand that can occur after the failure of payment by the first person who is in question <e>", "<cs> this could go on subject to patience almost indefinitely <e> <s> the noble lord will notice that in schedule amending schedule to the act it states <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house after some interval it may be appropriate to have such a review <e> <s> however the initiative for that must be generated by the way that the developments proceed <e> <s> it is very hard to say at the moment exactly what period of time would make such a review right <e> <s> certainly the government are by no means ruling out the possibility of a review <e> <s> there will be a certain amount of monitoring available from the accounts of the funding councils <e> <s> one would be able to see how things are developing to some extent <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it that the amendment is not moved <e>", "<cs> my lords the boards of governors will he responsible for the overall strategy of the institutions <e> <s> they will need to be small and cohesive enough to take key decisions <e> <s> they have to include a strong voice for lay members to ensure that the institutions are responsive to the wider world and particularly to the needs of employers <e> <s> i believe that we all agree with that <e>", "<cs> my lords i replied to a similar amendment moved by the noble lord in committee <e> <s> he has quoted somewhat extensively from the reasons that i gave on that occasion <e> <s> no doubt i could improve on them even more if i took up the time of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the government sympathise with the reason which prompts the amendment <e> <s> the question is whether the aim is best achieved by an amendment of this sort or whether that is achieved in other ways <e>", "<cs> my lords as i undertook to do i have with my colleagues reconsidered this matter <e> <s> the situation is that i am not able to accept this amendment <e> <s> however the noble lord lord peston has tabled amendment no <e> <s> za which deals with the possibility of part-time students being independent or additional nominee members and i am prepared to accept that amendment in principle <e> <s> there is perhaps a small technical difficulty but as i said i accept it in principle and will produce an appropriate amendment at third reading to give effect to it <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house that was a point mentioned at the committee stage that students tend to be present for a shorter time than the staff and are therefore perhaps more inexperienced <e> <s> that was one of the reasons for suggesting that there should be two nominees rather than one <e> <s> these points arising from the committee stage have been considered by my colleagues and myself <e> <s> as regards alternates i believe i am right in saying that clause of the bill provides for proxies for the governing bodies if the articles of government so provide <e> <s> in answer to the noble baroness lady white that provision would certainly be possible <e>", "<cs> my lords we are prepared to accept the amendment so that part-time students would be allowed on the governing bodies <e> <s> i cannot accept it as it is without further amendment because it would require a definition of full-time to apply to the schedule <e> <s> the noble lord has used the words full-time in the amendment <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that there are definitions of full-time in other parts of the bill and we require to apply an appropriate definition of full-time to this schedule so that the noble lords amendment would have its full effect <e> <s> if with this explanation the noble lord is willing to withdraw the amendment i undertake to bring back at third reading an amendment which is in the same terms on this matter but tries to deal with the definition point which i have mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords no one who listened to the noble baroness who moved the amendment speaking either now or in committee could fail to appreciate the power of her eloquence or the case she was making <e> <s> the question is whether it is appropriate to make the amendment part of the bill <e> <s> the purpose of clause is to confer on the higher education corporations broad powers to provide further and higher education <e> <s> special courses for the disabled are usually the province of the schools and further education colleges <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said that is an aspect of the matter which so far as i know has not been brought to my attention before <e> <s> it is obviously a matter of great importance to the house and if the noble baroness is willing to withdraw the amendment i shall certainly undertake to bring this aspect of the matter to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state so that he can consider it <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord repeat the reference which he has just given <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the point about the requirement to provide information i think it is fairly plain that the information to be supplied is for the purposes of the subject matter of the provision <e> <s> therefore i do not think that it could be objectionable for the reason which is mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls is in my view absolutely correct <e> <s> one needs to look at this matter a little more thoroughly <e> <s> where a person is employed by a and a decides to give up his business and hand it over to h the employee is not obliged to go to b a by giving up will breach his contract with the employee in the normal course <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment seeks to add a new category to the transferees to whom assets may be transferred on the dissolution of a higher education corporation

leave of the house perhaps i may answer <e> <s> i believe that the idea is to provide for the situation which would arise in the rather sad event which might trigger the provision <e> <s> the idea is to give the secretary of state the power to make the best use of the property as the circumstances of that time may dictate <e> <s> i suspect that the reason that the list contains two categories rather than one is simply the drafting reason that the body corporate should come after the natural person <e> <s> the natural person should come first and the body corporate should come second <e>

to choose <e> <s> i suspect that the order has been dictated by drafting considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to extend this debate further <e> <s> it seems to me that whoever will be properly appointed a member of the universities funding council will be able to appreciate that not all universities are the same and will take account of the differences in carrying out his or her function <e> <s> i am the first to accept that there are differences between universities in scotland and those in england wales and northern ireland <e> <s> as has already been pointed out by people with more experience of university administration than i have although i have some experience of being a beneficiary of it there are many differences between universities in scotland england and so on

observations on that point made by the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> the discussion of scottish affairs here is good and welcome <e> <s> the reason that the government consider it inappropriate to

attention to the importance for our higher education system of part-time as well as full-time provision <e> <s> i think it is already widely recognised and about per cent <e> <s> of the students in higher education are part-time <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord and the noble lord lord briggs and the noble baroness lady blackstone who supported him that the word education in clauses and of the bill covers all types of education and that the word research covers all types of research both full-time and part-time <e> <s> it is not necessary to explain that on the face of the bill <e> <s> the more detail of that kind one puts in the more questions one raises about other words and whether they also have to be as it were expanded <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it this is a debate in connection with a particular amendment <e> <s> i should be interested in knowing how the objectives that have been spoken of are particularly advanced by the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead has referred to the matter of academic freedom and the previous debate <e> <s> i should like to point out that at that stage we were discussing the question of academic freedom in relation to the procedures for dismissal <e> <s> the amendment which he moved into the bill with the approval of your lordships was concerned with that matter and it was into that part of the bill that the particular amendment was included as an aspect of academic freedom <e>", "<cs> my lords i would be extremely interested to know what that distinction is in the context of this amendment <e> <s> does the noble lord wish to add to what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords that strikes me as a very helpful but remarkable suggestion because it means that these great sentiments are so easily satisfied by using words which do not mean anything different from the words in the bill and that all these great difficulties can be resolved <e> <s> that shows something about the nature of the difficulties <e> <s> if the problem is as easily resolved as that it cannot be much of a problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord swann made a quotation which is not one with which i am familiar <e> <s> i certainly do not know the full context <e> <s> i certainly do not regard it as the final statement of government policy on this matter <e> <s> in answering this amendent before your lordships i have sought to state what is the policy of the government <e> <s> i said also that the secretary of state is responsible for this matter and he has made his attitude abundantly plain <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the view of the secretary of state is that the universities funding council in giving out money to universities may regard it as important to make certain conditions as to the application of the money <e> <s> in general i would not expect those conditions to be particularly detailed <e> <s> i would expect them to be on the same lines as those which are presently followed by the university grants committee <e> <s> then i would expect that the university obtaining the money would be bound to observe those conditions <e> <s> if the university received money on the basis that it has courses in sanskrit arabic and pure mathematics i hope it would be understood that it would provide those courses and that it would not give the money to philosophy politics or something else <e> <s> general conditions of that kind appear to be perfectly appropriate <e> <s> we are talking about an amendment <e> <s> we are not conducting a second reading debate although perhaps some of my observations may sound like that <e> <s> the amendment which the noble lord has proposed with all his skill and experience in edinburgh and elsewhere does not advance the cause

policy <e> <s> government policy is determined from time to time in the light of circumstances <e> <s> clause is proposed as part of a structure which we feel to be much more satisfactory as a permanent structure for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i have sought to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question but that the existence of a structure such as clause would be of extreme value if a situation of that kind were to recur <e> <s> but i should not like it to be thought that the sole motivation behind the production of clause was to assist the noble baroness to deal with the difficulties that were faced in some parts of the principality <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first question that the noble lord lord peston asked just reading the clause it seems to me that paragraphs a and b have to be satisfied in respect of the persons who are to be selected under the first branch <e> <s> if that is not the intention i shall certainly see whether we cannot do something about it <e> <s> that is the way the clause appears to me <e>", "<cs> my lords with his usual acumen the noble lord has forecast what i had in mind to say <e> <s> i should be wasting the time of the house if i tried to say in different words what i have said already in relation to other amendments <e> <s> it is difficult to see why a particular group should be singled out <e> <s> the idea is not so much to have <e>", "<cs> my lords the idea that the government amendment is verbose waffle does not exactly fill me with pleasure <e> <s> with respect to the noble lord lord morton of shuna that is not an accurate description of the amendment <e> <s> the phrase in brackets in amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords seven professions come within the professions suplementary to medicines act of which physiotherapy is one <e> <s> there are courses in the united kingdom leading to state registration as a physiotherapist <e> <s> of these are run within the national health service one is provided by an independent establishment and are provided by the education service <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the manuscript amendment moved by the noble lord lord adrian the government accept that amendment in principle <e> <s> that is to say the idea is that amendment no <e> <s> should apply only to institutions which receive money from the universities funding council <e> <s> that would of course equally exclude the university of buckingham <e>", "<cs> my lords the phrase policy objectives comes from the national audit act and is intended to apply across a wide range of institutions subject to the scrutiny of the comptroller and auditor general <e> <s> the phrase is one of general application <e> <s> i should have thought that it was at least as precise and capable of application as the phrase proposed by the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton as a replacement for the purposes of this type of institution namely <e>", "<cs> my lords when we discussed the matter in committee i sought to pay tribute to the noble lords strong commitment to continuing education as well as to his great services to it over many years <e> <s> the government share this commitment <e> <s> continuing education needs to be fostered for its essential role in promoting economic prosperity as well as for its contribution to personal development and social progress <e> <s> the government endorsed the importance of adult continuing education in the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i call amendment no <e> <s> dk <e> <s> if this amendment is agreed to i cannot call amendment no <e> <s> dl <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to answer briefly but still treat this matter and the arguments advanced as being of considerable importance <e> <s> the fact is that tenure has not been universal in the institutions of higher education in this country <e> <s> there are some which have had tenure and some which have not had it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a form of tenure which prevents the university from dismissing someone except for redundancy or good cause <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a form of tenure <e>", "<cs> my lords the most important point that i should like to make in respect of the amendment is that the special exclusion for staff on fixed-term contracts to which this would amount would place them in an anomalous position when redundancies were necessary <e> <s> it is not always easy to look forward to a situation where redundancy may be required <e> <s> if it could always be predicted it might be possible to ensure fairness between the different members of staff while conferring on some a fixed tenure of this kind <e> <s> however i believe that experience has shown that sometimes situations in which redundancy arises are created quite quickly <e> <s> the result of that is that one may well find that while a term has been allowed <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill already has provisions for appeal against dismissal and the dismissal aspect has been dealt with <e> <s> i agree that dismissal is perhaps the highest form of discipline so in a sense the procedure for dismissal would be included in procedures for discipline <e> <s> however this amendment is intended by way of addition to provide for procedures that will lead to results short of dismissal <e>", "<cs> my lords the background to the amendments is the part of the bill which deals with circumstances in which a member of the university staff who otherwise would be protected can be dismissed <e> <s> there must be justification <e> <s> if the official of the university is to be dismissed it must be as a result of the exercise of the powers which the bill gives in this context <e> <s> accordingly the power is conditioned on the circumstance that it is either by reason of redundancy or by reason of good cause <e> <s> unless the university has either redundancy as a reason sufficient in the circumstances or good cause as a reason sufficient in the circumstances the person will not be dismissed or the dismissal will not stand <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord hatch of lusby for asking that question because it enables me to say in advance what we are proposing to do in relation to the later amendments which deal with this question <e> <s> there is a famous set of eight words they have become famous so far as i am concerned in the provisions of the bill <e> <s> the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i am not sure whether it is in order <e> <s> however i am grateful to the noble earl and i shall take it that the amendment is not moved <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the amendments which i propose to accept have the same effect as the one proposed by the noble lord <e> <s> i am clear that the right result is obtained by deleting these eight words because they are the words which distinguish the redundancy provisions of this part of the bill from the redundancy provisions of the employment protection consolidation act <e> <s> that is why i prefer to do it this way <e> <s> to the best of my understanding of the amendment proposed by the noble lord it would certainly have the same effect in practice <e> <s> however if any doubt is raised in the noble lords mind by subsequent consultations before the third reading stage of the bill of course i shall certainly desire to give effect to them <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said <e> <s> i accept the amendment on behalf of the government for the reasons that i have given <e> <s> i do not entirely accept all that the noble lord said about the previous position <e> <s> but we need not go into that now <e> <s> i am grateful for what he said in thanking me <e> <s> let us try to end the matter on that note unless someone else has something to say <e>", "<cs> my lords there is perhaps still lurking behind the amendment some previous misunderstanding <e> <s> the provisions in the bill in relation to tenure or to conditions of employment to use an alternative phrase of academic staff are additional to their rights as employees under the ordinary law <e> <s> there never was any intention to detract from the rights of the university staff as employees in terms of the ordinary rights that an employee has under the employment protection act and other employment legislation <e> <s> the result of that is that the employment protection act applies to staff who are academic employees just as much as to any other kind of employee <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord morton said identical amendments to this one and to amendment no <e> <s> were put down at committee stage <e> <s> as i indicated i was sympathetic to the importance and the distinctive character of the institutions of both religion and law which characterise scotland <e> <s> i believe it is unthinkable as i said then and will repeat that the commissioners would ride roughshod over those institutions <e> <s> i expect they would give sympathetic consideration to the constitution of the universities as they are related to the church of scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought it would be reasonably happy <e> <s> but the point is that the bill as <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been the governments intention all along that staff who on or after th november the date of the introduction of the bill are appointed or who enter into contracts of employment or who are promoted should lose tenure when the modifications to the statutes of their institutions are approved <e>", "<cs> my lords the general provision so far as the bill is concerned is that the attaining of a new rate in a scale on which a person was operating would not amount to a promotion <e> <s> therefore if scale a has rates in it which are attainable by people who are in class b then it would not he a promotion <e> <s> if for example scale a the particular detail has not been given to me is a scale with a higher set of limits on it than scale b then the situation in which a lecturer moves from the scale he was on to a new scale at a higher level altogether and not attainable under his old scale would be a promotion <e> <s> that is a new condition of employment <e> <s> if he is a lecturer for example who is entitled to gradations in a given scale scale a with grade grade and grade to go up within the scale that is attainable by him would not be a promotion <e> <s> i hope that is reasonably plain <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this amendment proposes to do the same as the amendments with which we have just been dealing <e> <s> it seeks to exclude from this provision those who are promoted on or after th november <e> <s> that is what amendment no <e> <s> sought to do <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment as the noble earl has explained will result in tenure being retained by staff on transfer to another institution where it is certified by the funding council or the ugc as being for the purposes of restructuring <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to that question by the noble baroness i was really dealing with a person moving from one institution to another <e> <s> i said that where that happened the benefit of tenure would not be obtainable in the new appointment if it happened on or after th november <e> <s> i am not sufficiently familiar with the details of the situation facing the noble baroness to know whether it could reasonably be said that all that is happening in her situation is that a person is being moved within the same appointment to a new place of work <e>", "<cs> my lords it appears to me that the situation that the noble lord asks about would be this <e> <s> the commissioners may consider the matter and have reasonable grounds for supposing that the body in question was not one whose interests were sufficiently affected to make it proper for them to intimate to them <e> <s> if they could reasonably reach that decision they could take it and there would be no remedy for it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to advise the noble and learned lord of the remedy he would have if giving a client advice <e> <s> however if i had to advise i believe that judicial review is the most appropriate remedy <e> <s> what is more in the circumstances that he figured i should expect it to succeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects beg to move that the order of recommitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords again i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of recommitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords again and i hope finally i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of recommitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords my answer to the noble lords second supplementary question is as soon as parliamentary time is available <e> <s> so far as concerns the first question as he rightly said the report left the question of compulsion open <e> <s> at the moment legislation is being prepared but no final decision has yet been taken as to whether and to what extent there should be an element of compulsion <e> <s> the noble lord will know that other countries successfully operate condominium schemes without compulsion <e> <s> the question of compulsion remains under consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is so but i am speaking from memory <e> <s> i have not had an opportunity to check it <e> <s> i believe that that is probably right <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a situation which i should certainly wish to bear in mind in considering whether we should have compulsion and if so to what extent <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> i shall also speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> these amendments deal with the question of providing a passport to non-contributory legal aid for those in receipt of prescribed social security benefits primarily income support <e> <s> under the bill such an automatic passport was allowed for only in respect of advice and assistance under part iii <e> <s> by moving the power to clause which is what the amendments do it will enable regulations to <e>", "<cs> my lords as always i am seeking one word to explain an idea and i am sure that the noble and learned lord has the idea <e> <s> i hope that as the legal aid scheme is developed it will more and more give an impression of efficiency and speed <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> i should also speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> your lordships will remember that during the passage of the bill through this house i moved a number of amendments to the

that i gave the matter quite a lot of consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a recollection of a gentleman from killiecrankie who did just that without too much success <e> <s> the position is that part vi defines this special category including childrens cases <e> <s> if that stands we would not be able to take cases out of that category <e> <s> if however we have a power to put cases into the other categories it will give us a flexibility which i do not believe will be restricted in the way suggested by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> in the circumstances i believe that this is the wise

way harping back to the arguments about imprecise criteria that existed in the past for legal aid remuneration <e> <s> this subsection to which the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones referred provides that it shall be for the board to pay a clients solicitor for acting for him and to pay any fees due to counsel for so acting <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> it has always been the case that if a person suddenly acquired additional capital resources for example from an inheritance during the time he was receiving legal aid but after the initial means assessment his means will be re-assessed and he might be either ruled out of scope and have his certificate discharged or be required to pay an additional contribution from his new capital <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this amendment is consequential upon the

doubt that there will be any people requiring to sell their houses on that account <e> <s> so far as concerns reductions in prices which are contrary to the spirit of the initial agreement the same points that i made in relation to gazumping apply <e> <s> provided the agreement is entered into at the early stage that would be prevented <e> <s> therefore these matters operate in both directions according to circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i have yet to see practicable legislation which would be effective <e> <s> what is required to prevent gazumping is a legally-binding bargain <e> <s> it would be unusual to have legislation which forced people into a bargain when they did not want to enter into one <e> <s> therefore the answer is that if you want a bargain with the consequences of it you make one <e> <s> that seems to be a situation which does not require legislation in order to bring it about <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble and learned friend has said the law commission reports contain much wisdom <e> <s> however i believe that the essential point is the one i made which if the noble lord lord mishcon has not read the law commission reports i am sure he is perfectly capable of appreciating now <e>", "<cs> my lords the latest report to which the noble lord lord mishcon refers has nothing to do with gazumping <e> <s> no doubt that is why my noble and learned friend did not cover it in his question <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it would be wise for me to associate myself in any way with such speculation neither do i believe it to be true <e>", "<cs> my lords i have sought on other occasions publicly to air the views that i have been expressing this afternoon <e> <s> it is unwise to speak of the scottish system as being in any sense better <e> <s> it is of course different <e> <s> it has different effects but one of the effects may be that a purchaser could find himself with a legally binding bargain when on the whole he would prefer to be without one <e> <s> what is required therefore is that people understand the legal consequences of what they are doing whether in england wales or scotland <e> <s> if they want to do something different they should ask their advisers be they legal advisers or others to arrange matters in accordance with their wishes <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest possible respect i do not agree that legislation can deal with a situation where one party wants a contract and the other party does not <e> <s> i do not see why legislation should favour the one against the other <e>", "<cs> my lords if one person wants to make a legally binding bargain and can persuade the other side to agree to it i can see no reason why it should not happen <e> <s> i do not believe that estate agents as a class are incapable of entering into a binding legal bargain <e> <s> it is a question of what the parties want <e> <s> the mere fact that i want a legal bargain does not mean that the other side does and therefore we cannot have one <e> <s> if both sides want a legally binding bargain whether one side be an estate agent or not under the existing system i can see no reason why they cannot have one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to all noble lords who have spoken during the debate <e> <s> on this occasion i think i can claim unanimity in welcoming the bill in principle although i recognise the problems raised in <e>", "<cs> as the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones says perhaps indeed certainly for another bill if and when sufficient agreement is reached on these difficult matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that i am committed to this bill and desire to see it carried into effect that may be an adequate answer to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the background and reality of this matter was explained by the noble lord lord meston when he moved the amendment <e> <s> there is no doubt that in some cases there is a problem where one parent seeks to influence the child <e> <s> in practice there are more forms of influence than pressure for example by treating the child well <e> <s> i have come across cases in which a child has been showered with gifts and other excellent treats shortly before a court case no doubt in the hope that as a result the child will be favourably disposed towards the person providing the entertainment <e> <s> that result can be reached by more ways than pressure <e>", "<cs> i entirely understand the fundamental point that the noble baroness lady david has so clearly put before your lordships in connection with this amendment <e> <s> i think that we have sought to give effect to that principle in the way that the bill is drafted subject of course to the point which her amendment recognises that there may be situations in which the court making a balanced assessment of the whole matter concludes that the welfare of the child would go counter to the decision that the child has made <e>", "<cs> of course i agree that we have paragraphs a to g but that is put in the forefront of the considerations <e> <s> it cannot be overlooked even if the court were to become tired as i am sure it would not of reading the list <e> <s> that would certainly be at the forefront of its considerations <e>", "<cs> i am sure that those who know the noble baroness and who have read or listened to what she says would think of her not in any way as pompous but as simply putting a point of view based on her own valuable experiences as a school teacher <e> <s> i believe as my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale said that we have to look at the experience and views of the different people who come into contact with children parents teachers and as a last resort lawyers <e> <s> i hope that in the light of those considerations the noble baroness will feel able not to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the words that my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale wishes to leave out is to focus attention on the need for these particular factors to be regarded particularly when the order in question is opposed <e> <s> the idea of the checklist is to enable the court where the parties are at issue to make sure that not only are the matters that the parties are raising in question but also that the other matters listed are being taken into account <e>", "<cs> i believe that there may be some misunderstanding <e> <s> there is no intention to place any words of limitation on the discretion of the court <e> <s> what is to be done is to make it not obligatory on the court to have regard in particular to the full range of the checklist unless the case is opposed <e> <s> if the case is opposed then the court has an obligation to have regard to all the matters in the checklist <e> <s> the court is perfectly entitled to have regard to all matters in the checklist even if the case is not opposed but it does not have the duty to do so <e> <s> i believe that there may have been some misunderstanding for which i am responsible in not explaining the matter properly <e>", "<cs> i shall take that last question first <e> <s> the statute book would be longer if on every occasion the word he was used the word she had to be included where that was appropriate <e> <s> in order to try to simplify the statute book a little parliament decided to have a list of words which in the ordinary context would apply equally <e> <s> he is said to include she by the interpretation act <e> <s> it is the same for the plural and so on <e> <s> in some situations if one wishes to emphasise very specially that there is need for either feminine where a masculine is used or a plural where a singular is used and one wants to be absolutely emphatic about it one might make such an express reference <e> <s> however for the most part the parliamentary draftsman relies on the interpretation act <e> <s> it is good practice that he should do so <e> <s> if he departs from it in one place he puts in question the use of the interpretation act in all other places <e>", "<cs> i should not like it to be thought that i do not regard the emergency order as an extremely important order in the life of a child and in the history of a childs family <e> <s> quite the contrary i regard it as of extreme importance <e> <s> on the other hand one must remember that it is an emergency order and therefore it may be required in an emergency <e> <s> i can understand that if one takes emergency action which turns out not to be necessary one may do a great deal of harm <e> <s> but equally if one does not take emergency action when there is an <e>", "<cs> this amendment would remove the existing subsection and substitute one that was indicated previously as the noble baroness lady david pointed out <e> <s> we have taken the two points that were mentioned in that amendment and put them separately into the bill <e> <s> first as the noble lord lord kilbracken has just said we have put the real principle right in the forefront <e> <s> that is in accordance with what i have heard as recommended drafting practice on more than one occasion <e> <s> the principle is that the childs welfare shall be the courts paramount consideration <e> <s> that applies to all the orders mentioned in the later amendments of the noble lord lord kilbracken <e> <s> so that is the criterion <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may answer the question of my noble friend lady macleod of borve <e> <s> my understanding is that it would be right to consider each child distinctly <e> <s> it would be recognised that the children are part of the family <e> <s> therefore consideration of the family would enter into the matter <e> <s> but one would look at each child and consider in the light of the family circumstances of the child what is best for that child <e> <s> it might well be a very important consideration that the children should be together for example <e>", "<cs> with regard to the point made by the noble lord lord hylton the passage in clause a in brackets is intended to direct attention to that point <e> <s> it states <e>", "<cs> i am certainly considering how best to deal with practical questions <e> <s> as i said on second reading i hope that ultimately these matters may be dealt with by those who have made a special study of them <e> <s> but on a question of this kind such as whether or for example <e> <s> should be the appropriate age i should have thought it may be quite delicate to operate too definitely in that area <e> <s> the regulations for welfare officers reports could apply generally <e> <s> therefore anything put into them about the nature of the circumstances that they should look into would apply generally <e> <s> that may be one way of influencing practice in this difficult area <e>", "<cs> it is true that subsections and give examples of situations in which more than one person can have parental responsibility for the same child at the same time <e> <s> the phrase parental responsibility is used in those subsections for the first time <e> <s> it is an important phrase <e> <s> it is intended to emphasise the departure from too rigid an adherence to the idea of rights of parents in relation to children <e> <s> of course parental responsibility means <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> that is so not by reason of marriage alone but he could incur parental responsibility for the child by virtue of his actions <e> <s> he would not necessarily have all parental responsibility but he could have responsibility to maintain the child if the child was living with him as family <e> <s> he could find himself in a situation where he would have responsibility for the child in a limited sense <e> <s> that is how i see the situation <e> <s> it is a question on which i have not had an opportunity for a great deal of thought and therefore i may seek leave to amplify my answer <e> <s> however that is my understanding of the position at present <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> in our proposals the natural father himself would not have parental responsibility <e>", "<cs> in the example given by my noble friend i assume that the persons in question are married to one another and that the wife is the mother of the child <e> <s> if so clause lays down that both had parental responsibility for the child <e> <s> it does not go into details of the method by which the child came into existence except to say that it was born <e>", "<cs> we have tried to use words carefully in this bill at least at this stage and the emphasis is on the word solely <e> <s> clause reads <e>", "<cs> the noble lady lady saltoun has explained this clause entirely to my satisfaction by reference to the example of the nanny <e>", "<cs> i think that there may be some misunderstanding <e> <s> the important words immediately before surrender are may not surrender or transfer <e> <s> that is the essence of it <e> <s> that is the part that the noble lord was thinking of leaving out <e> <s> we are saying that that should not be allowed <e> <s> you should not be able to rid yourself of your parental responsibiility but you should be able to make arrangements for it to be met by other people in whole or in part depending on the circumstances <e> <s> it is difficult to think of circumstances where you could arrange for the whole of it to be met but there may be some <e> <s> that is the idea behind this clause and i hope that it is reasonably clear <e> <s> i am certainly willing to consider whether we can make it even clearer <e>", "<cs> i do not think that it would be right to say that <e> <s> another person cannot rid the parent of parental responsibility <e> <s> for example if a nanny took a child to school and was careless in letting the child cross the road as a result of which there was an accident the nanny may well have a legal responsibility for that <e> <s> the parent might have a responsibility of a different kind <e> <s> it is not easy to give an answer that would cover every possible circumstance <e> <s> the responsibility as parent would remain on the person who made the arrangement hut there may be a liability attaching to the person who agreed to take certain steps <e>", "<cs> it is right to say that the most extreme form of attempting to surrender or transfer parental responsibility was in the sale of children <e> <s> the prohibition against that was in more general terms <e>", "<cs> i am not sure how much further we can take this matter <e> <s> the point is that while you may ask somebody to look after your child while you are away this is saying that so long as you are away you are still the childs parent and have responsibility for the child <e> <s> one cannot cease even in part to be the childs parent just because one has left the child with someone else <e> <s> in that situation one retains full parental responsibilities as i am sure one would wish to do having made arrangements for the responsibility of looking after the child to be met by somebody else <e> <s> that somebody else may have responsibilities to the parent and may have responsibilities in law to other people <e> <s> he or she would certainly have a responsibility to carry out whatever arrangements had been made with him or her to look after the child <e> <s> if there is any fault in that respect there may be some remedies <e> <s> however the parental responsibility remains with the parent <e> <s> the responsibility of the person who has been asked by the childs parents is to meet in part some of the duties flowing from that responsibility <e>", "<cs> i think that here there is possibly a drafting difficulty <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that the amendment has altered in its terms a little since its originally appeared <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> this amendment addresses a situation which i can see requires to be addressed but i think it is to some extent addressed in the bill by the various provisions that would cover it <e> <s> i will come to those in a moment but to begin with i should like to say that the amendment is very wide and unspecific in its terms <e> <s> for example it does not limit itself to where the disability arises from mental or physical health or where the parent is outside the country <e> <s> indeed this would operate as the noble lord said if one of the parents is in jail <e>", "<cs> under the bill as it stands subject to one exception the appointment of a guardian does not take effect if there is a surviving parent with parental responsibility <e> <s> the amendment would mean that the appointment would always take effect when the appointer died and the guardian would share parental responsibility with any surviving parent <e>", "<cs> the difficulty about this is that perhaps the two branches of clause require different consideration <e> <s> subsection b is such that if we make the wording after the death there is no residence order in favour of the deceased because the residence order comes to an end on the death <e> <s> so immediately after the death there is no <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that suggestion and i should like very much to consider it <e> <s> but the noble lord lord kilbracken <e> <s> may be at least sufficiently happy to withdraw the amendment and give me a chance to see whether we can deal with it in that way <e>", "<cs> some solutions are preferable to others but i express no preference for that one <e>", "<cs> that is right <e> <s> therefore the greater includes the lesser and so long as the document is in writing and signed whatever other requirements there may be in relation to a will the requirements relating to the appointment of a guardian are satisfied <e>", "<cs> the important point is that the parent who has parental responsibility for his <e>", "<cs> as someone said earlier today that is an interesting question <e> <s> as i said i shall be glad to avail myself of the opportunity of considering the matter further <e> <s> however that is my understanding of the matter as drafted <e>", "<cs> rather in the same way as with a parent i think that in that case no preference is given to relatives in the courts power to appoint guardians <e> <s> there may be circumstances in which a relative would be a good appointment <e> <s> i think that the situation is exactly the same in the present law <e> <s> as many of your lordships will know relatives are often appointed and relationship is a good basis on which to consider appointment <e> <s> however i would not be in favour at the moment of putting in the bill a preference for relatives where the present law does not so provide <e>", "<cs> i think that the amendment and the way in which it was put raises the question first of whether in every case there should be an obligation on the court when considering any question with respect to a child to ask for what i shall loosely call for the moment a welfare report under paragraphs a and b of this subsection <e> <s> that is the first question <e> <s> the noble lord lord meston and other noble lords have pointed out how difficult that will be <e>", "<cs> i believe i have said that that is the position <e> <s> i shall be happy to check it <e> <s> but i believe that they are probation officers <e>", "<cs> at first sight these are the natural people to ask <e> <s> they are officials who have responsibility to the court or local authority officials whom the court might expect to answer its requirements <e> <s> the point will be discussed in relation to another aspect of the clause <e> <s> however that is the explanation <e> <s> obviously i would think that giving power to the court to require an official or an officer to report means that it must be somebody who has some kind of official position in respect of which they would have a duty to the court <e> <s> that would not be the normal position of an outside agency however willing it may be to give its service <e>", "<cs> the statute can put a responsibility on a local authority <e> <s> it is in line with what it does at the moment <e>", "<cs> i think that it is important when answering such questions as that posed by my noble friend lord trafford to look at the whole provision of clause <e>", "<cs> i have it in mind to open up clause b to enable the local authority to make arrangements other than with its own officers <e> <s> the court must feel if it makes a request that it will receive a report <e> <s> we do not want a court to make a request to somebody who does not comply with that request and a great deal of time is thereby wasted because delay is the enemy of the good in this field perhaps more than in any other <e> <s> i have it in mind to ask the local authority to arrange for a report to be made not necessarily by its own officer but to include in it for example such bodies as the nspcc <e> <s> if the local authority cannot arrange for anyone else it would have to fall back on its own officer <e> <s> i think that that would probably meet the case and it would certainly meet the point that my noble friend lady faithfull has made <e> <s> the local authority would have the ultimate responsibility to see that a report was made <e> <s> it would certainly cover the key worker case that has been mentioned because the local authority will have made these arrangements in the first place <e>", "<cs> it is a pity to leave a blemish on such an excellent bill and obviously i will consider that request very carefully <e> <s> so far as the main matter of the amendment is concerned if a guardian ad litem is appointed he will have responsibilities including the responsibility to state to the court the position from his point of view <e> <s> the function of the guardian ad litem is to look after the interests of the child and to try to see the matter from the childs point of view <e> <s> in the situation that we have here they are more in the nature of a party to the proceedings than of a reporting person <e> <s> therefore i would think it inappropriate to add whatever designation at this particular place because essentially they will be performing a different function <e> <s> one might have a welfare report where <e>", "<cs> on the second point there is really nothing between us it is only a question of how best to make the provision <e> <s> i would have thought that rules of court could so readily provide <e> <s> however there is a precedent in existing legislation for some such provision and i am happy to consider what should be done in that respect <e>", "<cs> dealing with the last point put by the noble lord lord irvine of lairg it may he that my noble friend lord renton was referring to the power given to the court in the opening part of clause that <e>", "<cs> yes but the court may not even if the court considered it to be relevant <e> <s> i believe that is what my noble friend was referring to <e>", "<cs> i consider that the amendment provides additional clarification to the definition of a contact order <e> <s> i am happy to advise the committee to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> as i explained earlier by virtue of section c of the interpretation act <e>", "<cs> the noble lord was hoping to have an amendment accepted well here it is <e> <s> i am grateful to him for his eagle eyed scanning of the bill <e> <s> the government support the amendment without equivocation <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the restriction is twofold <e> <s> first where a child is being looked after by a local authority the security which might he gained from a residence order must be set against the difficulties which premature applications might put in the way of realisation of the local authoritys plans for the child <e> <s> that is particularly so where a child who has been abused or neglected has been compulsorily removed from his home under a care order giving parental responsibility to the local authority <e> <s> the effect of the residence order would be to give parental responsibility to the foster parent and terminate the care order and therefore the authoritys parental responsibility for the child <e>", "<cs> the jurisdiction provisions of clause into which this amendment seeks to insert a paragraph c already cover orders of the kind that are here in question <e> <s> the essence of this is to make it possible to have the order granted without a court appearance <e> <s> whether a court appearance is necessary or not is a matter for rules and for the courts judgment <e> <s> in many cases where orders are sought at the moment they are quite unnecessary <e> <s> one of the policy considerations put forward by the <e>", "<cs> the amendment would allow a grandparent brother sister uncle or aunt whether of full or half-blood or by affinity or step-parent to apply for any order under clause of the bill without leave of the court <e> <s> there is clearly a danger both in limiting and expanding the categories of persons who may apply for orders in respect of children <e> <s> on the one hand a too wide and uncontrolled gateway can expose children and families to the stress and harm of unwarranted interference and the harassment of actual or threatened proceedings <e> <s> if too narrow or over-controlled the gateway may prevent applications which would benefit or safeguard a child from harm <e>", "<cs> this is a matter of judgment for the draftsman <e> <s> if one inserted <e>", "<cs> the issue at this stage is the application for leave <e> <s> the question is would the granting of the application for leave cause disruption <e> <s> it is not the ultimate success of the application that is in question <e> <s> the mere application itself and the consideration of the application can cause disruption in the childs life <e> <s> it is that stage that is in question <e> <s> what happens once the application for leave is granted is the next stage and the disruption that might follow on the granting of the leave is the first stage <e> <s> that is what we are now debating <e> <s> it is not that the noble lord is being pedantic but that he is on this occasion and rarely for him perhaps mistaken <e>", "<cs> it is the application for leave that is in question <e>", "<cs> that is the point i seek to make <e> <s> the application in question is an application for leave to make the application <e> <s> if the application for leave is granted the application will be allowed to proceed for the order under clause <e> <s> it is the application for the order under clause being allowed to proceed that will cause disruption <e> <s> that is the point at issue <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble lord is perhaps applying his mind to the wrong stage in the procedure <e>", "<cs> it can <e>", "<cs> there is no intention to remove the courts current powers to join children as parties to proceedings affecting them <e> <s> clause enables the rules of court to provide who may be parties to proceedings under the bill <e> <s> however as i have said already we must be careful not to risk children becoming unnecessarily embroiled in disputes which arise between their parents <e>", "<cs> i am certainly content to think about it more <e> <s> but the prominence which we are giving to the childs wishes and feelings in clause will have an effect <e>", "<cs> as clause demonstrates we take the view that delay in dealing with childrens cases is very much to be regretted and to be avoided <e> <s> in that sense there is nothing between us in principle in this matter <e> <s> as to the amendment the position is <e>", "<cs> that is a difficult question which this amendment does not address <e> <s> it is a problem which clause addresses <e> <s> it puts before the court the point that in these cases perhaps above all delay is a matter to be avoided <e> <s> i hope that that will be sufficient indication from parliament to the courts that they must give every possible priority to such cases <e> <s> as the noble baroness knows there are proposals in the civil justice review to seek timetables for cases <e> <s> one of the great causes of delay is that the parties tend to put things off <e> <s> timetables imposed on cases may be of great assistance <e> <s> we shall do our best to ensure that the courts deal with these cases as rapidly as possible <e>", "<cs> as has already been said the law commission in recommending that residence orders should be able to specify that a child divide its time between two households recognised that it would rarely be appropriate <e> <s> however experience in the united states in the view of the commission has shown that it can sometimes be a beneficial arrangement for children <e> <s> i have no doubt that it has learned since the proceedings on this bill started that there are other examples <e> <s> where a child is going to spend substantial but perhaps not equal amounts of time with both parents the commission says it is a more realistic order than giving a residence order to one parent and a contact order to the other <e> <s> the government accept those views as good sense and have provided the structural framework for them in the bill <e>", "<cs> i say that everything in this amendment is covered in the checklist <e> <s> if it is not then it ought to be <e> <s> accordingly if an alteration is to be made as it seems to me and if we are to maintain the structure and the principle of this bill we should put into the checklist those factors which have been omitted <e> <s> for example it would be possible to say the childs physical emotional and educational needs including the need for a stable or secure home or something of that kind <e> <s> but the more one looks at the amendment the more one sees that there are many types of physical emotional and educational needs that could be specified <e> <s> that is what i am saying about it <e> <s> if the committee feels that this matter is not properly covered by the checklist then it ought to be <e> <s> that is the way to go about it not by making a particular provision in respect of a particular order <e>", "<cs> clause is included in the bill because it is possible that an unmarried father will seek a residence order for the child to live with him even though he does not at that time have parental responsibility by a court order or agreement <e>", "<cs> the matters at issue are very important <e> <s> they are decisions in relation to the child and the courts order is required in respect of those decisions <e> <s> i have made the point in other contexts that we consider that there is a danger if the childs view is to be determinative of the matter that the child may be put in an invidious position for example where one separated parent wanted him to stay behind and the other wanted him to go and live abroad or where one parent wanted him to change his surname and the other did not <e> <s> it is quite bad enough for the child that the parents should separate <e> <s> it would be very much worse if the child was then burdened with the decision about which parent he should stay with or which parents name he should adopt if for example one of them remarried <e>", "<cs> the court would have to decide in the light of all the circumstances what was best for the child taking into account all the matters on the checklist including his educational emotional and physical needs <e> <s> his emotional needs would be a very important factor in that decision <e> <s> it is one of the matters to which i referred earlier <e> <s> the stability and security of his home would obviously be associated with the name prominent in that home <e> <s> if the other children in the home had one name and he had another that might be a very important consideration in favour of a change <e>", "<cs> the rules will give to the child the possibility of applying in the application for orders under clause <e> <s> it will be for the court to decide on an application <e> <s> if the child is of a sufficient age he will be able to act in the same way as any other person and it will be for the court to decide whether in the particular circumstances that should be allowed <e> <s> there is no technical problem to the child applying for the order <e>", "<cs> first of all the point about the number of months allowed in a specific time mentioned by the noble lord is one that i should like to consider further although it does not perhaps arise directly out of this amendment <e> <s> i can see that there is just a chance that some abuse may lurk in that area <e>", "<cs> in a great number of cases the parent who has the child and wants to take the child on holiday could perfectly well be trusted with the child and a foreign holiday <e> <s> if one is going to have to inform the other parent about all the movements of the child in logic that would apply in this country also <e> <s> for example let us say that the parent was thinking of going on a mountaineering holiday in some of the better places in the north <e> <s> it would be very reasonable that the other parent should know about it and know where they were <e> <s> i can see that there may be some circumstances in which some form of reasonable notice would be required <e> <s> this is the detail that one might expect to find adjusted in the order <e>", "<cs> i had a number of places in mind but i think that most of them would be north of the tweed <e>", "<cs> i should like an opportunity to consider the matter <e> <s> it may be that consequential amendments to the clause will be required <e> <s> however as the noble lord has explained the amendment i can see no harm in the court having that further power in necessary cases <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will accept that reply <e> <s> i hope to be able to deal with the matter at the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i shall first answer the questions which have been raised about the clause because they are fundamental to the amendment <e> <s> the consent provisions have been introduced because the order is intended to provide assistance to a parent for example whom the court may believe to be in difficulty and who may benefit from the assistance of a probation officer or an officer of the local authority <e> <s> the idea is rather as the noble lord lord prys <e>", "<cs> the first point to notice is that the person who may be named in the order would include for example a parent and it may well be that the parent requires to be advised or assisted <e> <s> the parent would be the person named in the order and the assistance would be in the form of making a probation officer available <e>", "<cs> i join with those who have congratulated my noble friend on bringing this matter to the attention of the committee <e> <s> i join also with the noble lord lord henderson of brompton in saying that it is important and certainly i would not suggest that any time spent on it is in any way excessive <e> <s> i hope i shall not be guilty of spending excessive time on it <e>", "<cs> one of the essentials if the bill is to be at all comprehensible is that children who are to be the primary subjects of the attention of this part of the legislation should be described with reasonable brevity <e> <s> we have used the phrase <e>", "<cs> yes i shall certainly be

baroness wants to comment <e>", "<cs> i am happy to agree to any request that noble lords make to me to consider a matter <e> <s> one could easily put in <e>", "<cs> i would never so characterise a suggestion from the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i have indicated that i shall see whether i can in any way make the matter plainer <e> <s> i shall of course bring the points that have been made in this debate to the attention of the draftsman <e> <s> from what i know about it and from the structure of the bill i heel that it may not be possible to improve this but i shall certainly see what can be done <e>", "<cs> one of the fundamental requirements of a comprehensible bill is that it should have some form of structure <e> <s> clause sets <e>", "<cs> i mentioned this provision when i spoke about the schedule because i did not want it to be thought that i was speaking of the authority of the schedule apart from this provision <e> <s> i explained then and do so again that the purpose of this clause is to make it possible to keep up to date the detail of these provisions <e>", "<cs> after the words of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale said that he had no doubt that there were plenty of precedents <e> <s> i did not feel it necessary to waste time by repeating his remark <e> <s> i am sure that the committee will know that the noble and learned lord would not make such a remark unless he thought that it was correct <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness explained this amendment would relax the requirement in the bill as drafted that cash assistance should be given only in exceptional circumstances and allow cash assistance to be given where it was the most efficient and effective means of giving assistance <e> <s> the examples to which the noble baroness referred would probably be in the nature of exceptional circumstances <e> <s> they would be covered by that <e> <s> however we are considering this amendment <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that with regard to assistance given under the child care act section is disregarded in total for the purposes of income support family credit and housing benefit under the regulations made under the act <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> subsection as drafted specifies that assistance for children in need may be either unconditional or subject to conditions to repayment <e> <s> the amendment would add a caveat that no child in need should be deprived of any service which he requires by reason of his parents being unable to meet any financial conditions <e> <s> i sympathise with the sentiments which prompt this amendment but i do not think that it is necessary <e> <s> first subsection should be read with subsection which requires the authority to have regard to the parents means before imposing conditions <e> <s> that is intended to ensure that repayment conditions which would be beyond the parents means are not imposed <e> <s> the authority would be expected to act reasonably and any disputes could be taken up under the representations procedure which each authority must establish under clause <e> <s> that should ensure that arrangements are fair <e> <s> however i shall consider whether additional provisions similar to those in paragraph and of schedule would be appropriate <e> <s> these might provide specifically that an authority may impose conditions as to repayment of the asssitance only if it considers it reasonable to do so and that a parent is not liable to repay any assistance when in receipt of income support or family credit under the social security act <e> <s> i shall certainly examine that aspect <e>", "<cs> if one has subsection one must have a subsection similar to <e> <s> the idea is to <e>", "<cs> i am sure all members of the committee will heartily endorse the sentiments behind this amendment <e> <s> it would be utterly wrong to suggest that it follows from a parent being disabled that the child is in need in the terms set out in clause of the bill <e> <s> a disability does not necessarily prevent a parent being a good parent and meeting the needs of his or her children perfectly well <e> <s> there are many examples of families successfully overcoming the obstacles presented by one parents disability or even both parents disability <e>", "<cs> this is a difficult matter which i appreciate is given very high priority and importance by my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> i have no doubt that it is extremely important but it does not necessarily follow that it is easy to get it right <e> <s> disabled is defined in clause because disabled children are to be regarded as children in need for the purposes of part iii of the bill <e> <s> i suppose that one option is to leave it at that without a definition <e> <s> but that has not commended itself at all so far <e>", "<cs> i recognise the concern so eloquently expressed by the noble baroness <e> <s> lady david in moving the amendment <e> <s> i have received the document from barnardos <e> <s> my wife is a member of the council of barnardos so it is natural that i should see it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to notify the house in accordance with the royal assent act that the queen has signified her royal assent to the following acts <e>", "<cs> as has been explained the first of my noble friends amendments seeks to ensure that a local authority shall provide day care services for every child who is under five and who is in need in its area whether or not that local authority considers it appropriate to do so <e> <s> in contrast part iii generally requires a local authority to provide a wide range of services in a manner and at a level that it considers appropriate to the needs of those children <e> <s> the latter approach must be preferable <e> <s> the local authority must have the flexibility to provide whatever services are appropriate for the children within its area <e>", "<cs> i do not know on what basis it could be suggested that they would have these powers <e> <s> they are statutory authorities and need statutory powers <e> <s> unless they have statutory powers to act they would not have statutory authority <e> <s> accordingly it is important that those powers should be there <e>", "<cs> as i indicated we are proposing to put down amendments to this bill to modernise the nurseries and childminders regulation act <e> <s> these amendments are in the course of preparation <e> <s> i have to rely on help in this matter but it is our hope that we may be able to discuss the amendments while the bill is still in this chamber <e> <s> i am just receiving some confirmation of that <e> <s> we are trying to settle the precise detail <e> <s> i hope that it will be on another day not too far off early in the new year while the noble lords are still in charge of the bill <e>", "<cs> it is not quite impossible for the matter to come in during the committee stage because it arises naturally in the late part of the bill <e> <s> however the best estimate i can give now is that it will probably be the report stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> it appears that the intention is to ensure that the duty to accommodate arises only in circumstances where the provision of accommodation is necessary in the interest of the welfare of the child <e> <s> however the existing wording of the clause appears to achieve that result <e> <s> the duty to accommodate arises only in respect of a child who is in need and who appears to the local authority to require accommodation <e> <s> the wording makes it clear that the duty arises only where it is necessary for the local authority to intervene <e>", "<cs> under the homelessness provisions in part iii of the housing act as amended by the housing and planning act local housing authorities already have a duty to arrange accommodation for homeless people in specified priority need categories provided that the local authority is satisfied that the homelessness is unintentional <e>", "<cs> the idea of clause is to make plain that the authority may provide accommodation in a community home for any person who has reached the age of but is under if the community home is provided for children who have reached the age of <e> <s> therefore the sort of answer to which the noble lord lord prys-davies <e>", "<cs> i see a good deal of force in that point <e> <s> i should like time to consider the matter further <e>", "<cs> this amendment would require the authority before providing accommodation under clause to give due consideration to any physical or other handicap of the child and to his educational needs including any special educational needs <e>", "<cs> the clause that we are here concerned with deals with voluntary arrangements <e> <s> it is the essence of a voluntary arrangement that it should be entirely free <e> <s> if i leave my child with a <e>", "<cs> my lords the white paper made a clear commitment to provide accommodation services to support families with children in need <e> <s> the bill achieves that under clause <e> <s> the local authority may provide accommodation for a child if the authority considers that to do so would safeguard or promote the childs welfare <e> <s> this service would be available to parents or those with parental responsibility and would also be available to children over thereby clearly acknowledging that children over should be able to make their own decisions <e>", "<cs> the bill already provides for the views of children over to prevail in cases where they agree to be provided with accommodation if their parents object or wish to remove them <e> <s> they can stay against their parents wishes <e> <s> this amendment would ensure that local authorities have no power to provide accommodation if a child over objects irrespective of the views of parents <e>", "<cs> the committee will recall that the white paper promised that where the local authority looked after a child away from home with the voluntary agreement of parents that is where no court orders had been made matters such as the initial placement schooling and contact should be settled by mutual agreement with the parents to make matters as flexible as possible <e>", "<cs> i think that it is certainly possible for the regulations to set out the subject matter that the agreements may cover rather than try to set out the terms <e> <s> that is what i would expect <e> <s> i would hope that the regulations make provision for the various headings that an agreement could cover not necessarily exhaustively but indicating the types of heading <e> <s> i would expect them to include matters referred to in the amendment and leave scope for others as well <e> <s> the wider the scope for agreement the better in that context <e> <s> i would expect the agreements <e>", "<cs> i have always taken the view that before one drafts regulations one should know what powers one has <e> <s> any drafts that could be provided while the bill is in progress would be provisional <e> <s> i am not in a position to say at the moment that we shall have the regulations but i think that if the <e>", "<cs> it is an important principle that it is right for the local authority to withhold its services if the child does not appear to require them <e> <s> the appropriate course for those who wish to challenge such a decision is then through judicial review <e> <s> this principle applies to many local government responsibilities <e> <s> in the case of the example put forward in this amendment however i think it is fair to say that there are a number of additional difficulties <e> <s> would the court order fall if the applicant failed to accept the accommodation <e> <s> it is a fundamental principle of this bill that a child should only be accommodated compulsorily where the grounds in clause are satisfied <e> <s> the proposal would seem to envisage a half-way house in which the powers and responsibilities of the local authority are not clear <e>", "<cs> clause provides for the responsibilities of local authorities towards children they are looking after <e> <s> in particular clause specifies that before taking any decisions about a child the local authority must so far as is reasonably practicable ascertain the wishes and feelings of the child the parents and anyone who has parental responsibility <e> <s> this amendment would require the local authority also to consult the guardian ad litem for the child if one has been appointed <e> <s> this would extend the role of guardian ad litem beyond that provided for in clause and any rules of court so far as i know <e>", "<cs> clause substantially reenacts the present law requiring a local authority which is looking after a child to safeguard and promote his welfare <e> <s> moreover clause and permit an authority to act inconsistently with this duty only where it is necessary to do so to protect members of the public from injury <e> <s> in all but the most exceptional cases therefore a local authoritys decisions with respect to a child who is being looked after by it must safeguard and promote the childs <e>", "<cs> i am all for practical progress and perhaps that is what the bill provides <e>", "<cs> i should like to say first that i very strongly support the view that the child is to be considered as a person and that all his or her needs and aspirations should be taken into account <e> <s> secondly i believe that all of us would wish to see steps taken to prevent drift as it has been described by the noble lady <e> <s> in a sense drift is one result of not treating the child as a person but allowing it to become involved in a structure in which its personality and individuality are lost sight of <e> <s> therefore i do not believe that there is any disagreement between my noble friend lord mottistone and myself on the basic objectives of the amendment and the same applies in relation to the other noble lords who have supported the amendment <e>", "<cs> the spirit of the amendment is as has already been pointed out in accordance with the policy on which the government have acted in this area generally <e> <s> i should like to begin by saying a word or two about what has been done in this area by the government in the prohibition of the use of corporal punishment in the various forms of child care establishment normally by amendment of the appropriate regulations <e> <s> it is fair to say that some of these have been completed and some are still in hand <e> <s> completed have been the regulations required in the case of homes registered under part i of the registered homes act and in the case of maintained schools and the ones in hand are in the case of care placements in independent schools and in community homes and voluntary homes where draft regulations are at an advanced stage of preparation <e> <s> in the case of private childrens homes the childrens homes act is unimplemented <e> <s> it is reproduced and amended in part viii of the bill and regulations <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i have not made the position sufficiently clear <e> <s> i tried to explain that the necessary steps have already been taken or are being taken in order to prohibit the use of corporal punishment in the various forms of child care establishments which i described <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the government are seeking to place before the chamber the best possible legislation and indeed this bill is a good example <e> <s> it must be right not to add unnecessarily to the bill <e>", "<cs> once again there is very little difference between us on what we want to achieve <e> <s> the policy underlying amendment no <e> <s> is that the allowing of the child to go back with a parent or a person who has parental responsibility for him is to happen in accordance and only in accordance with the secretary of states regulations <e> <s> in other words they are not to be able to do it except on the terms set out in the secretary of states regulations <e>", "<cs> most certainly <e> <s> i was taking advantage of my noble and learned friends kind remark that he was not expecting the answer immediately <e> <s> i certainly had not overlooked the point he made <e> <s> i think i have an answer but i would prefer to have more time to consider whether it is a full answer <e> <s> i would certainly have in mind to let him know what my considered answer is <e> <s> i certainly did not mean to overlook it <e>", "<cs> again i am absolutely clear that it is important that children who are siblings and who have lived together as a family should continue to do so if it can be arranged and if it is consistent with their welfare <e> <s> i understand that many local authorities already make arrangements where they can for sibling children to be looked after in the same family or childrens home <e> <s> i can see some advantage in making this a statutory requirement and if my noble friend will allow me time to consider the point further i shall be glad to do so <e>", "<cs> i should like to begin by taking up the point that was made by the noble lord lord henderson of brompton <e> <s> clause as a whole is a very considerable move forward from the existing law <e> <s> i believe that it is most important <e> <s> i also think that it is quite important to understand that it has to cope with many different matters but that it is not intended to cope with social security matters <e> <s> that is an entirely different field and i know that noble lords are well aware of that fact <e> <s> it must be kept in mind that we are not here to deal with social security legislation in its general provision we are dealing with a very specific situation <e> <s> i am sure that members of the committee will wish to be careful and to concentrate on this particular situation to ensure that what is proposed is appropriate <e>", "<cs> i tried to point out that <e>", "<cs> i think that my noble friend lord campbell of alloway was referring to in the manner of a good parent <e> <s> regarding the duty the point i make is that for a person to qualify there is no requirement that he should be in need <e> <s> i quite concede the point that i may be entirely wrong <e> <s> i do not claim infallibilty but i do claim to have carefully considered the difficulties with which this provision is designed to deal <e> <s> i have sought to set out my consideration of those <e> <s> however there is no qualifying condition that the person must be in need <e> <s> he has to require friendship and assistance but there is no necessity in order for him to be subject to the duty that he should be in need <e> <s> he must be in need if there is to be a duty implied to require assistance <e> <s> if the amendment implies a duty to assist it may well involve a duty to assist people who have no need of such assistance <e> <s> not every person who has been in care between the ages of and has the need for financial assistance <e> <s> some do and some do not <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i do not wish to take up time unnecessarily on this <e> <s> obviously if the noble baroness wishes to press the point then she is by all means entitled to do so <e> <s> all i am saying is that there is no necessity in order to qualify under this clause that one should be in need <e> <s> if to have a duty to assist in the manner of a good parent means that one need not assist then i am not sure that we are improving the clarity of the bill <e> <s> however those are matters for the noble baroness to consider <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the purpose of this amendment is to ensure that when a local authority provides a young person with assistance under subsection be it in kind or cash such assistance is disregarded for the purpose of calculating entitlement to benefit payable under part ii of the social security act <e> <s> that is the part of the act which deals with the income related benefits income support housing benefit and family credit <e>", "<cs> i would not think that there is any difference between us on this matter <e> <s> however again there are two stages to the question and i am not certain which stage is dealt with by the proposed subsection <e>", "<cs> the history that has been given to my noble friend by the charity may not be sufficiently related to the law in the matter <e> <s> the secure accommodation regulations are not all that ancient <e> <s> there may be some problem about that <e> <s> with regard to these regulations and the provision is repeated in the bill a child is not to be held in secure accommodation for absconding not at all and still less for absconding from home <e> <s> the situation is that he is likely to abscond from any other description of accommodation <e> <s> in other words short of secure accommodation there is nowhere that we can keep this child safely <e> <s> we have no other accommodation however attractive beautiful or homely from which he is not likely to run <e> <s> that is the first point <e> <s> one must consider all the other accommodation that the local authority can provide for the child <e>", "<cs> if a problem exists in this respect there are powers to deal with it in particular the powers to make regulations as provided to the secretary of state under the clause <e> <s> the noble baroness lady david suggested that in the case to which she referred it was complained that the childs attitude was not represented it was revealed but not represented <e> <s> perhaps in that case the question arises of what is meant by legal representation in the circumstances <e> <s> it is a difficult issue but powers are provided to the secretrary of state to deal with it under the present law if necessary <e> <s> if the bill comes into effect additional powers will be provided <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale in speaking to these amendments really invited a more radical point to be looked at namely whether the whole provision of clause is inappropriate <e> <s> so far as clause is concerned giving the secretary of state power to make regulations does have effect and i think it is a very normal way of doing it <e> <s> if one were to have a duty one would perhaps have to make directions about that in more detail <e> <s> the secretary of state certainly means as part of the implementation of this bill to make regulations and we would hope before the whole structure is put into position to have those regulations available <e> <s> it is obvious that they would <e>", "<cs> i think it might be arguable for example whether he could make regulations covering all these matters <e> <s> perhaps the one that is most obvious is the requirement for the authority to monitor the arrangements they had made with a view to ensuring that the regulations were complied with <e> <s> i think it is perhaps doubtful whether the general power in clause without that specific provision would empower the secretary of state to require the authority to monitor what it is doing but the purpose of this is really to try to set out in fairly clear language what is intended to be dealt with by these regulations <e> <s> the secretary of state may well have done that without such power but i think it is as well that to a certain degree these headings should be specified <e> <s> of course it is a question of judgment as to what degree one goes <e>", "<cs> regarding the people to be involved in the review we have sought to deal with that matter in clause d <e> <s> that is <e>", "<cs> i have not finished yet <e>", "<cs> it happened to reach me also and therefore i take advantage of it <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i can take this matter very much further <e> <s> i cannot undertake that a meeting would necessarily be held involving all the people at the same time <e> <s> i mentioned the doctor as an example <e> <s> i am certainly prepared to undertake that the people involved in the review will include people of the kind referred to in paragraph d this meets the point made by my noble friend lady faithfull and i shall also undertake that meetings will form part of the process where it is appropriate to get the people together <e> <s> that is as much as i can say <e>", "<cs> i think that prevention is better than cure <e>", "<cs> the bill provides <e>", "<cs> i do not know many hymns about representations <e>", "<cs> i do not know that it is very important <e> <s> the procedure should cover all forms of complaint and other representations <e> <s> the word is intended to cover that <e> <s> if the feeling is very strong about it then obviously i should be happy to consider this further <e> <s> however i do not mean by that to go into all the business about complaints managers and people of that kind <e> <s> that is a different matter altogether <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord mottistone mentioned the fact that junior members of staff are excluded but subsection is intended to secure the presence of an impartial person in the procedure <e> <s> therefore it would not be appropriate for a junior member of staff to be that person and it is right that they should not be named in subsection <e>", "<cs> i meant to imply that and i shall give further consideration as to how best it can be done in the light of the examples that have been given <e> <s> however it is a difficult problem and all members of the committee will have their own predelictions in the matter <e> <s> i certainly intend to consider it further and my noble friend can have that assurance <e>", "<cs> i shall endeavour to be sweet but i am not sure that i can be quite so short <e>", "<cs> the essential factor in this provision is the obligation on every local authority to establish a procedure for considering any representations made to it <e> <s> in order to define that as a reasonable procedure we have provided for the persons who may make the complaint or representation the essential independent element in the consideration of the representation subject to the undertaking i have already given to my noble friend <e> <s> we have also provided that the authority shall have due regard to the findings of those considering the representations and to whom it shall intimate its decision and so on <e>", "<cs> this amendment proceeds on the footing that only complaints are at issue <e> <s> the amendments propose that the obligation is to give due consideration to providing redress as in amendment no <e> <s> and consideration to providing redress as in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> therefore the amendments propose due consideration or consideration to providing redress <e>", "<cs> again i think we are aiming at the same objective <e> <s> it is a question of precisely how one arrives at it <e> <s> without adequate publicity a procedure such as is envisaged in this part of the clause would be considerably reduced in effectiveness <e>", "<cs> i listened carefully to the noble lord lord banks as he proposed the amendment <e> <s> i am inclined to think that the independence was secured by the presence of at least one person who was neither a member nor an officer of the authority <e> <s> other members might not be concerned with a particular case but might well be officials of the authority <e> <s> in any event with the independent element to which i have referred already what we have is a large step forward <e> <s> we want to ensure a working machinery <e> <s> we do not want a system that is hedged about with complaints procedures appeals further panels judicial review and so on <e> <s> a child has to get on with living <e> <s> i agree that there is also scope for people who administer complaints procedures and appear in them to live as well <e> <s> but the primary purpose is to bring the situation to the attention of the local authority by reference to an independent person <e>", "<cs> as i said earlier the clause and the part of the bill that we are considering put a new obligation on local authorities to establish a representation procedure <e> <s> that development by itself will lead to consideration and reconsideration of their practice <e> <s> the secretary of state will have power by regulation to set minimum standards to which the local authority would have to adhere <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord prys-davies in moving this amendment referred to the conclusion of lord justice butler-sloss in the report on the cleveland inquiry in which she said among other things <e>", "<cs> i am not proposing to enlighten the noble lord because i accept the principle of this amendment <e> <s> if my noble friend will allow me to consider how it can be taken on board i shall certainly agree to do that <e> <s> it appears to be a useful point for which i am indebted to my noble friend and to all those who have supported it <e>", "<cs> i think there may be some slight misunderstanding about this <e> <s> my understanding is that this amendment would require a local authority rather than allow it to assess a childs needs for the purposes of part iii at the same time as any assessment is made of his or her needs under the other statutes specified in paragraph a of schedule <e> <s> the purpose of the word may in paragraph of schedule as drafted is to allow the local authority to carry out an assessment of a childs need of services under part iii at the same time as any other statutory assessment which may be appropriate is carried out if it is sensible and practicable that they should be done together <e> <s> that will sometimes but not always be so <e> <s> if any assessment had been carried out under one of the other statutes a few weeks earlier <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree that this is an important matter <e> <s> i am very grateful for the suggestion contained in amendment no <e> <s> a and i certainly do not wish to describe it in any less appreciative terms than those used by the author himself <e> <s> i should certainly like to consider it <e>", "<cs> the bill as drafted endeavours to deal with this point by stating in schedule paragraph of part ii <e>", "<cs> the code has been of great value and i am glad to know that the noble baroness agrees with that point of view <e> <s> it is the only child care issue subject to a statutory code of practice of this kind <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord hylton has correctly anticipated the stand which i propose to take <e> <s> perhaps your lordships will not be surprised to learn that i cannot agree to the wiping out of a large part of schedule by means of this rather neat amendment <e>", "<cs> the amendment is of a piece with those that we shall come to later which would exclude the magistrates courts jurisdiction under other parts of this bill and which seek to fix in primary legislation which tier of court should hear particular matters <e> <s> however in relation to this particular amendment i should emphasise that the government recognise the seriousness of intervention in the family that a local authoritys applicaton for a care or supervision order represents <e> <s> as i made clear in my second reading speech one aim of the bill is to match the weight of the case to the level of court <e> <s> there are however factors other than weight to be taken into account in deciding which court should consider a particular case <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of that remark it might perhaps be worth mentioning that reference has been made more than once this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i saw those letters in <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking about the date of appointment <e> <s> i am fortunate that most people who are appointed to the bench carry on until the age of retirement and therefore there is a very large number of magistrates who are coming up to the age at which they go on to the supplemental list <e> <s> so i believe that the balance of the community is very well represented in the present age structure <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it a little difficult to see how that comes into the matters raised by this question <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will have noted that the parliament of of which the two distinguished noble lords were members fixed the age of retirement at <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend is right <e> <s> that is certainly one of the difficulties <e> <s> as i said there are difficulties in particular sectors of the community in getting people to serve who are sufficiently young <e> <s> therefore in the light of that kind of difficulty i am prepared to <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely accept what the noble baroness says as regards whether age is an indicator of fitness <e> <s> i believe that to be generally acceptable <e> <s> however i have to operate and i am sure the house would expect me to operate within the structure that parliament has laid down <e> <s> parliament has decreed that is the maximum age <e> <s> within that criterion i have to consider getting reasonable service from people who receive induction training before they have to retire <e> <s> it is for that reason that this general level of age was fixed a long time ago <e> <s> my noble and learned friend who asked a question just a moment ago carried on that practice during his term of office <e> <s> the provision is not intended to be any reflection on people of or over <e> <s> it is intended to give proper effect to the arrangements that parliament made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful for those comments <e> <s> that has been a cardinal point in my consideration of these matters since i have had responsibility for them <e> <s> i know that it was also the case long before i took office <e>", "<cs> my lords i consider these problems continually <e> <s> i endeavour to obtain as much assistance as i can to overcome them <e> <s> recently i have written to industrialists to try and get their help as regards allowing people to be released for service <e> <s> as the point has been raised i must say that the responses have been extremely favourable <e> <s> industrialists regard magistrates service as an important public duty <e> <s> they will do their best to give support <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps before coming to the substantive answer to my noble friends amendment i might be allowed to say that looking at the marshalled list of amendments still to be dealt with i think we are making progress in the sense that there are fewer amendments on the marshalled list today than there were when we started off at the beginning of the bill some three committee days ago <e> <s> i have probably considerable responsibility for the fact that we are moving so slowly because as the committee knows this bill has been the subject of very careful consideration by a number of people <e> <s> i have been anxious to try to set out fully all the arguments in answer to the various amendments that have been tabled <e> <s> but one of the consequences is that we do not make very rapid progress <e> <s> i feel i must do what i can to contribute to progress <e> <s> i am sure that others may have perhaps a smaller part to play in that direction <e>", "<cs> it is convenient to take the two amendments together <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would allow a court to make a new kind of order in care proceedings which would adjourn the hearing and permit directions to be given for a programme of rehabilitation <e>", "<cs> i am certainly grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for raising the possibility of discussing that group of amendments with this

baroness lady david also deal with it <e> <s> i do not know whether it is desired to approach these separately <e>", "<cs> i am perfectly content with that <e> <s> i thought that it might save a little time <e>", "<cs> i appreciate entirely what was said by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> it was that a lawyer may argue that the word significant is unnecessary because it is already implied <e> <s> in other words if the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord mishcon is given effect to it will make no difference <e> <s> bearing in mind the fact that we wish to direct the bill to people who may not be lawyers i believe it is right that it should be included <e>", "<cs> that is incorrect particularly in relation to the impairment of health and development <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon agrees that a question of amount or significance and the extent to which there is a deviation from a reasonable norm exists in that connection <e> <s> with the greatest respect i believe that on this occasion the noble and learned lord is not quite right <e>", "<cs> no i am not <e>", "<cs> i think it is convenient to take these two matters together in the sense that they link more closely than with the previous amendment <e> <s> i entirely agree with the noble lord lord irvine of lairg that here there is authorised one of the most important interventions in family life by the state <e> <s> therefore one must be careful <e>", "<cs> i can deal with that matter quickly <e> <s> if i had to make a choice of all the amendments i would be for amendment no <e> <s> za the amendment of the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> if necessary it elaborates the meaning that i have in mind <e> <s> i certainly do not find acceptable the reference to the child of similar background <e> <s> i do not think with respect to the noble lord lord kilmarnock that it has the effect that my noble friend lady faithfull had in mind <e>", "<cs> quality and connotation <e> <s> that is certainly where i first learnt most clearly about it <e> <s> i doubt whether it is necessary <e>", "<cs> the sentiment just expressed by my noble friend lady macleod of borve is precisely the reason why i feel that the words we have are perhaps preferable <e> <s> i think that the description in amendment no <e> <s> i za the one about attributes is certainly along the line that i have in mind as the construction of the phrase similar child <e> <s> this is obviously extremely important and certainly i shall consider it with the draftsman <e> <s> i have that very much in mind <e>", "<cs> i was not meaning to leave that out <e> <s> i was simply saying that the phrase similar attributes has the right sense from my point of view <e> <s> we will consider all that has been suggested including that mentioned by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the first limb of the conditions in clause requires that the child has suffered significant harm or is likely so to suffer <e> <s> the second limb requires that this harm or likelihood of harm is attributable to the child being given or being likely to be given care which is below a reasonable standard <e> <s> i shall not go into the full wording <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would add to this limb a third condition namely that the harm or likelihood of harm to a child of compulsory school age is attributable to his not being properly educated <e>", "<cs> the point raised here relates to care proceedings under which the nspcc is authorised <e> <s> the general principle we are following in this provision is that there will be several situations in which local authorities will provide accommodation for children <e> <s> such arrangements may be made with the voluntary co-operation of parents under part iii for orphans certain other children who under present legislation will be received into care and for children who are the subject of emergency protection orders or of police protection under part v including emergency protection orders obtained by persons other than the local authority <e>", "<cs> the government and i am sure the whole committee greatly appreciate the work of the society <e> <s> it has a most distinguished record and i speak for the government as well as personally <e> <s> i have known its excellent work <e> <s> this is evidenced by the fact that uniquely now the society is authorised under this type of legislation <e> <s> the difficulties are of a technical nature and in view of what the noble lord has said i undertake to consider the matter carefully <e> <s> i believe that it would be right to leave this over and i know that my noble friend is willing to take that course <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness has said neglect appears in the present law in the phrase avoidable neglect in section a of the children and young persons act <e> <s> it permeates section of the child care act as the basis on which a local authority may pass a resolution assuming parental rights and duties <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> it does not mean precisely the same thing because in the active form it is restricted to the court whereas in the passive form it applies to anyone who may have to ask the question <e> <s> i share the desire of the noble and learned lord to keep the active form if possible but i concluded that it was necessary to have this provision apply to other cases than where a court has to decide the matter <e> <s> that is the point of it <e> <s> the other way of doing it would be to put a similar subsection into every decision-making process where the matter may arise <e> <s> it was thought best to err on the side of brevity in this case <e>", "<cs> the basic duty which is required in order to as it were found this practice is contained in clause of the bill which sets out a local authoritys duty to investigate <e> <s> subsection requires that local authorities <e>", "<cs> this is not an omission without consideration <e> <s> in other words it is not an omission by mistake <e> <s> it is a deliberate omission and i shall try to explain why <e>", "<cs> i have heard all that the noble lord has said on the matter <e> <s> i consider that the fundamental points i made deal with the matter <e> <s> however that does not mean that i shall not consider further what he said <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> the previous amendments concerned a new clause to be inserted after clause <e> <s> we have dealt with clause standing part of the bill <e>", "<cs> a direction-making power exists under the current law in respect of children who have been committed to care in divorce and some other family proceedings though our understanding is that it is rarely exercised other than in wardship <e> <s> for most children in care the amendment would constitute a major change with courts being able to take responsibility for deciding any matter concerning the welfare of the child <e>", "<cs> when considering this amendment i think it is important to look at what clause a provides <e> <s> it provides that the local authority which while a care order is in force has parental responsibility for the child may not <e>", "<cs> clause and so on seek to address that point <e> <s> as the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge has said it is difficult <e> <s> that is why i believe that clause is the best place for this to be considered <e> <s> as i read the subsection it provides that the local authority must <e>", "<cs> the local authoritys flexibility in clause to give effect to that is well preserved <e> <s> i believe that the subsection addresses the problem in a more satisfactory way than attempting to do so in relation to a prohibition directed at the local authority seeking to change the childs creed for reasons of its own <e>", "<cs> the essential idea of children who are not in care being looked after is as the noble lord lord prys-davies says a voluntary arrangement <e> <s> that means that the child is the full responsibility of the parent who is still there in relation to the child <e> <s> in that situation it appears to me that the correct procedure is that provided generally in the earlier part of the bill where the section contact order is appropriate <e> <s> that is a general possibility of applying for a contact order in relation to a child <e>", "<cs> yes that generally is the case so far as i can see <e> <s> that would be the appropriate procedure provided under the bill for dealing with a situation where the arrangements are voluntary <e> <s> apart from the fact that the local authority is providing a service the parental responsibilities and relationships are the same as they are in a general family situation for which section is designed to cater <e>", "<cs> the same provisions would apply <e> <s> i cannot see why there should be a different kind of procedure for resolving problems between parents and the other people where the parents had arranged with a local authority to keep the child for a while and where they had not done so <e> <s> i cannot see that that is a relevant distinction <e> <s> section provides comprehensive arrangements for resolving disputes where it is right that people should have the possibility of contact with a child <e> <s> the mere fact that a child is under some kind of voluntary arrangement in the keeping of the local authority should not be different from arrangements made for let us say keeping a child in a private school or some other form of residental accommodation <e>", "<cs> i venture to think that most of these views have already been accommodated <e> <s> there is nothing in clause that precludes contact with any other person <e> <s> the duty to promote contact is that in paragraph of schedule to which the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale referred earlier and on which he asked me a question <e> <s> paragraph of schedule states <e>", "<cs> i opened my remarks by saying that there is no restriction in clause <e> <s> it is a provision which puts responsibility upon the local <e>", "<cs> that is covered because any person connected with the child would include a grandparent <e> <s> a grandparent is a pre-eminent example of someone who has a definite connection with the child <e> <s> the clause is int ended to embrace a general obligation to promote contact between the child and those who have any kind of connection with him and to try to maintain an ordinary family provision <e> <s> the intention is that the child is not taken away and put into a form of isolation but so far as possible is kept in contact with all those people with whom he has had connections <e>", "<cs> one must assume that people will read the whole of the legislation however difficult <e> <s> we debated the subject yesterday <e> <s> one cannot put everything in every place because one immediately introduces the most complex provisions <e>", "<cs> i am sure that we are all keen to see that when a child is in the care of a local authority under a care order contact is maintained between the child and any persons who have a substantial interest in the child where it would be in the childs interest for that contact to be maintained <e> <s> that is provided for in paragraph <e>", "<cs> the situation on these matters is that as the noble lord knows notification provisions form an important part of the rules of court currently applying to care proceedings in a magistrates court <e> <s> we intend to improve the present provisions in relation to procedure but i assure the noble lord that we intend to meet his concerns in rules of court as best we can <e> <s> it seems to me that notification matters are matters best dealt with in the rules of court <e>", "<cs> if i have understood this amendment right it deals with education supervision orders <e> <s> i am not sure that i can go along with the noble lord in his dramatic picture of what happens in magistrates courts <e> <s> no doubt on occasion as in some other courts there is some extra stress and a desire to get things finished on the same day as that in which they started <e> <s> some courts are less under pressure than others <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond to that point <e> <s> i sought to explain on second reading and if necessary i shall explain again that it is part of our purpose that these matters should be dealt with by the domestic jurisdiction of the magistrates <e> <s> we may gradually be able to improve the situation but believe that that itself makes an important distinction between criminal cases and this sort of case <e>", "<cs> assuming that i get this bill through i shall be getting on with it rather well <e>", "<cs> i certainly have that suggestion in mind but in this bill we are seeking to improve the arrangements for the child care jurisdiction <e> <s> i believe that if these arrangements prove to be successful they may well give a way forward for all forms of family dispute resolution <e>", "<cs> the phrase a family court is undefined <e> <s> i have met a number of people who support that campaign <e> <s> they have different views about the nature of the institution for which they are asking <e> <s> this bill is a considerable step forward in the arrangements for dealing with child care business <e> <s> if as i hope the arrangements under the bill prove successful they will form a good model for dealing further with other aspects of family business <e> <s> that is the sense in which i am moving <e> <s> i believe that it has good prospects for creating general improvement over the whole field <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that there is much difference of opinion between us on the result to be achieved <e> <s> clause already provides that a court may not make an interim care order or an interim supervision order <e>", "<cs> i think that the amendment the noble baroness has moved raises a question which it would he desirable to clarify <e> <s> i cannot accept the amendment as it stands because i would want to keep the substance of subsection as at present but i should like to consider adding to it to deal with the point that the noble baroness has raised rather than leaving it to a general law <e> <s> if the noble baroness is prepared to accept that i shall do my best to bring forward a proper amendment <e>", "<cs> the point appears to hold good in relation to both amendments so far as i can judge <e>", "<cs> i am taking the unusual step of asking that clause should not stand part of the bill <e> <s> it served two purposes both of which will be achieved by other means <e> <s> first subsections and gave a court in care or supervision proceedings the same power to make section orders as it has in family proceedings <e> <s> as i explained a short while ago in relation to amendments nos <e> <s> and amendment no <e> <s> which the committee kindly agreed to on th december achieves the same effect as those two subsections and therefore renders them unnecessary <e> <s> that amendment inserted proceedings under part iv of the bill which includes applications for care and supervision orders into the definition of family proceedings thereby attracting the power to make section orders which is conferred by clause <e> <s> as a result clause and adds nothing <e> <s> this is a neater way of achieving the same result <e>", "<cs> we accept that the courts are unlikely to find many cases in which it would not be appropriate to appoint a guardian to represent the childs interests <e> <s> however there may be some perhaps a straightforward case involving an older child who has already instructed his own solicitor <e> <s> in any case the court can call for a welfare report under clause of the bill from a probation officer or a local authority and there may be some circumstances in which the court considers it appropriate <e> <s> if the courts find it is not necessary to appoint a guardian we think that the courts should not be obliged to do so <e> <s> as an indication of the governments expectation in this area the committee will notice that the precise wording of this provision changes the emphasis of the present law <e> <s> under that the court is generally required to appoint a guardian only if the court thinks it is necessary to do so to safeguard the childs interest otherwise a guardian will not be appointed <e>", "<cs> as the noble and learned lord has said the rules of court currently prescribe circumstances in which a guardian ad litem shall instruct a solicitor for the child <e> <s> it was our intention to continue to make provision for this matter in court rules <e> <s> this would he one of the matters covered by clause b which places the guardian <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may deal with amendments nos <e> <s> and together <e> <s> they would have the effect of placing a duty on the court to appoint a solicitor for the child in circumstances where the child is not represented by a solicitor <e> <s> this would be an absolute duty as amendment no <e> <s> would remove the conditions that the current draft imposes <e>", "<cs> certainly we are considering that but this point we discussed a little in that connection <e> <s> at that stage my noble friend lord campbell of alloway proposed that the child should be represented by the official solicitor who would be the normal person to be appointed if a guardian ad litem were required <e> <s> the noble and learned lord <e> <s> lord elwyn-jones and myself were agreed at that stage that it would not be wise to restrict the child to the official solicitor but the child could have a solicitor of his or her own <e>", "<cs> i doubt whether as a technical matter the amendment ensures that guardians ad litem would be provided as a service by the courts instead of by local authorities <e> <s> it would still be open to the secretary of state under the regulations to require local authorities to provide the court welfare service <e>", "<cs> i have set up the instructions <e> <s> there is a question of priorities and at the moment my priority is to see this bill through parliament <e> <s> that involves a good deal of effort of one kind and another <e>", "<cs> the intention of these amendments has been explained <e> <s> i question whether the amendments go quite as far as their intention for the same sort of reason as i mentioned in relation to amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> however i should like to deal with the matter rather more fully because it is important and i should not like there to be any misunderstanding about it <e>", "<cs> the amendments are unnecessary <e> <s> subsection already provides that the secretary of states regulation-making power in subsection is not to prejudice the power of the lord chancellor to confer or impose duties on the official solicitor under section of the supreme court act <e> <s> accordingly it would allow directions under that act to give the official solicitor duties in any proceedings under the bill including those relating to care and supervision orders in the high court <e> <s> regulations about the role of panel guardians ad litem under the bill would be without prejudice to those duties <e>", "<cs> until now the official solicitor has had no role at all in care proceedings because he has not been in the high court <e> <s> we are looking at the best structure for the safeguarding of the childrens interests and the official solicitor might possibly have a role <e> <s> we are trying to make arrangements under which for example there would not have to be transfer from one guardian ad litem to another if the case was transferred <e>", "<cs> the aim of these amendments is the transfer of the power to give directions to a responsible person and to a child subject to a supervision order made in civil proceedings from the supervisor to the court <e> <s> section of the children and young person act does at present provide that the court may require the child to comply with the directions of the supervisor <e> <s> sub-paragraphs and of paragraph of schedule maintain that position <e>", "<cs> the review of child care law did not consider the duration of supervision orders made in care proceedings <e> <s> it did recommend that consideration be given to supervision orders in other family proceedings having a limited duration of one year with a power for the court to extend the order at a later date <e> <s> the court would have the power to impose certain requirements on parents and children and the shorter duration of the supervision order with a power to extend would enable the court to tailor its order to the needs of the individual child <e> <s> the shorter duration would make orders more effective induce a greater sense of purpose and reduce the risk of undermining parents confidence in relation to their children <e>", "<cs> we are in this clause talking about emergency protection of children and i accept that the words immediate removal could be said to help to convey this flavour <e> <s> however i fear that inclusion of the word immediately would undermine the philosophy of the clause <e> <s> first the order may be made <e>", "<cs> this is an extremely important matter <e> <s> i hope that notwithstanding what i said at the outset of this debate the committee will be prepared to allow me to make a fairly detailed explanation <e> <s> the matter is certainly one that i should not wish to try finally to resolve tonight <e> <s> as my noble friends have demonstrated between them there are two rather different points of view available on this matter <e> <s> differences exist between those who have great experience in this field <e> <s> there are differences between the directors of social work on the one hand and the nspcc on the other <e> <s> both those parties are very experienced in this field <e> <s> it would be difficult for me to select between them except on the basis of considerable reasons which i am now about to embark upon <e>", "<cs> there is a very similar provision on disclosure in clause which enables the court where it appears that adequate information as to the childs whereabouts is not available to another person to include a provision in the emergency protection order requiring that person to disclose any information that he may have if asked to do so by the applicant <e>", "<cs> i believe that i can deal with this matter fairly briefly as the answer is the same for all these amendments <e> <s> the rule-making power in clause is deliberately very far-reaching <e> <s> it covers all the matters which have been raised by the amendments <e> <s> in particular i refer to clause b which covers the persons who are to be informed of the making of listed applications and orders <e> <s> the rules of court could only cover notification of persons with parental responsibilituy for the child under the amendment that the noble lord lord mishcon has proposed at least if one reads just that amendment <e>", "<cs> i hate the idea of the noble lord being miserable <e> <s> i cannot entirely prevent him from being fatigued but i shall do my best to do so <e> <s> in my mind there is no question but that the matters covered in these amendments are of considerable importance as he says <e> <s> i believe i can undertake that all these matters will be subject to consideration for the rules and i would expect the rules not necessarily in these terms to make suitable provision to cover all these matters <e> <s> that is the situation <e> <s> obviously these rules have to be consulted upon and the precise circumstances of them have to be looked at <e> <s> however my understanding is that the intention is to cover all those matters in a codified way in the rules <e>", "<cs> i am prepared to undertake to give a statement of the position when we reach that stage <e> <s> if it is possible to be absolutely conclusive about the matter then well and good <e> <s> i shall certainly undertake to so to speak report the matter further to the noble lord in time for him to put down an amendment before third reading if he so wishes <e>", "<cs> although the earlier amendment and this amendment both deal with the medical examination this amendment deals with it in the context of the emergency protection order where the childs consent may be less important <e> <s> one can imagine a situation where an abused child under a parents influence would refuse <e> <s> therefore the considerations are different but i undertake to consider both amendments without necessarily the same result <e>", "<cs> the amendment is not necessary for the purpose indicated because there is nothing in this part to oust the jurisdiction of the court on judicial review <e> <s> as the noble lord knows one needs clear words to oust the jurisdiction of the court on judicial review <e> <s> the result is achieved by the wording as we have it at the moment <e>", "<cs> i have already explained in some detail the general policy that we have in mind and the possibility of making regulations which would make appropriate to certain cases particular procedures <e> <s> i should like to mention one point in connection with the amendments <e> <s> the registrar of the county court often deals adequately with family matters <e> <s> it might well be the case that he would be an officer to be considered as one to make such orders <e> <s> the matter is one on which we would desire to have flexibility and also desire to have the possibility of change without the necessity for primary legislation to take account of improvements in procedure and experience of procedure <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this raises an important question and the situation is one which we are very much still considering <e> <s> i could talk about it at some length <e> <s> it may be that the noble and learned lord will feel able to leave this with us for further consideration <e> <s> it is an area in which we are certainly thinking of making proposals of our own at as early a time as we can manage <e>", "<cs> the idea of this provision which is as it were under attack is to allow the rules <e>", "<cs> i will do my best to give an indication in time before the end of the proceedings here <e>", "<cs> i am happy to consider this amendment further <e> <s> we must watch of course that in what could well be tense situations we do not place on the child burdens of the kind that concerned us when considering similar amendments in respect of other parts of the bill <e> <s> we shall also need to be sure that it would not undermine any other obligations the police may have under this clause in particular the requirement to safeguard the childs welfare <e> <s> so it is a delicate situation but we will certainly consider it further <e>", "<cs> i sympathise with the principle behind this amendment and i undertake to table an amendment at a later stage to give effect to the white paper proposal by conferring power on the secretary of state by regulations to exempt specified organisations and their officers from liabilitiy as regards the harbouring of children in specified premises in specified circumstances <e> <s> the powers of exemption would also be extended to liability under section of the child abduction act for acts which amount to harbouring <e> <s> i hope that in the light of that undertaking the noble lord will feel able to withdraw this rather extensive amendment <e>", "<cs> as i understand this amendment it could exempt from transfer regulations those emergency protection orders which had been applied for by a person authorised to bring proceedings for care and supervision <e> <s> of course here we are currently talking about the nspcc <e> <s> i can see the logic behind the amendment <e> <s> a person who is authorised to bring proceedings under clause is in a special position <e> <s> not only is he able to act under clause he is also empowered to apply for an extension to an emergency order <e> <s> in other words his powers are as extensive as a local authoritys when it comes to making applications <e>", "<cs> on my noble friends question voluntary home means <e>", "<cs> the point that the noble baroness makes in relation to this amendment is a point well taken <e> <s> we shall certainly consider how best this shall be done <e> <s> the precise form of review may be a little different from the one provided for the local authority which we have discussed already but we shall consider this matter further <e> <s> i hope that in the light of that assurance the noble baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment <e>", "<cs> it is particularly this amendment that we have in mind <e>", "<cs> i believe that the question of which amendments one takes together is largely a matter of discretion <e> <s> sometimes one takes a larger group than one otherwise might have done in the hope of making particular progress because there are many important issues to be discussed <e> <s> i believe that in this committee we have sought to discuss issues and i have not troubled with the precise result in terms of drafting <e> <s> i believe that the same is true of nearly all members of the committee who have taken part in the debates <e>", "<cs> i cannot see any reason why a voluntary organisation with great standing would not be at least as good as other organisations in looking after disturbed children who needed that form of protection against themselves <e> <s> i cannot see why the mere fact that the organisation is non-voluntary should make it better in that respect <e>", "<cs> strictly speaking that proposal is not the subject of any of these amendments <e> <s> i know that the noble and learned lord is well aware of that because he spoke of tabling an amendment at a later stage <e> <s> i do not go along with the view that this makes no difference at all <e> <s> it is important in its context <e> <s> however perhaps the noble and learned lord will allow me to leave that matter until he puts it forward by way of an amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has explained a complicated amendment in an amazingly <e>", "<cs> the idea of this amendment is to provide for the regulations to deal with for example something happening which would require a visit within the prescribed time limits and the normal provisions would operate to require regular visiting <e> <s> but something might happen <e> <s> for example a complaint might be made from some independent source or there might be an accident to the child which would make it desirable that a visit should take place <e> <s> so the idea is to give power in regulations to require a visit determined not by time but by circumstances of which those are illustrations <e> <s> there might be better illustrations but those occur to me <e> <s> so we are anxious to keep this provision <e> <s> it is an important matter <e> <s> it is important that we should have the opportunity to visit as a result of something happening such as an accident <e>", "<cs> i think that this amendment will probably take some time because it is an important one <e> <s> so it may be that this is an appropriate time to see whether we can gain some refreshment before we embark on it <e>", "<cs> i should like first to say a word or two about the question of resources <e> <s> as i understand the position estimates for the public service are to be laid before the house of commons <e> <s> if there is a suggestion that for a particular function inadequate provision has been made i would suggest that that is a matter for the other place <e> <s> that does not mean that matters which affect resources may not be raised in this chamber but i suggest that the question of whether the resources provided are adequate or inadequate is a matter for the other place <e>", "<cs> it is clearly important that the secretary of state should be able to cause an inquiry to be held into matters connected with an individual child <e> <s> local authotities have powers and responsibilities not only towards children generally but also towards individual children in the circumstances covered by the bill <e>", "<cs> without going into the matter in too much detail perhaps i could say that in considering the situation that the amendment has raised we may well need to consider some further powers for the secretary of state to give directions possibly in relation to classes of children <e> <s> it may be wise to think of it in that light <e> <s> but certainly i am prepared to consider further what we can do in this direction <e> <s> obviously we should like to proceed in conjunction with the local authority associations <e> <s> that may take a little time to come to fruition <e> <s> but if the noble lord is prepared to leave it on that basis i certainly undertake that we shall give this very careful consideration <e> <s> in the light of the <e>", "<cs> clause and re-enact the secretary of states existing power first introduced in and now in section of the child care act to make grants to local authorities for the provision of secure accommodation for children in community homes and to require such grants to be repaid if the secure accommodation ceases to be used as such <e> <s> as the noble baroness has explained the purpose of her proposed amendment is to give the secretary of state an additional power to make grants to local authorities to defray the costs incurred by them of providing accommodation and services for children who might otherwise have been placed in secure accommodation <e> <s> in other words to place equal emphasis on the need to encourage local authorities to provide and develop a range of specific accommodation and services which would reduce or obviate the need for placement in security <e> <s> the noble baroness has given illustrations of how that may be done <e>", "<cs> while i appreciate the noble lords concern about this issue i do not consider it appropriate in this bill to be introducing legislation which affects the principles and application of policy under social security legislation which is the responsibility of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social security in another place <e>", "<cs> i hope that members of the committee will take it for granted that i shall draw the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social security to the noble lords remarks <e>", "<cs> in a sense i have already anticipated what i should like to say about this amendment in what i said earlier <e> <s> there is a certain amount of common material between the two <e> <s> it is important that parliament is kept informed about the operation of childrens services and reports to parliament are one of the ways in which that can be done <e>", "<cs> we discussed this general question in relation to an earlier amendment <e> <s> i set out fairly fully the position as regards regulations regulating the use of corporal punishment in an institutional setting <e> <s> i explained what i believed to be the situation for foster parents and suggested that the matter should he agreed with them arid a local authority at the time the foster parent arrangements were made <e>", "<cs> the situation is that clause has been put into the bill as a clause which requires refinement but which enables us to set out in principle what we have in mind <e> <s> the committee will remember that late in the summer after lord justice butler-slosss report came out the lord chancellors department issued a consultation paper <e> <s> we had to make the time for consultation quite short because i did not wish to do anything which would lose the place of the bill in the parliamentary process <e> <s> i believe that it is very important that the bill should go forward <e>", "<cs> no doubt the difficulty is partly the result of the language that i used <e> <s> i was not reading anything <e> <s> i was trying to explain directly to members of the committee what i had in mind <e> <s> the information that we have suggests to me that most care cases would appropriately be dealt with in the magistrates court <e> <s> the process has to start somewhere <e> <s> somebody has to decide where the case is to allocated <e> <s> if the truth is that most cases ought to be tried in the magistrates court then that is the appropriate place to start the case because it means that one will minimise the amount of movement <e> <s> it is very difficult to provide criteria that would not be operated by someone within the system <e> <s> we have in mind that the cases would start there <e> <s> if they satisfy criteria for being moved up they will then immediately be moved up to the court to which they ought to go <e> <s> they will then proceed from there <e>", "<cs> that is so <e> <s> it is by reference to criteria that we shall lay down as fully and in as much detail as seems practicable <e> <s> we may have to modify these criteria in the light of experience <e> <s> this is a new departure but it is one which i believe is welcome <e> <s> not all care cases are to be heard before the magistrates although some are at present <e> <s> that is one of the difficulties about the present system <e> <s> this is an advance on the present system which we hope we shall be able to improve as time goes on <e> <s> we are making a start the very best we can but it may still require to be improved <e> <s> the noble lord has described accurately what i have in mind <e>", "<cs> all i can say is that i shall do my best but as a practical matter the alternative is to lose the bill altogether until we gather everything together that came from that consultation <e> <s> much of that work has followed <e> <s> we had to find out what lord justice butler-sloss had to say before we could issue that consultation paper <e> <s> this is our opportunity <e> <s> we could have left out the jurisdictional questions altogether which is what i originally said when i was asked about this a long while ago <e> <s> i suggested that we should try to get the substantive law right and then make the jurisdictional improvements <e> <s> i now see an opportunity to do both <e> <s> i hope that the committee will have sympathy with that aim <e> <s> we cannot create it immediately because it is a difficult structure but the noble baroness may take it that i shall do my best to get as much forward to the committee as i can but i cannot promise because of the detailed work involved to get it right <e> <s> we must consult many people about it but i hope that we shall be able to have it all ready in time for the final stages in this chamber <e>", "<cs> that is precisely right <e> <s> i believe from information that i have that most cases will be appropriately dealt with in the magistrates court at that level the domestic panel level <e> <s> but we do not have an analysis in as much detail as i should like which would enable us to say that with absolute confidence <e> <s> once the system is in operation it will be seen perhaps that per cent <e> <s> of the cases will be taken in the county court <e> <s> if that is right that is the place where they should start and then make allocations out <e> <s> we need to minimise the number of transfers and to do that we need to start them at the place where most of them are heard <e> <s> that is the principle we are working on <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can deal with all of those matters generally without referring to particular amendments <e> <s> first as regards clause i have explained the reason for that being in the bill and i am happy to agree that it should be taken out by an appropriate amendment <e> <s> i believe that an amendment in the name of the noble lord lord irvine of lairg achieves that and i should be content with that <e> <s> that disposes of that matter <e>", "<cs> i explained why subsection was included in clause <e> <s> i have been able to consider the matter with others who are interested and am happy to omit the subsection <e> <s> therefore i accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i believe that the detail of this matter should be left to the rules of court <e> <s> the first branch of the amendment is in a sense expressing a general principle which one would give effect to in the rules <e> <s> the phrase <e>", "<cs> there appears to be a certain amount of misunderstanding about clause <e> <s> clause does not proceed on the basis that the code in the bill is complete <e> <s> rather clause provides that the inherent jurisdiction of the high court cannot be used as an alternative to a care or supervision order <e> <s> that is what it says <e> <s> it does not say that it cannot be used at all but it cannot be used as an alternative procedure for a care or supervision order <e> <s> the situation is that if one wants a care or supervision order one has to satisfy the statutory criteria <e> <s> in my submission that is perfectly right <e>", "<cs> obviously there may be something which could be improved upon but clause says <e>", "<cs> i am not absolutely clear what is intended by the amendment <e> <s> if the idea is that anyone could apply and be heard without the leave of the court that would appear to be a rather wide provision <e> <s> i find it difficult to see precisely what the effect would be <e> <s> i am grateful for the remark about the side note <e> <s> that is not part of the bill but is perhaps a point that needs thought <e>", "<cs> i explained in answer to an earlier amendment that we are not seeking to review the wardship situation in this bill because the law commission recommended that the bill should be put in place the wardship jurisdiction should be retained and then considered in the light of the position when the bill is in place <e>", "<cs> these amendments are practically identical with amendments nos <e> <s> to which were proposed for clause in relation to guardians ad litem in care and related proceedings <e> <s> clause with guardians ad litem and reporting officers in adoption proceedings and the points which i made in reply to amendments nos <e> <s> to apply here too <e>", "<cs> this matter is always one of judgment <e> <s> where duties are set out in the bill and only procedural matters remain to be disposed of i believe that the negative procedure is the proper means of regulation <e> <s> it is an effective means <e> <s> any objection to the matter can be raised whereas if there is nothing contentious it can be dealt with without involving parliamentary time <e>", "<cs> this is a very important provision <e> <s> the noble lord and myself had a discussion in which the importance of this particular concept arose in another connection <e> <s> he may remember it <e> <s> i believe it is very necessary to have this explanation at the beginning of the bill in clause because there the matter is being elucidated <e> <s> the interpretation clause normally carries all the special interpretations that exist <e> <s> that is the reason why i prefer to have the deletion in the earlier provision in the similar situation that we were speaking about <e> <s> in this case we are in a fairly important and a rather new field as regards the family law reform act <e> <s> it still requires to sink in as it were as part of the statutory framework <e> <s> though this is a duplication i believe that in the context of the bill it is quite important and i would rather hold on to it <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord feels in the light of the explanation that it is not wise to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> this new power can be used only in closely defined circumstances as set out in subsection a paragraphs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the general reception accorded the bill and for the acknowledgment of the work carried out by the law commission including the method by which it works which i agree has very much changed this particular approach to law reform <e> <s> governments also have learned from the techniques of the law commission on how to proceed in such matters <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale has said this is a fairly technical matter <e> <s> we may be able to resolve it by a more private discussion than is possible here so i welcome his kindness in giving us an opportunity for further discussion <e> <s> on that basis i hope that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord banks referred to the earlier amendment <e> <s> obviously an important aspect of the legal advice would be that it is focused on the amendment <e> <s> there is nothing in the amendment to say who is to impart the information and no duty is imposed upon anyone to do so as has been said when responding to the earlier amendment in committee i said that if it were thought desirable the form which the lord chancellor would prescribe could contain a warning about the legal significance of the agreement and that anyone in doubt should seek legal advice <e> <s> the form could also make it clear that the agreement was revocable by the courts if that were thought desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke about this matter to some extent in committee as did other noble lords who have spoken today <e> <s> i do not in any way minimise the importance of these duties which are described in the amendment in the same words as are used in the bill <e> <s> so to the extent to which the words have been commended i take them as being commended in the bill as stated <e>", "<cs> my lords if one is looking for clarity it is wise to have the head fairly generally in charge <e> <s> that is what we have sought to do <e> <s> if the noble lords argument were to be adopted it would be important to state the general duty <e> <s> it would be very odd to place little bits however important of the general duty into part i and then have the general duty itself stated in clause where it has to lie <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always anxious to do what i can to assist my noble friend to avoid temptation <e> <s> i shall certainly consider what he has said <e> <s> however i have to make it very plain that i do not think it at all likely that i shall come forward with anything on the lines that he has proposed <e> <s> if reference ought to be made in part i to local authorities place in the scheme and i should have to consider very carefully whether that is the case i should want to do so by means of a more general provision leading into part iii <e> <s> something of that kind may be possible <e> <s> if such consideration on my part assists my noble friend i hope that he will be able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not clear what my noble and learned friend is referring to <e> <s> as far as i know the marshalled list is in order <e> <s> i have no reason to suppose that it is not <e> <s> since my noble and learned friend has raised the matter i shall inquire into it <e> <s> perhaps in the meantime the noble lord lord mishcon can proceed on the basis that the marshalled list is in order <e>", "<cs> my lords until the noble lord explained the amendment i had some difficulty in understanding what was intended <e> <s> there may well be circumstances in which more than one guardian should he appointed <e> <s> i take it from what the noble lord has said that he is anxious to ensure that the guardian appointed under clause will not take over from the parent <e> <s> i think that that is the effect of the guardian appointment anyway <e> <s> i had rather assumed <e>", "<cs> my lords before i call amendment no <e> <s> perhaps i should deal with the point raised by my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> questions were raised about the drafting of clause <e> <s> amendments were put down in the lord chancellors name but they were withdrawn because some further doubts were raised about the matter <e> <s> that explains why what my noble and learned friend saw earlier is not on the marshalled list as printed <e> <s> we are not putting forward these amendments <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for drawing this matter to our attention but i think that it need not trouble us further at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should deal with that matter first <e> <s> i have spent some time trying to persuade authorities in other countries to speed up the processes for bringing children back from a parent in a case where a child has been taken or abducted in order to make sure that the system works properly <e> <s> i have pointed out and this may be the origin of the matter that if a child has stayed say a year in a new environment the child may have put down roots in that environment made friends and so on in such a way that the court would regard it in the best interests of the child to stay where he was <e> <s> therefore it is of great importance if one is trying to take a child back to get on with the matter quickly before the rooting has taken place <e> <s> that may be the origin of the suggestion that there is such a rule <e> <s> i certainly do not think of it as a rule i think of it as a very strong encouragement to get on with the matter because where a country has a rule that the paramount consideration is to be the welfare of the child one has to take account of these factors <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is easy to devise a formula for that purpose but i believe that the court will be able to distinguish cases to some extent by the risk of abduction <e> <s> it is difficult to try to give examples because they are apt to be taken out of context <e> <s> however i would expect a court to be fairly astute in watching that aspect <e> <s> no one can be sure in advance because to be successful <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of the amendment is to require rules of court to provide a procedure by which a child may apply to be joined as a party to proceedings or apply to start proceedings <e> <s> there is already power to provide a procedure to enable a child to exercise his rights under clause to start proceedings by applying for an order <e> <s> further in so far as he will be entitled to be a party to proceedings under clause again there is already power to provide for the procedure to be followed <e> <s> i can assure the house in so far as any assurance is needed that we shall make whatever procedural arrangements are necessary to allow the child to exercise those rights <e>", "<cs> my lords the court has a duty to ascertain the wishes of the child in accordance with the provisions of the main clause no <e> <s> <e> <s> the childs position will then be obvious <e> <s> clause requires the court to have regard in particular to <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the criticism if it is a criticism that the answer which i have given today is much the same as the answer i gave before <e> <s> it is the answer <e> <s> clause is the most important provision indicating the basis on which leave to apply for a section order will be granted <e> <s> it is the main area of the noble baronesss concern and the childs position is in the forefront of that provision <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder with the leave of the house whether i could make it absolutely plain that what i am saying is that the structure of the bill is such that rules of court will have to be made <e> <s> i cannot foresee any situation in which the right to apply to grant leave could be frustrated and clause makes it clear that the child has a right to apply for leave <e> <s> accordingly i am saying that the procedure for that purpose is a necessary consequence of what we have in the bill at the moment <e> <s> but i am not of course able to add anything further <e>", "<cs> my lords the present position as i understand it is that a grandparent can apply as of right for an access order under section a of the guardianship of minors act when a custody or access order is in force under section of that act or when the grandparents child has himself died leaving children <e> <s> those rights are rather restrictive and arbitrary in the governments view <e> <s> accordingly the bill will allow grandparents to apply at any time and in any circumstances for a contact order only provided that they obtain the courts leave by demonstrating that they have a good reason <e> <s> in addition of course a grandparent can apply if he or she has lived with the child for three or more years or has the consent of those with parental responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness explained the amendment would remove <e>", "<cs> my lords when drawing up a timetable the court will have to be realistic and will have to take account of all the circumstances otherwise it will simply not be adhered to <e> <s> many things may affect the matter for example whether medical or welfare reports have to be obtained when parties are available and so on <e> <s> plainly if parents are facing difficulties because they are abroad that too would be taken into account <e> <s> but so could the fact that they are hospitalised or are on a walking trip in wales or are uncontactable for some other reason <e> <s> perhaps rather than living abroad they are simply on a holiday <e> <s> it really cannot make sense to tack on to the timetable power one of the very many matters which in particular cases may be relevant <e> <s> doing so is not only illogical unless a pretty near definitive list is provided but may also suggest that the factor mentioned is somehow more significant than others and thus be misleading <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may take the last question first <e> <s> the reason for the distinction between clause and schedule is that children covered by schedule are in care and may not apply for an order under clause prohibiting removal <e> <s> under clause the child can apply for a prohibited steps order <e>", "<cs> no my lords it does not <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> my lords the child is free to agree perhaps but certainly not to disagree <e> <s> the question is whether his consent is required <e> <s> the amendment does not refer to the written consent of the child in every case <e> <s> it refers to <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that the noble lords intention in moving the amendment was not to produce the result which i have just described <e> <s> however if one reads the words carefully as i think i have done there is at least a considerable danger that they have that consequence <e>", "<cs> my lords i said in committee that i would consider whether there should be a limit on the overall time during which a child may be kept abroad during a given period <e> <s> that i have done and i have come to the conclusion that there is no need for such a limitation <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment like its predecessor addresses what i regard as an extremely important matter <e> <s> i do not in any way under-estimate the position <e> <s> however i wonder <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of different matters to be taken into account here <e> <s> first perhaps i may start with the point that my noble friend lord mottistone has just made <e> <s> i can well see that some discrimination might be required in relation to the schedule in respect of which clause operates <e> <s> noble lords will see that we have already done that <e> <s> clause is dealing with the provisions of part i of schedule <e> <s> there is nothing particularly sacrosanct about that <e> <s> i am certainly willing to consider whether any particular provision of part i should be regarded as sacrosanct <e> <s> however it is worth seeing how this position has developed <e>", "<cs> my lords what i am saying at the moment is that this house as a revising chamber indeed it is to this house that the bill was brought it has not yet been to the other place is exercising its legislative power in dealing with a bill that has come before it first <e> <s> i am saying that what has been referred to as the revising power of the house is to be exercised in relation to the grant of the power <e> <s> i see no derogation in this house granting the power subject to such conditions and limitations as it thinks proper <e> <s> it seems to me that that is a perfectly proper exercise of the revising power of this chamber <e> <s> the mere fact that having considered a matter it is left to be dealt with by statutory instrument does not in any way derogate from the revising power of the house <e> <s> i accept that the scope for revision is not so great in a statutory instrument as it is for an ordinary bill <e> <s> i accept that but the power to carry out this operation by statutory instrument is what parliament is presently considering <e> <s> i cannot see that merely tallow a power to be exercised by statutory instrument is a derogation from the revising duty and responsibility of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave the explanation is that i gave that as the basis on which a power of this kind is sought that there would be room for improvement in the method by which that improvement would be carried out <e> <s> in the language of the schedule it would be to modify or repeal parts and also to <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down i should like to make clear the fact that i am prepared to consider with my colleagues the removal of the word repeal <e> <s> i can see the effect of that in particular and the noble and learned lord has now focused on it especially <e> <s> shall be happy to consider removing that word if it is objectionable <e> <s> however i wish to preserve an ability to take account of improvements as they occur without the necessity for further primary legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i believe that in the circumstances i ought to undertake to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much understand and sympathise with the thought behind these various amendments to secure that due weight is given to the needs of children from ethnic minority groups and to enable them to develop with a proper awareness of their racial and cultural backgrounds <e> <s> however i cannot accept the amendments proposed just as they stand and it may be helpful if i spend a little time seeking to explain my reasons <e> <s> i shall therefore find it necessary not only to refer to the main one but to the later ones as well <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee in response to the amendment already referred to which was moved by the noble baroness lady masham i pointed out that there was no question of a child being taken to be in need just because the parent or parents were disabled <e> <s> i think that when one looks at the statutory provisions that is clear <e>", "<cs> my lords the point about clause is that it focuses on the circumstances of the child <e> <s> it is the child who has to be disabled <e> <s> it does not of course follow that the child will require any particular services although he is disabled but it puts the child into the category where his situation must be considered <e> <s> that distinguishes him altogether from the parent <e> <s> there is no question of a child being held to be in need simply because his parent or indeed both parents are disabled <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend has explained the purpose of the amendment is to strengthen the duty to provide day care by tying clause with clause and the authoritys general duty to promote the welfare of children in need <e> <s> i believe that it is unnecessary because as drafted the authoritys duty or powers in clause cannot be exercised inconsistently with its duty under clause the words in clause as they consider appropriate have to be read in conjunction with the general duty to safeguard or protect the welfare of children in its area who are in need <e> <s> day care is a facility and clause requires the authority to provide services appropriate to the childrens needs <e> <s> clause by virtue of clause includes facilities <e> <s> accordingly clause is already emcompassed by the general duty under clause <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should say that i should not seek in any circumstances to drive a court to look at <e>", "<cs> my lords the idea behind these amendments is the same for each of them although they are in somewhat different contexts <e> <s> perhaps i may look particularly at the first one amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords they could provide nothing so long as there were no children in need but if there were children in need they would have an obligation to provide <e> <s> they have a power to provide for those not in need so if there are no children in need they may provide nothing <e> <s> i hope that i am making this clear <e>", "<cs> my lords the phrase children in need is defined in clause <e> <s> i am happy to read it out again but we have already dealt with it <e> <s> the phrase in need is a short expression to help shorten the bill because the full definition is rather a long one <e> <s> if there were no children in need the local authorities would not need to provide but they have an obligation to provide for children in need and a power to provide for those who are not in need <e>", "<cs> my lords no i think that the definition of a child in need is of a more general kind <e> <s> clause states <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may answer that point <e> <s> have had an opportunity to consider the question <e> <s> so far as i can see but i am subject to correction if my noble and learned friend can point out an example the phrase in need is used in this sense in part iii and the schedule which is a schedule to part iii <e> <s> i am not aware although i am very happy to be corrected that the phrase in need is used in this context in other parts of the bill <e> <s> the words in need arise in other parts but it is a specific need <e> <s> i believe that i am right in saying that this definition would operate only in a context in which children were in need without further specification <e> <s> if my noble and learned friend has examples of such a context in other parts of the bill i should be extremely grateful if he would be kind enough to bring these matters to my notice <e> <s> perhaps when we have the meeting to which we referred earlier we could look into this also <e> <s> however i have had an opportunity of considering the matter and that so far is the result of my deliberations <e>", "<cs> my lords we have dealt with amendment no <e> <s> to some extent already but there is no harm in dealing with it in relation to amendment no <e> <s> since i covered it in general before <e> <s> with amendment no <e> <s> the situation is that we are dealing with out-of-school care including holiday arrangements for school-age children <e> <s> there are two types which one should perhaps take separately local authority provision and private and voluntary provision <e> <s> i shall return to the first in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> amends clause which is included in the bill because we want all local authorities to develop an interest in day care for the under-fives <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord prys-davies said in introducing this amendment it has been to some extent discussed in committee <e> <s> the principle behind amendment no <e> <s> is that the social services department should not be required to provide accommodation for a child or seek a care order in respect of a child simply because his parents are homeless <e> <s> it is suggested that it should be the duty of a local housing authority to secure that suitable accommodation is available in such circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i should try to explain the background to this because in a way it is slightly strange to find the noble baroness seeking to excise from the bill a duty on the local authority to provide accommodation for any particular group <e>", "<cs> my lords a child is defined in the bill as <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the first amendment it would require local authorities providing accommodation for a child to enter into a written agreement with the parents or the child himself if or <e> <s> the second would specify the details which should be included in the agreement namely schooling contact and the period of notice which must be given on either side before removing the child <e>", "<cs> my lords in making any decision about a child that it is looking after a local authority must of course give consideration to the childs health and educational needs whenever those are relevant to the decision to be made <e> <s> but those are matters which are central to the childs welfare and in subsection of this clause the authority is placed under a duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of any child that it is looking after <e> <s> this welfare duty bears on all matters arising in respect of these children including decisions made with respect to them and it is not necessary to pick out certain aspects of the childs welfare in subsection <e> <s> indeed as i have argued before there are positive dangers in emphasising particular elements of the welfare duty in this way because it may raise doubts about the completeness of the duty and therefore dilute it <e> <s> it is essential that nothing is done in the bill to undermine or raise questions about the comprehensiveness of the authoritys welfare duty to these children <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we share common objectives in this matter <e> <s> i have already mentioned as have the noble lord lord mottistone and the noble lady lady kinloss the need to avoid children drifting in care <e> <s> the rules of court would provide for a plan to be laid out in the application <e> <s> i agree that in all probability it would not be very detailed at that stage but it should be sufficient to allow the court to understand what is proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that the use of the word child in relation to some of these people is rather a legalistic way of going about the matter but it is not easy to see how to replace it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now further considered on report <e>", "<cs> my lords we discussed this matter in committee <e> <s> i undertook then to consider whether we could put emphasis on relatives <e> <s> that i have sought to do <e> <s> if i have understood my own amendment correctly that is an important proviso it inserts the phrase under the heads i ii and iii into clause at line and therefore preserves the existing provision about terms as to payment <e>", "<cs> my lords this is obviously a difficult and important matter i do not think that my noble friend lord redesdale need in any sense apologise for taking up our time with it <e> <s> this type of placement is central and it is important that we should think it over <e> <s> however while we recognise that there is a school of thought in favour of changing the name it may not be quite wise to do that in the statute at least not yet <e>", "<cs> my lords the regulation-making powers in paragraph of part ii of schedule will enable us to provide in regulations for a wide range of matters connected with the welfare and upbringing of children placed with foster parents <e> <s> there are many equally important matters which are and will continue to be covered in foster placement regulations which are not specifically named in the regulation-making power <e> <s> we shall discuss more about the principles of this matter later <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that some kind of borderline is required <e> <s> it is possible to say that it is a terrible injustice to make one rule for existing placements and a new rule for new placements <e> <s> one has to have some form of borderline in this business <e>", "<cs> my lords i may not have made my position as clear as i ought <e> <s> i said that the matter would be considered in relation to the making of regulations <e> <s> that is what i said and i wish to make it quite plain <e> <s> i was not offering to reconsider the terms of the bill in order to consider accepting this amendment <e> <s> i said that it would be considered in relation to the making of regulations <e> <s> the noble baroness may therefore feel that she has no undertaking from me to reconsider the terms of the bill on this aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords is it your lordships pleasure that this amendment be withdrawn <e>", "<cs> my lords the question is that this amendment be agreed to <e> <s> as many as are of that opinion will say content <e>", "<cs> to the contrary not-content <e>", "<cs> my lords before i call the next amendment i must point out that if amendment no <e> <s> is agreed to i cannot call amendments nos <e> <s> or <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> addresses the problem that clause was expressed negatively <e> <s> what was wanted in committee was that it should be addressed in the opposite sense <e> <s> the word only which occurred to some of us when discussing the matter at committee stage has been used by the draftsmen in order to turn a negative into a positive <e> <s> that is what was required and i believe that it is grammatical <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should mention first in relation to the last point that amendment no <e> <s> standing in my name has the <e>", "<cs> my lords from our viewpoint every bill is intended to improve the situation <e> <s> i do not think it would be appropriate for me to enter into the detail of the social security position <e> <s> i have already said to your lordships in committee that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social security has undertaken closely to monitor the changes made on the last occasion particularly in relation to young people <e> <s> i think that it is right to concentrate in the children bill on the special situation of children in care <e> <s> when your lordships have an opportunity as you undoubtedly will to consider the social security bill you will be able to apply your minds to that aspect of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the point as regards general levels is a matter for the social security bill <e> <s> this bill addresses the special problems arising from coming out of care <e> <s> that is the aspect that we should be considering now <e> <s> it is in relation to that matter that these amendments have to be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly try to do so <e> <s> when i spoke about children coming out of care i was seeking to use a fairly compendious phrase to describe those who are dealt with at the beginning of clause that is those who when they attain the age will be leaving care <e> <s> clause deals with that and it imposes a duty to assist <e> <s> it is not specific at that stage because it is the assistance that would be necessary in coming out of care <e> <s> i am referring to people who have been in care or otherwise as described in clause when i speak about children coming out of care <e> <s> the age rises as my noble friend said to <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house this is a difficult question <e> <s> somebody must have responsibility for deciding these matters <e> <s> we felt that they are matters appropriately left to the local authority which is the elected body in the locality <e> <s> i am sure that most areas will have people perhaps not as eloquent as my noble friend who are able to draw attention to these problems <e> <s> if the problems are not attended to by the local authority it may be the case that electors in the local authority area will suffer <e> <s> that is perhaps not the best argument for using these powers properly but it is nevertheless an argument <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for my noble friend to decide what she wishes to do <e> <s> i shall then put the matter to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords when i was seeking to answer the groups of amendments with which we have just been dealing i said that we hoped to bring forward future amendments to make specific provision for local authorities to assist young people in connection with their education and training <e>", "<cs> my lords before dealing with this amendment i should like to say that clause addresses the problem that the noble lord lord prys-davies mentioned that of children leaving care <e> <s> clause places a duty on an authority to advise address and befriend him with a view to promoting his welfare when he ceases to be looked after by it <e> <s> that is a general duty of a character that should take account of the matters to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> where it applies subsection should also have that effect if there is a need for advice and befriending <e> <s> befriending is a big word which encompasses all the sorts of things that a good friend would tell another on parting about matters that could affect him <e> <s> social security and all the other matters that were mentioned will be covered by that provision <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale is right to say <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend has explained the purpose of this amendment is to provide that the regulations which may be made under clause in respect of local authority reviews may include a requirement that the authority advise the child whose case is being reviewed of his right to apply to the court for discharge or variation of an order made under part iv of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords before i call amendment no <e> <s> perhaps i should say that it appears to be an alternative to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that any further explanation is required apart from saying that i think the effect of amendment no <e> <s> is to give representation wherever it occurs thereafter the same meaning <e> <s> i shall however check with the draftsman to be certain <e> <s> that is my understanding of what we did <e> <s> this precludes in no way the format for the procedures when the procedures are set out <e> <s> it may well be that some greater prominence might be given to complaint in that situation than is done here <e> <s> however i think the basic point that i have explained still arises <e> <s> we want to make it clear that the review procedures are intended to deal not only with complaints but with every aspect of matters <e> <s> i believe that the amendment does that <e> <s> i think therefore that i ought to invite noble lords to deal with amendment no <e> <s> and then we can possibly go on to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first address myself to the question that the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale asked me about paragraph of schedule which appears on page <e> <s> i am speaking from memory but i think that i attempted to answer that question somewhat later <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment as my noble friend has said is like one that we discussed in committee <e> <s> the theme of a responsible officer started there and is expanded in the amendment to deal with all children accommodated by a local authority <e> <s> it would also give that officer responsibilities to safeguard and promote the childs welfare <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that i substantially accepted the principle but i indicated one or two reservations about the precise scope of the duty placed on the designated officer <e> <s> moreover i expressed a doubt also about the wisdom of designating an officer of the other agency rather than of the authority when the child is being looked after by another agency on behalf of the authority <e> <s> this is a matter which requires regulation <e> <s> therefore i feel it is best dealt with in its entirety in regulations <e> <s> if one is dealing with the whole subject it is better to do it in one place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am willing to consider that <e> <s> one has to be slightly careful because the subsection is fairly long already <e> <s> however if my noble friend would be kind enough to leave that with me i shall consider it with my advisers <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it is wise to deal with the amendments in order though they are closely connected as the noble lord has explained <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would place a duty on local authorities to take reasonable steps to make provision for services to meet the identified needs of children in their area <e> <s> if this amendment is intended to relate to children in need as defined the <e>", "<cs> my lords i see no difficulty in accepting the principle underlying this amendment <e> <s> it is clearly right that local authorities should be expected to take whatever steps are possible to reduce the need to place children in secure accommodation and to seek the authority of the court to keep them there <e>", "<cs> my lords with permission i shall deal with amendments nos <e> <s> and together <e> <s> the intention as has been explained is the same <e> <s> it is to strengthen the duties of local authorities to promote links between children and their families <e> <s> naturally i am very sympathetic to this objective and indeed clause imposes on local authorities a general duty to provide services to promote the upbringing of children in need by their families so far <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of the amendment is clear and i am sympathetic to that purpose <e> <s> the bill places a duty on local authorities to appoint an independent visitor where communication between the parents and child is very infrequent or where the child has not been visited during the preceding months <e> <s> the job of an independent visitor is to advise and befriend the child from a standpoint which is separate from that of the local authority <e> <s> a visitor can offer valuable support to an isolated child without many outside friends <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the forcefulness with which the noble baroness lady david moved her amendment at committee i am not entirely surprised to find that we are back on this subject at report <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee i set out our reasons for objecting to the child being able to apply for a care or supervision order <e> <s> indeed the noble lord has summarised with his customary accuracy and brevity what i said at greater length at that time <e> <s> i believe those reasons apply equally well to applications by persons with parental responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of the proposal would be to allow the court in care proceedings to make a new kind of order an adjournment order when an application for an order is made <e> <s> i have some difficulty with this point <e> <s> as i explained previously in committee the rules of court will provide for adjournments and we do not think that their use should be encouraged unless they are necessary for the case to proceed <e> <s> adjournments contribute to delays which we are anxious to keep to the minimum and i would not wish to introduce a provision which runs counter to this <e>", "<cs> my lords although the noble lord may not be a legal man i know that he has a great deal of experience relating to children of a variety of ages <e> <s> the court has the power to grant an adjournment if necessary <e> <s> i find inconsistent with the principles that we have adopted the idea that in some way the court should be in charge of the rehabilitation programme <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment is that a programme of rehabilitation should be carried out <e> <s> as regards rehabilitation and so forth the local authority has responsibility for the management of the case <e> <s> therefore it is not appropriate for the court to say to the local authority this is what you must do and give directions for it <e> <s> the local authority has that responsibility <e> <s> to try to put it on the court confuses the responsibility and the allocation of it <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving this amendment the noble lord lord prys-davies explained that having been together with this bill for some considerable time we understand its structure and that the welfare requirements placed on the courts by clause apply in full to all orders which the court makes about children <e> <s> the introductory words to subsections and make that perfectly clear while subsection b applies the check-list in subsection to those proceedings <e> <s> therefore that brings the whole machinery of clause into the care jurisdiction <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment operates on a most important provision <e> <s> we have had considerable discussion about these matters <e> <s> i believe that no fewer than three options have been suggested as to how to construct the last part of this clause and we now have a fourth <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend has explained this amendment would remove the restriction in clause c on authorised persons applying for a care or supervision order in respect of a child who is being provided with accommodation by a local authority in cases where the accommodation was being provided following an order made under part v of the bill <e> <s> the present restriction is one of several restrictions in subsection on such applications by authorised persons <e>", "<cs> my lords we considered amendments similar to this in committee and i explained then why i would not wish to see harm defined as including neglect <e> <s> these arguments still hold but there is an additional reason why i prefer to resist this amendment in view of amendments nos <e> <s> and to which i spoke a short while ago <e>", "<cs> my lords the words of the amendment are indeed impeccable in another context but i suggest that they are not appropriate in this matter <e> <s> we touched on the question of court directions when considering amendment no <e> <s> and i argued that the management of cases is a matter for the local authority not the courts <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am sure that the noble lord appreciates that courts can often manage matters in a way which does not require formal power <e> <s> i have no doubt that in discussion as to whether a care order should be made the court would have a view about the proposals <e> <s> it may well be that in the light of discussion in the court amendment of the proposals will result <e> <s> however the responsibility for making the proposals and carrying them out must be that of the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> is the amendment being moved <e> <s> i shall try to deal with the various matters arising in connection with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly willing to consider whether that should be further defined <e> <s> i am sorry that my noble and learned friend <e>", "<cs> my lords clause provides that where a court makes an interim care order or interim supervision order it may give such direction if any as it considers appropriate with regard to the medical or psychiatric examination of the child <e> <s> clause provides that where an interim supervision order is made and the question of medical or psychiatric examination arises the court shall act under subsection and as if paragraphs and of schedule were omitted from the schedule <e> <s> these disapplied paragraphs provide that among other things no requirements as to medical or psychiatric examinations or treatment may be included in a supervision order unless the court is satisfied that the child if of sufficient understanding consents <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for his kind remark <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments raise matters of considerable importance as has been plainly indicated already <e> <s> we discussed this matter to some degree in committee <e> <s> the guardian ad litem service is comparatively new having been set up in about <e> <s> the bill seeks to build on what we have and to improve the service in a way that i indicated previously <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment does not deal with the amount of the resources but the manner in which they should be allocated <e> <s> the question of the amount depends on the total demand <e> <s> the important point that i have undertaken to consider further is whether this resource should be something that is the subject of a specific grant by central government to the particular authorities or groups of authorities or whether it should remain under the present system <e> <s> i believe that the amendment seeks to establish a mechanism in the hope that the result will be as the noble baroness would wish it <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is concerned with the subject with which i dealt earlier at some length although in a rather different context <e> <s> the wording refers to the powers of the secretary of state to make regulations to provide panels of guardians ad litem and would add that <e>", "<cs> my lords there can be no doubt that this is an extremely important matter and one on which it is possible for informed people to take opposite points of view <e> <s> i think that that is perhaps not an uncommon situation <e>", "<cs> my lords although this amendment was considered in committee we did not have an opportunity to debate the matter at any great length <e> <s> i am glad to have had an opportunity to hear the views of your lordships today <e> <s> we shall certainly consider all those views very carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend has explained we touched briefly on this matter at a late hour in committee <e> <s> clause enables the court to make an emergency protection order on application by any person <e> <s> in the majority of cases this will be the local authority in whose area the child is ordinarily resident which will then investigate the circumstances of the case and decide whether to apply for a care order or supervision order or provide services under part iii <e> <s> clause provides that where that local authority is not the applicant it may take over the applicants responsibilities under the order in accordance with regulations made by the secretary of state <e> <s> the amendment would require that both the authority and the applicant be of the opinion that transfer of responsibility under the order would be in the childs best interests <e> <s> the particular applicant in mind is the nspcc <e> <s> the amendment does not however provide for failure to agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i sought to explain in relation to amendment no <e> <s> how in general terms we would expect transfers of emergency protection orders to operate <e> <s> our principal concerns are that the local authority within whose area the child is ordinarily resident and which will usually be the body best placed to consider the childs needs is able to take over responsibility for the child and inquire into what further action if any is required without unnecessary hindrance to the authority and disturbance to the child <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave i shall consider what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i still feel rather strongly that it would not be right to make a provision for a court application in this situation <e> <s> the argument that i advanced is intended to deal fully with the case he made <e> <s> but i am always in the business of considering what has been said <e> <s> we are always anxious to be made wiser by doing that <e> <s> i could not give any possible commitment to bring forward an amendment to deal with this matter because my impression is fairly strong that we have dealt with the matter properly already <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i recognise the purpose of this amendment namely that registered childrens homes should not in any circumstances restrict the liberty of their residents hence the proposed requirement that the secretary of <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards amendment no <e> <s> it is our intention to make regulations under the regulation-making power in schedule and specifically paragraph d <e> <s> i shall refer to that because it deals with the point expressly <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> my lords i sought to deal with that by referring to clause a which provides for an offence of failing to give the notice required under regulations within the time specified <e> <s> the words in subsection a <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot do better than refer to the definition which states <e>", "<cs> my lords the secretary of state has a responsibility to keep under review the adequacy of the provision of child care training <e> <s> that continuing responsibility is put on him <e> <s> i do not think <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord henderson of brompton introduced the amendment <e> <s> he suggested with the courtesy that one would expect that i got it wrong on the last occasion in the sense that i said what the present law is <e> <s> he referred to an opinion of an eminent senior counsel and i of course have had the advantage of reading that opinion <e> <s> the question is is the amendment intended to remove the right of parents to administer punishment <e>", "<cs> my lords that is if i may say so a very good answer <e> <s> the proviso that is being repealed if the amendment is carried is designed in pursuance of that right <e> <s> the reason why it is there is because there existed and still exists such a right <e> <s> i put the question in that way at the beginning because the noble baroness lady david as she warmed to the subject particularly towards the end was looking on this as a move towards the taking away altogether of that right <e> <s> i shall not express a government view <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that in certain parts of her speech the noble baroness said that <e> <s> however i also think that on looking at the matter as a whole she was warming to the view that it should no longer be required exhorting all of us to take that point of view <e> <s> i shall not <e>", "<cs> my lords of course there is always a possibility in debates like this that the amendment proposed and what is said in support of it do not entirely match one another <e> <s> as regards this debate i can well see the point of view that the noble baroness and others were advocating <e> <s> at one stage the noble lord lord henderson of brompton was fairly close to suggesting it <e>", "<cs> my lords when clause was debated i undertook to delete the word repeal and i stand by that undertaking <e> <s> on that occasion i made remarks which encouraged the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale to believe that i would accept the principle of these amendments <e> <s> i do so i am prepared to accept the principle of the amendments <e> <s> the draftsmen wish to have the opportunity of casting them in words which accord with the general style of the bill but i am certainly prepared to accept the amendments in principle <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the amendment tabled by the noble lady lady saltoun in committee i said that the definition of relative which we use in the bill is that which has persisted in child care law for years or more <e> <s> i do not mean to say that that alone is a reason to maintain the definition not at al but merely that apparently there has not been a convincing reason in all that time to change it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am content to consider this matter carefully <e> <s> it will be the secretary of state who will be responsible for giving guidance <e> <s> i am sure that he will consider carefully how the guidance should be expressed <e> <s> as my noble friend lord mottistone said it may be that there are very valuable contacts with first cousins or remoter relatives <e> <s> i believe that it would be perfectly reasonable for the guidance to draw attention to that possibility so that it would not go by oversight or default <e> <s> that may well meet the concern of the noble lady <e> <s> i am very happy to undertake further consideration along those lines <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may take the amendments in order although they do in a sense deal very much with the same problem <e> <s> i shall <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i shall leave what i have to say until we come to the amendment <e> <s> i hope that noble lords proposing amendments nos <e> <s> and a as well as those who spoke to them will feel that they should not be pressed <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it this provision is in line with current home office policy <e> <s> that is my understanding of the matter but i am of course willing to be corrected <e> <s> i understand that the real thrust of the provision which the amendment seeks to address is the persistence of the offending and the connection with the home circumstances <e> <s> the real focus is that the court comes to the conclusion in the light of all the information given to it that it is the home circumstances that are giving rise to the offending <e> <s> it is true that some of the offences which are imprisonable may be regarded as not being all that serious <e> <s> on the other hand if imprisonment is thought by parliament to be an appropriate punishment it gives some indication that the offence is serious <e> <s> of course imprisonable offences trigger off a number of other consequences <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure exactly what position we are at <e> <s> if we are making a kind of supplementary to the withdrawal of amendment no <e> <s> i am content to consider it but the fact is that if parliament thinks the offence is one for which imprisonment is possible parliament must regard it as sufficiently serious for that to happen if that is not an argument in a circle <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand this amendment its effect is to remove the power of the crown court in certain circumstances to make a supervision order with conditions including the new removal from home requirement under section of the act as opposed to conditions under section a which latter provisions relate to specified activities <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am right in saying that all noble lords who have spoken in this debate took the view that the government are right to put the security service on a statutory basis and that this bill represents a step forward because it does just that <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord annan said in another context the matter may well be one of degree <e> <s> it depends what is in question <e> <s> i do not believe that one can answer a hypothetical situation of that kind without knowing the full circumstances <e> <s> what is required is that the function of the service is to safeguard the economic well-being of the united kingdom that is to say the entity as a whole <e> <s> i believe that what is referred to in this provision when one looks at it in the context is some form of threat <e> <s> there has to be a threat posed by the actions or the intentions of persons outside the british isles that have the purpose of subverting the economic well-being of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt whether there is any question of stupidity involved <e> <s> i believe that what may be involved is the difficulty of applying a concept that we perfectly recognise the economic well-being of the united kingdom to particular <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord knows at least as well as i do if not better what are the proper factors to be taken into account on an application to the court for judicial review <e> <s> he will know that it goes beyond a mere matter of procedure <e> <s> for example the court would certainly entertain the question whether the warrant was within the powers granted to the secretary of state <e> <s> it cannot be better put than by saying that the correct approach is the one the court uses to supervise administrative action applying the principles applied by a court on an application for judicial review <e> <s> the court is concerned not merely with the procedural aspects but also with the other matters at which on an application for judicial review it may look <e>", "<cs> my lords my answers to the noble lord lord hutchinson related to the powers of the commissioner <e> <s> i was reading from paragraph of schedule <e> <s> i used precisely the words which are there used <e> <s> the noble lord asked me how the commissioner would deal with that matter <e> <s> that is what i was dealing with <e>", "<cs> my lords i was asked about the grounds on which the commissioner could interfere and whether it would be only a matter of procedure <e> <s> my point is different from the one the noble lord now mentions <e> <s> the grounds on which the commissioner could do so are the grounds that would apply if he were applying the principles applied by a court on an application for judicial review <e> <s> that is what the bill says and that is what i understand to be the position <e> <s> i believe that it was a proper answer to the question i was asked <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to both my noble friend and to the noble lord lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord kilbracken for tabling amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> when he moves it i propose to accept it <e> <s> i agree that it is also an improvement on what we had before <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had help from the noble lord regarding earlier amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has already explained the background to and the bearing of the interpretation act on this point <e> <s> clause makes it abundantly plain that a residence order can be made in favour of more than one person <e> <s> it expressly makes that provision <e> <s> the draftsman feels that the correct way to deal with the matter is consistently through the bill as a whole and he has relied on the interpretation act <e> <s> it would be out of keeping with the general method by which the bill has been constructed unnecessarily to put in these words and it might well lead to speculation as to why it has been done in this case <e> <s> it is plain <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the degree of welcome that the amendment has received <e> <s> i should like to say two things <e> <s> first part i of schedule is given effect by clause <e> <s> there is an overriding provision which has the effect of setting out the scope of part i of schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords i sought to try to do that when i was seeking to justify the clause before <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that i would let first parliamentary counsel know what had occurred <e> <s> my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale has discussed this matter in more detail than i have <e> <s> i do not think it is right in this situation to make it an absolute rule <e> <s> it is a question of circumstances <e> <s> however it would be fair for me to say that i could say to first parliamentary counsel and to all the others who would be involved that if such a clause is put in it is highly likely that a fairly particular justification of it will be required <e> <s> i shall be able to vouch that from my own experience with more detail if necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords let me first of all say that the governments general position on this matter is quite plain <e> <s> we fully endorse the spirit of this amendment and the other amendments related to it which the noble lord lord henderson of brompton will move later on <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i had in mind that that would be an important aspect of guidance <e> <s> i had not directed my attention to who might issue it but it may well form part of the guidance which the secretary of state would issue in respect of the bill once it is enacted <e> <s> no doubt the precise form could be discussed with the commission as a useful precursor to the issue of the guidance <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to what has been said today and what was said in relation to earlier amendments to like effect <e> <s> i understand the concerns of parents with disabilities and of the groups representing them that local authorities may look upon their disability as a reason to intervene <e> <s> it is natural that people should seek reassurance when they have such fears concerning their rights to care for their own children <e> <s> that assurance can be given unequivocally <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness tells the house how she intends to deal with this amendment i should like in view of her question to me to add that we can certainly undertake that the guidance would be issued after consulting the associations that represent the disabled <e> <s> that would be normal practice in the consultation that precedes the issue of guidance <e>", "<cs> my lords some concern has been expressed both about the form of this definition and perhaps more importantly in relation to its substance <e> <s> i think that there is quite a lot to be considered in relation to this <e> <s> if the noble lord will allow me i should like to consider this amendment because we are certainly considering recasting the definition of a disabled child in the light of various discussions that have been going on <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly we could take the amendment by itself but i think it is not worth while when we have to consider the substance of the whole provision <e> <s> as the noble lord knows full well the later amendments go to the substance of the provision and the way the whole thing should be done <e> <s> there may be consequences from an amendment like this to other parts of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the question is that amendment no <e> <s> be agreed to <e> <s> as many as are of that opinion will say content <e>", "<cs> no my lords not at all <e> <s> that is a misunderstanding <e> <s> perhaps i had better just start again <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have indicated this has already been discussed as the noble lady said and i then indicated certain difficulties <e> <s> the definition has a statutory history <e> <s> any change will require careful consideration <e> <s> i undertake that the matter will be considered as the bill goes through another place <e>", "<cs> my lords the draftsman will have this point put to him along with the other matters raised in the consideration to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords we are proposing to introduce provisions dealing with the child-minder statute <e> <s> perhaps the noble lady will be good enough to await the proposal <e>", "<cs> the latter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should make clear that my comment about sympathetic consideration referred to an amendment on the lines of amendment no <e> <s> and the amendment moved earlier by the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> as to the child-minder legislation i said that we must wait to see what is proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords we have already debated this matter to some extent <e> <s> the amendments particularly no <e> <s> take account of some of the issues that i raised in respect of earlier amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in relation to the earlier amendment the matters that are dealt with in these amendments will certainly be the subject of guidance <e> <s> it is right to repeat that we also undertake to consult the commission for racial equality <e> <s> however in view of the particular emphasis placed on language by the noble lords lord henderson of brompton lord pitt and lord prys-davies i should like to say that my understanding is that language is part of the cultural background <e> <s> that is our understanding of the way in which the words have been used <e> <s> it is not of course the whole of it but an important part <e> <s> therefore since there is a duty to give due consideration to the childs cultural background there is already in the legislation a duty to have due regard to the childs language as part of that <e> <s> the guidance will certainly make clear that language is an important part of cultural background <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that what the noble and learned lord learnt at four would <e>", "<cs> my lords having regard to the authority of the noble lord in this area i certainly undertake to consider the matter further <e> <s> of course it will now be for another place to deal with the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord withdraws his amendment i should perhaps turn the nod into something for the record <e> <s> i undertook to the noble lord lord pitt of <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it is fair to say that there is some subtle significance in the drafting <e> <s> the point is that the general duty to provide suitable accommodation for the child is in clause already <e> <s> in a sense we are unable to add to that <e> <s> for every child disabled or otherwise the obligation is to provide suitable accommodation <e> <s> but it is particularly desired to highlight a special aspect of it here <e> <s> i can assure your lordships that this has not been arrived at without a certain amount of consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady faithfull has asked us to take account of the statement made in another place by my honourable friend mr scott <e> <s> this requires consideration of the different aspects of the matter <e> <s> under the social security system a persons circumstances are to be taken into account <e> <s> the statement referred to is a provision of the social security system and has a special bearing on those who are estranged from their parents and who live in accommodation other than their own homes with consequent increases in expense <e> <s> in those circumstances the social security system has a responsibility for them <e> <s> this has been acknowledged in that provision <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment sets out in some detail certain arrangements that local authorities should make when establishing representation procedures by adding to subsection a list of further provisions <e> <s> they are details of the kind which one would expect to see in regulations <e> <s> clause has been included for that purpose <e> <s> however certain aspects were considered to be of sufficient importance to be provided for in clause that is that an independent person should be involved in the procedure that is one of the fundamental points and that local authorities should give publicity to the procedure <e> <s> it is usual for other more minor provisions to appear in the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have understood my noble and learned friend rightly he thought that the amendment that i proposed should refer to subsections and <e> <s> however the regulations are referred to in subsection <e> <s> it may be that i have not completely understood what he has said <e> <s> perhaps he will allow me to read this <e> <s> if there is a matter which appears to require further consideration i shall ensure that such consideration is given <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of my noble friend lord renton i believe i am right in saying that the secretary of states power to authorise is a power which is exercised at present <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend has said we have discussed the matter but i am sorry to say that i do not think that i can take it very much further <e>", "<cs> my lords the short answer is that we are still considering the matter <e> <s> i regret that i am not in a position to give a final answer <e> <s> sympathetic consideration continues <e>", "<cs> my lords clause provides that <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that the current arrangements although fairly recently set up give rise to concerns particularly about conflicts of interest <e> <s> we have accepted that these concerns have some validity and as i explained on previous occasions we are taking steps to address the problem <e> <s> we are suggesting something very like the proposal of my noble friend <e> <s> we seek to give the secretary of state the power to group local authorities together in order that there may be available within a group people who are independent of the specific authority in question and with a structure that enables a person to manage the group effectively <e> <s> that is building on the present arrangements but it does so in a way that does not rule out further development for example on the lines of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it best simply to say that i have been considering the matter further since the last time and that the problems are certainly quite difficult <e> <s> i would not wish to move from the significant harm as the level of injury to the child justifying emergency intervention by the state <e> <s> we discussed this point fairly fully before <e> <s> the source of the clause was the advice in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand well the interest that the noble lord lord mottistone and the noble lady lady kinloss take in these matters <e> <s> there is no doubt that the proper way forward is by co-operation <e> <s> the difficulty is in making provision for a disputes machinery where the dispute is between the society and the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has mentioned an amendment similar to this was discussed in committee <e> <s> i said that we were considering the matter <e> <s> there are difficulties <e> <s> we are in the area of a balance between central government and local government and the question discussed earlier today <e> <s> i regret that we have not completed our discussion of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords at report stage in response to amendments proposed by my noble friends lady faithfull and lord campbell of alloway and supported by others of your lordships i moved an amendment which required the secretary of state to keep under review the adequacy of the provision of child care training and to receive and consider information from or representations made by the central council for education and training <e>", "<cs> my lords the present situation is that the common law recognises that a parent or someone with lawful control or charge of a child has a right to administer reasonable chastisement to that child <e> <s> it is to put this beyond doubt that this is so that section is there <e> <s> section of the children and young persons act is there to put beyond doubt that section is qualified by the common law <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no statement to make apart from stating the existing law <e> <s> i have no proposals to put forward on behalf of the government for any change in the law <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to the observations of my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale on these various matters <e> <s> the arrangement as i understand it which presently prevails is that the minister in the department responsible for the bill is also responsible for ensuring that the bill is according to his wishes before it is introduced to parliament <e> <s> of course the drafting of the bill is the responsibility of parliamentary counsel <e> <s> that is the present system and it has been so for some time <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> i received the letter with particular pleasure <e> <s> i am glad that he feels that this is a good way to go about the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the provisions in part ix of the bill could not work without the notification procedure being provided for in regulations <e> <s> notification is currently dealt with in primary legislation in the foster children act <e> <s> however we believe that it is right to use the more flexible vehicle of regulations to achieve more detailed and flexible provisions than exist at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lady faithfull has already pointed out amendment no <e> <s> is the same as one we discussed on report <e> <s> its effect is to add a further qualification to the circumstances in which the new removal from home requirement may be added to a supervision order made in criminal proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords and to the noble lady lady saltoun for bringing to our attention the need to have particular regard to the closer relatives who sometimes are apt to be overlooked in these provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i have it in command from her majesty the queen and his royal highness the prince of wales to acquaint the house that they having been informed of the purport of the road traffic driver licensing and information systems bill have consented to place their prerogatives and interests so far as they are affected by the bill at the disposal of parliament for the purposes of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords that is my intention <e> <s> there are three motions standing in my name on the order paper and with the permission of the house i shall deal with them together but put them separately <e> <s> the draft regulations for which i am seeking approval today are part of a package designed to implement the legal aid act from st april <e> <s> they relate to the scope of legal aid and advice and assistance and to functions to be given to the legal aid board areas over which your lordships expressed concern during the passage of the legal aid bill <e> <s> noble lords may be aware of further sets of regulations relating to legal aid which do not require affirmative resolutions but which have been laid before the house <e> <s> together all these regulations will within the framework of the new act form the basis of the operation of legal aid for the coming years <e> <s> subject to a few specific exceptions for the most part they recreate the existing arrangements <e> <s> however we have also taken the opportunity to carry out a measure of consolidation and revision and to give effect to some of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the response of the house to the regulations and to the order and for the helpful comment on definition <e> <s> perhaps i may take that last point first <e> <s> as the house will know i came to these matters with a general statement that legal aid was not to be available under the green form scheme for conveyancing and wills <e> <s> as a result of the consultation i have endeavoured to focus on those categories which appeared to me to be the most deserving for exclusion from that exclusion <e> <s> it is necessary to define these categories to some extent <e> <s> the green form scheme is fairly simple <e> <s> it is true that the list of permanent illnesses would be worth referring to in difficult cases but generally speaking it is a matter for solicitors to decide in the light of the circumstances <e> <s> i do not think many people would have difficulty in deciding whether an illness would properly come under that category <e> <s> the application of a certain amount of <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that i thought that the solicitor could readily advise <e> <s> the idea is that the applicant should certify whether or not he is suffering from a permanent serious illness <e> <s> where there is certification of that kind it is not likely that there would be much controversy <e> <s> in a simple scheme of this kind that seems reasonable <e> <s> it is a deserving category and i would rather include it than leave it out <e> <s> moreover i do not anticipate any difficulty in the matter <e> <s> we are merely asking the client to name the doctor just in case there should be any need to check up on the application <e> <s> but apart from that i should have thought that this is a simple matter and one which should therefore be allowed to stand <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the third motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> it is important to remind ourselves of the wording of clause <e>", "<cs> i believe that it is fair to say that the noble lord lord harris of greenwich was referring to subversive activities in the definition that he gave <e> <s> that is one branch of the type of activity which threatens the safety or well-being of the state <e> <s> i take the view that the phrase protection of national security covers that point <e> <s> in the way that the subsection is constructed the latter parts are particularisations of the protection of national security and of course help to explain it <e>", "<cs> first i am not in favour of removing the words or undermine i am in favour of keeping them <e> <s> secondly i think the words are capable of being understood and applied by ordinary people <e> <s> the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead supplemented my understanding of the words or undermine by reference to the dictionary <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran will if necessary have access to the same dictionary <e> <s> acts of parliament must proceed by using ordinary words undermine is an ordinary word <e> <s> i believe it would not be for clarity to seek to explain it further <e> <s> indeed the attempt at further clarification might just undermine the clarity which exists <e>", "<cs> that may depend upon ones point of view <e> <s> i know some who regard removing the house of lords as an improvement of parliamentary democracy but that is not a view which i share and nor perhaps does the noble lord <e> <s> i firmly believe that this house is an important part of our parliamentary democracy <e>", "<cs> the amendment would move the structure of the bill away from establishing clearly what the security service is required to do and instead replace it by injunctions about what the security service is required not to do <e> <s> i do not believe that that is necessary nor do i think it helpful <e>", "<cs> the noble lords explanation of the manuscript amendment amendment no <e> <s> a coupled with his explanation of amendment no <e> <s> which seeks to leave out paragraph b of clause indicates that there is not a great deal of difference between us in relation to the basic aim <e> <s> but i venture to submit to the committee that the way the government have tackled this is the better way <e>", "<cs> it may be convenient if i remind the committee about the strict limitations of this function as drawn in the bill and also of the important purpose it serves <e> <s> i should make it clear as i sought to do at second reading that it would not be right to speculate on whether an example of a particular transaction or hypothetical set of circumstances would or would not fall within this function <e> <s> it is not sensible to identify or appear to identify those who might or might not be subject to security service activities under this function because of the nature and seriousness of the threat they might pose <e> <s> to put them on notice might be deeply damaging as my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter has said <e>", "<cs> clause states <e>", "<cs> we have had a very full debate on this important amendment <e> <s> i have no doubt that as the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington said it was put forward after the most careful thought <e> <s> therefore we may take this as an example by which to test the principle and to determine whether any such body is possible within the framework of our service <e>", "<cs> that is precisely the point <e> <s> i do not say equally i say share the responsibility <e> <s> that is my point which i believe the noble lord accepts is fairly made <e> <s> there is a degree of sharing but i do not specify the degree <e> <s> that would be the result of a committee effectively exercising to the full its powers under this amendment <e> <s> that is not the way in which we can have a security service protecting the nation under clear authority and control <e> <s> the noble lord lord callaghan said that although there is a wicket keeper there is also a long stop but i do not believe that to have two captains is an effective way to regain the ashes <e>", "<cs> first may i just explain briefly the system for the issue of warrants under clause as provided in the bill <e> <s> we believe that it is safe efficient and fair <e> <s> it operates in this way <e>", "<cs> it may be for the convenience of the committee if i explain the functions of the commissioner as provided in the bill <e> <s> i believe it will be plain from this that this amendment is not necessary in order to permit him fully to discharge those functions <e>", "<cs> in practice with an experienced commissioner the situation envisaged by the noble lord is unlikely to arise because a commissioner in the nature of his remit is looking to ensure that everything is right <e> <s> i have no doubt that the commissioner will ask all the people involved questions of sufficient generality to make sure that he has probed all the surrounding circum <e>", "<cs> the statutory duty upon the commissioner is to make an annual report on the discharge of his functions and the power to report at other times to the prime minister is not tied to the receipt of individual complaints <e> <s> indeed one of the commissioners principal functions set out in clause is to keep the secretary of states warrant powers under review <e> <s> he has the intitiative this refers back to the previous amendment to keep the secretary of states warrant powers under review <e> <s> therefore there is no need for a complaint about a warrant for him to see whether an investigation is justified <e> <s> certainly one sees from the report of the commissioner under the interception of communications act that that is the way such matters are handled <e>", "<cs> there are two aspects <e> <s> first in relation to the commissioners general duty the bill states in clause <e>", "<cs> i do not have the exact question in my mind <e> <s> but i think that the answer is yes he is entitled to look at any aspect of the matter and report upon it <e>", "<cs> the commissioners duty is to keep under review the exercise of the secretary of states warrant power and to deal with complaints so far as they relate to the exercise of the warrant power <e> <s> the commissioner has a duty to make an annual report to the prime minister on the discharge of his functions and may at any time report on any matter relating to that duty <e> <s> if in the couse of his investigations he comes across a matter which relates to the discharge of his function to examine warrants he has the power to report the matter to the prime minister without waiting for the annual report <e> <s> he can do so immediately because he has the power to report at any time <e>", "<cs> it is important to be clear <e> <s> the commissioners responsibility is in relation to the exercise of the warrant power <e> <s> he has not got a roving commission it is the warrant power that he has to deal with <e> <s> if in the exercise of that power and the discharge of these functions he comes across some material that he believes should be reported on he will certainly be entitled to do so <e> <s> i wish to make it clear that it would need to arise out of the discharge of his functions <e> <s> it might well not be something relating immediately to the warrant <e> <s> as my noble friend suggested it may be something that transpired out of the examination <e> <s> it may be related to it but not actually an exercise of the warrant power <e> <s> it would certainly be within the powers given to him under this bill to report that matter to the prime minister <e>", "<cs> the commissioner established under this bill will be a person of standing independence and considerable judgment <e> <s> he will have the right to know all the facts relevant to his functions <e> <s> he is surely best placed to decide on what he should include in his annual report <e> <s> i hope that the committee will therefore agree that these are matters which are best left to i he commissioners judgment <e>", "<cs> i am not able to say precisely what the case is about that <e> <s> the point is that the commissioner is perfectly free to make as elaborate a report as he wishes <e> <s> i am sure that the commissioner appointed under the act would wish to do his job as fully as possible <e> <s> if one looks at the interception of communications act reports numbers of this kind are given <e> <s> it does not seem to have been <e>", "<cs> i shall try to answer the questions raised on the amendment <e> <s> if the noble lord lord hutchinson does not think that i have the answers right he will no doubt give his own in due course <e>", "<cs> the answer to that question is that i do not think members of the special branch would do so deliberately at least not very often <e> <s> a person who feels that he has been wrongly treated by an authority would i suppose be wise to complain to the body which he feels has mistreated him <e> <s> i believe that there would be no possible difficulty about an individual complaining to the police <e> <s> further if he had any suspicion that the security service were involved i do not think he would have any difficulty in complaining to the service <e>", "<cs> it was because i found the question difficult that i did not answer it rather than any unwillingness to do so <e> <s> the point is that the person making the complaint must be complaining about something <e> <s> further the something must be some form of interference with his property <e> <s> it may be that the interference with his property was carried out by a burglar and he may therefore think it wise to complain to the police about it <e> <s> however it may well be that on investigating the matter it turns out that it was not a burglar after all <e> <s> the subject matter of the complaint will determine what the complainant thinks he should do in those circumstances <e> <s> i certainly think that anyone who felt that he was involved in any way with the security service and who wanted to complain would be wise to complain not only to the police who may be involved but also to the security service <e>", "<cs> it may be convenient to say a few words about the role of the service in respect of vetting <e> <s> in doing so i assume that the committee accepts that it is right that the security service should have a clear duty under its statutory functions to help those engaged in matters affecting the security and well-being of the nation to make informed decisions about those who are employed on work where they could present a threat to the nation as a whole <e> <s> however as the committee no doubt understands the security service does not itself make the decision about the persons employment <e> <s> any report that it makes will be one factor but it is not the final word <e> <s> in some cases it may not know <e> <s> it may not necessarily be informed or need to know the final decision <e>", "<cs> i have a little difficulty with this amendment in regard to the position at which it arises <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord moved it from its first position on the marshalled list <e> <s> i am not absolutely clear about its position now <e> <s> however it may help if i try to describe the situation <e> <s> it might be helpful if i said that the tribunal would exercise its functions in response to a complaint in this way <e>", "<cs> the paragraph which the noble and learned lord seeks to leave out is in these terms <e>", "<cs> the tribunal in this situation is a tribunal that will have an important adjudicatory role with finality and the government felt that the right people to compose this tribunal would be people who generally were equipped by professional qualification to adjudicate <e> <s> it is for that reason that we took the view that the tribunal should consist of members of the legal profession with long experience <e> <s> the tribunal is concerned with administering justice to individuals and it must be known to be equipped to deal scrupulously fairly and with legal expertise with matters which may be highly complex <e>", "<cs> under paragraph of schedule the service is under a duty to provide all the information and documentation required by the tribunal to enable it to perform its functions <e> <s> there is no suggestion that that requirement is confined in any way and in particular no suggestion that the requirement in respect of information is restricted to information in writing <e> <s> if therefore in a particular case the tribunal required that information to be given by a member of the service attending on the tribunal assuming such a request was for the purpose of discharging the tribunals functions as obviously it would be in the scope of the amendment then it <e>", "<cs> the important matter in considering this amendment is to consider the nature of a tribunal and its functions <e> <s> i hope to persuade the committee that the bill makes proper and adequate provisions for the tribunal in its handling of complaints while avoiding the exploitation of its procedures by those who seek to threaten the security and well-being of the country <e>", "<cs> i believe it is important to notice that the person in question is a complainant <e> <s> it is not a question of someone defending himself as i believe the noble and learned lord said and also the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington <e> <s> it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to every one of your lordships who has contributed to this debate <e> <s> i say that with the deepest sincerity after a long debate <e> <s> so far as i am aware i have not criticised the bar or anyone else in respect of their responses to the green papers <e> <s> in particular i do not think that i personally have ever described the bars reaction as partaking of hysteria so far as i know <e> <s> some comment has been made about that i do not wish to say anything except in relation to what the noble viscount lord bledisloe said <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord rees-mogg and my noble friend lady oppenheim-barnes on their very distinguished maiden speeches <e> <s> it is quite impossible for me to refer to everyone who has spoken <e> <s> i could do so if that were thought desirable but perhaps all noble lords who have contributed will take it that i refer to them when i thank them for what they said <e> <s> the practical effect is that i shall take very careful in note further consideration of all that has been said <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had dealt with that but let me do it now if i have not done so sufficiently <e> <s> i said that we have allowed to nd may for responses to be received <e> <s> in my view there is a necessity also to implement the undertaking that we gave at the beginning of this process to make a statement as regards these matters to the house before the summer recess <e> <s> as i have said already i believe that it is very important that students and others should not be kept waiting unnecessarily <e> <s> i also said and i repeat it that the representations that are received by nd may may well contain suggestions for further work or something that requires to be done <e> <s> in considering the statement that the government would make before the summer recess that aspect of any such representation would be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i should have made that plainer <e> <s> so far as i am concerned my door is open to the judiciary and to both branches of the profession at all times <e> <s> therefore that situation arises now <e> <s> i would certainly hope to have full meetings with those concerned by the time the government statement before the summer recess is made <e> <s> i am not suggesting that there will be any change as regards openness to receive representations and people coming to see me just because nd may has arrived <e> <s> i am open now to hear what anyone has to say <e> <s> i hope that i have already expressed my appreciation of what has been said today <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a technical question <e> <s> i do not know whether the answer i gave yesterday would be regarded as sufficiently white for this purpose <e> <s> a good deal depends on what one has to say <e> <s> i do not think i should pre-empt the form of the statement at this stage <e> <s> i promise that all being well the government will make a statement before the summer recess <e> <s> the form of the statement will no doubt be dictated at least to some extent by the nature of its content <e>", "<cs> i can think of some excellent companions my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i now call amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the reason i do so is because amendment no <e> <s> has been marshalled in the wrong place <e> <s> in the proper order it comes before amendments nos <e> <s> to because amendments to leave out a clause come after amendments to a clause <e>", "<cs> my lords the remedy of judicial review developed by the judges is in my view an extremely effective remedy for the general problem of the misuse of executive power <e> <s> the question of the incorporation of the convention on human rights is a different matter <e> <s> i do not believe that we should presently contemplate it as a part of the administrative machinery <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that there may be a practical and appropriate limit to the number of proposals that one should consider at one time <e> <s> as regards this matter the system of judicial review has been very much developed by the judges <e> <s> i believe it is a field in which judicial creativity as <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends question illustrates the difficulty of securing unanimity of opinion in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said a little while ago i believe that our judges have developed administrative law with great success over the past or years <e> <s> i believe it is an area in which the judicial power has proved very effective <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble and learned lord knows the scope for examination of executive decisions has been greatly widened over the years <e> <s> it is appropriate to keep a distinction between the power of the courts to review in this way administrative acts and the responsibility for actually taking administrative decisions <e> <s> it may not be wise to confuse those <e> <s> the judges have developed their methods in a remarkable way while still preserving that distinction <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made it repeatedly clear and i have no problem in saying so again that i regard the independence of the judiciary as of fundamental importance <e> <s> i will certainly not be party to any proposals that would in any way impair the independence of the judiciary <e> <s> it does not of course follow that the independence of the judiciary necessarily means complete independence <e>", "<cs> my lords having regard to developments over the years i think it would be unwise to say that the judges could not develop judicial review any further <e>", "<cs> my lords that is also my sentiment <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt whether a particularly attractive feature of an amendment is that it should be designed to ensure that the public are given the very minimum of information about the matter upon which the commissioner can report <e> <s> the commissioner has the duty to report surely in what he considers would be an appropriate way <e> <s> the commissioner is to be a person of considerable stature <e> <s> i think one can see how this might develop by looking at the report by the commissioner under the interception act <e> <s> i do not know whether or not the noble lords assessment of that would be in accordance with what he predicts in respect of this particular report <e>", "<cs> my lords i should perhaps say that i was simply taking up the concluding <e>", "<cs> my lords at page line at end insert the words as printed on the marshalled list with a bracket inserted after the word doing <e>", "<cs> my lords at committee stage i explained fully the role of the service in respect of vetting <e> <s> i shall not go back over old ground <e> <s> i am not in a position to say anything about the numbers that the noble lord mentioned in moving this amendment <e> <s> they do not make any difference in relation to the principle of the matter <e> <s> there is also a passage in this amendment with which i have slight difficulty <e> <s> there is reference to specified by an individual <e> <s> i am not quite clear how that is supposed to work <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships know anyone may complain to the tribunal if he is aggrieved about anything which he believes the service to have done in relation to him <e> <s> this may of course include a complaint about the role of the security service in relation to some employment matter <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be allowed to leave the last point for another occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but the noble lord is not correct <e> <s> the word investigate first occurs in the passage which i read out in paragraph where it refers to shall investigate <e> <s> there is a duty to investigate the complaint in accordance with the schedule <e> <s> there is no proposal to do anything other than investigate the complaint <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry but for once i do not understand the point made by the noble lord <e> <s> the obligation on the tribunal is to investigate the complaint in accordance with the schedule and there are subject matters for the investigation not only in paragraph but also in later paragraphs of the schedule for example in paragraph which states <e>", "<cs> my lords the distinction is between a tribunal that has the duty to investigate and a tribunal that has the duty only to adjudicate between cases presented to it <e> <s> consequences flow from that distinction <e> <s> it is on these consequences that i have sought to rely <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank those of your lordships who have spoken for your kind remarks about the matters on which we have been able to agree <e> <s> i reckon it as a particular achievement that the noble lord lord jenkins of putney sees in this bill a real reform <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is true to say that the motion moved was that the bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords the question is that the house do now adjourn during pleasure for five minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to notify the house in accordance with the royal assent act that the queen has signified her royal assent to the following acts <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble and learned lord has said this provision deals with the determination in relation to legal aid costs of the juvenile court and the crown court <e> <s> with regard to what the noble and learned lord referred to as a family court he knows probably better than i that what is covered by that phrase depends a great deal upon who is using it <e> <s> different people have different ideas about it <e> <s> however in the children bill we have taken a very significant step in improving the arrangements for dealing with childrens cases <e> <s> the bill contains provisions under which applications for care orders can be taken at the magistrates court level the county court level or the high court level <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly bear that suggestion in mind <e> <s> i note that the royal commission over which the noble lord presided followed that course but after seeking permission from the various people who had responded to its request for information and restricting the responses which were open for inspection to those not of a personal kind but of a general organisational kind suggesting various changes <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read a good number but i have not read all of them yet <e> <s> however i certainly intend to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether i am aware of that but certainly the position is that i have already studied a good number of the responses which contain various suggestions to which i shall be giving very careful attention <e>", "<cs> my lords the green papers set out proposals for the elimination of rules in the legal profession which are not necessary in order to ensure standards of competence and conduct <e> <s> the question therefore in relation to any particular rule is whether it is necessary for this purpose <e> <s> if a rule is not necessary for this purpose its elimination is not likely to increase cost <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble friend i have attended a great number of inquiries of one kind or another <e> <s> i do not think that i have ever attended one in which there has not been a suggestion of some further study that should be undertaken before a decision is reached <e> <s> i acknowledge most heartily the importance of these proposals <e> <s> i regard them as extremely important and i think i can assure my noble friend that decisions about what we should recommend arising from the consultation will be taken only after very careful consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said the primary aim of the green paper proposals is to consider whether there are any unnecessary rules in the profession <e> <s> if on examination a rule turns out to be unnecessary its elimination is not likely to increase costs <e> <s> we have made a number of proposals for seeking to reduce costs <e> <s> these have arisen primarily from the civil justice review which my noble and learned friend lord hailsham initiated some time ago <e> <s> i was glad to be able to announce some little time ago that we were hoping to implement the main thrust of that reviews proposals <e> <s> the object of the three green papers is not primarily to reduce costs <e> <s> if as a result of the elimination of unnecessary rules costs are reduced that will be welcome to all those who are clients of the legal profession <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i have in fact studied that paper with some care <e> <s> if i have understood it properly i think it may proceed on assumptions about the green paper proposals which are not fully justified by a close study of the green papers themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i have always regarded it as a wise precaution in advocacy not to overstate ones case <e> <s> therefore at the moment i am simply claiming that these proposals if implemented would not increase costs <e> <s> as i said i believe that they may reduce costs but i am not actually making that claim at present <e>", "<cs> my lords the green papers contain proposals which are the provisional views of the government on many matters <e> <s> they are however provisional views and therefore may not ultimately be the governments views after there has been consideration of the consultations <e> <s> as a means of provoking lively and informed discussion i think that the green papers have been quite successful <e>", "<cs> my lords important as the civil justice review proposals are i doubt very much whether her majestys government would propose that they and only they be enacted in the next session <e> <s> the number of clauses required for that purpose has not yet been determined <e>", "<cs> my lords these are papers for consultation and i have promised i hope that your lordships will believe that i should like to fulfil that promise to consider representations about them from whatever quarter they may arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not really able to say a great deal about the matter <e> <s> i have read reports in newspapers which indicate that a fairly substantial sum was aimed at by the bar <e> <s> i think that that amount has been collected <e> <s> however whether it has all been spent i cannot tell <e> <s> so far as concerns the law society i have no information in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i have addressed that question <e> <s> i have already said that the nature of the proposals are such that they should lead to the elimination of unnecessary costs and unnecessary rules <e> <s> i do not believe that that will increase the cost of litigation <e>", "<cs> my lords the aim of the green papers as well as the aim of the civil justice review and every other initiative that i and my noble and learned friends who have preceded me in this office have taken in recent years has been to try to improve the service to the people whom the noble lord referred to as ordinary folk <e> <s> indeed i made that fact clear in the green papers <e> <s> we tried to write the papers in such a way that ordinary people without any particular legal training or experience could understand them <e>", "<cs> my lords i answered the noble lord in the way that i did so as not to make any comment that could be construed as in any way adverse to the honour and public spiritedness of the two branches of the legal profession in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord considers that the standard of the debate was high <e> <s> i personally found it extremely useful <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that my noble friend quotes exactly what i said <e> <s> i do not believe that i made any reference to trade unions in my response <e> <s> however i accept that the rest of what he said is the substance of my remarks and that the responses are extremely full and constructive <e> <s> naturally they are not all in the same direction <e> <s> the question now is in the light of the responses what is the correct direction in which to move <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of my noble and learned friends were present on th april and contributed to the debate <e> <s> i myself was here at the start of the debate on the report on the parole system which was initiated by the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale <e> <s> i certainly do not recollect noticing that any of my noble and learned friends managed to be present on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to paraphrase exactly what i said two days ago <e> <s> i said that my aim in the green papers was to propose the removal of unnecessary restrictions <e> <s> the removal of unnecessary restrictions would not increase costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with that <e> <s> it is one reason why the speculative action on the scottish model is perhaps better than the contingency fee arrangement in america because it is available to potential defenders as well as to potential pursuers in that country <e>", "<cs> my lords the overall objective of all the proposals which i have sought to make deals with costs and accessibility <e> <s> i aim to avoid unnecessary costs <e> <s> sometimes there are of course great difficulties in family litigation <e> <s> among the actions that were initiated by my noble and learned friend lord hailsham was a study of the conciliation service <e> <s> that study has recently reported and a good deal of discussion is taking place on the report <e> <s> as often happens on these occasions the views on the conclusions of the report are not unanimous <e> <s> however that is an important development which i hope we shall be able to take forward <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i am aware of the general effect on costs of the producers of goods having to bear the costs of litigation <e> <s> i have that in mind <e> <s> one also has to bear in mind the rights of those who may be injured as a result of products <e> <s> as usual it is a question of balancing the various interests <e> <s> i am sure that the contribution of lloyds of london to the responses as well as the other contributions we have received will help us to reach a just balance in the result <e>", "<cs> my lords the evidence given by the chief justice to the royal commission on legal services will be placed in the library today <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall most certainly consider that <e> <s> i noted in the debate that took place on the consultation paper concerning the scottish legal profession that someone quoted my noble and learned friend lord hailsham of saint marylebone who was of course quoting another <e> <s> my noble and learned friend lord hailsham of saint marylebone had said reform <e> <s> reform <e> <s> are things not bad enough already <e> <s> i am certainly not seeking to promote reforms which will make matters worse in this country <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i am aware of that <e> <s> however i think the quotation was attributed to my noble and learned friend in the report of the debate on the scottish paper <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly the retired chief justice of the united states was very familiar with the system here and that on the other side of the atlantic <e> <s> however i am not absolutely certain whether he was uniquely familiar with it <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in answer to the noble and learned lord at the conclusion of the debate to which some reference has already been made the precise form of our announcement will depend upon the content of it <e>", "<cs> my lords as i again intimated on that occasion it is my hope that we shall be able to make a statement before the house rises for the summer recess which i hope will not be unduly delayed <e>", "<cs> the congregation will take place on thursday th june <e> <s> accordingly i trust that the house will agree to grant me leave of absence for thursday th june <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord for his remarks <e> <s> i am sure that the law commission will also appreciate his thanks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am particularly heartened that my reply might give some encouragement to solicitors and barristers <e> <s> certainly the matters to which the noble lord has referred are of great importance and i have no doubt that they will figure in the law commissions report <e>", "<cs> my lords of course there are many consequences of divorce <e> <s> however the question concerns primarily the law relating to divorce <e> <s> perhaps the latter part of the noble lords supplementary question is wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> the rate of divorce in this country is a cause of great concern <e> <s> i have no doubt that that aspect of the matter will be taken into account in the law commissions report <e> <s> it is one thing to notice a serious matter of that kind it is rather more difficult to prescribe an effective cure for it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very difficult question <e> <s> once a married couple have decided to part it is difficult to know what place there is for the tremendously complicated and lengthy procedures which follow <e> <s> whether tightening up the law would reduce the divorce rate is open to question <e> <s> i very much believe that good divorce law should reinforce the institution of marriage rather than tend to destroy it <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware the law commission canvassed among other things a proposal that all the ancillary matters arising out of a divorce should be decided upon and settled before the divorce was granted <e> <s> in a sense that is the type of tightening up which the noble lord the leader of the opposition has in mind <e> <s> it is certainly a proposal for further consideration <e> <s> i shall be most interested to see what the law commission ultimately decides when it submits its report in the light of the full consultation which it has had <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord and i too should like to join with him in thanking members of the joint committee on consolidation bills for the work which they carry out <e> <s> it is not the most exciting work that ever occupies parliamentarians but it is extremely important and we are most grateful to them for the care which they take in so doing <e>", "<cs> my lords the capital court building programme currently contains nearly schemes for the crown court either in construction or yet to reach that stage involving both adaptations and new buildings <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the view that crown court buildings are extremely important public buildings and that an appropriate standard of design must be attained <e> <s> that standard must enable the building to blend with its environment create a civic presence reflecting the dignity of justice command respect for the legal process and mark the place of the law at the focal point of a community <e> <s> on the other hand it is also wise to develop general criteria for the requirements of court buildings <e>", "<cs> my lords the arrangements attempt to secure good design consistent with creating buildings within a reasonable economic cost <e> <s> as concerns telford the point which the noble lord raises is obviously a matter of judgment <e> <s> a nostalgic building may have great attractions for some of us <e>", "<cs> my lords all these circumstances certainly have to be taken into account <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend appreciates that local circumstances sometimes make it impossible to continue with the old building <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously one of the aims of the programme which i described in my original answer is to attempt to cope with this problem <e> <s> over the last five years several major schemes have been completed providing nearly additional crown court rooms almost half in london and the south east <e> <s> despite a huge increase in the workload this has helped over the period to keep average waiting times more or less as they were <e> <s> our aim is to reduce these times because i entirely accept the principle underlying the noble and learned lords point <e>", "<cs> my lords there are difficult questions of priorities to be decided in relation to any expense <e> <s> however within the limits of trying to be as economical as possible we attempt to get the best design we can <e> <s> it is important that the design should take account of the locality <e> <s> that does not necessarily involve additional expense but it is an important consideration <e> <s> it must be taken into account along with all the other considerations that go into the production of a good crown court building <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that the noble lord will be aware that these are not matters on which universal agreement is easily reached <e> <s> before any decision is taken to abolish the dock a number of interests would require to be consulted <e> <s> i have no doubt that the noble lord is promoting his point of view actively in those quarters <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an aspect of court design which we are taking into account <e> <s> the precise requirements are not always easy to estimate but in the design of the buildings the development of a technological requirement is kept in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for joining me in that respect <e> <s> as regards the names of various bodies i assume that the bill has consolidated the existing law <e> <s> however i am happy to have the matters referred to by my noble friend looked into as the bill goes to the consolidation committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> as regards the serious matter of the offence of impersonating a barrister we are very open to suggestions as to what maximum penalty might be appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords that is obviously a suggestion for consideration <e> <s> the responses to the consultation papers have been extremely valuable interesting and varied <e> <s> i am sure that in the vast majority of cases the interest that the respondents have sought to serve is the interest of justice generally <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the noble lords first point i am in the habit of paying attention to the views not only of the faculty of advocates but also of the bar of england and wales <e> <s> i have seen the views of the faculty of advocates on these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the judges are entirely entitled to disagree with the lord chancellor <e> <s> if it is this lord chancellor in question it is probably this lord chancellor who would be wrong <e> <s> on the other hand the structure which we have proposed will minimise the risk of that and enable rational discussion to take place <e> <s> between the advisory committee chaired by a judge the professional bodies the heads of division and the lord chancellor the prospects for rational discussion reaching an agreed conclusion are about <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not possible for me to say whether legislation will be introduced immediately following the next queens speech <e> <s> but we certainly expect and i hope that we shall have an early opportunity of introducing legislation <e> <s> so far as concerns the debate as your lordships know we had a fairly full debate on th april into these various matters <e> <s> of course for my part there is nothing i like better than to debate matters about the legal profession <e> <s> but on the other hand i am well aware that there are many others who have other interests to pursue <e> <s> the interests of the house as a whole must be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it is right to make progress by legislation <e> <s> i have certainly carefully considered the matters about multidisciplinary practices and partnerships <e> <s> what i have put together on the subject is the result of very careful consideration of this matter and also consideration in relation to the white paper published yesterday by the department of trade and industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say first that the white paper relates to england and wales and not to scotland although i indicated the reciprocal arrangements based upon the provision under the community directives towards the end of my statement <e> <s> so far as concerns changing from our present system to an inquisitorial one that is obviously a very large question indeed <e> <s> but the civil justice review which i indicated we were proposing to implement in its main outline suggested that perhaps in relation to small claims those adjudicating might take a more inquisitorial line <e> <s> that is certainly a development which i think the noble lord would welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords the overseas practice rules would not be part of the system which would require so far as concerns changes the approval of the heads of division and the lord chancellor <e> <s> the rules which the lord chancellor and the heads of division would be considering would be rules relating to advocacy and litigation in this country <e> <s> accordingly that particualr machinery would not come into the overseas practice <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to notify the house in accordance with the royal assent act that the queen has signified her royal assent to the following acts <e>", "<cs> i must say first that this bill is intended to consolidate the existing law with only such changes as are necessary to an appropriate consolidation as recommended by the law commissions that is the scottish law commission and the law commission <e> <s> therefore there is no question of any change of policy in relation to this matter represented by this bill <e> <s> but as has been pointed out there have been many changes in the legislation affecting opticians over the years and for the clarity of the statute book it is only right that these should be brought together <e> <s> that action will do nothing except make the statute book better than it was before <e>", "<cs> the report of the joint committee to which the noble lord lord mishcon referred expressed it thus <e>", "<cs> paragraph reflects existing law <e> <s> it gives the privy council a power after consultation with the council and any other body or person whom it thinks fit to consult to make such alterations in the membership of the council and the numbers and qualifications of members as may be expedient in view of changes in circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to put amendment no <e> <s> to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is objected to i shall not put the question in that form <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall put the question that amendments nos <e> <s> to inclusive be agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords the question is that the commons amendments be now considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord prys-davies and to my noble friend lord renton for welcoming the amendment <e> <s> i attach a great deal of importance to the proper implementation of this measure <e> <s> noble lords can take it that we shall be extremely careful to try to measure resources to what is to be required of the courts <e> <s> one of the present problems is that it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> replaces and partially alters the original clause <e> <s> while it repeats that to be effective parental responsibility agreements must be in the form which will be prescribed by the lord chancellor it provides that they will be effective without the need for their being recorded in any particular way unless or until the lord chancellor makes regulations prescribing a manner of recording <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i shall speak at the same time to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> these amendments together with amendments nos <e> <s> to and do two things essentially <e> <s> they split clause into two parts the first dealing with the appointment of guardians and the second with their removal <e> <s> they recast the clause so that like other private orders under the bill those relating to the appointment of guardians can be made either on application or by the court of its own motion <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> in doing so i shall also speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> perhaps i may take the amendments in order <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> will allow an individual who wishes to be a childs guardian o apply to the court to be so appointed and for the court to order his or her appointment provided of course that the circumstances in either clause a or b exist <e> <s> the amendment corrects an oversight in the original clause which did not provide for applications to be made to the court for appointments of guardians <e> <s> this

beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> with this amendment i group amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> these are purely drafting amendments <e> <s> they

the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> even if an issue has not been raised by parties before the court it may still be appropriate for the court to make an order that deals with the matter <e> <s> the

my lords i do not believe the mere fact that the colour question may be involved is of itself an absolute bar <e> <s> it is of course a most important consideration <e> <s> however as i said i do not believe that it is an absolute bar although none of these amendments specifically covers the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to confirm that i believe the bill sets the framework for and places supreme emphasis on the welfare of the child <e> <s> it largely leaves such matters to be judged in relation to the particular circumstances of the case in question <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always difficult to strike a correct balance between individual local responsibility and general guidance <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state would have responsibility for issuing general guidance but guidance by its very nature is there to be a help rather than a rule <e> <s> therefore the ultimate responsibility would be with the authority <e> <s> in many cases that

move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords the problem is that a family assistance order must make provision for a local authority to do particular acts <e> <s> that involves resources for the local authority and we must be careful about the conditions under which the local authority should be asked to provide an officer in a particular way <e> <s> the same applies more generally <e> <s> it is a matter of detail but perhaps of necessary detail <e>", "<cs> my lords many of these amendments have arisen as a result of consultations with those having practical experience <e> <s> a good deal of consultation has been going on throughout the whole parliamentary process with people in the field <e> <s> difficulties in the work are sometimes encountered which might not be adequately or properly described in the way that the noble lord lord mishcon did and an arrangement of this kind which allocates responsibility can be important <e> <s> i know of cases in which because a probation officer has as it were moved on in some way adequate arrangements for carrying on that persons work have not been made <e> <s> it is useful to direct attention to that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the amendment is designed to ensure that

my lords this imposes a duty on local authorities in england and wales to <e>", "<cs> my lords i ought perhaps to explain amendment no <e> <s> fairly shortly <e> <s> a fuller discussion may arise in relation to the amendment to the amendment on the marshalled list <e> <s> i also wish to speak to amendment no <e> <s> in this connection <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and are concerned with the provision of accommodation for children under voluntary arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords there are obvious advantages in having agreements which would operate in practical terms <e> <s> however whether it would be right to have legally enforceable agreements in this area is much more doubtful <e> <s> as has been mentioned one of the important principles underlying this matter is to distinguish very clearly between a local authoritys compulsory role and its voluntary role in this area <e> <s> one of the practical matters that has arisen is that people are less willing to involve themselves in voluntary arrangements if they fear that those arrangements can be backed up with compulsion in other words if the boundary between the voluntary giving of a child to a local authority and the compulsory taking of a child by a local authority were to be confused <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall seek to deal with the matter as it has been put forward by my noble and learned friend lord brightman <e> <s> if the provision is not intended to be legally enforceable there is no problem as regards practice because arrangements will be set out in practical terms for this to occur <e> <s> there is nothing in the bill which prevents that from being the practice <e> <s> i cannot see how putting into the bill something about an agreement which is not intended to be legally enforceable really advances matters <e> <s> i suggest that it tends to introduce confusion because agreements referred to in statute law are normally intended to have legal effect <e> <s> accordingly while i appreciate fully what my noble and learned friend said i fear that to introduce this amendment into the legislation would be a mistake <e> <s> however it would be right to regulate the practice in the way that the noble and learned lord and the other speakers who have spoken in support of the amendment have suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in

protection in detention or on remand <e> <s> that is a very special class of child <e> <s> it does not follow that they are in need in the technical sense although they are in need of accommodation <e> <s> the provisions regulate the basis on which those children are accommodated <e> <s> i believe that it is important to have the holding of children under those circumstances regulated by statute <e>", "<cs> my lords it applies to children generally <e> <s> there are particular provisions dealing with children who are in the care of the police in respect of particular offences <e> <s> but the amendment applies to children generally who are within the categories that i described for example in subsection of the new clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the

powers should be exercised <e> <s> that is what amendment no <e> <s> does <e> <s> to try to turn it into a duty to make payments in all circumstances would require a completely different approach

to her majestys commands and by virtue of the commission which has been now read we do declare and notify to you the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in parliament assembled that her majesty hath given her royal assent to the several acts in the commission mentioned and the clerks are required to pass the same in the usual form and words <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble and learned friend sits down i wish to mention that whether we have achieved the idea may be open to question but it was that part of the objective as described in the white paper now contained in clause a and b as the general principle <e> <s> in clause we have provided that the general principle is to prevail <e> <s> in other words the statutory objective is subject to the general principle and therefore the idea of what is <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a full and interesting debate <e> <s> your lordships will not expect me to deal in detail with every point that has been made <e> <s> the whole purpose of the bill is to seek to make improvements and to open up opportunity for improvements in access to justice <e> <s> i have no desire to achieve any sort of populous effect or anything of that nature <e> <s> i put the bill before your lordships in the belief that the general thrust of its provisions no doubt subject to improvement by amendment as it goes through the house is properly directed towards achieving a better system of justice and a more varied and therefore better provision of legal services for all our people <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly correct that as the bill stands what we have proposed is that these safeguards should be the subject of regulation <e> <s> therefore i think that it would be right for us to bear in mind when considering the bill what these provisions might be <e> <s> i certainly think that what was proposed in the white paper is a reasonable set of protections <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree of course that there are continuing debates about the office and the more public funding that is done through the office the more there may be questions about it <e> <s> i have certainly sought to discharge this office bearing in mind that very important consideration to the best of my ability <e> <s> i certainly make it my business to keep fully in contact with members of the other place and to answer their queries and letters as fully as i can in order that they may feel that i am accountable to them although i do not have the privilege of being a member of that place <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to notify the house in accordance with the royal assent act that the queen has signified her royal assent to the following acts <e>", "<cs> i am extremely happy to agree with the proposition that the object of the courts is to provide a service to the public to those who have recourse to them <e> <s> it is in order to ensure that the courts do that most effectively that my noble and learned friend lord hailsham set tip the civil justice review to make proposals upon these matters <e>", "<cs> i have sought to explain that as between the courts at a particular level the convenience generally of those having to resort to the court will be important <e> <s> we come to that at a later stage <e> <s> this clause is concerned with allocation of cases as between the two levels of courts <e> <s> that must depend on the objective character of the cases and what is involved in them <e>", "<cs> i share the aims of the noble lord and should like to get the matter as correct as possible <e> <s> however i wish to avoid any confusion about the nature of the criteria to be applied as regards clause <e> <s> no doubt when we have had a chance to consider some of the later clauses and the effects on the interests and convenience of the parties we may be in a better position to assess exactly how our objectives may be met <e> <s> i am grateful for the stance that the noble lord has taken on the matter <e>", "<cs> i regret to say that there has been a certain misunderstanding as regards some of <e>", "<cs> subsection refers to an order made under this section <e> <s> the only order-making power under this clause is in subsection <e> <s> accordingly clause is intended to refer to the only orders that may be made under clause of this bill which is under the power contained in subsection <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that observation but i must say that the only order-making power in the whole clause is in subsection <e>", "<cs> that is my reading of it <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> the purpose of subsection is to enable the lord chancellor to confer new jurisdiction for example on the county courts <e> <s> the county court jurisdiction is statutory and there are restrictions on it for instance in relation to defamation which we shall hear about later <e> <s> if i thought it was right in the light of the resources available to the county courts to increase their jurisdiction then it would be right to make clear the effect of that on the existing statutory situation in the county courts <e> <s> the whole purpose of the legislation is to enable the jurisdiction to be varied in order to make it possible to allocate cases between the two levels of court to the best advantage of the public as a whole <e>", "<cs> in view of what my noble and learned friend said i should add that there is no power to restrict the jurisdiction of the high court under these proposals <e> <s> the only power is by order to make provision conferring jurisdiction on the high court <e> <s> that is additional jurisdiction because there are restrictions on high court jurisdiction by statute in regard for example to consumer credit arrangements and such matters <e> <s> the second power is to confer jurisdiction on the county court <e>", "<cs> i have already undertaken in answer to the noble lord lord mishcon to see whether we can make it absolutely plain that subsection is intended purely as an incidental or explanatory provision to the powers contained in clause <e>", "<cs> it depends on what one decides to do <e> <s> i do not wish to pre-empt the amendment of the noble lord lord mishcon about defamation but let me take it as an example without prejudice to the argument that he will no doubt put forward <e> <s> at present there are restrictions on defamation actions in the county court under the statute <e> <s> supposing i thought it was a good idea to allow the smaller actions of defamation to proceed in the county court <e> <s> under the powers in subsection i could confer jurisdiction on the county court to hear such actions <e> <s> then the effect would be to amend the existing statutory prohibition against it <e>", "<cs> yes i think the noble lord may be correct in saying that subsection g would enable the jurisdiction of the high court to be restricted in the circumstances of that particular part but the point i am making is that the only powers to deal with jurisdiction as such are the powers in a and b which are to confer jurisdiction not to restrict it <e>", "<cs> as i understand the provision the order is to repeal any provision made by or under any enactment that is to say an enactment which presently exists which is affected by an order made under this provision <e> <s> i do not see in what circumstances it could possibly affect a provision of this bill <e>", "<cs> yes because a subsequent enactment if it did not do so expressly would impliedly repeal any power to alter it <e> <s> the last word of parliament would prevail <e> <s> let us take the defamation example supposing in a years time parliament decided that defamation should be restricted to the high court and supposing i had made an order under this provision allowing defamation proceedings in the county court the new act of parliament would supersede because it would impliedly repeal the power to put defamation in the county court it would be saying defamation could only be in the high court <e> <s> so any later enactment being the last word of parliament would repeal this provision as far as it was inconsistent with it <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should say generally and in particular in reference to this point that i believe debates in this house inform us all <e> <s> after one has listened to various points which have been put forward one sometimes sees ambiguities which were never seen before <e> <s> ingenuity is always capable of producing ambiguity which can sometimes arise in ways other than as a result of ingenuity <e>", "<cs> i certainly value the opinion of the circuit judges and i intend that they should be among those consulted on the draft order <e> <s> however they would not be the only people consulted the bar the law society and those representing consumer groups would also be consulted <e>", "<cs> i regard it as the primary responsibility of the lord chancellor to secure the proper resourcing of the courts <e> <s> i do not think that it could be right to expect the judges to do so <e> <s> on the other hand the whole system can work only if the lord chancellor takes proper account of the views of the judges <e>", "<cs> we have had an interesting debate and as the committee may know i have intimated that i propose to carry out a review of the law of defamation <e> <s> we are seeking to prepare some material including reviewing the reports which have been available for some little time to see whether any action can be taken on all or any of them <e> <s> however with great respect to the noble lord lord mishcon for us to pre-empt this matter in the way he is seeking to do at the present moment would not be right <e> <s> i think perhaps he is drawing my attention to it rather than believing that it would necessarily be effective immediately <e>", "<cs> if i were proposing to do that which the noble lord lord mishcon wishes in other words to give jurisdiction to the county court one could do it under the powers of this bill <e> <s> if one were to deal with the kind of complexities referred to by my noble and learned friend lord ackner however that would have to be a bill of its own <e> <s> at least it would not be part of this exercise <e> <s> it would be big enough i think i can assure my noble friend of itself to justify a pretty substantial bill if we were to try to deal with all the difficulties that exist in the law of defamation <e>", "<cs> the county courts are a service given to the public in the administration of justice <e> <s> it is extremely difficult at the beginning of a year to estimate precisely the volume of work that may accrue <e> <s> we must try to estimate the necessary provision and try to obtain it in competition with a good number of other very worthy causes which have a call on the exchequer <e> <s> i believe that the court service is regarded indeed i certainly regard it as such as a very important call on the public purse <e>", "<cs> i am saying that provision has been made to enable me to obtain staff <e> <s> in so far as it is necessary we have to have training arrangements for staff and we devote a great deal of effort to that training <e> <s> one of the results is that we have staff who are quite valuable to other people as i mentioned earlier <e> <s> a good deal of effort is devoted in the lord chancellors department to this <e>", "<cs> i estimated that primarily by reference to staff numbers <e> <s> one of the difficulties about all this is to estimate the workload that the court may have in a particular year <e> <s> this year the increase in workload has been quite high <e> <s> however it is difficult to estimate at the time when one is preparing the necessary estimates for the public service <e> <s> however on the whole we seek to do that to the best of our ability <e>", "<cs> i have obtained figures which are part of the totals referred to in the autumn statement which my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer made to parliament <e> <s> i indicated that one of the consequences of what has been allocated in that statement is that it will enable me all being well to have additional staff for existing commitments and up to further staff for the implementation of changes <e> <s> these arrangements strike me as reasonable <e>", "<cs> the money to which i have been referring is the money allocated in respect of the courts and the lord chancellors department generally in the autumn statement <e> <s> that is a statement to parliament of what is to be expended out of the public purse on these services <e>", "<cs> i spoke particularly in relation to staff numbers because that is the most important resource <e> <s> as regards the situation of individual courts we sought to devolve this because budgets are best handled at local level <e> <s> i have explained already that the burden of work in the county courts this year turned out to be quite high <e> <s> so far as the crown courts are concerned to which my noble and learned friend lord ackner referred i believe that the waiting times in those courts are as low as they have been for a considerable number of years <e> <s> we have concentrated on the crown courts in past years and in this i include my noble and learned friends lord hailsham and lord havers <e> <s> these are areas where the liberty of the subject is primarily at issue and our efforts have produced considerably reduced waiting times <e>", "<cs> i would not say that my noble friend had it totally wrong but the figures that the noble lord lord hacking gave are exclusive of judicial salaries they comprised costs other than judicial salaries so we do not need to consider judges salaries in this regard <e> <s> these figures show that there is roughly a million advantage so far as fee income is concerned over expenditure but that is what happens if one has more work than one bargains for <e> <s> the expenditure has to be estimated before it is known exactly how much work there is <e> <s> considering that the total budget is of the order of l million million is not very far out especially as the estimate was made a long time before the start of the year <e> <s> my noble friend can be reassured on that aspect of the matter <e>", "<cs> that obscures the real point <e> <s> what your lordships want to achieve is the carrying out of the objective recommended by the civil justice review <e> <s> to put an obstacle in the way of the lord chancellor doing that does not of itself achieve very much <e> <s> the lord chancellor hopes to get the necessary resources and do what is wanted and to put an obstacle in his way in the form of this amendment does not appear to be particularly constructive <e>", "<cs> i thought for one moment that i should be able to agree entirely with my noble friend lord rippon <e> <s> however i think that at the very end he unfortunately fell into a small error <e> <s> subsection makes it perfectly plain that the lord chancellor cannot confer such jurisdiction on the county courts <e>", "<cs> no certainly not because subsection quite plainly restricts the scope of subsection <e> <s> it is plain that if one exaggerates the effect of subsection it may be easier to suggest that such provision should not pass into law <e> <s> but <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is right in saying that at the present time the only method available for dealing with these matters is judicial review <e> <s> my understanding of the report of the civil justice review and it is confirmed by my noble and learned friend lord griffiths is that the preference for which previously there was argument and representation was some form of appeal <e> <s> there are plenty of statutory provisions for which there is a right of appeal to the courts in respect of a decision of a local authority <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord is well aware of those <e> <s> however normally they provide some form of criteria on the basis of which the county court judge can decide the appeal <e> <s> the judicial review is an entirely different process available only where parliament has not thought it appropriate to allow such an appeal <e> <s> the argument put before the civil justice review was that in such cases some form of appeal should be provided rather than that judicial review should be available <e> <s> however none exists at the moment <e>", "<cs> the situation is that i intend to accept the proposal of the civil justice review in this connection just as i propose in the order to accept the general form of bands which it proposed subject to anything which may emerge on the consultation which i shall hold before we make the order <e> <s> therefore there is no question of rejecting <e>", "<cs> i agree entirely with the spirit of the amendment <e> <s> it is right that the court service should be monitored having regard to the waiting times and the way in which it transacts its business the volume of business handled and so on <e> <s> the same is true of the high court <e> <s> we prepare figures annually a copy of the court service report is sent to the law society and the bar and to anyone else who has expressed an interest in receiving it <e>", "<cs> that is what i have in mind <e> <s> perhaps i may be allowed to consider this as i had in mind a rather less formal report before the amendment was proposed <e> <s> as the noble lord knows we already provide a court service and i had intended to continue that but if a more formal obligation is required i shall consider it <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will allow me to do that without any commitment because i have not had a chance to consider fully its possible ramifictions but i shall certainly consider it carefully before report stage and let him know the result of my consideration <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly consider that <e> <s> the report that i had in mind would have been as informative as possible <e> <s> the idea was that the public should know the nature of the service being provided and any deficiencies would be highlighted <e> <s> that is helpful for a number of reasons and i shall consider that aspect also <e>", "<cs> it might be appropriate for me to comment before the question whether clause shall stand part of the bill is put to the committee <e> <s> i do not propose to go over everything that has been said <e> <s> however as i understood what my noble and learned friend lord hailsham said in his speech on second reading when he criticised parts of the bill as ignoring every principle of law reform he <e>", "<cs> indeed it is intended to mean exactly that <e> <s> it is intended to make a little easier the wording of the new section <e> <s> with respect if instead of procedure provision one reads the definition of procedure provision into the section one will find that it makes perfect sense <e>", "<cs> the provision is by or under any enactment and the powers to make rules of court are under the county courts act and the supreme court act <e> <s> so these rules are made under enactment also <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the noble lord lord meston and my noble and learned friend the master of the rolls <e> <s> originally i intended that the court would have fairly wide discretions as regards subsection b <e> <s> however on reconsidering the matter and seeing that in section of the county courts act which is a good precedent there appears the phrase used in amendment no <e> <s> i thought that it may be as well to express it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord hacking is right in saying that the reason we altered the wording is to make it possible for the court to take account of convenience generally <e> <s> of course the convenience of the parties is included in that consideration <e> <s> however i did not wish to restrict it to the convenience of the parties because for example if it was convenient for certain parties to have a long case in a particular court it may be very inconvenient from the point of view of other litigants wishing to litigate in that place <e> <s> in seeking to dispense justice to all litigants the high court would want to take account generally of convenience <e>", "<cs> i have a moment to consider the amendment before it is formally moved <e>", "<cs> i think that it would be perfectly reasonable for me to accept the amendment <e> <s> it may be that on consideration parliamentary counsel will wish to finish it in some way because the phraseology is perhaps not the most expedient <e> <s> however in order to make progress i shall accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i believe that it is fair to say that it is right to deal with these matters with a fairly open mind <e> <s> if someone makes a suggestion which would improve what we have we should try to make use of that suggestion <e> <s> that is what i have done <e> <s> bills are generally drafted within government <e> <s> when the bill is open to public scrutiny many people make suggestions <e> <s> i have always taken the view that it is my job to do my best to get the bill right in the light of all the considerations available <e> <s> the amendments that we are discussing and later ones are intended to take account of that process <e> <s> that is why i always listen carefully to what members of this place say in <e>", "<cs> my impression is that the amendment was debated with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> it was debated in connection with the amendment moved by the noble lord lord hacking to delete the courts power to strike out when an action was brought in contravention of a procedure provision <e> <s> all the amendment does is add a requirement that if the striking power is to be used it can be used only in the event described in the amendment <e> <s> we tended to assume that the court would not use the power except in those circumstances but having regard to the amendment moved by the noble lord lord hacking it was thought better to incorporate it <e> <s> it is an example of the procedure that i described to the noble baroness lady phillips <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord prys-davies has said the phrase officer of the court is defined in the statute into which the provision is being put <e> <s> in that respect it has an advantage over the word clerk because clerk has no such definition <e> <s> i should like to remind the committee of the context in which the phrase applies <e> <s> it is a power given to the county court rule committee to make arrangements <e> <s> the committee may take it that the county court rule committee would make appropriate arrangements to deal with the matter <e> <s> as it is a matter of procedure i suggest that it is right to leave it to the county court rule committee to prescribe the circumstances in which proceedings may be transferred by the decision of any officer of the court whose identity is for the committee to specify from one court to another and the procedure consequent upon any such transfer <e>", "<cs> i did not wish to take technical matters but one of the consequences of the bill under a later clause is to substitute a new name for the registrar <e> <s> i shall consider what has been said but i do not wish to go further than that at present <e> <s> i shall consider whether some alteration to what is in the bill should be made in the light of what members of the committee have said <e> <s> it is a matter for the rule committees <e> <s> they are likely to wish to give opportunities to parties on a lot of matters where that is not expressly stated <e> <s> it is one of their obligations to make sure that the procedure is fair <e> <s> however i shall consider what the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> i am perfectly prepared to do that <e> <s> i shall consider with favour any representation that the noble lord has made and this one perhaps with more favour than others <e>", "<cs> i consider that the best way to deal with such amendments is by textual amendment of the basic statute in this case the county courts act <e> <s> for my part if the bill becomes law i should wish to pursue the question of consolidation of these statutes <e> <s> that would be intended as a structure for the high court and the county courts for some time to come <e>", "<cs> the purpose of this part of the clause is to deal with the orders that a county court should have power to make <e> <s> as there is an express statutory prohibition against a county court having judicial review jurisdiction paragraph a of the proposed subsection is clearly correct <e> <s> the noble lord lord hacking does not wish to remove that <e>", "<cs> the situations in which provisions such as those in new section d are drawn up vary a great deal <e> <s> the power in question in the children bill was a wide power to deal with the precise provisions that were then being made <e> <s> this is a different situation altogether <e> <s> the noble lords lord prys-davies and lord mishcon were directly involved as was the late and very respected lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> he was concerned not so much about the general question as about the possibility that the power in the children bill would be used to repeal provisions which he thought of importance <e>", "<cs> i certainly take the view that the restricted amendment powers which are dealt with here are not in the same category as the open amendment powers which were dealt with and described as a henry viii clause in the children bill <e> <s> many things have happened since donoughmore reported including the great development of the powers of the court in judicial review and the right to apply in the exercise of powers the underlying intention of the statute as the court gathers it <e> <s> i have sought to make it plain in the bill that that is what we desire to do <e> <s> the government certainly take fully into account the donoughmore committees recommendations and i have sought to have regard to them but as i said earlier the circumstances vary according to whether the clauses are in effect henry viii clauses <e>", "<cs> subsection is a regulation-making subsection because it contains the power to prescribe the order <e> <s> subsection is intended to deal with the conditions of the prescription that may be made in relation to the orders <e>", "<cs> the aim of the regulation-making power is to enable the nature of the order that the county court should not have power to grant to be prescribed <e>", "<cs> although that question is directed against those who moved and supported the amendment perhaps i may be allowed to have the first shot at answering it <e> <s> the answer is undoubtedly yes it is an attempt to change the basis on which the local authorities proceed <e>", "<cs> as i have already said at present per cent <e> <s> of authorities have an internal appeals procedure <e> <s> under their powers to issue a statutory code of guidance my colleagues in the department of the environment wish to recommend the procedure to the other authorities so that they also will embrace that best practice <e> <s> i submit to the committee that at this juncture and in the present state of knowledge that is the right way forward <e>", "<cs> that is a matter for the local authorities <e> <s> i have discussed it briefly with those who know more about it <e> <s> i have been told that in some cases the intimated decision is called into question and is then referred to the chairman of the housing committee as the elected officer with responsibility <e> <s> he reviews the cases <e> <s> in some he grants the application in others he does not <e> <s> therefore the point about low level is taken up <e> <s> i do not know whether that is the uniform method <e> <s> perhaps it is right that elected representatives at a senior level should take the responsibility <e> <s> i know that that is one method of dealing with the matter <e> <s> there may be others <e>", "<cs> my position today is entirely consistent with what i said on the last occasion <e> <s> i was then dealing with what the civil justice review appeared to have in mind <e> <s> however that said quite plainly that before anything of that sort could be dealt with there would have to be a substantive review of the law on homelessness <e> <s> as regards the position i take today that is consistent with what i said last time and i am not in a position to change it <e>", "<cs> so far as concerns the supreme court the wording of the law has until now in general terms given the court discretion to award costs against anyone <e> <s> the court is left to exercise that discretion <e>", "<cs> if quite contrary to his normal character at the end of the year he refused to repay and i took action i would be a party to the proceedings and therefore the court could make me liable as a party to the proceedings <e> <s> however i hope that in that case i would not be made liable <e>", "<cs> indeed and i am saying that it is a necessary condition that it should be satisfied but not a sufficient condition <e> <s> the court has a discretion as to whether or not to award costs against people answering this description <e> <s> there is no discretion to award costs against people answering any other description <e> <s> that is the purpose of the provision <e> <s> the mere fact that a person is covered by that list does not mean that the court will make an award against him <e> <s> that is the point <e> <s> it is a restriction of the people against whom an award may be made in order to provide clear guidance to all the classes of cases of which i know in which such an award has been considered <e>", "<cs> it is necessary to review the provision against the background of the existing law <e> <s> section of the supreme court act states <e>", "<cs> there are a number of possibilities <e> <s> one example is somebody who is prepared to give evidence in support of a case where that person is not acting in bona fide <e> <s> i am not suggesting for a minute that the court would do more than have power to consider these matters <e> <s> i do not see why the only support that should be considered is financial support <e> <s> sometimes bodies support a test case without actually giving financial support <e> <s> it might be that the way the case was conducted and the nature of the costs incurred were affected by that support <e>", "<cs> i am perfectly content to consider whether we should have subsection which attempts a classification in the light of <e>", "<cs> i have already said that i shall reconsider the question of subsection <e> <s> i understood the noble lord to say that if the subsection were to be removed he would not wish this amendment to go forward <e> <s> in the circumstances perhaps he will feel able to withdraw his amendment today so as to enable me further to consider the position <e>", "<cs> it seems to me with the greatest respect that that is a complete answer as to whether subsection should stand <e> <s> as i explained earlier the present law gives power to award costs against persons who are not party to the case <e> <s> however as my noble and learned friend my noble friend lord campbell of alloway and the noble lord lord meston said no court would think of <e>", "<cs> first legal representative is defined in the clause as follows <e>", "<cs> it is always difficult to get everything right <e> <s> i thought that it was wise to limit the power in case people thought that it could be exercised in too draconian a manner <e> <s> it seemed to me that a maximum of per cent <e> <s> was a reasonable figure to take <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly consider it <e> <s> i indicated that we thought this was a good figure <e> <s> i had regard to the present level of cost between the high court and the county courts but it is impossible to justify such a figure in great detail <e> <s> it seemed to me to be a reasonable figure <e> <s> however i shall consider whether the matter needs to be put in this way <e> <s> so far as possible it mirrors the present situation in a slightly different way <e> <s> we need something along the lines of subsection b in order that that aspect should be considered <e> <s> however i am very happy to look at it again <e>", "<cs> the idea is generally to give equal treatment to both sides <e> <s> the way in which the rule is expressed is to order one party to serve witness statements on another <e> <s> there might be cases in which it was only appropriate to do it in respect of one side perhaps at a particular time <e> <s> the side note is a matter to be determined in the light of the final content of the clause <e> <s> i shall certainly keep in mind the point the noble lord has made <e>", "<cs> if we can omit that subsection without harm i shall be happy to do so <e> <s> perhaps my noble and learned friend will allow me to take advice on the point <e>", "<cs> i was not proposing to enter into a full account of my position at the present moment <e> <s> however in view of the point that has been raised i wish to say first of all that what is proposed here is that these powers should be dealt <e>", "<cs> as my noble and learned friend the master of the rolls has said the point has been raised in almost every annual report that he has submitted since <e> <s> indeed since i have been in office as lord chancellor i have been extremely conscious of it <e>", "<cs> i fully appreciate the work of the official referees

much the type of person required difficulties might arise <e> <s> the discretion mentioned in the civil justice review was one which would affect corrupt or unruly representatives <e> <s> i have provided a power so far as concerns corrupt or unruly representatives later on in the clause <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that indication <e> <s> i feel myself to be between two extremes in this matter <e> <s> i should like to be as accommodating as possible and to try to pick up the spirit of the civil justice review <e> <s> as i said earlier many of those people may want a friend or

justice because people were entitled to make their case without being restricted in that way <e> <s> the word unruly covers that because the judge may say now come on you have told us that already <e>

to do the same <e>", "<cs> the civil justice review was set up for the purpose of identifying the causes of among other things problems of delay in the courts and recommending action to alleviate them

provision <e> <s> moreover i think it only right that i should take such responsibility <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has made the point <e> <s> with the best information that it has the court has assigned a date and then for reasons about which the court has not been informed for example negotiations between the parties which have settled the matter the hearing is no longer needed and time is

review it seems to me to be appropriate for the court to have the power <e> <s> if the noble lord lord grantchester is correct the power will be seldom exercised <e> <s> i am entirely in favour of that <e>", "<cs> the main matter is the one that i have mentioned <e> <s> the possibility of occupying the time for appointments on an interlocutory basis can also arise <e> <s> since i have been in

court that they carry out is not part of the administration of the administration of my department <e> <s> but there are some areas that they cover which it may be appropriate for him to examine <e>

for the parliamentary commissioner to look at on the other hand <e> <s> that is the problem <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful for any assistance <e> <s> i certainly did not intend any discourtesy to the noble lord <e> <s> i think in moving amendment no <e> <s> the noble lord lord hacking referred to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it was for that reason that i thought to give that information <e>

able to carry it out <e> <s> i do not give a full undertaking because we have not yet completely solved the difficult question but i certainly have every intention of bringing forward an amendment if i possibly can in time for report <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly have that in mind <e> <s> i do not think the question of whether compensation is paid is precisely the same question but they are obviously related <e>", "<cs> i am very much against wasting time on any amendments but i wish to say a word or two in answer to the speech of my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson of ewell who moved the amendment <e> <s> i have the greatest possible respect for my noble and learned friend as a most distinguished law officer and very fine advocate of great experience <e> <s> i should also like to take this opportunity of paying tribute to the excellent work he did in providing the guidance in a good deal of the reform that was carried out on the internal workings of the inns and their relationships with the bar generally <e> <s> i believe that that was excellent work and generations to come as well as the present generation will reap the fruits of that excellent work <e>", "<cs> i am glad to detect a considerable degree of harmony <e> <s> i am particularly glad that my noble and learned friend lord ackner also noted that although perhaps towards the end of his submissions he may have gone on to more controversial matters <e>", "<cs> my amendment no <e> <s> a which i propose to move governs the whole matter by stating <e>", "<cs> we could have a considerable discussion about the matter but i do not wish to be accused of speaking to my amendments at too great a length <e> <s> however such a question may well give rise to extremely difficult arguments <e> <s> it may

is something that is not presently being done <e> <s> for the moment i cannot see that the suggested change will make the kind of difference that is being indicated <e> <s> i shall consider the matters but i hope that the committee will approve amendment no <e> <s> a which i have moved <e>", "<cs> there may be some misunderstanding <e> <s> line consists of the words in question and <e>", "<cs> i think not <e> <s> i think that there are three matters to go in <e> <s> i do not wish to take up time <e> <s> may i look at that <e> <s> certainly the intention is to put this emphasis on <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with the view that what has been referred to as the cab rank rule is of great importance <e> <s> the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington was kind enough to quote something that i said in my capacity as dean of faculty representing the faculty before the royal commission in the late s <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the effect of the amendment is slightly to take away from the role played by the statutory objective in the framework for developing legal services which i am trying to establish <e> <s> the clause as amended would require the advisory committee the designated judges and myself to act in accordance with the general principle and subject to that to act to further the statutory objective only so far as it was reasonably practicable to do so in the circumstances of the case <e>", "<cs> i am not saying that the words reasonably practicable are not appropriate in some contexts <e> <s> of course they are but i see no advantage in putting them into the provision dealt with by the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am prepared to consider the wording further <e> <s> the issue is extremely important <e> <s> the policies contained in the white paper were put to the draftsman and he came forward with the provision in his way <e> <s> i shall draw to his attention what has been said and ask for his views <e>", "<cs> i have to say that it never occurred to me for a moment that the designated judges could be liable in damages in the circumstances of this particular bill assuming it becomes an act <e> <s> as my noble and learned friend the master of the rolls said it is the invariable practice of the government to provide indemnity to judges who are sued as sometimes judges are in relation to their judicial work <e>", "<cs> the function of the lord chancellor has been referred to <e> <s> for my part i completely support and endeavour to act upon the principle that the lord chancellor has a responsibility to uphold the independence of the judiciary and of the judicial process <e> <s> i believe that that responsibility has been taken seriously by all my predecessors and i certainly seek to do the same <e>", "<cs> certainly <e>", "<cs> i accept the fact that the senior stipendiary magistrate is a person worthy of consideration in this connection and that a number of others will be suggested <e> <s> perhaps my noble and learned friend will allow me to consider all the proposals <e>", "<cs> i shall seek to answer both those questions <e> <s> as was pointed out by the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington it is difficult for lay people to understand exactly the conditions under which lawyers operate <e> <s> therefore it is extremely useful that they should have assistance in the formulation of the rules <e> <s> i believe that lay people of appropriate experience can bring forward advice on such issues <e> <s> after all the courts and the legal services exist in order to provide for a need which the public has <e> <s> under our existing structure the profession will set the rules subject to the approval of the senior judges and the lord chancellor <e> <s> they will be the people who have the responsibility the committee is advisory only <e> <s> i believe that where the chairman of an advisory committee is a judge it is appropriate that the balance should be for a lay majority <e> <s> i have indicated that simply because it is a consideration which i have in mind and i wished to set it out at the beginning of the debate <e> <s> like everything else it is open to discussion <e>", "<cs> i should like to deal with some of the issues that have been raised <e> <s> my noble and learned friend lord oliver quoted from the white paper <e> <s> the reason advanced in the white paper at paragraph for the majority being lay persons is that the balance aims to ensure that the committee primarily represents the views and interests of the user of legal services but contains wide representations from those who have practical experience of providing them <e>", "<cs> i thought i explained in answer to that question that this is not a body which is to regulate it is a body to give advice <e> <s> i know of no other profession in which such an important part of the decision-making to which the profession is devoted is taken by lay people <e> <s> as i said a significant feature of our system of criminal justice particularly is that the decisions on all disputed matters of fact are for lay people to take <e> <s> however above all i am making the point that the advisory committee is not for regulating the professions <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> i shall respond to that point before the noble lord sits down and therefore before the amendment is put <e> <s> i said that i would consider these matters i tried to show the framework in which i was seeking to operate because there were a number of candidates involved <e> <s> i should like to know why the noble lord considers that a patent agent should be included on the advisory committee <e> <s> he may find it convenient to make representations to me on another occasion although he is perfectly entitled to do so here if he wishes <e> <s> that is a matter entirely for him <e>", "<cs> certainly i shall be happy to receive the further enlightenment on the institute of legal executives that my noble friend will provide <e>", "<cs> in response to my noble and learned friend in case there is any misunderstanding i indicated at the outset that i would consider the proposals <e> <s> i indicated the general considerations concerning the committee which i have in mind <e> <s> i have no intention whatever of proposing a committee on which every possible sectional interest is represented <e> <s> otherwise it would be almost a committee of the whole house <e>", "<cs> yes certainly <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord hutchinson for his remarks <e> <s> i am extremely interested in trying as best as i can to promote these matters <e> <s> i think it is also fair to say that the general council of the bar and the law society are concerned about other aspects of racial discrimination <e> <s> i am considering whether anything can be done in relation to this bill to deal with those problems <e>", "<cs> while i perfectly understand the aim of the noble lord i do not think that i can accept this amendment <e> <s> the committee and the framework created in this part of the bill deal with the question of the structure of the profession and the services provided <e> <s> it is not intended to deal with the level of remuneration for example that should be paid to professional advisers <e> <s> the effect of the proposed amendment could lead the advisory committee into seeking to stipulate rigid standards to apply to all clients whatever their status their means or the sums at stake <e> <s> wealthier clients would not for example be entitled to employ additional counsel in particularly important cases <e> <s> the object of the bill is to remove any unnecessary restrictions which inhibit the quality of service and not to impose them <e> <s> if the service is freed from any unnecessary restrictive practices the result will be an increase in client choice <e> <s> i have been accused in the past of seeking to subject the profession to undesirable influence from the executive <e> <s> but the amendment seems to suggest that the advisory committee should advise rigid controls which would probably be deleterious to an independent profession <e> <s> i suggest that it would be best to let the advisory committee concentrate on legal education and conduct <e>", "<cs> we discussed regional legal services committees at the committee stage of the legal aid act <e> <s> i said then that the legal aid board already had power under the legal aid act to establish and fund regional committees should it be found desirable to do so <e> <s> the legal aid board has already given some consideration lo the role of legal services committees but needs snore time to develop its own relationship with the providers of legal services <e> <s> it would not be sensible to pre-empt this work <e>", "<cs> i had in mind in that debate that it was a matter for the legal aid board but of course it could not do anything until it was set up <e> <s> the primary function that it has had since it was set up is to try to improve the administration of the existing scheme so as to get applications for legal aid certificates dealt with quickly <e> <s> i believe that the board is looking at these matters with as much expedition as possible <e>", "<cs> provisions allowing payment of fees and allowances to be paid out of money provided by parliament normally require the rates to be set with the consent of the treasury <e> <s> it is important that a consistent approach is maintained so that particular fees and allowances do not fall out of step and create pressure for increases elsewhere <e> <s> the treasury is responsible to parliament for the proper administration of moneys voted by parliament not only in respect of the total amount but in respect also of the ways in which they are disbursed <e> <s> this reflects the proper care which the government should have in dealing with what is after all the taxpayers money <e>", "<cs> on my noble friends second point the question concerns the most appropriate word in the context <e> <s> the essence is consent <e> <s> sometimes the appropriate way to express it is by using the word approval <e> <s> sometimes it is consent and sometimes it is concurrence <e> <s> it depends on the nature of the context <e> <s> these phrases are included in recognition of the treasurys responsibility to parliament for that aspect of the subject matter <e>", "<cs> i have a good deal of sympathy with the intention of this amendment but i doubt whether it is a matter which should be dealt with in the bill <e> <s> my intention is that the advisory committee should be enabled to conduct a modest programme of research <e> <s> paragraph of schedule gives the committee power to regulate its own procedure and i think that decisions on whether part of the grant-in-aid should be used for research <e>", "<cs> i think that i shall have to leave the noble lord in such a difficulty at least for the present time <e>", "<cs> i am happy to consider further how this matter should be dealt with <e> <s> the public of course includes all those who are disadvantaged <e> <s> the general includes the particular <e> <s> i can see a possible advantage in having a specific reference to that group of people <e> <s> if the noble lord will allow me i should like to consider the matter further <e>", "<cs> the committee has a general advisory function but in relation to advocacy and litigation it has a particular and more central function <e> <s> that role would be weakened if its advice on advocacy and litigation matters carried no more weight than that on other legal services issues <e> <s> the government remain committed to the principle that in the first instance the maintenance of standards in legal services is a matter for the professional bodies themselves <e> <s> the general objective in this part of the bill of developing legal services gives the advisory committee a role to play <e> <s> but that role has been carefully drawn so as not to impinge unduly on the independence of the professions <e> <s> i consider that the correct balance between complete professional independence and the right of the users of legal services to have their voice heard in advice through the medium of the committee is struck with the present requirement that the professional bodies should be under an obligation to have regard to the committees advice only to the extent that it relates to advocacy or litigation because that is the statutory matter that is central to its role <e> <s> it is for that reason that this limitation is included and that i do not feel able to accept the amendment <e> <s> i hope that in the light of that explanation the noble lord may feel able to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i have explained the position as i see it <e> <s> it is something worth waiting for to have my noble and learned friend on my side <e> <s> that is extremely pleasant <e> <s> i have sought to explain the matter but the real point is to deal particularly with advocacy and the conduct of litigation <e> <s> that does not imply that we do not have regard to that in other circumstances it just means that there is no particular statutory obligation to have regard to it <e>", "<cs> i am not in favour of over-specialisation but i am in favour of consideration being given to specialisation in certain areas <e> <s> one of the functions of the advisory committee and particularly of those members who are familiar with requiring legal services is to advise on that kind of question <e> <s> for example in what kind of areas should people exhibit specialisations <e> <s> personal injuries is a good example <e> <s> one of the points that comes to my notice as lord chancellor concerns letters from members of parliament complaining about a delay in handling a case for a client who is a constituent <e> <s> quite often the delay is due to the client having gone originally to someone who was not familiar with the area of law in which the claim arose <e> <s> that perhaps is primarily a matter that arises in a solicitors practice <e>", "<cs> i suppose that i could have used some other word but what i have in mind is advice to the professional bodies in relation to particular specialisations the need for them the way in which they should be recognised what particular aspects the service should have and so on a fairly general remit and it is advice on these matters to the professional bodies that is in question <e>", "<cs> i have much sympathy with the sentiment behind the amendment although i recognise that in practice it may be difficult for the ombudsman to pursue such cases or to achieve a result of real benefit to the client <e> <s> if the noble lord agrees to withdraw the amendment i shall consider whether we can do something effective about the matter <e>", "<cs> i shall also look into that matter <e> <s> there are a number of amendments to solicitors legislation for which the law society has asked <e> <s> we shall be considering them and this point will be kept in mind <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble and learned friend <e>", "<cs> i have already indicated in the most practical manner possible that quite a number of amendments put down were extremely sensible because i have accepted some of them <e> <s> i entirely accept the point that the noble lord has made <e> <s> perhaps i should have said it earlier <e>", "<cs> while i see the point that the noble lord makes on the second amendment i regret that i do not think it would be right to accept this and indeed it would not be right to give it favourable consideration <e> <s> the fact that somebody has been bogged down or gagged by a legal process <e>", "<cs> certainly i shall do my best <e> <s> on tuesday night i said that the administration of my department is already subject to the parliamentary commissioner for administration but the administration of the courts although staff are supplied to the courts by the lord chancellor is not part of the administration of the lord chancellors department because the courts are a distinctly separate institution <e> <s> it is that which has caused the difficulty <e>", "<cs> i intend to propose an amendment to this bill if i can find the right formula <e> <s> i believe it is within the scope of this bill to deal with <e>", "<cs> as matters stand at the moment i am certainly hoping that i shall have an amendment ready at report stage <e> <s> i have not yet been able to ascertain completely how difficult the drawing of the boundary line may be <e> <s> i am certainly hopeful <e> <s> i have had discussions with a number of interested people about the matter <e> <s> i shall keep in touch with the noble lord and with the noble lord lord hacking in view of the fact that he brought forward the amendment <e> <s> if my noble friend likes to ask me about it i shall be happy to say how i stand at the moment of questioning <e>", "<cs> this type of provision is not unique and i am certainly not aware that it has caused any difficulties elsewhere <e> <s> i believe that something along the lines of subsection is needed to ensure that a recommendation of the ombudsman may not be ignored by the practitioner or the professional body <e>", "<cs> as i already said there are a number of schemes in which the ombudsman has a power of this kind <e> <s> if my noble friend feels that all these can be distinguished i shall be happy to consider the matter further <e> <s> however i believe that this is a fairly general feature in ombudsman schemes <e>", "<cs>

out of the criminal courts <e> <s> that is wrong <e> <s> there is no foundation in this bill for that allegation <e>", "<cs> i shall take this amendment into account and i hope to give effect to the principle of it <e>", "<cs> amendments nos <e> <s> za and zb are the same <e> <s> i am not sure that it is necessary for primary legislation to set down for all time the method by which solicitors acquire rights of audience and rights to conduct litigation or to make a statement of the extent of those rights <e> <s> that is something that is more appropriate to the rules of the profession body concerned in this case the law society <e>", "<cs> i should have said something about it <e> <s> my understanding is that it is a rather specialised provision which has been given effect for example in the situation to which the noble lord lord hooson referred <e> <s> when one reads the section as a whole one does not regard it as doing other than recognising that in some places the old quarter session rights should be recognised if there is a scarcity of counsel <e> <s> i personally had to exercise that right in the very limited circumstances when the crown court moved from bodmin to truro <e> <s> the old rule so far as bodmin was concerned was transferred to truro <e> <s> that is the scope of the section as i understand it <e>", "<cs> i believe that there is more to the section than just that <e> <s> i have not got it in front of me at the present moment <e> <s> my reading of it suggests that it can only be used in relation to special situations <e> <s> that is the understanding i had of it <e>", "<cs> as regards legislation on this topic the present position is that authorised practitioners as provided in the act are to be certified or authorised by the lord chancellor individually <e> <s> i am furthering the policy that my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson of ewell and my noble friend lord rippon of hexham proposed by distancing myself somewhat from the approval of practitioners <e>", "<cs> as i have already explained one of the purposes of this measure is that the lord chancellor should appoint people having regard to the considerations which are mentioned in this clause of the bill <e> <s> there is no proposal that any body should nominate the members except the lord chancellor <e> <s> i have no intention whatever of appointing people who might be thought to be or might consider themselves to be delegates of anybody else <e>", "<cs> the present law restricts the right to do conveyancing <e> <s> it is on that monopoly that this provision operates <e>", "<cs> before dealing with the detail of the amendment i wish to point out that clause b imposes on the board the duty <e>", "<cs> i rise again because i wish to assure the noble lord lord evans of claughton that i do not regard this as a matter to be swept along <e> <s> i regard it as very important and i listened with great care to what he said and to what my noble friend lord boardman and others said because i agree that this matter affects ordinary people <e> <s> i started off my life in the law dealing with conveyancing transactions for people who were even more ordinary than those described by the noble lord in his submissions at least if the price of the houses is anything to go by <e>", "<cs> this clause is in part ii of the bill and the general objective of this part is described in clause which has been amended <e> <s> however in this aspect the clause remains as it was <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has also referred to amendment no <e> <s> b and i shall try to deal with both <e> <s> as regards amendment no <e> <s> a the noble lord wishes to put an obligation on the lord chancellor to publish what is in the boards report <e> <s> that is my understanding of the first amendment <e> <s> i question whether that is wise <e> <s> it is right that the lord chancellor should have a discretion to publish what the board may say but to have an obligation to do so might not be wise <e> <s> for example the board might refer to the lord chancellor the result of some form of preliminary investigation or something of that kind <e> <s> the result might well require further substantiation <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may deal with these two amendments at the same time <e> <s> my intention is that the regulations should deal with this matter by specifying the nature of the supervision that should be required <e> <s> i believe that that is the wisest course to take in this situation <e> <s> the green paper referred to this provision and the white paper developed it in quite considerable detail <e> <s> i believe that the white paper proposal is an effective method of securing supervision by a properly qualified person <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether there is some misunderstanding about this amendment <e> <s> i rely upon the standard of competence and conduct of the professions that is to say the solicitor branch the barrister branch and the licensed conveyancer branch to ensure proper standards in the performance of these conveyancing services <e> <s> there is no intention whatsoever of depriving the law society the bar council or the society of licensed conveyancers of making rules about the standard of professional conduct <e> <s> all that the provisions do that the amendment seeks to delete is to ensure that the scheme can operate making use of solicitors for example either as employees or as agents of the building societies to provide the services <e>", "<cs> the intention of the clause is to make it possible for a solicitor in private practice to provide conveyancing services for the clients of a building society <e> <s> that is the purpose of paragraph c <e> <s> paragraph b makes it possible for a member of the law society for example to be an employee of an authorised practititioner <e> <s> i believe that the two paragraphs are necessary if the scheme is to be fully effective <e>", "<cs> i see that <e> <s> that is an aspect of the matter which i would want to consider further but the regulations could cope with that <e> <s> i do not believe that it is necessary to take paragraph a out but i shall certainly look further at the matter <e> <s> that also deals with the point made by my noble friend lord renton <e>", "<cs> i intended to say that i would consider that point <e> <s> i believe that it is capable of being dealt with <e>", "<cs> i find it difficult to accept the principle of the amendment <e> <s> the board is to be given a full range of powers to deal with any authorised practitioner whose performance does not come up the mark <e> <s> we are to discuss the powers that it would have to look at what practitioners have been up to <e> <s> against that background i see no reason why the board and practitioners should be put to inconvenience and expense where there is no reason to doubt their competence <e> <s> where there is a power to impose conditions to my mind is a more direct and effective way of dealing with any problems <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to amend subsection of clause which provides that the board when making rules in respect of an application for authorisation under subsection may in particular make provision as to the form in which any application must be made and for the furnishing by applicants of information required by the board in connection with their application <e> <s> the amendment makes it mandatory rather than discretionary for the board to make such particular rules <e>", "<cs> as i have already said i fully support the idea that by one means or another clients must be protected <e> <s> that i believe is achieved in two ways <e> <s> first under clause b to which the noble lord lord mishcon has referred it is a prerequisite for authorisation that an authorised practitioner must have satisfactory arrangements in force for covering adequately the risk of any claim <e> <s> the board shall authorise a person to provide those services if it is of the opinion that the applicant will comply with the requirements mentioned in subsection <e> <s> in other words it must see that satisfactory arrangements are in place for a particular practitioner to be authorised <e> <s> that means that generally speaking the practitioner must be insured <e>", "<cs> i understand the aim of the noble lord <e> <s> the amendment if accepted would compel continuing financial surveillance by the board of authorised practitioner accounts and the handling of their clients money in a way similar to that in which the law society requires annual certificates from auditors that solicitors have complied with its clients accounts rules <e> <s> to the extent that this kind of surveillance is needed the existing powers already set out in the bill are adequate to allow regulations to impose the necessary requirements <e>", "<cs> i take also amendment no <e> <s> c to which the noble earl has spoken <e> <s> i regret that i cannot accept these amendments <e> <s> if one looks at clause one sees that the board is to consider whether the applicants business is being and is likely to continue to be carried on by fit and proper persons or in the case of an individual whether he is a fit and proper person <e> <s> the board can therefore recognise people who are fit and proper persons without any further ado <e>", "<cs> schedule paragraph gives the board the general power to regulate its own arrangements <e> <s> it will be open to the board to establish such a register <e> <s> it may well consider that in order to function effectively it will need to establish a register of those bodies or individuals that it has authorised <e> <s> however the noble lord has drawn my attention to a number of similar situations in which a statutory duty is imposed to keep such a register <e> <s> i am therefore happy to consider favourably i believe in this case this particular amendment <e>", "<cs> the powers the bill confers on the board are aimed to enable it to perform its duties of authorising and supervising practitioners in a way that is light and flexible as well as effective <e> <s> under clause b the board has a general duty to supervise the activities of authorised practitioners and by clause the board will make arrangements designed to enable it to ascertain whether authorised practitioners are complying with the regulations which the lord chancellor will make if parliament so decides <e> <s> further under clause d the board may make rules concerning transitional arrangements for dealing with any work in hand should an authorised practitioners authorisation be revoked or suspended <e> <s> those would vary according to the circumstances <e>", "<cs> it is appropriate in this arrangement for the ombudsman to have the kind of powers that are here in question <e> <s> we have endeavoured to provide in the new schedule a an amendment to deal with this matter <e> <s> my amendment no <e> <s> ya provides the opening to it <e> <s> there is then a schedule of detailed powers for the ombudsman <e>", "<cs> this board is not intended to be a mirror of the law society with its detailed powers it is under a statutory duty to make rules providing for the circumstances in which it may suspend or revoke authorisation <e> <s> it may well be and this is a point of the amendment which i should like to consider further that the board should have specific statutory powers to call for an authorised practitioners documents in order properly to carry out its supervisory and disciplinary functions <e> <s> with the noble lords agreement i intend to look into the matter and return to it at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may deal first with the point made by my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> in clause power is given that <e>", "<cs> i should not like it to be left on the nod of the head as it were in case it might be thought disrespectful to the noble lord <e> <s> i should like to make it clear that i believe it essential that the competition should be fair <e> <s> the question is how best to secure that without involving some unnecessarily elaborate procedure <e> <s> it is quite clear that among other things we shall require and i believe so far as i can judge that it is agreed by all those who have an interest in the area that the precise prices being charged should be stated <e> <s> therefore the level of charge that these authorised practitioners are making will be obvious <e> <s> i shall endeavour to ensure that there is machinery for dealing with any difficulty that might arise from that pricing being in any sense unfair <e> <s> i believe that that is the objective that the noble lord has in mind on this aspect of the matter <e>", "<cs> this is the other side of the question that we were discussing earlier <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord diamond for presenting the amendment <e> <s> his knowledge of the subject is wide but we appreciate that he has taken over the matter at short notice <e>", "<cs> i gave an explanation of the amendment when it was spoken to by the noble earl <e> <s> however for completeness i shall refer to the matter in answer to my noble friend lord coleraine <e> <s> first the general purpose of the regulation-making power is set out in clause a and b <e> <s> subsection is the actual regulation-making power and i have sought to set out the headings under which as i now see matters the regulations may be required <e>", "<cs> i suggested in the white paper that the qualified person in charge of the transaction should have a responsibility at the initial interview to explain precisely the nature of the service to be offered <e> <s> obviously the essential part of that is the preparation of the conveyancing documents but solicitors in private practice might for example give a much more ample service by giving advice on matters related to the transaction <e>", "<cs> i hope that the professional standards of those carrying out the work will be such as to enable them to communicate effectively <e> <s> they are to be solicitors licensed conveyancers or barristers and i believe that they are the most satisfactory people in whom to repose confidence on this point <e> <s> i believe that that is justified confidence <e> <s> i cannot think of anybody else upon whom i would wish the responsibility of explaining this matter to rest but a professional person with a responsibility for the transaction <e>", "<cs> parliament decided some considerable time ago that to be a licensed conveyancer is a sufficient qualification to do conveyancing <e> <s> therefore an option available here is to have licensed conveyancers in charge of the conveyancing transactions <e>", "<cs> there is at the present time in existence and there has been for some time a profession of licensed conveyancer <e> <s> if a member of the public goes to a licensed conveyancer he is entitled to an explanation of the services the licensed conveyancer can offer <e> <s> there is nothing of a dream world about that <e> <s> if he goes to a solicitor he can expect the solicitor to explain to him what services he offers <e> <s> if he wishes to make a comparison he should be able by comparing what the two professional people have told him to ascertain the difference between those services <e> <s> that is a practical matter and i have no doubt that it happens <e>", "<cs> i thought i had dealt with that matter but i shall try to do so more directly in answer to my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> strictly speaking i think it is true that if those lines were omitted i could still do what i have in mind <e> <s> as i said earlier it is right that where regulation-making power is being conferred by parliament on the lord chancellor or on anyone else for that matter the heads under which it is anticipated the power may be used should be indicated <e> <s> i believe that is part of the way in which parliament may be reasonably assured of what is in mind <e>", "<cs> my noble friend expresses exactly what i wish to achieve namely that i can make regulations under which it will be the responsibility of the professional person to tell these people in plain language what it is the professional person is prepared to do for them <e> <s> i do not imagine for one moment that the professional person at least i hope not will proceed by trying to explain the matter to the ordinary client in technical language <e> <s> the purpose of the interview is for the client to understand what is happening and what the solicitor or licensed conveyancer is to do for him <e> <s> the purpose of this clause is to enable me to make the necessary regulations <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly have in mind including in the regulations that the advice should be given in language that clients can understand <e>", "<cs> as i said the structure of the clause is that paragraphs a and b of subsection indicate the objectives which are to be secured <e> <s> i think that it is implicit in the form in which the noble lord lord mishcon has moved the amendment that he believes that this particular power would be within the scope of those objectives <e> <s> however what is in question is whether there are sufficient powers under subsection to achieve that result <e>", "<cs> as concerns the individual subsection c endeavours to give sufficient detail of what i have in mind for this purpose <e>", "<cs> that is certainly not the intention behind this <e> <s> clause c requires that the transaction should be <e>", "<cs> the purpose of these two amendments and what we have in mind is very much the same <e> <s> i have in mind that a particular individual who is qualified in accordance with the qualificaton regulations should have the overall control of a particular transaction <e> <s> i envisage that the same person should carry out all the affairs relating to that transaction <e> <s> in other words when a client enters a firms offices and gives his instructions to a mr x <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i should make it clear that i have in mind that the person to whom the client will have access is the person who is in overall control of his case and that the client is not put off in the front office as it were <e> <s> the person he sees should be the qualifed person who is in charge of the transaction <e> <s> the words overall control are intended to signify that <e> <s> obviously typists secretaries and other people will help in carrying out the transaction but the client should be able to see the qualified person who is responsible for his case and who is giving directions in it <e> <s> i shall certainly look at the provision again in the light of what has been said but that is the purpose that i was trying to serve <e>", "<cs> i regard clause b as dealing with qualifications <e> <s> clause c is intended to deal with the continuity of control <e> <s> i intend to provide that the properly qualified person should be continuously in control of a transaction and that it should not pass from one qualified person to another <e>", "<cs> clause provides that the regulations may in particular make provision designed to avoid conflicts of interest <e> <s> my noble and learned friend lord hailsham has suggested that there is an inevitable conflict of interest between the purchaser and the person from whom he borrows in order to complete the purchase <e> <s> that is the fundamental point made by my noble and learned friend <e>", "<cs> the noble lord intervenes as i am seeking to develop the point <e> <s> the point is that the noble lord must therefore conclude if solicitors do that and however they come to do it that in relation to the actual conveyancing which is the subject of the statutory monopoly under section of the solicitors act there is no conflict of interest in the cases in which the independent solicitor acts for both sides that is both for the lender and for the borrower <e> <s> he must accept that that is so otherwise the profession would not tolerate that for a moment <e>", "<cs> i understand that point and i shall endeavour to come to it <e> <s> however at present i am dealing with the situation of a solicitor <e> <s> in practice according to the national consumer council surveys the majority of those who go to solicitors for their conveyancing neither ask for nor are given independent financial advice <e>", "<cs> as regards the last point i am not exactly sure on what it is based <e>", "<cs> that is a somewhat different point <e> <s> it might well be a point against having licensed conveyancers authorised to do conveyancing <e> <s> the law has already dealt with that <e> <s> one may now go to an independent licensed conveyancer under the solicitors act and perfectly lawfully he may provide the conveyancing services <e> <s> i suggest to my noble and learned friend that obviously the best service you can get is the best service for you <e> <s> as regards the question of the advice you ask for that is one matter but deciding to which person you go to get that advice depends on the advice that you wish to receive <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> i was wondering about the basis <e>", "<cs> we are dealing with a conflict of interest <e> <s> how far a solicitor serves a clients interests is another matter <e> <s> assuming the building societies take on the service that service will be defined and quite extensive if it is to be successful <e> <s> the precise service as regards the conveyancing monopoly is defined by that monopoly <e> <s> there is nothing to prevent a building societys solicitor giving services over and above those covered by the monopoly if the building society wishes to make such an arrangement <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the interview is in order that a decision may be come to as to whether the client will be offered conveyancing services by the institution <e> <s> it is an interview with qualified persons a solicitor or licensed conveyancer governed by the professional standards of his or her profession <e> <s> that is the purpose of it <e> <s> of course the intention is that it will be free in the sense that it will not be determined until it is finished whether or not there should be a transaction on the conveyancing side at all <e>", "<cs> both in the green paper and in carrying the matter through it has been my view that something of that kind is required in the regulations <e> <s> i believe that the powers that the bill confers are sufficient to enable that to be done <e> <s> i certainly have every intention of including a requirement on those lines in the regulations <e>", "<cs> paragraph f which is the last paragraph of subsection provides that the regulations may deal with the handling by authorised practitioners of their clients money and it will be possible for regulations to be made on the lines of these amendments if that is what seems to be required after full consultation <e>", "<cs> a power to make arrangements along these lines is already indicated as it were as a particular in subsection e <e> <s> this is a matter on which i should certainly wish to consult in detail because there are many detailed matters that would have to be dealt with in relation to this area if it were to be the subject of regulations <e> <s> the noble lord may therefore take it that i shall have this very much in mind as a matter to be considered in relation to the reglations <e> <s> i shall undertake full consultation upon them when they are drawn <e>", "<cs> i have the question very much in mind and in that sense i am looking at it <e> <s> i propose to make it necessary to separate out the cost of each item and each part of any services which a building society for example may offer <e> <s> that may well be a way of dealing with this point <e> <s> i shall certainly keep in mind all that the noble lord said <e> <s> as i observed there will be full consultation on this matter as we draft the regulations <e>", "<cs> i doubt very much whether it would be possible to produce the draft regulations at this stage <e> <s> i feel that we must try to get right first the primary legislation <e> <s> certainly i undertake to have full consultation about the principle <e> <s> also these regulations would come under the affirmative resolution procedure <e>", "<cs> i have said as much as i reasonably can at this juncture <e>", "<cs> as i explained earlier the provisions of subsection b make it appropriate to prescribe the nature of the qualifications that are to be required <e> <s> one would take the qualifications in relation to solicitors on the basis of the law societys statutory requirements <e> <s> accordingly the powers properly to prescribe qualifications are already contained in the bill <e> <s> therefore i hope that the noble lord will consider that the amendment is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> i agree entirely with what my noble and learned friend has said <e> <s> primarily the question must be settled in the legislation dealing with solicitors <e> <s> however the prescribing powers enable me to follow that in prescription under the bill <e>", "<cs> i intend to have wide consultation as regards making regulations under the clause <e> <s> all the interests referred to in the amendment would be among those to be consulted <e> <s> the advisory committee has no specially important role but we should wish to have its views as well as those of the governing bodies of the bar the law society notaries and licensed conveyancers <e>", "<cs> i have endeavoured to do that in so far as i possibly can in relation to the various matters raised <e> <s> the white paper sets out the thinking as far as it was developed at that stage in relation to regulations <e>", "<cs> certainly i am willing to look at the matter raised by the noble lord <e> <s> we thought it right to set out those powers and of course compensation is a wide word <e> <s> however i shall certainly consider what the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is speaking on clause stand part <e> <s> the question is whether the director general of fair trading should have a part in this matter <e> <s> my noble friend knows that the statutory provisions arising out of competition law have been applied to the professions before <e> <s> it is not a new thing <e> <s> for example in the past the monopolies and mergers commission has had to inquire into certain rules of the legal profession <e>", "<cs> all i can say is that i was vice-dean of the faculty of advocates when we had our first passage of arms with the director general of fair trading <e> <s> i did not object to his jurisdiction on account of his name <e> <s> i was not particularly happy with some of the issues that he was seeking to pursue but we nevertheless had an inquiry <e> <s> no doubt when the fair trading legislation is considered and if there is any question of how appropriate his title is to his functions that can be considered <e> <s> we are dealing with a statutory officer and that is the description of his function <e> <s> that function has a bearing on aspects of professional life <e>", "<cs> i do not profess expertise in the practical effects of competition law <e> <s> that is the responsibility of the director general <e> <s> i can only answer that question in relation to a particular case in the light of his advice <e> <s> that is why we have these provisions for taking his advice <e> <s> if the decision in relation to the approval of regulations is to have final authority it is right that competition matters should be taken into account before the final decision is taken <e> <s> that is the purpose and i believe it is an appropriate purpose <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will feel that it is appropriate <e>", "<cs> whatever may be the superficial attraction of this new clause i suggest that it should not form part of the bill <e> <s> its origin lies in concern that the conveyancing activities of authorised practitioners might lead to a decline in the provision of legal aid services <e> <s> although i do not agree that there is real foundation for that fear i doubt both the practicality of the new clause and whether it can serve any useful purpose <e> <s> it will certainly be very difficult at the very least in the time-scale provided for to determine the exact impact of any one factor on the general availability of legal aid services <e> <s> indeed i am seeking to make some investigations at present in another connection in relation to the spread or distribution of these services <e>", "<cs> certainly i welcome the information that is given to me by the law society from time to time in particular in relation to any matters touching the concerns that the noble lord has expressed and certainly the same for the national consumer council <e> <s> the national consumer council has i think taken the view that what we are doing here in the general pattern of it is the right way forward <e> <s> that is a view that has affected my own thinking about what we ought to do <e>", "<cs> i consider that one must have regard to whether or not it is necessary to establish a boards authority in relation to the system or authorisation in respect of probate practitioners <e> <s> so far as banks and insurance companies are concerned many of whom already undertake trust corporation business we are merely extending to them the right to prepare applications for probate and letters of administration <e> <s> banks and insurance companies are already subject to authorisations under statute and are prudentially regulated <e> <s> although building societies do not at present undertake trust corporation work it seemed reasonable to include them in the list of those who might as they too are regulated in such a way that one could presume they were fit and proper organisations <e>", "<cs> it is the same sort of matter that we dealt with previously in relation to another part of the bill <e> <s> the existing power is really sufficient to enable proper regulation to be made <e> <s> of course it has the effect of ensuring that the regulations may be amended from time to time in the light of experience <e> <s> therefore they can be improved if any loophole or defect turned out to be present in existing regulations <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will take it that i shall consider carefully what should be done but that he will also bear in mind that i believe that the ordinary drafting mechanism of the word may is adequate for this purpose <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord boardman will see that clause a which substitutes a new section in the solicitors act provides that <e>", "<cs> i am happy to consider this amendment perhaps i should say favourably in the sense that we may be able to do something in the direction which the noble lord has in mind <e>", "<cs> this depends on whether the board has any jurisdiction in this area <e> <s> as i indicated in answer to the noble lord lord prys-davies so far i am not persuaded that it is desirable to extend the conveyancing boards functions into this area <e> <s> therefore it follows that the amendment would go out of this jurisdiction along with the board <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may take this opportunity of the question having been posed to thank the noble lord lord mishcon for the kind remarks he made about me a few moments ago <e> <s> i am extremely grateful for them and i reciprocate them in regard to all members of the committee who have shown such patience in remaining with us until this time of night <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation is that the long title of the bill is <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord wishes to move an amendment to the long title we shall have to have a committee stage <e> <s> i take it that the noble lord has objected <e> <s> therefore the house must resolve itself into a committee on the bill <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> on these amendments there is a good deal to be said for the views that the noble lord lord hacking has put before the committee <e> <s> i have felt on balance that since the risk of uncertainty would fall on the lawyer making the agreement it would be highly likely that he would normally protect himself by reducing the agreement to writing <e> <s> however in view of the fact that the noble lord has put the matter forward i am very happy to consider it further <e> <s> so far as i can see there is little difficulty <e> <s> if the noble lord will allow me therefore i should like to consider the matter <e>", "<cs> i too am anxious not to pre-empt the main debate on clause stand part <e> <s> however in the light of the consultation which we held on this matter i concluded that the correct principle was that the legal profession should be able to take on conditional fee arrangements conditional on the success of the case but also conditional on the principle that the remuneration should be related to the work done <e>", "<cs> i believe in the doctrine of justification by faith alone and in the doctrine of original sin <e> <s> i also believe that faith without works is dead being alone and therefore that the faith which is important is that which manifests itself in the way that people conduct themselves in their daily lives <e>", "<cs> i hope that i have said nothing that suggests the contrary <e> <s> that is precisely what i am getting at <e> <s> an agreement under which the lawyer is paid if he succeeds is an agreement which may be lawful <e> <s> the detailed rules about it would certainly be capable of being dealt with by professional bodies <e> <s> there is nothing outlawing the nature of the rules that they can make <e>", "<cs> the accurate position is that they are unenforceable by reason of their quality <e> <s> that is to say the law does not regard them as allowable and therefore they are unenforceable agreements <e> <s> that is my understanding of the position on the basis that public policy is against them <e> <s> it is quite difficult to have such a public policy which is the policy of the legislature of the united kingdom which allows them in one jurisdiction but not in another <e>", "<cs> the provision would apply to those who have been afforded rights of audience under the machinery that is set out in the earlier clauses including the right to conduct litigation <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the scottish situation is that an agreement such as has been described is not unlawful and is enforceable <e>", "<cs> that is a different point from that with which i was dealing when i spoke <e> <s> my noble and learned friend now makes the point that such an arrangement could give rise to blackmail <e> <s> i do not accept that <e> <s> i believe that the arrangement would include the requirement with <e>", "<cs> i certainly agree with the principle of the amendment <e> <s> i am perfectly content with the amendment as it stands subject to any later drafting which the draftsman may suggest <e> <s> however i am now prepared to accept it as it stands <e>", "<cs> that is why i indicated that i am perfectly content with the principle that the availability of a conditional fee agreement in no way affects eligibility for legal aid <e> <s> i hope that i made absolutely plain what i have in mind that whatever the eligibility limits the agreement would be available over and above eligibility for legal aid <e>", "<cs> certainly not <e> <s> the legal aid act makes provision for those of poor or moderate means <e> <s> i do not believe for one moment that this would be an appropriate answer to legal aid <e> <s> this is an additional provision over and above legal aid <e> <s> i believe that it is right to make possible that agreement under such conditions as thought appropriate by the bodies regulating rights of audience and rights to conduct litigation <e>", "<cs> i said earlier that i accepted this amendment subject to any question which may be raised by the draftsman as regards the precise wording <e> <s> i shall take into account what my noble friend lord renton said <e> <s> i believe that that is the best way to proceed <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord mishcon will be quite happy that we should seek to meet those difficulties so long as the principle is accepted <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend may take it that in contemplating regulations of this kind i should certainly wish to take the mind of the lord chief justice as well as the other heads of division <e> <s> the purpose of this clause however is to mirror as between the constituent law districts of the united kingdom the rules made for the european jurisdiction <e> <s> these are made under directives as my noble and learned friend knows and the lord chief justice is not directly concerned in that procedure though his views would necessarily be important <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to say that i am not absolutely clear precisely what it is the noble lord seeks to achieve by this amendment <e> <s> the proposal is that a scottish advocate will have rights of audience in england for example on the same <e>", "<cs> that is one of the difficulties the clause has to deal with <e> <s> i seek to mirror the arrangements that we have so far as the ec is concerned <e> <s> to take the example of my noble friend there might be difficulty in the idea that a scottish solicitor should come to england and have a right of audience in a court here where no english solicitor had a right of audience <e> <s> we are trying to cope with that situation by allowing us to have the capacity to prescribe rather than making it completely automatic <e> <s> these directives are difficult to apply across the nations at the moment and we simply want to achieve a similar result so that a scots person should not be able to say that in england he has fewer rights than a frenchman or german in similar situations <e> <s> conversely an englishman going to scotland would have no fewer rights than a corresponding frenchman or german would have in the same situation <e>", "<cs> i accept this amendment in principle <e> <s> there is a slight problem concerning the consequent drafting <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend will allow me to make the corresponding alteration in terms that the draftsman would wish <e> <s> i do not believe that this particular clause is inconsistent with the undertaking that i gave in the white paper to make regulations which will ensure that united kingdom lawyers have rights to practise in other parts of the kingdom at least equivalent to those available to lawyers from other ec countries <e> <s> but the clause as drafted goes further in making provision for such cross-border practice than the service directive does with regard to inter-state practice <e> <s> that was not my original intention and for that reason i am prepared to accept this amendment in principle <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to know that my noble friend favours this clause <e> <s> perhaps as we go forward he will find others that he may favour <e> <s> i understand the point made by my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale and i have sought to explain before that i give this kind of detail in order to try and give notice of what is in mind <e> <s> he is correct that at present the regulation-making power is subject to the negative resolution procedure <e> <s> no doubt we can consider later whether that is appropriate <e> <s> the idea is to give effect to the principle of directives <e> <s> that was the reason for it <e> <s> i hope that the committee will approve the clause <e>", "<cs> there is a fairly strong view that a rule of law prevents a barrister as such from entering into a contract with his client for the provision of his services as a barrister <e> <s> that prevents him from among other things suing for any fee that may have been arranged in advance <e> <s> if there is such a rule i have sought in this clause to take it away but make it absolutely clear that the general council of the bar can regulate any matter in this connection <e> <s> it is therefore entirely open to the general council of the bar to make any rules it wishes about it <e>", "<cs> the clause applies only to barristers and no one else <e> <s> so far as i know such a rule applies only to barristers <e> <s> therefore there is no bumpy or exceptional playing field <e> <s> the general council of the bar is the professional body having full authority over every person covered by the clause <e> <s> so there is nothing in the clause to oblige or enable a barrister to have direct access with a lay client in the crown court if the general council of the bar prohibits it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> the whole idea of the clause is to preserve subsection <e> <s> subsection merely gives the additional right to barristers over and above what they have at present if a rule of law such as the clause deals with exists <e> <s> i shall consider whether we need to make the point plain <e> <s> i had taken it that client would include the lay client <e> <s> i shall take advice as to whether we can clarify the point <e>", "<cs> the purpose of this clause is to apply the existing rule of law only to advocates whether they be barristers or solicitors or persons who act as advocates under clause <e> <s> it is the existing rule of law only that is being applied because we have defined the immunity rule as any rule of law which confers immunity from liability for negligence in respect of any act of omission <e> <s> so in order to find out what the immunity is one has to go to the existing law which tells one what it is <e> <s> there are cases in which the stage at which the immunity applies has been determined <e> <s> i have no wish whatever to disturb those or enter into an attempt to define what they say <e> <s> therefore i have used the expression the immunity rule as referring to the existing law <e> <s> i hope that that is reasonably plain <e>", "<cs> i believe i started with that point <e> <s> i started by saying that the rule of law is the immunity rule which exists at the moment <e> <s> the question of where the immunity starts in relation to a particular matter has already been decided <e> <s> i do not wish to reopen that question <e> <s> it is necessary to cover the matter of contemplated proceedings because the question may arise of how far along the road the matter has gone <e> <s> that is why we use the phrase contemplated proceedings <e> <s> i am using it solely to make it clear that we are not making any change to the existing law and that that law continues as it was <e>", "<cs> the measure would not apply in those circumstances for the reason that they do not come within the immunity rule which is referred to in clause <e> <s> the immunity rule would not cover those matters and therefore nothing in any of the other clauses extends the immunity rule <e> <s> it simply gives the subject matter to which the immunity rule may apply <e> <s> however as the immunity rule does not cover the matters the noble lord referred to nothing else brings it in <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly consider the matter <e> <s> i have sometimes found that non-lawyers in this chamber find it easier to understand what i intend in the clauses than some of those who are not laymen <e> <s> however i shall take account of what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> i have considered carefully whether i should attempt to restate the immunity rule <e> <s> having studied the cases i have concluded that that would be rather unwise <e> <s> therefore i thought it best to take the rule as it stands and allow the judges to develop it not attempting to formulate or reformulate it in any way <e> <s> however i shall certainly consider whether anything can be done to eliminate <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i understand the spirit in which the amendment has been put forward <e> <s> however i take the same attitude to it as i took to the amendment dealing with the cab rank principle <e> <s> these are matters that are best dealt with in considerable detail in the rules that will be set out for dealing with them when they arise <e> <s> the point which the noble lord lord meston made about the rule shows that the details need to be worked out closely <e> <s> i should have thought this was one of the considerations that it would be right for the profession the designated judges and the lord chancellor to have in mind when considering the report and the advice of the advisory committee <e> <s> that committee should be asked to comment on it <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect to my noble friend it is not a nonsensical situation at all <e> <s> the present law prohibits the law society and i take that first from allowing partnerships with anyone who is not a solicitor <e> <s> of course that includes lawyers in other countries <e> <s> therefore the existing law makes impossible having a partnership between for example a firm in london and those who practise the law in france or germany <e>", "<cs> certainly the only point is whether it is right to exclude altogether any question of this sort <e> <s> the law society being empowered to make the rules and this is what i intend any question of that kind is left for any legislation which may follow <e> <s> however as regards present law it appears to me entirely right that the law society should have complete freedom in this area and that it should be able to make the rules it thinks right in the light of its consideration of these matters <e>", "<cs> i do not wish unduly to enter into this conversation except to say that i do not know whether my noble and learned friend the master of the rolls exactly stated my position <e> <s> a number of problems are associated with it which i do not think it appropriate to go into at this juncture <e> <s> in my view it is right that we should give this power to the law society and that we should not attempt to deal with what may or may not arise under legislation which has not come forward and which ought to be dealt with as it arises <e> <s> it appears to me to be right to leave the matter as one which is no longer a matter of statutory prohibition but one for the law society and the general council of the bar <e>", "<cs> i would not wish to accept this amendment <e> <s> the machinery that has been set up in the earlier part of the bill for dealing with rights of audience and right to conduct litigation is one under which the designated judges and the lord chancellor will have to approve the rules before they become effective <e> <s> if that is done then the rules according to the department of trade and industrys white paper would not be challenged under the legislation that is being adumbrated in that paper <e>", "<cs> i have not got all the legislation in front of me but my understanding of the situation is that the general rule with which we are dealing here prevents unincorporated associations <e> <s> if we take that away we must replace it by giving the law society a power to prohibit <e>", "<cs> the matter is one on which i seek to achieve a good way forward <e> <s> i have the matter in hand <e> <s> the companies act is the responsibility of the secretary of state for trade and industry <e> <s> however i believe that we shall be able to find a way of dealing with the mater <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will feel able to leave it at that <e> <s> i hope that the committee will allow the clause to stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> the new machinery provided in the bill is intended to deal with the right to conduct litigation and rights of audience <e> <s> it is appropriate that it should deal with those aspects of solicitors practice but there is no cause to alter the arrangements that have stood the test of time in the balance of the situation <e> <s> that is the way in which the matter has been approached from the time of the white paper onwards <e>", "<cs> the general route that we have proposed is that a right of audience in a court held for a sufficient time confers the necessary qualification to be a judge of that court <e> <s> so far as concerns solicitors and others who have been judges in a court below service in the court below will also be a qualification <e> <s> that could result in solicitors reaching the high court bench much more quickly than in the kind of period mentioned by the noble lord again obviously subject to a suitable candidate <e> <s> none of these is more than a qualification <e> <s> it does not at all mean that anyone with the qualification would necessarily be a suitable person <e>", "<cs> on transitional provisions i certainly have in mind that we may need to consider exactly how that would be achieved <e> <s> but i have endeavoured to set out the criteria on rights of audience <e> <s> not every person who has a right of audience is necessarily a great advocate <e> <s> but many who have acquired rights of audience in the past have turned out to be extremely good judges <e> <s> i believe it to be a reasonable criterion to apply along with the criterion of service in a lower court <e> <s> at the moment as the noble lord knows a circuit judge of great distinction is not eligible for appointment to the high court bench if by chance he came from the solicitors branch of the profession <e> <s> that we are seeking to remove <e> <s> it is an avenue of importance <e> <s> i believe it is right to go forward in this way <e>", "<cs> the general qualification that applies at present to many judicial offices is of being for example a solicitor with a certain number of years standing <e> <s> there is no qualification in quite a number of these instances in respect of any particular experience though for solicitors there is presently a requirement to serve as recorder for a certain time <e> <s> but the basic qualification is the first matter <e>", "<cs> i have sought to explain that we have put forward a system which depends on <e>", "<cs> the circumstances differ in some respects <e> <s> the most important difference is that the arrangements here for the enlargement of rights of audience are a good deal more elaborate than the arrangements which are provided in scotland although the safeguards are very much the same <e> <s> the principles which we have adopted are the same as those which underlie the scottish legislation <e>", "<cs> a supreme court qualification means that a person has a right of audience in relation to all proceedings in the supreme court that would be a sufficient qualification <e> <s> if a person were a barrister under the present arrangement he would have the right of audience in relation to all proceedings in the supreme court and be eligible <e> <s> the noble lord was suggesting that many people who are presently high court judges would not be qualified <e> <s> however that is not correct on the basis that i have just explained to him <e> <s> the idea is that if a person had purely a high court qualification in the future he would not be eligible by reason of that alone to sit as a supreme court judge in the crown court <e>", "<cs> the answer on this point depends whether he has <e>", "<cs> that is technically the position at the present moment <e>", "<cs> the persons who are qualified under the schedule to be lords of appeal in ordinary are those who have a right of audience in relation to all proceedings in the supreme court <e> <s> i submit that having regard to the safeguards which are required in that respect a person with supreme court qualifications is indeed appropriate to be regarded as being eligible for appointment to the highest tribunal in the land as someone who has been regarded in terms of the qualifications which have been approved by the senior judiciary and the lord chancellor as having a right of audience in the supreme court <e>", "<cs> with great respect i do not accept that they would not have sufficient qualification in law to be properly regarded as advocates in all branches of the supreme court <e> <s> whether one calls them a barrister or a solicitor is not the issue <e> <s> the question is whether they have the qualifications that are required under the regulations approved by the senior judiciary and the lord chancellor to appear in the supreme court in all its aspects <e>", "<cs> the short answer is that when one mentions a barrister to some people abroad they do not know exactly what he is <e> <s> i have no doubt that many do but not everyone does <e> <s> it is perfectly reasonable to ask what lord x was to which the reply might be that he was a distinguished and qualified supreme court advocate for years <e> <s> i should have thought that that was a perfectly reasonable answer which would satisfy the intelligent and inquiring observer <e>", "<cs> i did not say that <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord has to turn what i said to something else <e> <s> i said that some people abroad do not know what a barrister is <e> <s> i have met some people who did not know what an advocate was that was my professional qualification <e> <s> i certainly did not indicate that the ordinary person did not know what a barrister was <e> <s> i should have thought that a supreme court advocate was a perfectly reasonable and intelligible description <e>", "<cs> the situation is that obviously if there were to be any change in the circuits the lord chief justice would be consulted and so of course would the other heads of division because they too would have an interest in this matter since the circuits also deal and i hope will deal even more with specialist work not only in the south-eastern circuit in the royal courts of justice <e> <s> the situation is that if there were to be any changes in the circuits a great deal of consultation would require to be held with others the local law societies the bar the circuit leaders and so on <e>", "<cs> the intention of the noble lord lord meston and the intention that i have are the same <e> <s> clause states <e>", "<cs> the history of the matter is that the civil justice review suggested that the title registrar was open to misconstruction and that people were treating the registrars who are holders of judicial office as though they were the same as the people who dealt with births marriages and deaths <e> <s> that shows that sometimes even the present nomenclature is not beyond some ambiguity <e> <s> the civil justice review recommended that the title registrar should be changed to a title incorporating the word judge <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for raising this matter <e> <s> i regret that it is most unlikely that i will be able to deal with it before report stage in any comprehensive way <e> <s> i propose to say something about the matter in answer to the amendments that my noble friend lord coleraine has tabled <e> <s> they raise the same sort of issue <e> <s> if my noble and learned friend can wait until then i shall avoid repeating myself <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i have sought to bring forward in clauses and and schedule the necessary amendments to the judicial pensions schemes which are generally speaking in primary legislation to bring them into line with the requirements of the social security acts of and <e> <s> the judicial pensions schemes are extremely complicated as anyone who has tried to understand them knows <e> <s> they carry a good number of difficulties for those who have to try to make out their rights under them <e>", "<cs> as i have said the first thing to do is to think out what the scheme should be which is an onerous task as i am sure my noble friend appreciates <e> <s> anything to do with pension schemes is complicated and this one is particularly <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble and learned friend for giving us the opinion of my noble and learned friend lord goff of chieveley and to the noble lord lord byron for raising the matter <e> <s> i can see the attraction of what the noble lord has suggested <e> <s> the course i propose to take is that i should have an opportunity of consulting the departmental advisory committee on arbitration <e> <s> depending on its attitude to the matter we might be able to deal with the point during the course of the bill <e> <s> if there is great difficulty about it we should have to leave it over <e> <s> if the noble lord would care to leave it with me on that basis i undertake to bring it to the committees attention and see what its attitude to the matter is <e>", "<cs> i shall do that if i possibly can <e>", "<cs> that demonstrates the wisdom of the formula i was going to use <e> <s> i accept this amendment in principle <e> <s> i shall check with the draftsman on its detail and hope to include it in an acceptable form to all of us on report <e>", "<cs> in principle i accept the view that the provision ought to apply to a counterclaim <e> <s> i should like to check to be sure whether or not the amendment is necessary in that respect <e>", "<cs> the amendment that my noble and learned friend has proposed is a very interesting solution to the problem of delay <e> <s> i know that the rules set out by this chamber in its judicial capacity have proved to be somewhat difficult in application in the day-to-day work of dealing with these matters <e>", "<cs> i believe that there are quite important practical problems although i see the force of the noble lords amendment <e> <s> i am happy to consider it <e> <s> i think it may be difficult to have adequate consultation on this very quickly but i shall see what can be done if the noble lord is prepared to leave it on that basis <e>", "<cs> these amendments are not necessary because of the existing general law <e> <s> under the law of property act as applied in the interpretation act the definition of land already includes buildings and other structures <e> <s> in this context and in this clause it is therefore unnecessary to require the addition of the words and buildings <e> <s> i believe that to be the position <e> <s> if the noble earl will be kind enough to check this for himself perhaps in the meantime he will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i believe that the word condition includes any condition whether express or implied written or oral <e> <s> i refer to amendments nos <e> <s> j and k <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for the suggestion in the amendment <e> <s> if he will allow me i should like to consider it carefully <e> <s> this is a difficult area in which to operate <e> <s> the building societies act has a provision like this but i am <e>", "<cs> the idea of the clause is to provide customer protection against tying in so that the customer can insist that each service involved in a transaction should be priced separately and be available separately <e> <s> separate pricing enables the customer to choose which services if any he wants and discourages the person offering the services from offering them at a loss <e> <s> separate pricing is achieved by clause <e> <s> the amendment seeks to discourage lenders from offering a package of services to a customer at a discount <e> <s> at first sight that does not appear to be in the interests of the customer or client <e>", "<cs> the line that the noble lord has suggested on the earlier amendments might make it unnecessary to pursue amendment no <e> <s> la <e> <s> the amendment which defines services to include <e>", "<cs> the clause only requires that it cannot be made a condition of accepting one service that somebody must accept some other service from the nominated person if i understood the suggestion of the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> certainly that will do for a summary <e> <s> one does not have to do that unless one wishes <e> <s> a person is free to take one service by itself or two or more depending on what he wants <e>", "<cs> there is no difference between us on intention <e> <s> i intend to include all these people and we believe that we may have done so <e> <s> but if there is doubt about it perhaps my noble friend will be kind enough in due course not at the moment to tell me the detail of the doubts and i shall take them up with the draftsman <e> <s> the intention is quite plain that the various persons he has mentioned all of whom are justices of the peace in some shape or form should be included in the protection <e>", "<cs> clause implements the recommendation of the civil justice review that for the purposes of the limitation act an action should be brought at the time when process is served <e> <s> that is one of a number of proposals designed to reduce pre-trial delay particularly in personal injury cases with which the review was principally concerned <e> <s> a related procedural change which will come into effect by rules of court on st june this year will reduce from to four months the maximum permitted interval between issue and service of process <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly consider the matter <e>", "<cs> i agree with my noble and learned friend in so far as the matter is intended to deal with disciplinary powers as it were over legal representatives <e> <s> that is the power which preserves the inherent jurisdiction of the supreme court over solicitors as provided in section of the solicitors act <e> <s> but the idea behind this clause is to provide in the magistrates court a power parallel to that in the high court under rule of order of the rules of the supreme court deriving from section of the supreme court act and by extension the county courts which itself is to be re-enacted in the form of clause of this bill <e> <s> so there is a distinction between those two types of power and i believe that that is a proper distinction <e>", "<cs> i endeavoured to suggest that this wording came from order rule and that that wording is reflected in this clause <e> <s> the wording to which the noble lord referred relates to the exercise of the courts powers as preserved by secton of the solicitors act <e>", "<cs> the effect of this clause would be to have the payment made out of central funds if i have understood the objective correctly <e>", "<cs> that is a considerable novelty <e> <s> i find it hard to see why central funds should be involved in matters that arise between parties <e> <s> there is a different question in relation to such disciplinary provisions as section of the solicitors act <e> <s> as a result of a request from one of my judicial colleagues i am presently considering what can be done about that because it is in the nature of a disciplinary provision <e>", "<cs> there may be a question of costs against the other party but at present i see no justification for the public purse incurring the cost of what has occurred <e>", "<cs> fairly fundamental questions are involved <e> <s> at one level it is the consequence of a judicial act that has produced the costs <e> <s> normally public funds do not bear such costs otherwise there would be a large demand on public funds <e> <s> therefore substantial difficulties stand in the way of making awards in this area out of public funds <e> <s> for that reason i wanted to be sure that that was precisely what the noble lord had in mind <e> <s> i understand from him that it was <e> <s> in those circumstances i have great difficulty in giving effect to the amendment <e>", "<cs> when i first spoke on this i indicated that at the invitation of one of my judicial colleagues i was considering the question of section costs <e> <s> i have not yet completed that <e> <s> therefore if it can be called a benefit the noble lord will have the benefit of the same consideration <e>", "<cs> that point of principle remains and presumably that is what we will discuss on clause stand part <e> <s> the purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the director himself can give instructions to the people who will handle the bail applications if this clause is allowed to stand part of the bill <e> <s> therefore he can give instructions to which they must conform <e> <s> the result of that is not to make it any less objectionable from the point of view of the noble lord <e> <s> we shall argue about that on clause stand part <e>", "<cs> i should not like it to be thought that simply because the bar council and the law society had taken a particular view that that necessarily was a view that ought to prevail <e>", "<cs> i did indeed <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down i should say that i am willing to consider for affirmative resolution procedure the subject matters that he has raised <e> <s> clause is the one which we discussed in relation to clause <e> <s> i indicated then that i would endeavour to make it clear what i was seeking to say <e> <s> i know that my noble and learned friend does not agree with me <e> <s> he said that although i said it thrice i had not persuaded him <e> <s> i am sorry that i said it thrice if i did not have that effect <e> <s> i intend to deal with that point <e> <s> i am minded to delete clause in the light of the considerations brought forward by my noble and learned friend <e> <s> clause and are in much the same position as clause and <e> <s> so far as the rule-making powers for conditional fees and the rights of scottish and northern ireland lawyers are concerned i am content that the basic rule should be under the affirmative resolution procedure <e> <s> the only matter about which i am a little concerned perhaps my noble and learned friend will allow me to consider it is whether all the regulations under clause require to be dealt in that way <e>", "<cs> i am appreciative of the length of time for which my noble friends and my noble and learned friends have waited to put their point <e> <s> i am disposed to do everything that i possibly can to meet what they have said <e> <s> in the circumstances agreeing with my noble friend lord rippon is perhaps the least that i can do <e> <s> i understand the concerns and while i am not sure that i entirely accept his description of the amendments where the power to amend primary legislation is conferred even in a limited sense i shall see that the affirmative resolution procedure is followed <e>", "<cs> i entirely go along with the point of view that the mere fact that we are seeking to increase choice which is what this bill is about is not to be taken as a cost-cutting exercise so far as concerns legal aid <e> <s> i am also anxious to preserve the point that the level of representation appropriate to a particular case is something that the legal aid board has statutory responsibility for already and of course the judges also have in criminal matters a power in this situation to say at what level representation should be <e>", "<cs> i should like to read carefully what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i believe there is not very much between us and that we should be able to reach a form of words which accurately reflects what we wish <e> <s> in any case i should like to try to deal with the question of the other authorised litigators and advocates under the new framework in relation to legal aid <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will be kind enough to allow me time to consider that matter and i shall see whether we can achieve a form of words to which we can both agree <e>", "<cs> the fundamental section is section of the supreme court act <e> <s> the provision in the prosecution of offences act uses that section <e>", "<cs> i see that <e> <s> i agree that the provisions of the second practice direction about appeals to the crown court from magistrates courts in civil proceedings and in criminal proceedings in the crown court in some cases where the same firm appeared in the magistrates courts are fairly general <e> <s> they are based on the circumstances that the solicitor appeared in the magistrates court <e> <s> in that way they are somewhat special <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord kilbracken has kindly drawn attention to this question in order to focus on for example the provision in clause <e> <s> the noble baroness lady phillips asked what is involved <e> <s> i cannot make it plainer than to say that what is involved is a live embryo other than a human embryo for example some form of animal embryo <e> <s> this makes it quite clear that no person shall place in a woman a live embryo other than a human embryo <e> <s> that is the purpose involved here <e> <s> the noble baroness may feel that that is so extraordinary that it should not be prohibited but extraordinary things can happen and therefore it is wise to make the prohibition <e>", "<cs> while i believe that if this amendment were passed it would not affect the definition in the sense of altering its meaning what is proposed to be cut out contains words of explanation which are important for ordinary people and that includes myself understanding exactly what is involved here <e>", "<cs> it might perhaps be convenient if i indicate a view upon this matter not seeking in any way to restrict discussion on it but in order to indicate the position which i shall take with regard to it <e>", "<cs> in saying that i recognise the fear of many members of the committee that the definition of embryo in clause may if the vote on clause goes against research leave uncontrolled any research on <e>", "<cs> the government have not included a definition of research in the bill because they believe that for the purpose of the bill it is not necessary and indeed is undesirable to do so <e> <s> we have the feeling that the word research is probably as clear as any substitution for it <e> <s> the same is true of experiment <e>", "<cs> i understand the purpose for which my noble friend has moved the amendment but with great respect i question whether it assists the definition of treatment services as <e>", "<cs> it is important to notice the emphasis on the words provided for <e> <s> the bill states <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry that my efforts to assist have only created more difficulty for the noble lord lord stallard <e> <s> perhaps i can have another try <e> <s> he wants to make this specific <e> <s> of course there are different matters which one wants to make specific <e> <s> i rather suspect that what is wanted by my noble friend who moved the amendment is something which makes it clear that treatment services will not enable research to be carried on if research is prohibited under the name of treatment <e> <s> i believe that that is the point which my noble friend is making <e> <s> i cannot see how it helps to specify in relation to a particular woman <e> <s> that is the wrong kind of specification <e> <s> the specification required should be directed at what is included in treatment <e> <s> as i said earlier that is why i believe that the phrase provided for is important <e>", "<cs> my noble friend the duke of norfolk made it plain that he wishes the test of research or the test of something that is not research to be the purpose of assisting either the embryo itself or its development <e> <s> that is exactly the emphasis that this definition has that the treatment services are to be provided for the purpose of assisting women and not for anything else <e> <s> they are to assist women to carry children <e>", "<cs> i should like to make clear from the outset that i shall listen to everything that is said take account of concerns and seek to meet them <e> <s> all i seek to point out at this stage is that the suggestion made in this amendment does not appear to be directed effectively to meeting the concerns which prompted it <e> <s> i shall certainly consider whether those concerns can be met in some other way as we proceed <e> <s> i am not sure that this discussion has so <e>", "<cs> when this bill was drafted our information was exactly the same as that of my noble friend the duke of norfolk namely that cryopreservation was the only method of keeping that was available <e> <s> we have used the word keeping in the bill to accommodate any development of other methods of keeping that might arise <e> <s> we want to make clear that the only one we knew of was cryopreservation <e> <s> however no harm is done by making clear the intention that any other method of keeping is covered <e> <s> it is entirely in line with the spirit of clause and therefore as my noble friend has put forward this point i undertake to consider it and will seek to bring forward an amendment on report on the lines he suggested <e>", "<cs> i am rather surprised that there seems to have been a pause in the discussion <e> <s> as my noble and learned friend lord hailsham said the categories of the existing law were developed by analysis of relationships with which our system had to deal <e> <s> one of the matters with which it did not have to deal at the time the categories were developed was the embryo <e> <s> the noble baroness lady warnock and her committee had to consider this matter <e> <s> i can do no better than quote from paragraph of their report <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is absolutely right <e> <s> the general usage is a transitive one but embryology uses it intransitively <e> <s> however the bill is not meant for embryologists it is meant for ordinary people <e> <s> therefore although the bill as drafted takes not surprisingly the usage of the embryologist because it was working in that particular area of science when we saw the noble lords amendment we recollected that it did properly reflect the more general practice <e> <s> therefore i thought it wise to accept the amendment <e> <s> accordingly i propose to recommend that members of the committee do likewise <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should confirm to the noble lord lord somers that one of the purposes of clause is to try to deal with the matter and make it clear that we are not dealing with the ordinary procedures to which he referred but the rather extraordinary procedures which require regulation under the bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may deal with the noble lords second point first <e> <s> the definition imports the idea of live so far as concerns human embryos <e> <s> therefore the definition clause does not import the word live where it is another embryo that is in question <e> <s> it takes us back to the argument as regards the original amendment with which the noble lord started the proceedings <e>", "<cs> all members of the committee will agree that this has been a very important debate and one on which we face very important issues <e> <s> i should like to say first in answer to the noble lord lord milverton who expressed a distaste for the bill that if he believes that such matters ought to be regulated then a bill such as this is essential <e> <s> i do not believe that any of us relishes the difficult task which is involved in coming to decisions in these areas <e> <s> however i believe that we have a duty as legislators to seek to achieve a regulation of the matters in our nation which will last <e>", "<cs> yes that may well be true as matters stand <e> <s> there is a suggestion that it might be wise to legislate to cover those treatments too <e> <s> however the bill states <e>", "<cs> it is absolutely true that the bill as it stands does not prohibit as it were the implantation in a woman of dead non-human gametes <e> <s> that is absolutely plain <e> <s> but the point is that the mischief with which this provision is designed to deal is the mischief of inserting live non-human gametes in a woman <e> <s> the potential harm of that is very great indeed <e>", "<cs> the bill is right <e> <s> i do not for one minute believe that many people will want to read a lord chancellors explanation but when they read the bill they will see that the evil with which we are trying to deal is that of seeking to implant in a woman live non-human gametes <e> <s> that is what we are aiming at <e>", "<cs> as noble lord lord kilbracken explained to the committee there is no question of policy or substance here it is purely a drafting question <e> <s> while i entirely sympathise with his intention to simplify the drafting of clause in seeking to remove the need for clause by deleting the reference in clause a to the primitive streak i think that it would be unfortunate if the amendment were accepted <e>", "<cs> i do not think that we should pass this particular amendment for the moment <e> <s> my noble friend has made a point upon which i should like to take the advice of parliamentary counsel <e>", "<cs> clause provides that a licence cannot authorise replacing a nucleus of a cell of an embryo with a nucleus taken from a cell of any person embryo or subsequent development of an embryo <e> <s> this amendment would provide in addition that a licence could not authorise replacing a nucleus or component of a nucleus of a cell of an embryo with a nucleus or component of a nucleus taken from a cell of any person embryo or subsequent development of an embryo <e>", "<cs> the prohibition in clause d is designed to prevent cloning using human embryos <e> <s> the reference which the amendment seeks to take out to <e>", "<cs> we have had a very important debate on an extremely difficult subject <e> <s> i shall seek first of all to deal with the effect of the amendment on clause <e> <s> it would deny unmarried women access to in vitro fertilisation treatment <e> <s> the amendments to clause would prevent them from receiving donor insemination from licensed treatment centres <e>", "<cs> this amendment refers to a technique used in some countries for the treatment of infertility whereby embryros are flushed from a womans body before they implant in the uterus for subsequent use usually in relation to the technique of embryo donation <e> <s> although it is not at present used in this country it is possible that in the future clinicians may find it helpful in some cases <e> <s> it would seem therefore not right to accept this amendment which would have the effect of prohibiting it <e>", "<cs> we have had a full extremely interesting and highly important debate that i am sure holds the interest of all noble lords and of many outside this chamber <e> <s> we are discussing the very centre of the bill and a matter that goes to the heart of what life is about and what it is right and not right to do by way of research in the first days after sperm and egg have been mixed together <e>", "<cs> i understand the view that the licensing decisions should be the direct responsibility of the secretary of state who would of course be directly responsible to parliament <e> <s> it is a view which has been prominently deployed at various stages in the debates following the warnock report <e> <s> it is also a view which has been carefully considered by the government but to which in the end we have decided not to give effect <e>", "<cs> the intention of the bill is that the authority which will be established thereunder will carry out its statutory functions of control and licensing effectively and be worthy of full public confidence <e> <s> as the noble lord lord grantchester mentioned the authority will have the power to give or refuse licences and subsequently to withdraw or vary licences which it has granted <e> <s> for example if it should turn out that a particular licence which had been granted had in the judgment of the authority undesirable effects for some reason which was not anticipated at the time when it was granted it would have the power to revoke the licence <e> <s> of course as the noble lord pointed out procedures will be necessary in such a case to give the licence holder an opportunity to have the matter properly discussed <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may deal with a further point that he made <e> <s> i refer to the idea that the people who grant the licences may not all be members of the authority <e> <s> i think that clause requires the licence committee to be constituted entirely of members of the authority <e> <s> i must apologise to the noble lord for not dealing with that aspect earlier <e>", "<cs> i understand that paragraph e of schedule is designed to deal with one of <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord meston is referring to ground which to some extent we covered in relation to the amendment moved by the noble lord lord kennet in which he sought to classify an embryo either as a person or as a chattel <e> <s> in spite of what was said earlier today it was not the lawyers who sought that classification i think on that occasion it was the noble lord lord kennet <e> <s> some of the lawyers who spoke including my noble and learned friend lord hailsham suggested that the lawyers had not developed classifications into which an embryo would properly fit and therefore he declined to do so <e> <s> in this particular respect i followed his good example <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to consolidate certain enactments in relation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to consolidate certain enactments relating to special controls in respect of hazardous substances with amendments to give effect to recommendations of the law commission <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to make provision for repeals consequential amendments transitional and transitory matters and savings in connection with the consolidation of enactments in the town and country planning bill the planning listed buildings and conservation areas bill and the planning hazardous substances bill including provisions to give effect to the recommendations of the law commission <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> this amendment would have the effect of making it a condition of all licences that information had to be recorded in a manner laid down by the authority on treatment services set out in clause a the persons for whom treatment services are provided b the treatment services provided for them c the persons whose gametes are kept or used for the purpose of treatment services provided under licence or whose gametes have been used to create embryos kept or used for treatment services of this kind d any child appearing to the person responsible to have been born as a result of licensed treatment and e any mixing of egg and sperm any taking of any embryo from a woman and any other acquisition of any embryo <e>", "<cs> a number of issues are raised by these amendments <e> <s> i should say at the outset that the noble lord lord kennet is right to say that the amendments raise an important matter which goes far beyond any question about titles of honour or anything of that kind <e> <s> i shall refer to that matter in the course of my remarks <e>", "<cs> that illustrates the point i am seeking to make <e> <s> in any event whatever the history and the lineage aspects of this matter may be i am sure that all of us appreciated the clarity with which the noble lady has put this case <e> <s> i think it would be right to say that this is extremely difficult territory <e> <s> i am very much aware that there are strong arguments in relation to the welfare of children born as a result of donation <e> <s> it is felt by some that a child born in these circumstances should be able to discover who his genetic parents were <e> <s> i know this view is held by many organisations representing social work and adoption and fostering interests who make an analogy with the access to such information in the case of children who are adopted <e>", "<cs> that may depend on the circumstances <e> <s> for example earlier in the committee stage we discussed the situation in which parents knew that there was a possibility of their union resulting in children with a genetic disease <e> <s> they might have a child who had a genetic disease <e> <s> they might be afraid to incur the risk of a second child born by natural conception having that same disease <e> <s> they might therefore prefer in the light of the information that they could obtain about the embryo that would be produced by the in vitro fertilisation method to proceed in that way in the belief that they would thereby eliminate the risk of producing a second child with the same defect <e> <s> that is one example <e> <s> i hope that i have made it clear <e> <s> i think that i have not <e>", "<cs> i was not at the moment seeking to convince the noble baroness simply to answer her question <e> <s> this is an important point <e> <s> that is the reason for the distinction <e> <s> it is not an oversight <e> <s> it is based on a real distinction between the situation of a child born to parents who are not married on the one hand and the situation in which a child is born as a result of one of the treatments on the other <e>", "<cs> the question concerns the extent to which the amendments would be <e>", "<cs> i believe that i have understood the point <e> <s> in effect i am saying that where an existing deed describes the beneficiaries as children of x then after the provision comes into force i think it would be wrong this is the policy of the bill so far to distinguish between those children of x who are born naturally and those children of x who might be born to x as a result of the treatments on the assumption that the section was then operating <e> <s> so in a sense my noble and learned friend is suggesting that the class of people in the deed as it stands would be if i may put it this way the natural children of x i would extend that provision to include those children who are born as a result of the treatments <e> <s> we suggest that it would not be right when the section is in operation to distinguish between children born naturally to their parents and children born as a result of treatment with those parents as their parents for the purposes of the law under the provisions of this section <e>", "<cs> assuming that i have understood the point which is a considerable assumption the distinction sought in subsection b of amendment no <e> <s> is between children who are born naturally whether grandchildren or not grandchildren like children require to be born and those children or grandchildren who are born as a result of treatment <e> <s> the grandchildren may be born either as a result of parents having been born as a consequence of such treatment or as a result of themselves having been born as a result of such treatment <e>", "<cs> i quite understand that <e> <s> the whole point is that when a person talks about xs children grandchildren or great-grandchildren or children in a will which has already taken effect to any degree he may if he thought about this at all be thinking of children born by natural means <e> <s> however the bill states that for this purpose children born by natural means and children born as a result of those treatments should be taken in the same way as children of their parents <e> <s> that will apply to all degrees of children grandchildren and the like <e>", "<cs> the provision does not apply to titles of honour which certainly include hereditary peerages <e> <s> the provision which deals with the status of children born as a result of those treatments does not apply to titles of honour <e>", "<cs> i am at the service of your lordships as to when we should have that discussion <e> <s> i must point out that it would perhaps be undesirable to treat it as if it arose only in connection with titles of honour <e> <s> it is a much more fundamental and <e>", "<cs> it is perhaps entirely easy for me to indicate the full effect of the noble ladys amendment <e> <s> however i think it would be right to take it that amendments nos <e> <s> and would have the effect of requiring the authority to keep information which would unequivocally identify people for whom licensed treatment services are provided and donors of gametes or embryos <e> <s> therefore the result is that a person who donated sperm for example would require to be identified <e>", "<cs> at present i cannot accept any intention to put any kind of marking on the birth certificate <e> <s> as regards records to be kept by the authority that is a matter to be determined in the light of the general responsibilities of the authority <e> <s> i think my noble friend lord teviot is asking that the authority should have records from which it can be determined whether a particular person has in fact been subject to one of these treatments at some time which might be related to the birth of a particular child <e> <s> that is certainly something that one would want to consider <e>", "<cs> i quite appreciate the difficulties but the same is true in relation to what occurs in what i might call nature <e> <s> the precise circumstances in which children are born when couples are married is not the subject of disclosure on birth certificates <e> <s> when someone applies for a title of honour and my noble friend has indicated that he has had some experience of that particular test as it were there may be more detailed inquiries made into the circumstances of a particular birth than would normally arise in connection with its registration <e> <s> this is the kind of material that might emerge in that situation <e> <s> but as far as i am concerned i do not think it would be right to have a particular mark on a birth certificate in this connection any more than it is right to require people to put particular marks on birth certificates in every other possible situation <e> <s> that information would have to come in another way than from the ordinary birth certificate <e>", "<cs> the policy of the bill is that licences will be granted either to individuals who will themselves control the premises where the activity to be licensed is to be carried on or to another person or body which manages the premises on which the activity is to be carried on <e> <s> but and this is the important point each licence application must designate an individual under whose supervision the activities authorised by the licence will be carried on <e> <s> so there must be a single person responsible for supervision of all the activities authorised by a <e>", "<cs> the amendment is concerned with the export and import of gametes or embryos <e> <s> trade is rather a different matter and i believe that the noble earls graphically expressed attitude to that will be widely shared <e>", "<cs> the words import and export are used with what i believe is the correct meaning namely carried out of the country or carried in <e> <s> import means carried in and export means carried out <e> <s> if those gametes or embryos are to be carried into the country it is essential that proper protection is afforded because that could be an extremely delicate and dangerous matter as i am sure all noble lords appreciate <e> <s> similarly for us to allow embryos to go out would offend most people unless we were satisfied that they would be used in the same way as noble lords have in mind might be allowed here <e> <s> however the precise terms in which that provision should be expressed would relate closely to the situation <e> <s> for example it might be appropriate that a person should continue to be responsible for the embryo until an operation was carried out <e> <s> a much more specific provision would be required than would be appropriate in the case of an ordinary licence which in a licensed institution was to run for some time in this country <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down it may be worth giving what i think is the answer namely that no person shall keep or use an embryo except in pursuance of a licence <e> <s> that is the basic doctrine for this country <e> <s> the only way in which a person could therefore lawfully either import or export an embryo or gamete would be under licence <e> <s> that covers the point but naturally i shall be happy to consider it further <e>", "<cs> first i entirely agree that the code should be produced as rapidly as possible consistent with the subject matter with which it deals <e> <s> secondly when i replied to the earlier amendment of the noble lady lady saltoun to which she referred i had in mind the possibility that statutory guidance not just in the code but a statutory provision dealing with the matter that she raised on the lines that i suggested might go into primary legislation and control the code to some extent in that way <e> <s> i am still considering whether i can bring forward such a proposal on report having regard to what happened to her amendment <e>", "<cs> i see no difficulty in that <e> <s> the authority will be consulting quite widely on the code and i should expect it to be very easy for noble lords to have sight of it at that stage <e>", "<cs> the white paper which we published in november made it clear that in the governments view all adults over should have a legal right to find out whether they were born as a result of sperm egg or embryo donation and that those who were should be given right of access to certain non-identifying information about the donor or donors of the genetic material for example about their medical or genetic history <e> <s> this is reflected in clause <e> <s> the point about medical records is dealt with absolutely <e> <s> i can do no better than remind the committee of the reason which the government had when indicating that this was their policy in paragraph of the white paper <e>", "<cs> if he was concerned about that all he needs to do is to apply to the authority and that authority will tell him whether or not there are grounds for his fears <e> <s> if a person is happy with his roots and does not wish to know anything more about them then he can leave the matter as it is <e> <s> however if he wishes to find out provided that he satisfies the condition of having been counselled he need only apply to the authority which will be able to tell him whether or not his parents had been in receipt of treatment covered by the bill at the appropriate time although it cannot tell him exactly how he was born <e>", "<cs> if members of the committee take the view as i do that it is an important matter to know what the likely effects will be then i believe that that counselling is very well placed <e> <s> i do not imagine that there will be a huge desire to resort to these applications <e> <s> it may be that more people will have recourse to this process than may at first sight appear although the total number affected by these procedures is likely to be rather small <e> <s> even so the need for counselling is so important that it is right to make it a condition that a person should be counselled before he receives an answer to the query <e>", "<cs> that is a solution for those who want to find out the information <e> <s> the problem about putting anything on the birth certificate is first that it is public to everyone whatever their interest or connection with the family <e> <s> secondly if the committee believe in counselling before this information is disclosed which i hope and believe most members of the committee may do if such information is put on the birth certificate the child may discover it completely by accident when he tries to get a copy of his birth certificate <e> <s> he will not have any opportunity to have counselling he will suddenly discover it <e> <s> i believe this has happened in other circumstances but this is a difficult problem <e> <s> one of the disadvantages of putting this information on the birth certificate is that there cannot be an enforceable requirement for counselling before the information is disclosed <e>", "<cs> as the committee has heard the bill as drafted provides in clause <e>", "<cs> in amending subsection of clause the amendment has two quite separate effects <e> <s> first as regards paragraph a of subsection the clause as at present drafted ensures that a man who provides sperm through the statutory scheme for use by others is not to be treated as the father of any resulting child <e> <s> in the governments view it would be unfair to sperm donors if as the result of a public-spirited act aimed at helping infertile men and women they were to make them selves liable for the maintenance and upbringing of the child <e> <s> not only would such a result be unfair to donors but it would not in any way reflect the social reality and would carry the very grave risk of seriously reducing the number of donors and hence the supply of sperm <e>", "<cs> the subsection provides that presumption <e> <s> of course the presumption may be a rebuttal <e> <s> therefore it is possible that the answer is not finally provided under the clause <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just clarify what i believe to be the correct position <e> <s> if what i might call the social father the womans husband has not given consent and can show that <e>", "<cs> as i understand it this amendment would prevent the authority from making information available to an applicant which would identify his or her genetic parents derived from information relating to the period before the legislation came into force <e> <s> i do not think the amendment is necessary because as the bill is at present drafted clause does not empower the authority to make such identifying information available to children born as a result of the techniques to be licensed under the bill <e> <s> unless the bill is subsequently amended to alter the policy that no identifying information is to be made available to children born as a result of donation there is no need to specify that as this amendment does <e> <s> the bill does not allow that in any event <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may take up the last point that the noble lady lady saltoun made <e> <s> in considering the terms of licences the authority may decide that it is wise to limit the number of donations by an individual for the reasons given <e> <s> no doubt other precautions could be taken with regard to that and to the way in which sperm from a particular donor is used <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i mentioned responsibility particularly <e> <s> i understand that it is the identification of the donor that is likely to discourage him from coming forward <e> <s> one can see that the fewer consequences identification has for the donor the less identification is likely to pose a disincentive <e> <s> on the other hand i suppose that once ones identity is known ones security against any other form of responsibility is apt to be diminished <e> <s> therefore in practical terms the result may be the same <e> <s> the noble baroness makes as usual an important point <e> <s> however i believe that on balance the warnock committee was right to hold that identification in itself is sufficient to make it unlikely that donors would come forward <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to press the point about the distinction between the authority and the state but the authority will be an independent body set up for that purpose <e>", "<cs> i had judged the intention of amendment no <e> <s> to be the same as that of the group with which we dealt earlier which had the aim of making identifying information available in respect of children born as a result of techniques to be licensed under the bill <e> <s> in that case the amendment would have the effect of making information defined in regulations available to those receiving services <e> <s> i do not think for the reasons that i have given in relation to other amendments moved by my noble friend lord teviot and the noble lady lady saltoun that it would be appropriate for us to agree to that extension of the policy in the white paper and to make such information more widely available <e> <s> even with the safeguard which the amendment provides of regulations which would specify which categories of information would be available i think it would be unfortunate if the confidentiality of data held by licence centres and by the authority about these sensitive treatments were to be breached <e>", "<cs> as we come towards the end of the committee stage it is very pleasant to feel an air of unanimity enveloping the committee <e>", "<cs> i said that if my noble friends were agreeable i should like to consider the matter further <e>", "<cs> the amendment would provide that a person who exceeds any authorisation contained in a licence or who fails or omits to observe or perform any condition contained in a licence granted to him or his employer is guilty of an offence and liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding years or a fine or both <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble and learned friends lord wilberforce and lord goff of chieveley for having taken part in the debate on this amendment <e> <s> i do so in the knowledge that they speak with great expertise on this subject <e> <s> the first time that i had the honour to appear as a scottish counsel in an english appeal was in the field of international private law and my noble and learned friend lord wilberforce was sitting <e> <s> i therefore learned something about this subject at his feet and a very important subject it is <e>", "<cs> i did not have responsibility in relation to this matter in but my understanding is that if it was ratified in we have left it for a very long time before bringing it into effect <e> <s> i understand that the convention was signed but has not yet been ratified <e> <s> the purpose of the bill is to enable that ratification to take place <e> <s> the command paper says that <e>", "<cs> my information is that the printing to which my noble and learned friend lord wilberforce has drawn attention is a misprint <e> <s> it should have said that it <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the bill is to enable us properly to bring the law of the united kingdom into line with the convention to give the convention the force of law in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> i entirely support the last observation of my noble and learned friend lord wilberforce about the desirability of courts being prepared within reason to look at any relevant material <e> <s> i welcome the opportunity to look at the academic writers views on topics with which we are concerned when sitting judicially <e> <s> however i doubt whether it is wise to seek as it were to legitimise that practice in the bill because to do so would suggest that it was in relation only to the subject matter of the bill that that was proper <e>", "<cs> the precise guidance which could be taken out of pre-act decisions would be a matter of close consideration <e> <s> for example when the sale of goods act codified the law on the sale of goods it did not completely nullify the effect of previous decisions as decisions of utility in ascertaining how the words of the sale of goods act should be applied because generally speaking that act proceeded on the basis of the principles laid down in those authorities <e>", "<cs> when this bill was drafted the advice which i received was that the matters which were to become a force of law should be printed and not the preamble <e> <s> however having considered the matter in the light of my noble and learned friends amendment i believe that there is something to be said for putting in the preamble <e> <s> if we do that for the rome convention we should want to do it for the others <e> <s> therefore if my noble and learned friend will leave the matter with me i shall consider bringing forward an amendment upon report to put in the preambles in respect of all the

i have endeavoured to carry out as fully as possible in the time available the various undertakings that i made <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the aim is to make it clear that the provisions of the act cannot be affected by an order made under that section but that any other enactment can be and that any subordinate legislation made under the act can be <e> <s> my noble and learned friend has therefore understood the effect of the amendment as i intend it <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments cover a subject matter which i do not think we discussed particularly at committee stage <e> <s> at the outset i should like to say that so far as i know the department has not yet been approached with proposals along these lines <e> <s> we have been considering questions of changing the ministerial tribunal under the trade marks act <e> <s> there have been discussions on that but on this matter no discussions have so far taken place <e> <s> that does not preclude our having discussions now <e> <s> obviously i accept that this is a matter of importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i wished to clarify my undertaking and that i have done <e> <s> as regards the point raised by the noble lord lord mishcon one must adopt a somewhat evolutionary approach <e> <s> we are making considerable changes in relation to the county courts and concern has been expressed about both granting powers which are too wide and also restricting powers <e> <s> i thought it right to have a machinery under which the matter could be considered <e> <s> any concerns on the lines expressed by the noble lord lord mishcon can be taken into account in deciding what is to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords it has not caused me to reconsider the correctness of the amendment but it has been a complete fortification of the fact that i have it right <e> <s> the amendment deletes the detail which we suggested in subsection of the new section of the supreme court act in attempting to distil the cases <e> <s> having heard the comments of the noble lord lord mishcon my noble and learned friends lord ackner and lord simon and others i decided that it was wise to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure how to take the last compliment <e> <s> i am particularly grateful that my noble and learned friend lord wilberforce also supports the amendment <e> <s> i had in mind the point that he raised and realise that my proposal achieves that <e> <s> i am grateful for his support <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> has been pre-empted <e>", "<cs> my lords as i made clear in committee the purpose of this clause is not to shut out people who have a case from the court of appeal but in the interests of the court in the interests of the administration of justice and also in the interests of litigants who have a hopeless case the court of appeal should have the power to tell them that at an early stage <e> <s> accordingly in my submission this amendment is not directed to securing justice but rather to doing harm to a general power which the rules committee should have on the lines of this clause <e>", "<cs> my lords the provisions that we are discussing will enable the rules committee to make the detailed rules <e> <s> i should have thought that that was the right course to take <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> yes that is precisely what i said <e> <s> the rules committee may well think it right to make a special rule in that connection <e> <s> all we are doing is giving the rules committee power to deal with this <e> <s> i do not wish to elaborate the argument because i know we want to get on and i am very much in favour of that but the situation is that as we have seen already and as my noble and learned friend the master of the rolls pointed out when this clause was discussed in committee if too much rigidity is imposed on the rules committee anomalies are apt to develop which cannot be put right unless there is further primary legislation <e> <s> this is a matter essentially to be dealt with by rule <e> <s> accordingly i would ask your lordships not to accept the amendment <e> <s> i hope that <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble and learned friend withdrawing the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is it your lordships pleasure that the amendment be withdrawn <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed it is but the whole clause is governed by the powers of the rules committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the way in which amendment no <e> <s> has been received <e> <s> the press statement was based on an answer given in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i must gratefully accept the views which have been expressed <e> <s> i therefore hope that your lordships will agree to the insertion of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble and learned friend sits down i should say that i would be most happy to discuss the matter with him as part of the general discussion and to put the points he raised to parliamentary counsel for advice <e> <s> therefore it would be consistent if my noble and learned friend did not move the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords the kind of annual report i have in mind is similar to the present report for the court service which the noble lord lord irvine of lairg may have seen through the bar councils facility <e> <s> i should be happy to make it available to any noble lord who wants it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord was kind enough to suggest that i had achieved for him what he wanted in the way of timing <e> <s> i think that there may well have been factors other than my persuasion involved <e> <s> circumstances beyond my control may have contributed to the apt timing of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by referring to the reference by my noble friend lord peyton of yeovil to the concluding part of my speech in committee <e> <s> when i talked about the machinery i was not referring only to the advisory committee <e> <s> he said that there is plenty of advice available and i suppose therefore that it is a question of distinguishing between what is good and what is bad <e> <s> i was thinking of the full machinery which includes consent to the rules by the four designated judges the heads of division and the lord chancellor <e> <s> i took the view that it was appropriate for the rules to be settled in that machinery <e> <s> for that reason i advised your lordships and i am glad that my noble friend took my advice on that occasion not to support the amendment then proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords that is precisely what i had understood to be the position <e> <s> i do not regard that situation as satisfactory at present <e> <s> i do not believe that this amendment would deal with that situation because it deals only with rights of audience in the higher courts <e> <s> it suggests that the rule is appropriate only in relation to rights of audience in the higher courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i am right in saying that on that occasion i said that this rule was a constitutional guarantee <e> <s> however i may be wrong about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i undertook at committee stage to consider this matter and i am seeking to do so <e> <s> the precise way in which this should be dealt with is quite a difficult question <e> <s> consideration started with parliamentary counsel and the consideration of it has not yet been completed <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand and appreciate legal executives and the institute of legal executives <e> <s> i took an interest in their activities before they were brought to my attention by the noble lords lord hacking and lord morris during the course of these proceedings <e> <s> my first meeting with a legal executive was in relation to an affidavit in which he described himself as a member of the institute of legal executives <e> <s> one of our noble and learned predecessors in the appellate committee of the house on reading the affidavit asked what was a legal executive <e> <s> i am glad that the standard of acquaintance with the detail of the legal profession has moved on in the appellate committee since then <e>", "<cs> my lords since it is fresh in our minds perhaps i may first take the second point which the noble lord lord hutchinson in particular wished me to have in mind <e> <s> i am the first to acknowledge the claim of the bar of england and wales to be very highly regarded <e> <s> i yield to no one in that and i have sought to make that clear on many occasions <e> <s> but this advisory committee is an advisory committee to give advice which will be before the lord chancellor and the designated judges the heads of division when the profession proposes its rules or when these rules are being considered <e>", "<cs> my lords that is precisely why i asked for the book <e> <s> i was pretty certain that that was the position but i wanted to have the text in front of me <e> <s> my noble and learned friend has confirmed it <e> <s> the rules committee works extremely well <e> <s> i have no reason to doubt that the profession has confidence in the rules committee indeed so much confidence that it can work without too many meetings <e> <s> it can work on paper <e>", "<cs> my lords however high the authority from which it comes in no circumstances do i wish to associate myself with a description of a judge of the supreme court or a member of the appellate committee of your lordships house as a toothless watchdog <e> <s> it has not been my experience that the description would properly be applied to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made my view clear on that matter <e> <s> my difficulty about adding to the advisory committee is the tremendous size that it will become <e> <s> if my noble and learned friend lord ackner was put to his election on which of the judges he has suggested will he take that is supposing that i was in a position to take one judge in order to meet the point made by my noble and learned friend the master of rolls which would he choose <e> <s> i shall give my noble and learned friend a chance to answer the question in one moment but i wish to make my thoughts clear <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i put the question to my noble and learned friend lord ackner as the mover of the motion because i knew that he must reply <e> <s> however the view of my noble and learned friend the master of the rolls would be extremely valuable to me <e> <s> i am sure that the house would be glad to hear his view and therefore i am very willing to give him leave if he seeks it to answer that question for <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall need to consider this matter further because as your lordships appreciate it is important <e> <s> i have considered it on the basis of the amendment and i now wish to consider the matter further <e> <s> i certainly would not wish to make a decision now and i shall consult further before coming to a conclusion <e> <s> however i am very grateful for the indications given by my noble and learned friends <e> <s> i hope that in the light of the dicussion my noble and learned friend lord ackner will feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the way it will run is that eight persons shall be present other than salaried judges and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly the sort of body that i have in mind including bodies across the spectrum of interest represented in the immediately succeeding subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords it humbly appears to me that the appointment of this committee should be the responsibility of the lord chancellor for which he is answerable to parliament <e> <s> my noble and learned friend can take it that as with other matters i should certainly wish to have the views on these matters of the lord chief justice and the other heads of division <e> <s> however i do not believe it is appropriate that the lord chief justice should be involved by giving agreement to these appointments <e> <s> i believe it right that the lord chancellor should carry that responsibility for which as i said he is answerable to parliament <e> <s> i believe that the object that my noble and learned friend has in mind will certainly be secured by the arrangements that i have in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble and learned friend wants an explanation he will have to move the amendment <e> <s> i will put the question and then it is open to me to give such an explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am proposing to make a short reponse to that matter now and if my noble friend wishes to ask the leave of the house if he thinks that is necessary no doubt he will do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the position of this wording in the clause seems to me to be quite reasonable having regard first to the kind of prominence which my noble friend lady elles wished to give to the european dimension so that we would not be considering all these matters in a vacuum and so that we should have regard to the development of the community of which we form part <e> <s> certainly my understanding is that the phrase member states is sufficiently precise to connote membership of the european community <e> <s> however i shall look further at that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall now put the question on amendment no <e> <s> since we have ranged over it <e>", "<cs> my lords i considered carefully what title i should give this officer <e> <s> the word is new to the statute book <e> <s> the word commissioner has until now been applied to such posts <e>", "<cs> my lords amendments nos <e> <s> and would enable the ombudsman to investigate an allegation of negligence against an advocate but not to make the recommendation which the complainant is perhaps most likely to seek <e> <s> that is the effect of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i find it difficult to think it appropriate that the ombudsman should have jurisdiction in areas which are expressly closed to the courts <e> <s> i feel that that would not be right <e> <s> nor do i see much point in conferring a jurisdiction which could only fail in the most part to deliver what the claimant seeks <e> <s> i see <e>", "<cs> my lords this subsection requires that if the ombudsman finds against a practitioner there should be some form of sanction if the practitioner does not agree with the ombudsman and does not implement what the ombudsman said <e> <s> we thought it unwise to go the length of forcing the practitioner to do what the ombudsman said <e> <s> he always has that option but if he declines to do so it seems right that the ombudsmans authority should not be completely undermined <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the noble lord lord mishcon in thanking the committee for its efforts in what he has correctly described as a complicated consolidation <e> <s> i should also like to thank the law commission and the draftsmen for their efforts <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now further considered on report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i am also grateful for the time-saving way in which he has expressed his gratitude for later amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of consistency with scotland will produce interesting discussion as we move through the amendments including one to be moved shortly by the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it might be possible to summarise those characteristics at some time <e> <s> all that i am concerned to point out at the moment is that there are distinctions between the two systems which are relevant <e> <s> for example solicitors in scotland have wide rights of appearance in criminal jury trials <e> <s> that is one of the important distinctions between scotland and england with regard to this aspect of the matter <e> <s> i suppose that the reasons are those of development and history and of course the treaty of union has something to do with the preservation of the distinctiveness of the scottish system <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation with regard to solicitors clerks is regulated in the high court by the judgment to which the noble lord lord hacking referred <e> <s> it is the unambiguous effect of that judgment that solicitors clerks do not possess rights of audience to appear before county court judges or registrars in chambers <e> <s> it has been the custom for judges and registrars to exercise their discretion to permit clerks to be heard <e> <s> so far as i know it has never been found in any way unsatisfactory <e> <s> the ability for judges and registrars <e>", "<cs> my lords if there were a general agreement about that i would be quite content to do so <e> <s> in the light of the situation that i am in i have sought to devise a system for providing new rights of audience keeping in place all the existing rights <e> <s> if i were to accede to this amendment i should be making a change in that policy <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by pointing out that the noble lord lord harris of greenwich is utterly mistaken in suggesting that a provision in this bill will confer a right of audience on employed members of any prosecuting authority <e> <s> this bill sets up a framework under which matters of rights of audience and the conditions under which they can be exercised are to be determined in the light of advice from an independent advisory committee appointed by the lord chancellor in accordance with rules to be proposed by the professional bodies which will become effective only if they are approved by the four heads of division the designated judges and the lord chancellor <e>", "<cs> my lords i can distinguish between a person employed by a prosecuting authority and one employed by somebody else <e> <s> however the mere fact that someone is employed by a prosecuting authority does not mean that he cannot bring an independent mind and independent judgment to the problems before him <e> <s> i do not wish to pursue this too far but the essence of the reason for the existence of the crown prosecution service is that independent and proper decisions will be taken as to the institution of prosecutions themselves <e> <s> it is generally the employees of the <e>", "<cs> my lords in his earlier submissions the noble lord referred to one of the government papers <e> <s> i think he probably referred to the first of the three green papers <e> <s> i said there that an example of a code of conduct provision might be that the person having the responsibility for the investigation of the case should not have the responsibility for its presentation <e> <s> i said that in relation to the more serious cases taken on indictment <e> <s> it does not necessarily apply to all cases on indictment <e> <s> this is a matter for consideration as part of the rules <e> <s> however that is an entirely different question from whether or not the person who presents the case could properly be an employed person <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend said i accepted the amendment in principle at committee stage because i am entirely in sympathy with the point that is made <e> <s> my noble friend does not need me to tell him that the arrangements that exist between the general council of the bar and the inns of court are just a little intricate <e> <s> i have not had as full an opportunity as i should have liked to consider the full implications of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly i do not intend the provision to foreclose the questions raised in relation to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> makes certain that nobody loses an existing right of audience <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> deals with an entirely different matter <e> <s> the noble lord lord hacking seeks to confer a right of audience albeit in practice generally granted by discretion at present <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> simply preserves all existing rights of audience and was not intended to deal with the noble lords problem under amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble and learned friend sits down perhaps i may say that i wish to consider the point he has raised in the amendment with parliamentary counsel and perhaps report the result to him at the discussion that we have arranged <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran is right <e> <s> there is already a statutory right to be heard in the patent county court granted under the act to which he referred <e> <s> to that extent patent agents are distinguished from bodies such as the royal institute of british architects and others to which my noble friend lord renton referred <e> <s> that particular right is preserved under clause b <e> <s> paragraph a of that clause does not apply <e> <s> however <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would suggest that the authorised bodies named in the bill the law society and the general council of the bar would be expected to exercise a disciplinary authority over and have training regulations and conduct rules for individuals who are not their members <e> <s> that would be quite contrary to the general principle contained in clause which as your lordships know requires every person exercising rights of audience himself to be a member of an appropriate authorised body which can maintain standards of qualification and conduct <e> <s> in fact such employees not only might be members of those bodies but in some cases for example legal executives they might be members of completely separate professional bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord i shall certainly consider whether the provision can be improved even further <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation is that i had hoped that i might be able to have the necessary amendments put down in time <e> <s> however as the noble and learned lord has said i had undertaken to look fairly extensively at schedule <e> <s> it is important to get it right <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to do anything i possibly can to prevent any premature ageing settling down on my noble and learned friend <e> <s> i shall do my best to enlighten him when we have completed the necessary work <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am happy to inform all noble lords who are interested <e> <s> that may be rather a wide class but i shall certainly seek to inform the noble lord lord mishcon about my progress <e> <s> perhaps anyone with a particular interest in schedule will contact me and i shall try to copy any correspondence i have with my noble and learned friend lord ackner and pass it to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall deal first with the point raised by my noble and learned friend the master of the rolls <e> <s> the intention is that the rights of audience are defined by reference to the situation on th december when the bill was published <e> <s> the regulations which are given effect are those which exist on the coming into force of clause dealing with the rights of audience <e> <s> however rules which are made now by the general council of the bar or the law society under another clause will have effect if they are not altered before the clause comes into force <e>", "<cs> my lords the idea is that if there should be a question about any of the rules then that question should be submitted for consideration in the ordinary way under the machinery <e> <s> the advisory committee the lord chancellor and the four designated judges would have to look at the rule to see whether it should be approved <e> <s> in other words the deemed approval will apply to everything in respect of which there is no requirement to go through the procedure <e> <s> that strikes me as the safest and easiest way <e>", "<cs> my lords the rule would be considered and if it was then approved by the lord chancellor and the designated judges it would have protection from the competition authority <e> <s> a possible scenario is that the lord chancellor would raise a question about the rules <e> <s> speaking generally i see the draft rules before they are approved as regards education and training for the law society and i have always been courteously afforded a sight of the rules of the bar <e> <s> however if any question arose about a rule then i should require to put that rule through the procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i am very happy to discuss this <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not only a question of dealing with existing rules it is applying to these existing rules a deemed approval <e> <s> that is the point <e> <s> it is not only dealing with existing rules and challenging them it is providing them with a deemed approval <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends on what value one attaches to approval of the rules <e> <s> the point is whether one wants these rules to carry approval <e> <s> that is the need for the procedure <e> <s> there is no question of no rule at all applying <e> <s> the rule in question would be considered and a rule that would apply from that time forward would be the rule that the judges and the lord chancellor considered to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i took this matter to be part of the rearrangement suggested in respect of schedule and what i said in respect of that also applies to this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a point of importance and there are somewhat related points to be dealt with in connection with later amendments <e> <s> from all i have seen what i seek to achieve may be possible of achievement within the restrictions proposed by these various amendments <e> <s> i am <e>", "<cs> my lords i join the noble lord lord mishcon in complimenting the noble baroness on the clarity with which she moved the amendment <e> <s> it is a technical area but a technical area enlightened best perhaps by lay people <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness told of her experience <e> <s> i was not certain whether any mortgage facilities were involved and if so who acted in connection with the conveyancing in support of the mortgage <e> <s> however there is no doubt that independent solicitors in private practice act for the purchaser and the person who provides the mortgage <e> <s> that happens in a high percentage of cases and i believe with no detriment to anyone <e>", "<cs> my lords this is what i have set out before and it is the same here <e> <s> i regard the arrangements as being that a solicitor will have all the responsibilities of a private solicitor to his client <e> <s> the only responsibility which he will have to the building society is to secure for the building society a proper title in respect of the mortgage <e> <s> the arrangements which i have in mind will secure that <e> <s> in other words the building society is providing a solicitor for the client either a solicitor employed by the building society or arranged by it if the client wants that <e> <s> that does not prevent the client going to another solicitor altogether if he so wishes <e> <s> there is no suggestion that this arrangement is compulsory <e> <s> it is merely a facility which the building society will be able to offer to the client if the proposals of this scheme go through <e>", "<cs> my lords prudence integrity and adequate professional skills are all matters which concern me <e> <s> i believe however that the present bill and the proposed regulations will <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in committee in response to a similar amendment the existing powers already set out in the bill are adequate to allow regulations to ensure what is required without imposing unnecessary burdens <e> <s> in addition clause provides that in discharging its duty to supervise the activities of authorised practitioners the board shall make arrangements designed to enable it to ascertain whether authorised practitioners are complying with regulations made by the lord chancellor under section <e> <s> i do not believe that it is necessary to make specific provision for an annual certificate by an accountant to be provided in this particular way <e> <s> if the board finds in the light of experience that this is necessary for supervision then there are adequate powers for it to make such a requirement <e> <s> if on the other hand the board considers such a requirement to be unnecessary the only thing the amendment would achieve is to increase the cost for the client <e>", "<cs> my lords as i see it the essential point is that the person who is acting as the qualified person namely the solicitor or licensed conveyancer should owe the proper professional duty to the client whether he is an employee or acting as an agent of a building society <e> <s> this clause as drafted would go further than that <e> <s> the idea must be that the conveyancing work is done by a person who owes the client the proper professional duty and that should rest on the professional person <e>", "<cs> my lords what my noble friend has said is helpful <e> <s> he wishes to establish that the professional person who is in charge of the transaction even if he is employed has a fiduciary <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to read the report of our discussions <e> <s> so far as i have understood my noble friends point i believe that i can favourably consider bringing forward an amendment to make it clear that where the authorised practitioner is providing these services the person who is responsible for the transaction at the professional level shall have the responsibility to the client in carrying out the transaction that a solicitor would have in relation to the ordinary practice <e> <s> there may be difficulties about that <e> <s> my noble friend will i am sure take that into account <e> <s> i shall look carefully at this point to see to what extent i can meet his concern <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon is asking me whether the regulation-making power as drafted in the bill is wide enough to enable me to make the type of regulations that he has in mind <e> <s> i have sought advice upon that point but in view of the question that the noble lord has asked i shall look at the matter again <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make sure that i have the necessary power to ensure fair competition in all aspects price cross-subsidy and so on and any other matters that may occur to us as we develop the proposals for regulations <e> <s> the main heading in issue here is fair competition <e> <s> we wish to see as we go along the precise way in which these aims may be achieved but that is the purpose that i have in mind <e> <s> i believe that what the noble lord says is in accordance with what i propose <e>", "<cs> my lords all i am saying is that the precise manner in which the policy is carried out is different from what we had in the white paper <e> <s> i am not sure now for example that the best way of securing what i had in mind in the passage which the noble lord read from the white paper is the statement annually to the prudential authorities <e> <s> it may be much better to look at their prices and judge whether the prices are fair rather than relying on certificates and so on <e> <s> i do not want the noble lord to be misled <e> <s> what i have in mind is to achieve the aims that were set out in that passage of <e>", "<cs> my lords it would never occur to me to suggest that the liberal democrats were never satisfied <e> <s> however we had intended to satisfy the noble lord lord evans of claughton whom i am sorry cannot be with us <e> <s> however i understand perfectly the reason for that <e> <s> i thought that in satisfying the noble lord i could do no better than carry out what he suggested <e> <s> however i am advised that what i am proposing in amendment no <e> <s> would have the effect that each transaction that is to say each individual transaction would be under the overall control of one individual <e> <s> that is what i wish to achieve <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords the powers that the bill confers on the board are aimed to enable it to perform its duties of authorising and supervising practitioners in a way that is light and flexible as well as effective <e> <s> the board has a general duty to supervise the activities of authorised practitioners and it will have to make arrangements designed to enable it to ascertain whether authorised practitioners are complying with the extensive regulations which the lord chancellor will make if parliament so decides <e> <s> in addition the board may make rules concerning transitional arrangements for dealing with any work in hand should an authorised practitioners authorisation be revoked or suspended <e>", "<cs> my lords as i explained this amendment was brought forward in order to seek to satisfy the matters raised in committee by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i have sought to set <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i believe that this is an appropriate way to deal with the matter and the schedule is very much along the lines of the sort of procedure which has been suggested in relation to the main provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble and learned friend sits down i should be grateful if he left the amendment for discussion <e> <s> i have difficulty in understanding precisely its effect so if my noble and learned friend is willing i would appreciate its being left to form part of the discussion we intend to have <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i must first explain that i believe this amendment to be slightly misdirected <e> <s> the regulations in subsection a were intended to relate to a complaints scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to my noble and learned friends question is that the only purpose of the schedule is to say how a body becomes an approved body <e> <s> subsection says <e>", "<cs> my lords it was to that aspect that i was seeking to give the answer <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords i brought these amendments forward as a result of the amendments moved by the noble lord lord hacking <e> <s> i am glad that my noble friend lord renton approves of the first one <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that the clause already in the bill allows a percentage increase on the fee that would otherwise be payable assuming that there were no conditional fee agreement attached to it <e> <s> what was in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment deals with the situation that arises if the agreement is not in accordance with the prescription <e> <s> as i understand the law at present it states that a conditional fee agreement is unenforceable <e> <s> therefore i seek to maintain that state of the law in respect of any conditional fee agreement which does not comply with the requirements of the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am not sure that that issue arises under the amendment for which i have sought your lordships approval <e> <s> however as i understand it in litigation a client is always entitled to have his account taxed <e> <s> i do not propose any change

rules laid down by the <e>", "<cs> my lords in formulating his question earlier the noble lord dealt with the situation in regard to clients in the crown court <e> <s> i have sought to answer that by

accepted by those of your lordships who have spoken <e> <s> i think that the law society is of the view that it would be good to allow under proper conditions which are still being worked out multi-national partnerships <e> <s> the amendment is directed in principle and i am perfectly content to take it that the drafting may not be of the higher standard of which the noble lord lord mishcon and his colleagues are capable towards seeking to lay down conditions under which a prohibition would be required in respect of multi-disciplinary practices <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of the consent provisions that is the consent provisions relating to the designated judges and the lord chancellor is to deal with matters concerned with rights of audience and the right to conduct litigation <e> <s> it is in that area that the consent of the designated judges is required <e>", "<cs> my lords the history given by my noble and learned friend lord ackner which my noble and learned friend lord hailsham supported is my understanding of the history of section <e> <s> it is right to say that a practice direction was made under it of a more general kind than the one relating only to particular courts <e> <s> my noble and learned friend did make a practice direction allowing solicitors who had appeared in the magistrates court to appear in the crown court on appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords i prefer to accept the suggestion of my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> it saves repetition of printing an amendment of some size <e>", "<cs> my lords we have a system for appointing silks and appointing judges which i have inherited <e> <s> it was described by my noble and learned friend lord hailsham when he was lord chancellor in a booklet issued during his distinguished tenure of the woolsack <e> <s> i have sought to follow the principles laid down there <e> <s> there is nothing clandestine about the matter in the sense that what occurs is set out and is well known <e> <s> i have ventured to broaden to some extent those consulted for example by formally including the chairman of the bar in the consultation <e> <s> there is always a little difficulty in relation to individuals <e> <s> we have devised a system under which as the chairman of the bar would very often if not universally be a candidate himself for a vacancy in the high court he gives views on a variety of candidates by reference to a list <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> however i was thinking more of the phrase he used to describe the question that that prime minister might ask <e> <s> that raised a possibility in my mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i now call amendment no <e> <s> standing in the name of the noble lord lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> my lords i undertook in committee as my noble friend lord coleraine has said to consider the position of an experienced solicitor who obtains the high court qualification <e> <s> i have sought to deal with that in amendment no <e> <s> a which introduces the transitional provisions <e> <s> in the second part of that amendment relating to the judicial appointment of solicitors i have provided that a solicitor who was admitted before the commencement of the section system and who is given afterwards a right of audience will be treated as having been given that right of audience on the day of his admission so that he will qualify <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave the situation that i contemplate is that special requirements are made in the transitional situation <e> <s> we shall come to that point later <e> <s> on the general basis where there is no special arrangement of a transitional kind a necessary qualification not necessarily sufficient but a necessary qualification is a certain amount of experience as an advocate in the court to which the person is qualified to be appointed <e> <s> for the high court i thought that it was reasonable to set that at years <e> <s> the brilliant solicitor of whom i hope there will be many will therefore qualify for the high court bench once he has displayed his brilliance as a high <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord hacking for reading out that passage from the white paper <e> <s> it represents the policy on which this part of the bill is based <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter of his choice <e> <s> if he has the necessary qualifications he may not be either a barrister or a solicitor <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon spent a great deal of time earlier in his parliamentary career arguing that solicitors should be eligible for the high court bench <e> <s> it was thought at that time that only barristers should be eligible but now i am glad to say his view on that point has prevailed <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the question of which qualifications are appropriate is a matter which may well relate to the size of the jurisdiction <e> <s> however i still suggest to your lordships that in principle it is right that those who are appropriately qualified to practise before a court should be eligible for appointment to the bench of that court <e>", "<cs> my lords i would describe a person who was appropriately qualified as a supreme court advocate as a lawyer <e>", "<cs> my lords with reference to that last remark the others are also fairly highly qualified on present requirements <e>", "<cs> my lords i took it that what the noble lord had in mind was a coroner other than one qualified only as a medical practitioner <e> <s> that is what i would have in mind and it is that point which i should like to consider <e> <s> coroners often although not always regard themselves as deciding disputes between parties <e> <s> in fact often they are faced with questions of that kind <e>

the result of discussions with my noble and learned friend the master of the rolls <e> <s> thus far the president of the family division has not suggested to me that any particular provisions are required <e> <s> however in view of the experience of my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale in that connection i shall certainly raise the matter with the present holder of that office to ascertain whether he wishes any comparable provision to be made <e> <s> in that way i shall give further consideration to the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord shaughnessy for bringing forward this amendment <e> <s> i am delighted to hear him participate in our debates <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of my noble friends interest in this area and i am grateful to him for giving me the opportunity to explain to the house the proposals for extending the law societys jurisdiction over inadequate professional services or shoddy work as it is more commonly called <e> <s> i had hoped to introduce those powers at this stage of the bill but pressure of time has been such that that has not proved possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> the discussion that we had in committee on this clause certainly helped me personally to focus on the issues <e> <s> i should like very much to acknowledge that <e> <s> it has been a difficult matter and the discussions have been extremely helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is not dissimilar to that moved by the noble lords lord prys-davies and lord mishcon in committee <e> <s> so far as i can judge the present amendment would not be in the interests of the customer <e> <s> the amendment would not allow lenders to offer a package of services to a customer at a discount <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i have understood that <e> <s> perhaps i may speak again very briefly <e> <s> i do not think that it would be in the <e>", "<cs> my lords this new clause has been brought forward in response to the amendment proposed at committee stage by the noble lords lord mishcon and lord hacking <e> <s> i have considered very carefully how to deal with the matter and after a good deal of care and consultation the result is what we have produced <e> <s> it is a matter of jurisdiction <e> <s> the action which is protected from investigation is that <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i should think that a case in which a particular defendant is abroad may well be a class of case that is to say that it is distinguished from other cases in which there is no defendant abroad <e> <s> i believe that the phrase we have inserted is broad enough to deal with the various situations which the noble lord suggested <e> <s> so far as concerns the first part we have limited it to the limitation act <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord says the clause implements the recommendation of the civil justice review which contained quite distinguished practitioners as well as of course others <e> <s> i do not know that i can do better than say what is the purpose of the limitation act <e> <s> the purpose of the limitation act must have some relation to the defendant <e> <s> the issue of a writ which is not served does not appear to have any particular effect on the defendant at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there is nothing in this amendment that would prevent the noble lord lord mishcon from continuing to call himself a commissioner for oaths if he wishes to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of the amendment as has been stated is that instructions given by the director of public prosecutions to staff who are not crown prosecutors in relation to bail applications may now be given so as to apply generally <e> <s> i must say that i do not find it difficult to understand those words <e> <s> generally means without reference to a particular case but reference to cases generally <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall certainly take that point on board <e> <s> however the objection which is being voiced is that it is possible to give a bad general instruction <e> <s> one can also give a bad special instruction <e> <s> the quality of the instruction cannot be determined by the drafting of the power to give instructions <e> <s> we are dealing here with a power to give instructions and are saying you need not give an instruction that applies only to particular cases you can give a general instruction <e> <s> for example have a good look at the evidence and look particularly for these features in it <e> <s> i do not suggest that that is anything more than an example of my own <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood my noble friend lord renton to say that he knew of situations where members of the crown prosecution service had been instructed to oppose bail on every occasion and that their promotion in the service depended on their success in that regard <e> <s> i may have misunderstood my noble friend but if he said that i should certainly like to have the details because i should like to bring the matter to the attention of my right honourable friend the attorney-general whose responsibility it is to supervise the service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to my noble friend <e> <s> if he can tell me of someone in the crown prosecution service who has that understanding i should certainly like to know <e> <s> if i misunderstood i am happy to accept my noble friends assurance that he did not put the matter in the way i suggested <e> <s> i am sure it is my fault <e>", "<cs> my lords this clause is rather carefully phrased and simply equates the report given by someone with a supreme court qualification with the authority it would have had if it had been made by a barrister <e> <s> therefore it is not perhaps such a restrictive practice as contemplated by the amendment <e> <s> however it would not be right for me to turn the proposition down out of hand at this time of night especially having regard to the pleasant way in which it was moved <e> <s> in the circumstances i am happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment proposes a new clause with two subsections each dealing with a different proposition <e> <s> so far as concerns the first proposition the situation is that it may be necessary to consider precisely where legal aid is required <e> <s> i do not believe that the question of whether legal aid is required depends upon lay persons having rights of audience <e> <s> on the other hand there may well be situations in which it would be right for some form of assistance to be provided to enable people to receive lay assistance as well as the more general legal aid type of professional assistance by solicitors counsel or other qualified advocates <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a reasonable statement of what i have in mind <e> <s> they would have to be satisfied that it was appropriate that legal aid of that standard should be supplied <e> <s> subject to the means tests and so on they would have the obligation to supply it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to make it clear that i wish to have flexibility to consider how best legal aid could be provided <e> <s> for example the legal aid board is considering the possibility of its being able to fund legal advice centres or the like <e> <s> that may well be the best way of helping people in certain types of cases such as housing cases <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord understands that i am considering that as a possible way of giving assistance in some kinds of case <e>", "<cs> i have not found that <e>", "<cs> there is an erratum note on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords first perhaps i may express my gratitude for the general welcome that this amendment and the others have had <e> <s> as regards the apples and oranges point what we have done is to enlarge the definition of apple if i may use that analogy to include a time before people might strictly say you had an apple but where the apple was in the process of becoming an apple <e> <s> that is why the amendment has been tabled in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend and i am glad that the amendment meets precisely his concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> the other point that she makes is a separate one which we may have an opportunity to consider later <e>", "<cs> my lords i am reluctant to begin speaking unless your lordships feel that we have spoken for long enough on this subject since the rules are that no noble lord is supposed to speak after the minister other than the mover of the amendment <e> <s> however i get the impression that it is thought that the time has come for me to summarise the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble earl lord halsbury recognises in the civil service a detachment from its own interests <e> <s> that is very heartening <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the sense of the remarks of all who have spoken and their wish that the authoritys report should be as informative as possible <e> <s> the obligation under the bill is that the authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i made plain that i have fully considered all that has been said <e> <s> i very much doubt whether singling out particular parts of the activities of the authority would be conducive to greater detail in its report <e> <s> if i were to amplify the obligation it would be to emphasise that we wish to hear about all the authoritys activities <e> <s> that is the force of the clause now <e> <s> i am perfectly willing to consider the matter further in the light of the amendment of the noble earl and of the support for it <e> <s> i recognised that in my first address on the subject to your lordships when i sought to explain that the purpose was achieved <e> <s> i shall consider the matter further if the noble earl is content to withdraw the amendment on that basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to speak again later but with your lordships leave perhaps i may answer the points that have been raised <e> <s> i believe that the point raised by the noble lady lady saltoun would be an appropriate matter to be taken into consideration in relation to the welfare of the child <e> <s> the precise circumstances may vary from case to case <e> <s> that is why we have used a very broad term which encompasses all of those matters <e> <s> it would be a question to be asked in relation to particular circumstances such as the noble lady has mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the response from all sides of the house to this and the other amendment to which i spoke <e> <s> i certainly attach a great deal of importance to them <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord ennals that the precise detail requires to be worked out <e> <s> that is why i think it right to state the principle as an overriding principle to be given effect in the code of practice and to provide that the code of practice should deal with it <e> <s> when we come to consider the code of practice we shall expect the authority to consult widely <e> <s> i am sure that the extremely important practical questions posed by the noble lord will then be taken into account <e> <s> however the matter is dealt with it must be taken into account before treatment services are provided <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments take us back to the territory covered by the amendments moved by the noble lady lady saltoun in committee <e> <s> the amendment is somewhat wide in intention in that it would require a man and woman to present themselves for treatment and that counselling would be available to a man and woman <e>", "<cs> my lords i sympathise with the reasoning behind the amendments each of which may well raise an issue on which the code of practice should attempt to give some form of guidance <e> <s> however i should like to make a general point about the code of practice <e> <s> the code will be drawn up by the new authority and will need to be approved by the secretary of state and laid before parliament <e> <s> with the exception of the important amendment dealing with the welfare of children which i have just moved the code in its present form is not specific as to content <e> <s> the matter should be decided in the light of detailed consideration by the authority charged with the responsibility for the licensing system <e> <s> i am sure that that must be the right policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that exactly the same considerations apply to this amendment as applied to the previous one more particularly perhaps to this amendment which does no attempt to specify the number but provides that this should be specified in the code <e> <s> it may well be that different numbers should apply to different aspects of the amendment <e> <s> however i again give the assurance that the matters referred to in the amendment will certainly be brought to the attention of the authority when it is constituted under the bill and that the secretary of state will bear those matters in mind when considering whether to approve the code in terms of his statutory duty <e>", "<cs> my lords strictly speaking of course the amendment requires that the limit be in the code but i do not take that point more than just as a matter of semantics <e> <s> it is a statutory provision regulating the code <e> <s> what i said earlier applies also to this amendment <e> <s> i can well understand that it might be in somewhat exceptional <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i did not intend that <e> <s> in all these undertakings i intended that that consideration would be brought to the attention of the licensing authority leaving it to decide what it should do <e> <s> i would not wish to give the impression that the house as a whole had approved any line on this matter except that this was a matter for the licensing authority to consider and determine and for the secretary of state to have in mind when deciding whether he should grant approval <e> <s> that is all that i mean <e> <s> these subject matters will be drawn to the attention of the licensing authority as subject matters which have been considered without in any way telling it what to do <e> <s> it must be the licensing authoritys responsibility to decide whether something along those lines is appropriate and if it thinks that something along those lines is appropriate what the detail of what it lays down should be <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord robertson understood that in relation to my earlier undertakings as i hope that all of your lordships have <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has raised a point that is separate from the one with which my amendment deals as he has recognised <e> <s> clause as at present drafted provides that the woman who has carried the child is to be treated as the childs mother <e> <s> but the application of the clause is limited to cases where she carried the child as a result of the placing in her of an embryo or of sperm and eggs <e> <s> the amendment would remove that limitation as the noble lord has explained <e> <s> in cases where a woman is inseminated artificially or naturally it is clear who the mother is because her own egg is used <e> <s> she is both the carrying and the genetic mother <e> <s> there is no need to make provision in the clause for what is indisputably the case <e> <s> that is a reasonably basic rule of statutory drafting <e> <s> indeed by raising the question as to why it is necessary to make statutory provision it might cast doubt on what had previously seemed obvious <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> would enable a mother who is not the genetic mother of a child to require that an indication is included in the register of births that the birth is by donation <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would similarly enable a father who is not the genetic father of a child to require that an indication would be included in the register of births that the birth is by donation <e>", "<cs> my lords subsection of clause provides that where a child is born as a result of donation the husband is to be treated as the father of the child unless it is shown that he did not consent <e> <s> because a sperm donor is not treated as the father by virtue of subsection a the result <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment raises a very interesting point <e> <s> as drafted by virtue of clause where a married woman gives birth to a child as a result of donation her husband will be treated as the father unless it is shown that he did not consent <e> <s> where the wife and husband have been judicially separated it seems highly likely that the husband will be able to prove rather easily that he did not consent <e> <s> but i do see that it is questionable whether a judicially separated husband or those coming after him should have the burden of proving that he had not consented in order to avoid parenthood which carried with it responsibility for maintaining the child together with rights of succession <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to repeat what have been described as promising noises by saying that i have undertaken to consider this amendment and to see whether the principle of it can be incorporated <e> <s> i believe that we may be able to do that <e> <s> if my noble friend is prepared to withdraw the amendment without my giving any further commitment than that i shall certainly consider it further to see whether at a later stage in the bill we can bring forward something on these lines <e>", "<cs> my lords the rule which has hitherto been followed is that the genetic line is the important line in relation to succession dealt with by subsection <e> <s> as my noble friend has pointed out in cases where the title is in question and what the noble lord has referred to as old-fashioned low-tech methods a degree of investigation has had to be gone through in a number of situations <e> <s> my noble friend refers to it as being in quite a pickle <e> <s> these cases raised a good deal of difficulty and the legal profession found them of some interest <e> <s> they were also of some length <e> <s> therefore the policy has been to operate in the same way as under the earlier statutory provision <e>", "<cs> my lords the point was raised in relation to scotland during the committee stage as my noble and learned friend lord jauncey of tullichettle said <e> <s> presumably it is intended that deeds instruments and so on executed before the clauses come into force will be construed without regard to the legal parentage conferred by the bill unless those deeds were executed by the legal parent or parents themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i made it clear although i was moving amendment no <e> <s> that i was speaking also to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all of your lordships will be sorry to learn that the noble lord lord henderson of brompton whose amendment it is is in hospital <e> <s> i am sure that we all wish him a speedy recovery <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has taken much interest in the matters that we are discussing <e>", "<cs> my lords clause of the bill requires the authority to keep information about the keeping or use of gametes of identifiable donors and identifiable persons for whom treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is important in view of the interventions of the noble baroness lady phillips my noble friend lady elles and my noble friend lord lauderdale to say that the point which they are raising does not appear to me to be relevant to this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in a sense it may have been extremely relevant to the last amendment which was proposed by the noble lord lord prys-davies <e> <s> i indicated the situation with regard to that amendment <e> <s> at the risk of being somewhat out of order i shall explain that the amendment dealt with the question of whether for example it would ever be proper to disclose the identity of a donor <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to point out that clause provides that <e>", "<cs> my lords subsection of clause requires the authority to provide information to the registrar general in cases where it is alleged that a man is not the father of a child and the registrar general needs to have that information to determine whether the claim is well founded <e> <s> for example if a man who has been registered as the father of a child by virtue of being married to the childs mother subsequently denies being the father the registrar general will need to find out whether the child might have been born as a result of treatment involving the use of donated sperm to which the man did not consent <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that an important event occurred years ago which was by no means confidential <e> <s> as regards this amendment and as my noble friend has explained it has the effect of allowing everyone access to records held by the authority years after the events to which they relate <e> <s> i expect that it would in practice if it were accepted assist great-grandchildren of children born as a result of these techniques possibly to acquire new information about their ancestry <e> <s> no doubt it would also benefit those who wish to follow genealogy in an academic sense <e>", "<cs> my lords if amendment no <e> <s> b is agreed to i cannot call amendments nos <e> <s> to as they will have been pre-empted <e> <s> i now call amendment no <e> <s> b standing in the name of the noble lord lord walton of detchant <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving his amendment the noble lord lord walton indicated how it had developed <e> <s> it arose from the concern expressed by the noble earl lord perth in committee <e> <s> the idea is to make more explicit the proposal contained in paragraphs f <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord hunter of newington for his commendation of the sub-paragraph but having considered what the noble lord lord walton has provided we believe that it may be more express and therefore easier for noble lords generally to understand <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e> <s> the hamster herself will be subject to the regime to which the noble lord lord houghton referred <e> <s> the laboratory animal would be subject to that regime in any event <e> <s> there will be no damage to the hamster by the use of the hamsters egg so the problem about which the noble lord was concerned does not arise <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i should say that i had intended that he should move his amendment <e> <s> i would commend acceptance of the amendment and then any detail which might emerge could be settled at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords if amendment no <e> <s> b is agreed to i cannot call amendments nos <e> <s> to including amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> perhaps i should just make it absolutely clear that i have undertaken to consider how the special point made by the noble earl lord perth in amendment no <e> <s> should be dealt with <e> <s> although i am subject to advice about it i propose something along the lines that directions would be effective only after they had been reported to parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i am only too well aware of the last point <e> <s> one of the difficulties of the administration of that circuit is that it covers such a large area but there is no natural division available to make it smaller <e> <s> i know that those who have responsibility for the circuit are conscious of <e>", "<cs> my lords i had actually thought of that possibility <e> <s> however the more choices i have when the bill is completed the more difficult it may be to satisfy everyone as i hope i will be able to do with the appointments i shall make <e> <s> therefore if it is possible to bring this to a conclusion during the course of the bills progress i would much rather do that <e> <s> as my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls said there has been a development of understanding of what this bill aims to do and i am therefore optimistic in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i hat is right <e> <s> there is a power to co-opt to committees and sub-committees of the advisory committee <e> <s> certainly that is intended to include meetings of the advisory committee <e> <s> that is a power that could be exercised in this respect <e> <s> however the main point is that i have given an undertaking in respect of the subject matter of this amendment which is an appointment to the advisory committee itself <e>", "<cs> my lords as usual my noble and learned friends mathematics are superb <e> <s> i am giving an undertaking that in addition to the chairman there will be another judge on the committee <e> <s> the only point on which i cannot agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that by-product of my noble and learned friends activities <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may deal first with the point made by my noble and learned friend lord ackner <e> <s> clause says <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i find it difficult to obtain a form of words on which there is no possibility of disagreement <e> <s> we have listened to arguments on statutory construction <e> <s> the ingenuity that can be lavished on them is quite considerable <e> <s> however on this occasion i regard it as reasonably plain that the last phrase deals only with the manner of the reasons <e> <s> if i could have an opportunity of putting some questions in respect of the argument to the contrary i should be glad to do so <e> <s> however i do not think that our procedures here allow room for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i indicated my general position with regard to the matter on an earlier occasion <e> <s> i have been trying to see how to bring the matter forward <e> <s> in recent times there have been difficulties in the operation of this matter in the high court <e> <s> no doubt others can elaborate <e> <s> there have been some questions as to what exactly for the purpose of the original decision solicitors clerk is <e> <s> there is no definition of clerk in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the desire of the noble lord lord mishcon to make this measure procedurally complete but it is important as i have sought to explain to notice the provisional nature of the view provided for in the clause <e> <s> the difficulty which my noble and learned friend the master of the rolls and others including myself raised was that the formal procedure which would require to be gone through might be damaged by the informal consultation which preceded it <e> <s> we have had no such difficulty in relation to for example the rules of the law society where informal consultation goes on a good deal <e> <s> but it is at least possible that some of these procedures may be a little more contentious than those which so far have taken place in relation to the law society although there have been some problems in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i do not think that this amendment is necessary <e> <s> i have listened carefully to the noble lord and accept what he says as a very cogent argument <e> <s> but the essence of the matter is that these subsections are intended as provisions to enable the lord chancellor or the designated judges to convey provisional views to the authorised body <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment raises quite important questions about choice <e> <s> the authority for legal aid with regard to the crown court is of course the crown court itself under the existing arrangements <e> <s> one aspect of that has been of quite considerable concern and has resulted in regulations made after considerable consultation with the senior judiciary which affect the choice of counsel by clients <e> <s> the court has a right to say what is to happen with regard to the number of counsel and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords the next question arises on the second part of this provision <e>", "<cs> my lords that is extremely helpful as regards intention <e> <s> however the advice i received was not so specific <e> <s> the amendment specifies regulations but not general regulations <e> <s> as drafted it may give rise to a situation in which it is impossible to make a provision that in an appropriate case the noble lord shakes his head which is always a good sign <e> <s> if in the last part of the amendment the noble lords aim is the kind of scenario attributed to me by the noble lord lord hutchinson that i wished to drive counsel out of the crown court that is not my intention <e> <s> on the other hand i do not wish to preclude the situation where it may be wise to restrict representation to a solicitor if that is the appropriate level for the particular case that authority should be with the court <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in a certain difficulty <e> <s> if the intention of the amendment is that in particular cases the regulations may give authority to the court to provide that the representation is by solicitor only that does not appear to damage what i have in mind <e> <s> however i have in mind the possibility that in particular cases the court can decide on the level of representation <e> <s> i am prepared to agree providing that it is clear that the legal aid machinery can allow for particular cases to be restricted to solicitor only

which i am moving and which i brought forward as a result of consideration of the amendment no <e> <s> of the noble lord lord mishcon which he moved on report <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house this is quite important because if i have understood it the amendment of the noble lord may not be helpful in promoting the object which he has in mind <e> <s> it is the regulations which should say what is required in order to control the competition <e> <s> to make sure that the competition is fair is not an open question <e> <s> the decision on what is fair competition must be made under the regulations <e> <s> clause and we are talking about the earlier duty states <e>", "<cs> my lords my view is that the question of who judges what is fair is best left with the lord chancellor under the regulations <e> <s> to put another body in charge of that judgment might produce a difficult and contradictory situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the reception given to amendment no <e> <s> and in an advance way amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> these amendments have not been put forward without a great deal of thought <e> <s> the amendment of the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment extends the operation of subsection b to cover employed members of a professional body as well as members acting as agents of authorised practitioners <e> <s> the amendment would take that subsection too far <e> <s> i wish to ensure only this was the scope of the amendment moved by the noble lord lord mishcon that agents providing conveyancing services were not forced into agreements with their principals which would restrict their ability to provide independent advice <e> <s> if the client wanted advice in addition to the conveyancing service there should be nothing to prevent the independent solicitor from giving that advice <e>", "<cs> my lords we discussed a similar amendment on report <e> <s> it is not an easy area in which to operate <e> <s> i understood my noble friend to suggest that the existence of the fiduciary duty determines the terms on which a solicitor may act <e> <s> however i believe that the precise terms on which a solicitor may act require to be determined with a good deal more precision than simply saying that he or she is subject to a fiduciary duty <e>", "<cs> my lords we debated the principle of this clause in committee and at that time it was affirmed by a substantial majority in a fairly full chamber <e> <s> therefore i do not propose to go back over the main arguments of principle in connection with the allowance of conditional fees in this clause <e> <s> i shall deal with the amendments which have been proposed and which have the effect of removing the possibility of uplift <e>", "<cs> my lords i was proposing to read a good deal more of the report <e> <s> i was merely making the point that we are seeking power to set an uplift of the type that the committee has in mind <e> <s> the next part of paragraph is important <e> <s> it states <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i shall do that with pleasure but i thought that i had dealt with it <e> <s> paragraph continues by stating <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that my noble friend lord coleraine had made that point <e> <s> i certainly dealt with it in committee in answer to my noble and learned friend the master of the rolls <e> <s> i believe that when a client goes to his solicitor to make arrangements for taking his case on it is not normal to require the client to take independent advice <e> <s> if he did he would have to go to another solicitor to obtain it and there would have to be an arrangement of terms on which it was obtained and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords the mandate to give advice as the noble lord lord hacking has pointed out is extremely wide <e> <s> i believe that that is advantageous <e> <s> however when it comes to requiring approval from the lord chancellor and the designated judges the terms of reference for that approval as laid out in clause in relation to alterations are that <e>", "<cs> my lords we have discussed the amendment in different forms during the various stages of the bill <e> <s> i am bound to say that the addition of subsection c makes it a little nearer what i believe might be right <e> <s> however it is unfortunate that the provision should be expressed in the way in which it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i have had the matter looked into with a view to bringing forward an amendment <e> <s> there has never been a policy difference between us on this point <e> <s> the amendment is acceptable in principle <e> <s> my noble friend is right as regards metropolitan and acting metropolitan stipendiary magistrates <e> <s> i believe however that provincial and acting provincial stipendiary magistrates are already covered by the terms of the justices of the peace act <e> <s> i had a little difficulty in accepting that that was the position but it appears to be so <e> <s> i therefore suspect that a slightly different form of words from that proposed by my noble friend may be preferable <e> <s> if he will allow me i shall have the matter dealt with in another place <e> <s> we are now in a position to do so but i was not able to put down an amendment in good time for third reading <e> <s> therefore if my noble friend will allow me to do so we shall put forward an amendment which exactly covers the area of difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said when i moved the amendment on report i have no desire to remove from the noble lord lord mishcon the noble title of commissioner for oaths <e> <s> i think it is a title dignified by antiquity as well as by nobility therefore i can well understand people having a desire to use it <e> <s> i think the point made by the noble lord lord mishcon may have to be addressed <e> <s> the amendment says <e>", "<cs> my lords the eloquence of the noble lord lord hutchinson drew out of me everything i had to say on this amendment on the two previous occasions that we discussed it <e> <s> i do not have anything to add <e> <s> my understanding is that this practice was widespread until the decision of the divisional court in <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first part of the noble lords submission in support of the amendment i shall be happy to consider whether we should look at the definitions to ensure that all those that we wish to cover are covered <e> <s> on the noble lords second point i should not be content to accept the principle of that suggestion because i believe it right that if the institute of legal executives is to have rights of audience it should do so directly <e> <s> with that explanation perhaps the noble lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> as my noble and learned friend said i have already indicated that i commend the amendment to the house for acceptance <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be inappropriate for me to speak long on the motion that this bill do now pass <e> <s> however i should like to say one or two words <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the point <e> <s> if it came to be discovered that would create an uncertainty about the status of the child <e> <s> if nothing is found out about that and all is kept private no problem arises because the child is seen to be born in the normal course of events and no query is raised on that <e> <s> on the other hand if a query were raised this amendment would apply and settle the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can first answer the noble lord lord kilbracken <e> <s> unless the condition in paragraph b is fulfilled this amendment is not required <e> <s> if the mans own sperm is used the common law makes that man the father <e> <s> the reason therefore for inserting paragraph b is to make clear that it is only required in the case covered by b <e>", "<cs> my lords as the house knows and as the noble lord has explained subsection of clause provides that where a child is born as a result of donation to a woman who is party to a marriage the mothers husband will be treated as the childs father unless it is shown that he did not consent <e> <s> subsection a makes clear that the references to the parties to a marriage do not include parties to a marriage dissolved or annulled at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords the question that arises under this amendment and what is in a way fundamental to its consideration is what a testator or truster would have done if faced with the knowledge that a child was born to his son or daughter by one of these treatments <e> <s> i said at report that these techniques were not previously contemplated and that i would find it difficult to believe that it is clear that a parent would want to say that a child born to his son or daughter by this technique was not to inherit with other children born to that son or daughter <e> <s> that is what i had in mind at that stage <e> <s> this amendment would take out altogether the possibility of these children being in the deeds <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of that point and i am seeking to deal with it by saying that clause treats the child as related to the mother or father in question <e> <s> but i am making a different point now <e> <s> i am saying that that does not exclude the possibility that a person seeking to construe an existing deed might be able to show that it did not contemplate a child born by donation but restricted the children to children who were born by natural methods <e> <s> it will be perfectly open to any person to argue that the terms of a past or indeed a future instrument showed a contrary intention to that of clause and therefore excluded children by donation <e> <s> this seems to be the correct approach and it applies whether in regard to the large estate referred to by the noble baroness lady phillips a castle or whatever may be at issue <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no difference between us on what the result would be so far as concerns coats of arms <e> <s> we are all i believe agreed that they should be treated under this provision <e> <s> the only question is whether they need to be separately mentioned or whether they are already covered by the word dignity <e> <s> the most modern answer to that point of which i am aware is that given by lord goddard sitting as my noble friend said as the earl marshals surrogate in the case to which i referred <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lady lady saltoun has pointed out this amendment brings us back to ground that we have to some extent trodden before <e> <s> it would require that where a dispute arose in the course of legal proceedings about a persons right to succeed to a dignity title of honour or entailed property the licensing authority would be required to provide where appropriate a certificate stating that according to its records the person had not been born as a result of egg or sperm donation <e> <s> we are therefore considering an amendment which is concerned with the disclosure of information <e> <s> of course if the person had been born after donation the authority would not be able to provide the declaration and one supposes the conclusion would be drawn by the outside world that the child had been born as a result of donation <e> <s> for the reasons i have explained on earlier occasions after does not in fact necessarily mean as a result of but the inference would be there <e> <s> that is rather a technical aspect of the matter <e> <s> in other words the authority is not really in a position to certify exactly what is provided there <e> <s> that is the first point <e>", "<cs> my lords it does not necessarily follow that the parents would be dead when the question arose as the earlier amendment of the noble lady shows <e> <s> the question might arise for example in relation to a trust under an existing deed <e> <s> however the evidence that would be available in the ordinary case of a question about an illegitimate birth would be available in the same way in this case <e> <s> i do not think that one should make special provision for this situation just because we happen to have created a record for the purpose of controlling these treatments <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a highly important and complex bill and one which the government introduced after a long consultation and deep and careful consideration <e> <s> it follows from the work of the committee chaired by the

grateful to all noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> indeed the noble lord lord mishcon is right that it is the fact that my noble and learned friend felt that the bill would be improved by an

amendments moved during the commons committee and report stages <e> <s> all except the first paragraph concern amendments which have been considered in earlier groups <e> <s> paragraph e breaks the link between crown prosecutors and solicitors in relation to rights of audience in the crown court <e>", "<cs> my lords this matter is similar to what we discussed in some detail on the basis of questions raised by the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington in an earlier debate <e> <s> the house will remember that section of the prosecution of offences act gave wide powers for the lord chancellor to vary rights of audience <e> <s> i took the view that these ought to be used only in relation to restricted types of case but the wording permitted a wider view to be taken <e> <s> i agreed to modification <e> <s> this represents that modification <e> <s> the important point as the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington has pointed out is that any exercise by the lord chancellor of his powers would be with the concurrence of the lord chief justice the master of the rolls and indeed all four designated judges <e> <s> the purpose would be simply to deal with i would not say a little local difficulty but something of that kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i spoke to this amendment with

friend lord renton and to then <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their welcome of the principles of this statement <e> <s> some questions have been asked and some detail has been requested <e> <s> the situation is that the white paper contains a good deal of detail <e> <s> i am simply heralding the white paper to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords the idea of the formula is to try to enable that to be done <e> <s> i know that the right reverend prelate will be aware that it is always difficult to provide a simple rule which is just in all circumstances <e> <s> we are endeavouring to provide a rule which is as simple as possible and which will do justice in the vast majority of cases <e> <s> there may be exceptional circumstances for example at particularly high levels at which the courts intervention will be necessary <e> <s> apart from that we are aiming at a system which will be reasonably simple to administer and which will do justice on the basis of the formula in the vast majority of cases <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the leader of the opposition is perfectly right <e> <s> i made a statement which it will not be necessary to repeat in the commons <e> <s> the substance of what my right honourable friend the secretary of state is saying in the commons will bear a marked similarity to what i said <e> <s> however as both departments are very much involved in the matter it is appropriate that i should make the statement to your lordships and that the secretary of state should make his statement to the other place <e> <s> the differences between the two are such as not to require their being repeated in either place <e> <s> that will be seen when noble lords have had a chance to examine the detail <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends questions are always well informed and important <e> <s> i am sure that she has many more but perhaps the white paper will answer some of them <e>", "<cs> my lords what i have said this afternoon does not touch directly on that <e> <s> the statement concerns simply the question of maintenance responsibilities <e> <s> if the parties can agree on maintenance there is no need for any action under this system <e> <s> on the other hand even if parties have been able to agree questions may arise later on the enforcement of their agreement <e> <s> if that happens and a party wishes to use the agency the agency would be <e>", "<cs> my lords that is part of the reason why i believe it is sensible to have an executive agency within the responsibility of the secretary of state for social security <e> <s> the system would certainly seek to pursue the maintenance obligations by pursuing the liable parent <e> <s> however if for some reason the payment were not forthcoming under the agencys efficient collection system of course the ordinary income support system would be in place <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the detail in regard to appeals is still open to consideration as the white paper will show <e> <s> the precise form of an appeal has yet to be determined therefore any question of legal aid does not arise at this juncture <e> <s> the question is whether appeals should go to some form of tribunal existing or new or to the courts <e> <s> that is a matter still to be determined and views on the matter would be extremely welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords as it is fresh in my mind i take the last question first <e> <s> certainly part of our aim is to do nothing to discourage people from working and remaining independent <e> <s> therefore the arrangements are proposed with that very much in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords the object is to provide a simple way to arrive at maintenance <e> <s> as i pointed out in the statement a variety of discretions is available at the moment to determine the amount of maintenance <e> <s> i believe that generally maintenance should be a relatively simple matter and determined by a formula with an agency having the power to get the necessary information and provide the necessary help in collection which is available to it <e>", "<cs> my lords the question is that the house do not insist on their amendment no <e> <s> to which the commons have disagreed but do agree with amendments nos <e> <s> a to g proposed by the commons in lieu thereof <e>", "<cs> my lords in obedience to her majestys commands and by virtue of the commission which has been now read we do declare and notify to you the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in parliament assembled that her majesty has given her royal assent to the several acts in the commission mentioned and the clerks are required to pass the same in the usual form and words <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to give effect to the convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters including the protocols annexed thereto opened for signature at lugano on th september and for purposes connected therewith <e> <s> i beg to move that the bill be now read a first time <e>"]
