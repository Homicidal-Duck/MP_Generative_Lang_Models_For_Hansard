["<cs> my lords i should like to begin with a personal word of explanation and an apology that i have not been present at all on any of the former occasions on which this bill has been debated <e> <s> in fact work at the national level in church house on matters concerned with christian unity have prevented me from attending your lordships house as frequently as i would wish <e> <s> also i very much regret the absence this afternoon of the right reverend prelates the bishop of london and the bishop of truro who have encouraged me to speak in this debate <e> <s> as the bishop of london made clear at the beginning of his speech on the earlier bill the house is indebted to the noble baroness lady wootton of abinger for her care in presenting this bill to the house <e> <s> i also express sympathy with her at the untimely death of her bill and the obligation which she has now undertaken to present the bill again to the house <e> <s> thanking her for the moderate and careful way in which she has presented the bill this afternoon gives me great delight because she is an honoured citizen of the county of which i am bishop <e> <s> i wish i could support her in her case but i feel that i must ask your lordships to vote against this bill this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am assuming that tonight the pressing of this question is not set in the context of economies made in general throughout our country <e> <s> i would feel i needed to reserve my position in that <e> <s> i assume that what we are talking <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that the sale of arms by one nation to another implies that they share certain assumptions about peace-making and the ordering of the international community and that therefore such sales raise important moral and ethical issues as well as commercial and political issues and issues of security <e> <s> will he not agree that these issues ought to be the subject of widespread public debate because they concern the standing of our particular country in the world <e> <s> furthermore will the minister agree that such debate can be conducted only if there is widespread information about the kind of arms that are being sold and to what extent <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak not only on my own behalf but on behalf of my right reverend friend the lord bishop of london who asked me to present his apologies to the house his name was associated with the amendment when it was debated at the report stage <e> <s> both he and i would like to express our thanks to the noble lord lord bellwin for his courtesy in speaking with the bishop about this matter and also to the government for having accepted the principle of the lords amendment and bringing it to this house today <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise because i must leave the house immediately after making my speech since the last train for me leaves waterloo at <e> <s> in speaking in support of the question addressed to the government so eloquently and so fairly by the noble lord lord mcnair i wish to make two points only <e> <s> the first is to impress upon your lordships house the intense and long-standing nature of the devotion felt by <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to begin my speech by going down a pathway that has not yet been followed in the debate and by thanking the noble lord lord wells-pestell for using the word depend in the motion that he has put before us <e> <s> the noble lords motion includes the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if a cough which becomes worse as the hour gets later makes it impossible for me to stay to the end of the debate <e> <s> i want to take up a point which the noble lord lord chitnis emphasised at the beginning of the debate namely that el salvador is of growing concern to many ordinary people in our country <e> <s> i should like to approach that point by declaring a financial interest in el salvador <e> <s> i do so associating myself with many millions of other ordinary people in this country who have a similar financial stake <e> <s> it is not a financial stake invested in el salvador for purposes of gain however it is a contribution made through christian aid to humanitarian services in that country <e> <s> perhaps i might remind your lordships that million was received by christian aid for disbursement in most of that from house-to-house collections throughout the length and breadth of our country <e> <s> for example million gift envelopes were distributed <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that it is a matter for worldwide discussion rather than for action to be taken in only one country <e> <s> easter is celebrated by christians all over the world <e>", "<cs> my lords many testimonies have already been offered in this house about the high reputation enjoyed by the bbc across the world <e> <s> i would like from personal experience in africa and the middle east to share in that tribute <e> <s> the bbc broadcasts have a standard of integrity and independence which make them deeply valued by audiences all across the world and never more so than in times of crisis danger and uncertainty <e> <s> the noble lord the foreign secretary has shown that he knows that as well as if not better than any other member of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend <e> <s> may i suggest that that is perhaps an argument for making as available as possible the transcription services which through their playing of cultural material enables people to learn english the more quickly and testimony is borne to this by the japanese radio services <e>", "<cs> my lords i count it a great privilege to support the noble lord lord mcnair in encouraging the government to use their influence to help the bahis now facing vehement persecution in iran <e> <s> without any hesitation i would stand by the speeches which have just been made by the noble lords lord mcnair and lord stewart of fulham and associate myself with the descriptions which they have given of the bahi faith and of the reasons why we should be concerned about them and their situation in iran today <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak as a consumer representative about the national health service because i am convinced that i and my family have received more from the national health service than we have ever contributed to it <e> <s> i have no inside or expert knowledge <e> <s> it is true that some years ago i was a part-time employee of a health authority because i was a part-time hospital chaplain but i speak essentially as a patient and as a regular visitor to people in hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is before the general synod of the church of england at the moment draft legislation which if it eventually receives royal assent will make it impossible for a dean and chapter to act unilaterally without obtaining further advice and agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords like other speakers i am grateful to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for introducing this debate because it is recognised by all that this is a matter of growing concern <e> <s> as i represent an organisation which has many people working at ground level so to speak perhaps i may report that it is clearly becoming a widespread concern of the clergy who are in contact with all sorts of people that debt is an increasing social problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i like others am grateful to the noble lord lord stewart for raising this timely debate on the shortage of teachers <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin with an apology <e> <s> i was called to give evidence on behalf of the general synod to the ecclesiastical committee of parliament <e> <s> during the course of that examination i was asked about the number of people likely to be considered under this draft measure <e> <s> i recognise now that i was less than clear in my answers and if in any way i misled the committee i apologise both to the committee and to the house <e> <s> no figures had been ascertained at that stage <e> <s> i could therefore rely only on my own experience <e>", "<cs> my lords the churches have long had a stake in the education of the people of this country <e> <s> increasingly the word that has crystallised our approach has been partnership partnership between church and society in the education of the whole nation <e> <s> we do not see that partnership in terms of the church determined to teach and educate its members in an otherwise secular system nor are we focusing even in county schools on preserving religious education and ignoring the rest of the curriculum <e> <s> we are essentially in partnership with society open in our concern for all in the educational field and working for balance <e>"]
