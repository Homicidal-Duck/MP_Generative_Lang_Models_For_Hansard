["<cs> my lords alone among the list of speakers my name carries parenthetically the letter m <e> <s> i feel as if i were a learner driver and it induces in me a proper degree of respect for the conventions of your lordships house and also a proper degree of trepidation <e> <s> i suspect that i am also alone in the fact that over years ago when i gave my first lecture in cambridge i was criticised for my presumed defects not directly but indirectly <e> <s> it was a lecture theatre which the students entered from the rear and i entered from the front <e> <s> not unnaturally the first few rows of the lecture theatre were unoccupied which i did not consider to be a personal affront to me <e> <s> however i felt it necessary in view of the fact that i had prepared my lecture with such loving care and wanted all the words to fall on the ears of my audience to say foolishly as it turned out can you all hear me <e> <s> there was a slight pause and then a student in the first occupied row said yes sir i can hear you but i am prepared to exchange places with someone else <e>", "<cs> my lords there are no less than recommendations in the croham committees report <e> <s> fortunately many of them are either formalisations or logical extensions to meet todays circumstances of practices which were current when i was chairman of the university grants committee <e> <s> so your lordships will not be surprised to hear that i regard them as entirely praiseworthy <e> <s> since quinquennial funding and <e>", "<cs> my lords the concluding sentence of the governments response to your lordships select committees report on science and technology includes the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words about science in space on which the united kingdom spends through the british national space centre about million a year <e> <s> the very word space presents conceptual problems <e> <s> by definition it is a three-dimensional extent without any limits <e> <s> most of it is a vacuum <e> <s> thus expressed it would seem to have little significance for your lordships who like nature doubtless abhor a vacuum <e> <s> however just because it is limitless and infinite space contains everything in the universe <e> <s> that includes us the inhabitants of this universe <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to follow the chancellor of the university of oxford <e> <s> it is difficult to follow so many vice-chancellors <e> <s> i am mindful of the fact that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor referred to the relationship between vice-chancellors and chancellors <e> <s> having been the one and being now the other i rely upon the definition of an th century divine <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak on this subject <e> <s> having heard so much eloquence expressed in the delightful scottish accent and having heard other eloquent words expressed in an equally delightful english accent and phraseology perhaps i may speak as a yorkshireman who has an alliance with neither of the other two <e> <s> i wish to speak as one who served for five years as chairman of the university grants committee and for whom this particular problem is very familiar <e> <s> it is territory that has been gone over before <e>", "<cs> my lords glasgow is unique in that respect only <e> <s> it is the one university in the united kingdom to which if i remember the figures correctly about per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> of students come from within about miles of glasgow <e> <s> however that is not true for example of edinburgh which has many english students <e> <s> nor is it true of st andrews nor indeed of the highland and islands university of aberdeen with its many students <e> <s> i would say that glasgow is unique not just in scotland but in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to rise again <e> <s> i shall be brief because the hour is late <e> <s> i must be the only person in this house who has been in the position earlier in my life of having been tempted by the devil to apply the method of contract funding to the universities <e> <s> i always resisted it for two very simple reasons <e> <s> the first is this <e> <s> all my experience throughout four universities as a teacher and researcher has taught me one thing <e> <s> it is that the human mind unconstrained by narrow concepts narrowly drawn and specified in contracts is the most secure defence we have for freedom on the one hand and the permitting of the full flowering of the human mind <e> <s> if on the other hand one tells people who have high skills and high intelligence to do something within a narrow framework one will not liberate their intellectual energies and inventiveness one will constrain them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am conscious of the fact that at this hour mine is the twelfth only of scheduled speeches <e> <s> that gives great force to the old latin tag <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add my congratulations to the right reverend prelate the bishop of bradford <e> <s> his was a voice of sanity and humanity which reminded us of some fundamental values in education <e> <s> i would expect no less from one who comes from the west riding of yorkshire <e> <s> i thank also the noble baroness lady blackstone for the debate <e> <s> i confess that when i heard that it was to take place my heart sank first at the prospect of yet another debate on higher education and secondly at the phrase on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that by now noble lords are beginning to feel that the number of words spoken and written about the so-called greenhouse effect is likely soon to exceed the number of molecules of man-made greenhouse gases which are added daily to our atmosphere <e> <s> such torrents of verbiage can be self-defeating <e> <s> i shall therefore be brief <e> <s> i shall not bother your lordships with physics and chemistry despite the invitation from the noble lord lord flowers for me to indulge in my own subject <e> <s> instead i want to emphasise just a few salient points <e>", "<cs> my lords it is extremely difficult to follow such eloquence as has come from the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and with whose views i agree in many respects <e> <s> i want to make it absolutely clear from the beginning that i am not opposed to a mixture of loans and grants as a means of financing students in higher education <e> <s> to adopt that method is merely to systematize a point of equity namely that benefits come to individuals in higher education <e> <s> their life chances are enhanced by it and there are also benefits of a very obvious kind which come to the state <e> <s> i see no objection in the principle <e>", "<cs> i want to make two brief points which relate to my own direct experience of the part-time student <e> <s> to be personal for a moment i had an elder brother who went through that process in the late s <e> <s> i know the degree of hardship involved in studying while one is employed <e> <s> but that is not the major point <e> <s> in connection with operating a charity of which i am chairman i have had a good deal of contact with the students at birkbeck college about whom the noble baroness lady blackstone spoke <e> <s> i want to assure the house and the government that in my long experience within higher educational life i have never come across any other persons so deeply committed to the process of education not just for themselves but also for what they can subsequently give to the community <e> <s> on those grounds alone i believe that it is worth while to support the two amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow the remarks made by the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby by disagreeing with him partly on the basis of my experience as chairman for many years of the national radiological protection board which is a body that sets standards to protect people from ionising and other radiations <e> <s> my experience in that connection throughout many difficult incidents has led me to believe that if this bill were to become law it would succeed only if it achieved two aims and only two aims <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add my congratulations to those of the noble lord lord carr on the witty and moving speech of the noble lord lord clifford which was so full of the common sense by which he and his father set such great store <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can be a little more explicit on the effects of these amendments by reference to my own experience <e> <s> if this group of amendments amendments nos <e> <s> and is accepted it would remove the anomaly to which i drew the attention of the chamber on second reading namely that as the bill is now drafted a nhs trust which is responsible for a teaching hospital would be compelled to have one of its non-executive directors appointed from the university whose students were taught in that hospital <e> <s> health authorities on the other hand would not be compelled to have a member from the university <e> <s> i am sure as i said on second reading the committee will agree that that is illogical <e> <s> i ventured to think that it must be an oversight <e>", "<cs> as the president of the royal postgraduate medical school perhaps i may offer congratulations to the noble lord lord jenkin on taking a bath on that particular evening <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make one comment <e> <s> i hate the word representation and i deliberately avoided it <e> <s> the test here is simple if we want the health authorities in doing their job to have the highest degree of competence it is inevitable that that must mean a university representative <e> <s> perhaps that word should be deleted from the record i mean a person who will inevitably be nominated among others perhaps by the university and who will ultimately be appointed by the secretary of state <e> <s> that is how i look at the matter <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may answer the noble baroness from my experience on the question of getting private money into university teaching hospitals <e> <s> to a certain extent that is achieved by many of the full-time academic staff being allowed to do some private practice provided that it is consonant with the policy of the school concerned and provided that the fees come to the school <e> <s> there has been some discussion recently the universities felt rather strongly about it about the proportion of private practice fees which can be used for personal gain <e> <s> it was felt that the issue might derogate considerably from the universities motive in continuing their own research <e> <s> there is a nice balance to be held <e> <s> it is another reason for having a forum in which both sides are present as of right to hammer out the problems between them <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make a few observations at this point <e> <s> i do not believe that it is realised that what is proposed in the bill is an attenuation of what already exists in terms of the universities involvement in the health authorities <e> <s> the minister said and i believe i heard this correctly that there is nothing to prevent universities somehow being drawn in as non-executive directors if they were trusts which is provided for or drawn into the boards <e> <s> that is quite different from there being a requirement <e>", "<cs> i want only to have that person who is most competent to serve <e> <s> i go back to the principle of competence rather than representativeness <e> <s> in some cases it may be the dean or someone else <e> <s> in the case of the royal post-graduate medical school i believe the minister knows already that we have a special problem <e> <s> under the bill as it now stands and since all the chiefs of service are full-time university employees we are in an interesting paradoxical position <e> <s> as i understand it under the bill the medical director will be ex-officio if it is a trust and an executive director of the institution <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble baroness a further question <e> <s> will that order be available for us to see at the report stage <e>", "<cs> but there will be a firm commitment to it at that stage <e>", "<cs> in those circumstances i am willing to withdraw the amendment at this stage <e>", "<cs> as the debate progressed i was greatly heartened by what seemed to be strong support for the amendment from all sides of the chamber <e> <s> therefore i was correspondingly somewhat disappointed with some of what the minister said in reply <e> <s> clearly we all welcome what is an obvious step namely that the director of research and development must as the noble lord lord carr said have his seat on the executive and his proper place within the structure <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak on amendment no <e> <s> ba <e> <s> this matter follows on rather nicely from the previous point <e> <s> it is inconceivable to me and it certainly would be inconceivable to the chairman of my special health authority at hammersmith that there should not be a medical man as a director in some form or another of the trust were it to become a trust for the simple reason that he handles a large budget <e> <s> he has his own cost centre which is extremely important <e> <s> how he spends his budget is of vital importance financially to the operation of the hospital <e>", "<cs> i find myself in considerable difficulty <e> <s> although the noble baroness has spoken at very great length and i have heard a large number of words i am still perplexed at the reply <e> <s> if she has stated that the secretary of state in his approval of the trusts would ensure that the duty would in practice by whatever means fall upon those trusts which have within them responsibilities for providing the facilities for teaching and research at university medical and dental schools i shall be satisfied <e>", "<cs> i am greatly relieved to know categorically that that is the case <e> <s> it makes my job a good deal easier <e> <s> but it leaves me with the strange logic that one has two institutions on the one hand the health authority and on the other the trust performing very similar tasks <e> <s> one has a constitution under which it is not required to provide facilities for university medical and dental schools and the other has nothing so prescribed within the bill <e> <s> i still find that extremely strange <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble baroness lady cox has just said has an obvious instant and rather sympathetic appeal to us all <e> <s> however i should like to point out that there is a fundamental difference between the amendments proposed by the noble baroness lady young and that which the noble baroness lady cox has moved <e> <s> within the operation of the health service some of the premises are owned many of them are equipped and many of the staff who are there are paid for by the universities <e> <s> reciprocally it is the case that what is done within the universities affects the health service <e> <s> it is therefore of the greatest importance that the university voice should somehow be heard at the decision-making table of the health authorities <e> <s> in the same way the health authorities should have a voice at the highest level of the universities <e> <s> however the latter is not the issue before us today <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with some hesitation but also with a great sense of gratitude to the government for the way in which they have handled the matter in relation to the universities <e> <s> that comes from me perhaps more easily as a yorkshireman once defined as a scot with the generosity squeezed out of him <e> <s> your lordships can imagine my surprise when there was such a quick response from the government this evening to the amendment of the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour <e> <s> that seems to me to typify the way the government have met points that have been put forward <e> <s> it was stated by the noble baroness lady young that they were put on behalf of the universities <e> <s> i do not think that points made by many speakers in your lordships house on education and research can or should be considered as being on behalf of the universities <e> <s> those of us interested in the issue have been trying to ensure the success of the national health service in its various forms or years from now <e> <s> that will depend solely on the quality of the doctors whom we produce and the resources which are available <e> <s> those resources include the knowledge that will be won by research <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to join in congratulations to the noble lord lord soulsby of swaffham prior who has drawn our attention to the fact that the annual influx of able young people is indeed the lifeblood of all universities <e> <s> i am pleased to have him here as a champion in our midst <e> <s> he is very welcome and we thank him for his splendid maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the polytechnics do not cover any of the expensive subjects such as medicine dentistry agriculture or veterinary science <e> <s> there is no point in taking average figures unless one takes account of the great range of unit costs <e> <s> if one makes the proper allowances the situation is entirely different <e>"]
