["<cs> my lords it gives me particular pleasure today to be speaking in a debate on the railways which has been introduced by the noble lord lord marsh <e> <s> he and i have worked very closely together in a variety of ways since when he was minister of power in a previous government and subsequently when he was chairman of british rail <e> <s> i have always found him stimulating witty and practical <e> <s> his speech this afternoon fully justifies that view <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate so far has shown that although this apparently relatively small matter could have been settled quite easily by being allowed to drag on in this way it has raised a number of much more fundamental issues <e> <s> at this late hour i should like to confine my few remarks to one such issue <e> <s> i contend that at the present time more perhaps than at most times in our history it is necessary for this country to be able to project itself effectively abroad <e> <s> a proper understanding of our affairs our thinking and our approach to life can bring tangible benefits in providing a better climate for our exports <e> <s> it can bring intangible benefits by enabling us more effectively to participate with other nations in dealing with some of the very difficult issues which face us all <e> <s> at the very time therefore when we should be expanding the means that we use to project ourselves abroad it is sad to note that repeated proposals appear to be made to move in the opposite direction <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister whether in reference to the cheapness of french electricity he could indicate to us what are the losses made by the french electricity industry compared with the profits made by the british electricity industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with those who have paid tribute to the noble lord lord soames for so eloquently introducing this most important motion <e> <s> as has just been said he drew particular attention echoed by other noble lords who have spoken to the importance of the forthcoming williamsburg conference <e> <s> there seems to be no doubt about that sentiment in the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl referred to the amount of public funds payable to the national coal board <e> <s> would be agree that on a per tonne basis the national coal board is in receipt of substantially less from government funds than is the case in any other west european coal-producing country <e> <s> secondly would he also agree that a large amount of these borrowings and these funds is due to the fact that the coal board under the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in the tribute paid by the noble earl lord lauderdale to the noble lord lord taylor of hadfield <e> <s> i have had the privilege of knowing him for a good many years and in my previous activities dealt a great deal with his company which he founded as he explained to us and led with such distinction and still leads to the great benefit of all who have dealt with it <e> <s> it is a particular personal delight to me to feel that we shall be colleagues in the house even though we are looking at each other across the chamber <e>", "<cs> as someone who was concerned for some years with the management of a public corporation i should like to express a degree of concern about the matters being dealt with under these two amendments <e> <s> it seems to me that the government are here proposing to take certain specific rights of intervention which are generally absent in the case of other corporations <e> <s> indeed the directions which the government usually give are of a general nature <e> <s> i recall that there was a discussion in the early days of this government in which there was some debate as to whether or not the government should take on specific powers of direction and the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like as have other noble lords to express appreciation to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe for introducing this motion <e> <s> i am only sorry like him that this matter should have been the subject of a short debate because i feel that we are tackling one of the fundamental aspects of our industrial economy <e> <s> i should also like to express my personal appreciation to the noble lord lord beswick for the kind remarks he made on my account <e>", "<cs> my lords i still fail to see what harm would be done so long as public enterprises were limited in the amount of money they could borrow were controlled as to their investment which they are and were then left to borrow that amount as best they could and before going outside the national loan fund were to advise the government that they were doing it <e> <s> that would be one small way in which they could operate more commercially without any conceivable harm to the national economy <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord strabolgi on the ground that i think it most important when the effective use of energy is so vital to this country that we should be giving local authorities every conceivable stimulus to use their powers and their skills to make sure that in their conversion of refuse into heat and electricity they can dispose of the resultant electricity as freely as anybody else <e> <s> i should declare an interest since i am the chairman of a heat service company which is working very closely with the glc on this very subject <e> <s> the prospects are very considerable <e> <s> the bill provides us with the opportunity to give full stimulus to local authorities to go ahead with these projects <e> <s> i believe therefore that the amendments proposed by the noble lord are worthy of the full support of this committee <e>", "<cs> i support the plea that the noble earl lord lauderdale has addressed to the government benches that this whole matter be reconsidered in line with what has already been agreed by the noble earl the minister in relation to a previous amendment <e> <s> the position of the local authorities in this whole matter is crucial <e> <s> they need to be given every encouragement <e> <s> already many officials in local authorities and elected members are very keen on going ahead in this field <e> <s> however if it is felt by them as is evidenced by the letter some of us have received from the association of county councils that they feel they are somehow being discriminated against then a worthy and desirable endeavour may be limited in its application <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the view expressed by the noble viscount lord hanworth <e> <s> financial viability can be regarded in a variety of ways <e> <s> if all projects are to be treated on the same relatively short-term basis there is no doubt that schemes of this sort will not come into effect <e> <s> these are long-term schemes requiring fairly large amounts of money <e> <s> they may cost a good deal in capital investment in the initial stages in order to bring long-term benefits <e> <s> i hope very much that even if the amendment cannot be accepted the government will make clear that the term financial viability is to be interpreted fairly flexibly in relation to these important schemes that can bring such important long-term benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords there is not the slightest doubt that the subject which has been introduced by the noble lord lord kirkhill is one of the greatest importance <e> <s> he has spoken on it with a depth of understanding of the problem <e> <s> the noble earl lord lauderdale has treated us as we have come to expect to a vigorous <e>", "<cs> my lords if i could reply to the noble earl i am not talking about power stations <e> <s> i am talking about general usage in industry to which he was referring and about the enormous potential there is in industry for the conversion of boilers from oil and gas to coal <e> <s> there is a substantial financial advantage in so doing <e> <s> the thermal cost of coal is very much lower than that of oil or gas and rightly so <e> <s> there is now encouragement by the government in grants of up to per cent <e> <s> of the cost of conversion and there are benefits being provided by the european community <e> <s> these are things that are moving in the right direction <e>", "<cs> my lords will the house allow me to comment on that <e> <s> i believe that the battersea station has been closed down because its life as a power station has come to an end not its life as a combined heat and power plant <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that in the very desirable improvement in the competitiveness of british industry the basic industries have also played their part <e> <s> these basic industries play an essential role in the revival of the british economy and should be regarded in that sense <e>", "<cs> my lords we have all listened with great care to what the noble earl the minister has said <e> <s> i still feel that it would have been desirable for the cegb to publish its tariffs and then negotiate around those tariffs in the normal negotiating manner <e> <s> however if he has given us the assurance that any negotiation conducted by the cegb will take full account of the terms on which electricity boards negotiate and that it will not as a result of its central position discriminate in any way against those negotiating with it i am happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord strabolgi and supported by the noble lord lord balogh <e> <s> this is a very moderate amendment and entirely in keeping with the sense of the bill <e> <s> we are suggesting here that local authorities which take the initiative to generate electricity by using waste products to greater advantage than has so far been the case should be entitled to negotiate with the electricity authorities to transmit that electricity to other local authority locations <e> <s> this is what the bill proposes for private enterprise which takes such an initiative in generating its own electricity <e> <s> there is no restriction to the generation of electricity on the basis of waste it can generate it on the basis of any fuel it likes <e> <s> so this seems to be a discrimination against the initiative which could be shown by local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been closely associated with an energy consumers council for many years and as their name suggests what they like to have done to them is to be consulted <e> <s> they are not experts in most of the technical fields for which they are being consulted and nor i suggest in this particular case would the secretary of state himself be an expert in metering <e> <s> he depends upon technical advice <e> <s> the purpose of this amendment is that the technical advice should be rendered both to the secretary of state and to the consumers council and that they should consult together in order to decide what are desirable meters and what are not <e> <s> i would hope therefore and it is not my intention to press this amendment in withdrawing this amendment that the secretary of state would however be prepared to consult with the consumers council in these decisions in order to make sure that there is nothing in their view that might be contrary to his opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords we have heard what the noble earl the minister has said <e> <s> it is quite clear that it is the governments view that the electricity authority should do everything possible to promote the development of chp <e> <s> it still puzzles me somewhat as to why if that is their intention they cannot state it in the bill <e> <s> however if the answer is very clear as a result of this discussion and what the noble earl the minister previously said namely that they wanted the authorities to promote this but for some reason which is unclear to some of us do not actually want to say so then i should be very happy to leave matters there <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the noble earl the minister has said i do not wish to press this amendment <e> <s> i would only remind the house that we as a country are lagging far behind many continental countries in the application of this type of scheme <e> <s> denmark sweden germany france and many other continental countries have gone much further ahead than we have and i believe we have lagged behind because of our ambivalence and uncertainty about these projects <e> <s> if we want to go ahead with them there must be a determination and a will so to do <e> <s> if we remain ambivalent and uncertain we shall find that these other countries will get ahead of us in the efficiency with which they utilise electricity and other forms of energy <e> <s> with those remarks i am quite ready to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might make a short contribution <e> <s> i was very struck by the judicious comments made by the noble earl lord de la warr and the noble lord lord orr-ewing because it seemed to me that they had very carefully considered this problem and on the whole had inclined towards the view that there should be a single director in charge of this operation <e> <s> i have had experience of running a fairly large organisation for many years and i have also thought about this in the light of that experience <e> <s> after the same careful thought as those noble lords gave to this problem i have come to the conclusion that bearing in mind that this is a totally new experiment in a very large sector of industry we would on balance be better advised to set up a council alongside the director general so as to make people feel that there was full representation at the top of the body which would set the rules and see that they were carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords we all owe a debt of gratitude to the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos for introducing this very important debate particularly at this time <e> <s> i do not believe that your lordships house could be debating a subject of greater importance than this one nor at a more relevant time <e> <s> as a relatively newly-arrived member of your lordships assembly i regard it as a very great honour to be able to participate in the debate <e> <s> i also regard it as a very great honour to be speaking after the noble lord lord thorneycroft whom i have known for many years during the course of his very distiguished career <e> <s> i have had the opportunity of working closely with him particularly when he was the first chairman of the british overseas trade board <e> <s> i fully concur with his view which he so eloquently expressed that we must do everything within our might to develop our trading position in a free and liberalised trading world <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i should like to comment on that point <e> <s> i am conscious of the need to ensure that we keep to our international obligations <e> <s> the whole purpose of the purchasing policy that i was proposing was that we would be purchasing from home sources because they were competitive with overseas sources <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to come along tonight and speak about nationalised industry but to range more widely on our economic affairs <e> <s> however as a number of noble lords opposite have severely criticised the nationalised industries particularly the noble lords lord cocklield lord boyd-carpenter and lord vaizey and as i appear to be the only speaker in todays debate with first-hand experience of nationalised industry <e> <s> i feel that i should say something about it <e> <s> i hope very much that their criticisms were not directed at people who work in the nationalised industries <e> <s> i can say from my long years of experience that the management and the people who work in those industries are as good as efficient and as effective as those who work in any other part of british industry <e> <s> if there was any suggestion that those who happen by chance or desire to work in nationalised industry are somehow second-class industrial citizens of our country i hope that the noble earl lord gowrie will make clear that this is not in the governments mind to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall consult the noble lord lord vaizey on my horticultural phraseology <e> <s> all i was saying was that i thought this delicate state of affairs needs to be dealt with in such a way that we can spread i hope that that will be permissible the degree of improvement that is apparent in certain regions and in certain sectors <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of the answers given by the noble lord the minister i should still like to suggest that this is a very disturbing trend <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord what measures the government propose to take either through the british overseas trade board or in other ways to reverse this trend <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord the minister whether in pursuit of this humanitarian objective the government are putting aside funds to aid medical research to deal with these unfortunate conditions shortly after birth <e> <s> if we can save children from getting into these conditions after birth then obviously the whole problem can be very much diminished <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that in any future strategy for the coal industry a high level of investment should be maintained in order to make the best and most efficient use of this valuable resource and furthermore to facilitate the progressive replacement of high-cost capacity <e>", "<cs> my lords may i as someone who has been on the other side of the fence so far as consumer councils are concerned put it to the noble lord the minister that it is highly desirable that we should take this question of consumer representation very seriously because i believe that the enterprises themselves can gain a great deal by having a responsible well-organised consumer organisation to help them run their affairs effectively <e>", "<cs> my lords in putting a point to the noble lord lord belstead on the statement i would declare an interest as i am chairman of the british iron and steel consumers council <e> <s> i should like to join with other noble lords who have spoken in welcoming the increase in the quota which i think will be of benefit not only to producers but also to users <e> <s> i was particularly pleased however to hear that there is a likelihood that the port talbot investment will now go ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware of the fact that the consensus of economic forecasts is that the present high level of unemployment is likely to remain for at least another year and possibly two <e> <s> in view of that very serious prospect what are the policies of her majestys government to alleviate that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with the noble lord lord bruce of donington not only in expressing concern at the late arrival of the statement but even more so at its very exiguous nature <e> <s> it would have been helpful to us who have to speak on this statement if we had at least had a summary of some of the reductions to be made drawing attention to their nature instead of having the detailed statement put in our hands at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret to be so lengthy but it is mainly because we were given so little information that i am making a little more of a probing effort <e> <s> i will certainly now limit my remaining remarks <e> <s> they are these <e> <s> i believe and i would put it to the noble lord the minister that we should have been better served if we had had a longer period for mature reflection on this issue <e> <s> the sudden introduction of these changes with a degree of uncertainty as to where we are going in financial policy has been not only unexpected but i believe harmful <e> <s> i think some words of reassurance about how these matters will be dealt with in the future would be most helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that answer <e> <s> will the noble lord not agree that generally speaking interest rates within britain and the community are still too high to facilitate the recovery of industry for which we are all waiting <e> <s> does he not think that it would be a desirable initiative for her majestys government to try to lead the community in bringing down interest rates and thus have an impact on countries outside the community which may have higher rates <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for the remark that he has made <e> <s> may i ask him whether this measure that he has reiterated will take place as soon as possible to enable industry to get going again <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with those who have paid tribute to my noble friend lord byers in introducing this very important motion which has given us an opportunity of airing our views <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for that reply i should like to ask him whether taking into account the conclusions of both the civic trusts report of this year and the armitage committees report of he will consider supporting the carrying out of comprehensive pilot studies in one or more counties to ascertain what measures can be taken either by the construction of by-passes or by other means to reduce the effect of heavy lorries on the environment <e> <s> that is a question <e>", "<cs> my lords may i <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a very brief question <e> <s> i should just like to ask whether the government are <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl kindly say bearing in mind that closures of pits which are past their prime is only one part of the strategy for the coal mining industry that the government will maintain the policy of substantial investment in new capacity to replace the capacity which is taken out <e> <s> moreover will the noble earl confirm that the government will maintain investment in new and advanced coal mining technology in which britain at the moment leads the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i join the noble viscount lord whitelaw and the noble lord lord barnett in congratulating the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter on choosing such an important subject for debate today <e> <s> he has worded the motion in such a way that we need not be too repetitive <e> <s> it covers such a wide range of important topics that i believe most of us will try to choose one particular angle on which to concentrate <e>", "<cs> if so i should like to say that i heartily concur with that sentiment and i should like to make a small suggestion here <e> <s> if we take our minds to the province of alberta in canada a province which has been blessed with very substantial mineral resources they realised that those resources would not last for ever a large part of the proceeds which the government gained from the exploitation of those resources they put into what they called a heritage fund and that fund has been used to develop longer lasting industrial activities <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord boardman for letting me speak on this question of the brickworks <e> <s> if i may i should like to correct the record slightly <e> <s> i should also like to say that our relations with the noble lord were always amicable while he was a minister <e> <s> the point is not that we did not want to sell off the brickworks we wanted to get a good price for them <e> <s> it was my task to nurse those brickworks and i <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with the noble lord lord bruce of donington in congratulating the noble lord lord greenhill of harrow on the way in which he presented this very important report <e> <s> as someone who has been involved for many years in the operations of the european community the report struck me as being extremely well-balanced judicious and careful in its findings <e> <s> it was charting territory which is extremely complex to chart because it was trying to identify the community effect on trading patterns which are inevitably influenced by a whole variety of factors <e> <s> i believe that the conclusions reached are as fair and as proper as anyone could reach in a study of this sort on this subject <e> <s> i believe that the work done by the sub-committee will considerably enhance the growing reputation of your lordships select committee on the european communities <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may enlighten the noble lord i was referring to the total manufactured trade of the united kingdom not only its manufactured trade <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome from these benches this review of regional economic policy <e> <s> we also welcome the publication of the white paper look forward to studying it and appreciate the time given for consultation <e> <s> we also welcome the greater emphasis being put on job creation and the extension of such aids as may be available to the service sector as well as to the manufacturing sector <e> <s> i should like to put to the noble lord the minister a question for elucidation <e> <s> first of all he mentioned that regional development grants will in future be payable only towards projects which provide for modernised capacity and that simple replacement investment will not qualify <e> <s> we feel that this could be a very subjective judgment as to what is replacement and what is new investment <e> <s> we consider that if there is a good replacement project which will maintain or possibly even improve employment prospects in a given area this also should rate for grant <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that the nationalised industries have achieved a remarkable success in purchasing on a competitive basis from this country the vast bulk of their supplies averaging over per cent <e> <s> in the case of the national coal board which i had the honour of serving together with the noble lord lord gormley the industry achieved even more than that <e> <s> would the noble lord kindly indicate to us in percentage terms what success has been achieved by government departments and agencies directly responsible to government in the purchase of goods produced in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that whereas the trend in our balance of trade with france shows a favourable tendency when one looks at the whole of western europe and if one compares the first nine months of this year with the first nine months of last year one sees that there has been a growth of no less than billion in the trade deficit <e> <s> will the noble lord agree that this deterioration calls for an urgent review of our trading position with western europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon in expressing appreciation to the noble earl the minister for the clear way in which he has put this bill before us for its second reading <e> <s> it is as he indicated a short-term measure to give further financial support to the coal industry in its present difficult circumstances <e> <s> i can say as the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon said that we on these benches will also facilitate its passage through the house <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene <e> <s> i should like to make my point quite clear <e> <s> i do not believe it would be healthy in the longer term for the industry to have to depend upon grants in order to pay interest <e> <s> we should find some other more effective longer-term financial structure <e> <s> that was what i had in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister kindly advise us whether there is a broad strategy on research and development into energy and whether the research and development undertaken on renewable sources is related to the research and development effort into other forms of energy <e> <s> also is this kept constantly under review by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords we have on many occasions in the recent past addressed ourselves to the subject of the infrastructure and investment in it <e> <s> in spite of that i believe that the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos is entirely justified in introducing a motion today as a result of which we can re-examine this vital issue <e> <s> looking at the problem of the infrastructure of britain the physical infrastructure we would <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord kindly care to comment on the situation in the united states as opposed to that in france where substantial economic recovery has been stimulated with a reduction in both unemployment and inflation <e> <s> is that not the example that we should set ourselves here <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the continuing although reduced deficit on tourist account will the noble lord indicate what measures have been taken to stimulate what one might call indigenous tourism <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can clarify that point <e> <s> i said that it had been generally recognised that we must have modification of the common agricultural policy <e> <s> i said that the problem we now face has been exacerbated by the fact that we have allowed it to run on for as long as we have <e> <s> but on the other hand in seeking any solution i said that if we were too drastic we could undo the benefits which we had achieved for the farming community over past years <e> <s> those were the remarks i made <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to interrupt again but i really must correct that impression <e> <s> i do not recall having said anything of the sort <e> <s> the line i was taking was that i believed that by coming forward with positive proposals to resolve these very real problems of the community we could serve both our own interests as a nation and the interests of the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my appreciation to all who have spoken in this debate <e> <s> it would have given me very great pleasure to identify a number of the points that have been made and to underline them or comment on them <e> <s> but we are at an advanced hour there is other business to be transacted so i shall limit myself to expressing my appreciation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble earl for that answer <e> <s> is he satisfied that sufficient resources have backed this campaign <e> <s> in particular will he say whether in order to encourage consumers of both the domestic and industrial market some incentives of a financial nature will be offered <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that there have been press reports that the advisory council on energy conservation might be disbanded <e> <s> would he indicate to us whether this is so in view of the new initiative which the government are taking in this field <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble earl whether his attention has been drawn to a recent article in <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that a great deal has been achieved in british airways under the chairmanship of the noble lord lord king of wartnaby <e> <s> furthermore and following a previous supplementary would he not agree that this demonstrates that the question of ownership is largely irrelevant to the success or failure of an enterprise <e>", "<cs> in rising to support the amendment so ably moved by my noble friend lord lloyd of kilgerran i should like to suggest that the government ought to be very pleased by this proposition <e> <s> the bill contemplates the unique transfer of a massive concentration of industrial and technological might from the public to the private sector <e> <s> it is a totally new venture and in carrying it out we need to exercise extreme caution <e> <s> the appointment of a single official with his very large and wide-ranging powers to try to regulate this operation virtually on his own with the secretary of state coming in behind him as a supervisor does not seem to me to provide the reassurance which the public will be looking for <e> <s> therefore we need to devote some attention to the kind of body which should be set up <e> <s> whether it be precisely in the terms proposed by my noble friend or in some other way could be debated but that there ought to be some body of people who are skilled in the various aspects of these matters and who could have a supervisory role over the whole operation seems to me to be highly desirable <e> <s> that body must clearly be separate and distinct from government <e> <s> it should be a body in which the public can feel that regular supervision is being exercised and that there is not an undue concentration of power in the hands of one man in this unique transfer of industrial power from the public to the private sector <e>", "<cs> in his very reasoned reply to the amendment the noble lord lord cockfield referred to clause which makes provision for the establishment of certain advisory bodies <e> <s> the weakness in clause i submit is that those advisory bodies would be appointed by the director himself he would appoint them if he wished and he would nominate their members <e> <s> it seems to me that this is a very weak alternative to the independent advisory body my noble friend has proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just add to the noble lords comments on this matter that in my personal experience there is an enormous possibility for technological transfer in this area <e> <s> i have been personally involved in a project known as the ocean thermal conversion technology in which i believe that our expertise in the united kingdom could add enormously to developing the resources of the deep sea and in which i believe we shall be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am putting this point to the noble lord as something that could add to his comments <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to intervene very briefly and i am grateful for having been allowed a short time to do so <e> <s> there are two issues here one is the broad political international issue which was dealt with so eloquently by the noble lord lord caradon in introducing this motion and secondly there is the commercial and technological issue <e> <s> having been involved in some of the technology of producing energy out of deep seas that has been developed in this country i should like to ask the noble baroness lady young when she replies to say whether she believes in this transfer of technology and in using the technology that has been developed here that we would not be in a better position to do that by signing this convention than by not signing it <e> <s> we have in britain a great wealth of expertise <e> <s> we have explored the deep sea <e> <s> we have now developed ways in which the deep sea can yield up new resources for the benefit of the world <e> <s> would we not be better off if we joined with the rest of the world in signing this convention than if we tried to go on our own <e> <s> that is the specific issue i should like to raise <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment because i believe that in an area such as that of the telecommunications service there is an element of social obligation just as there is an element of social obligation in the supply of railway and other basic services <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington in moving the amendment has made it quite clear that care will have to be exercised in determining what need is <e> <s> there can be circumstances in rural and remote areas and areas of social deprivation as indicated in this proposal where there is a need for having telephone boxes which might not necessarily be profitable <e> <s> so i hope that the spirit of this amendment will be accepted and that it is also accepted that there is an element of social obligation in the provision of such a basic service as telecommunications <e>", "<cs> despite what the noble lord lord glenarthur has said there seem to be some areas of uncertainty in this issue <e> <s> for one thing it appears that the director has to use his judgment as to whether the facilities should be maintained or left in place <e> <s> secondly the level of access charges seems to be a matter determined by the company <e> <s> i would have thought that it would be best for all concerned for the companies for the director and for the public if this whole issue was clarified more than it is at present in the legislation <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a few remarks to what my noble friend lord taylor of gryfe has said <e> <s> while i was with the national coal board i played a fairly considerable part in introducing the concept of positive purchasing within the nationalised industries and we achieved a very high level of home purchasing on a competitive basis <e> <s> the question which arises which my noble friend touched on as did other noble lords in this very important issue is what is going to happen in the new framework within which this major enterprise is going to operate <e> <s> sir george jefferson has given these assurances but he said if i am quoting the noble lord correctly in the immediate future <e> <s> sir george jefferson of course will be moving on in due course and no doubt taking up other jobs <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> we on these benches attach very great importance to this question <e> <s> it may be that the wording is something that can be changed <e> <s> i should like to feel that in order to try to expedite proceedings and not put this matter to the vote at least we could get an assurance from the noble lord that further consideration would be given to introducing into some other part of the bill assurances that the very high standards so far maintained by british telecom under their present status will be continued in the future and that endeavours will be made to that end <e>", "<cs> on that basis i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to say in answer to the points just raised by the noble lord lord morris that we are here talking not about a tier of government or a tier of an executive nature but about a regulatory body <e> <s> if this regulatory body is to have the credibility which i believe will be very necessary in this major change in the running of a big organisation like the telecommunications industry then it must be seen to be credible <e> <s> one of the weaknesses in the organisation of this regulatory body is that so much is concentrated in one man everything centres on the director <e> <s> if there were a council of the sort so ably recommended by the noble lord lord bruce of donington i cannot personally see how it would do otherwise than strengthen the nature of this body <e>", "<cs> is the noble and learned lord indicating that this future statement will deal with the whole issue <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble and learned lord whether the proposed statement is likely to refer to other amendments which we have already discussed or might be likely to discuss or is it solely related to the amendment that we have just been discussing <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord somers in this proposition <e> <s> it seems to me that if one of the objectives is to ensure that the director and the secretary of state conform and to make sure that there is conformity with the important clause the word shall is much more appropriate than may <e> <s> for that reason alone the amendment is worthy of support <e>", "<cs> would the noble and learned lord perhaps consider separating clause <e>", "<cs> i should like to support those in favour of the amendment <e> <s> if it is thought desirable to introduce it into the licence if it is conditional and if it provides on the face of it an additional safeguard for users it seems to me to be wholly in the spirit of the bill and it is desirable to introduce it <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to speak in this important debate i should like to crave the indulgence of the house if i leave before it is terminated because some months ago i committed myself to going to eastbourne to speak to a large gathering on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl whether in the preparation of the reply that we are all anxiously awaiting account will be taken of the fact that these major schemes will involve long lead-times and a long payback period and whether special provision will be made for that <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that despite the great efforts of exporters which have been referred to by the noble lord lord thorneycroft this is indeed a very serious trend in view of the likely prospect over the next few years with north sea oil revenues diminishing <e> <s> would he indicate his views as to what the likely trend in the balance of our manufacturing goods is likely to be in the coming year <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel a certain diffidence in intervening at this stage of the debate because we have had three such eminent speakers before me two noble lords both former chief secretaries to the treasury with whom one would not dare to argue on their financial skill not that i would because i agreed with everything they said <e> <s> then we had the noble earl lord bessborough with his great political experience <e> <s> i feel diffident also because it may not be possible for me to remain throughout the period of this debate due to a long-standing commitment for dinner <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indebted for the noble earls reply <e> <s> may i ask him however how he reconciles what he has just said with the recent findings of the report issued by the energy committee in another place in regard to the intended electricity price increases <e> <s> is he aware that they found that there was in their opinion no economic or commercial ground for such increases and that to use their own words the only plausible reason for such increases was the determination of the government to raise additional revenue <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the supplementary question asked by the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne will not the noble earl agree that in the discussion of this matter it would be much simpler if the government were to admit that this was a revenue raising operation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble earl for that reply may i ask him whether he would agree that in the s we could well once again be a net oil importing country and in the light of that prospective situation we ought to be putting in hand immediately a very detailed study of the prospects and initiating a public debate thereon <e> <s> would he therefore tell us whether the government would propose to do those things <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his reply <e> <s> would he not agree that this is a very important market <e> <s> it is one which has been built up at great cost and with great success <e> <s> it is therefore important that people should know where supplies will be coming from in due course <e> <s> the noble earl referred to imports <e> <s> will be kindly indicate to us what are the options so far as importing gas is concerned and whether he will be contemplating a pipeline connection with the continent <e>", "<cs> my lords the special importance of the report which we are debating today and on which the noble lord lord obrien and his sub-committee have rightly been congratulated lies in the clarity and brevity with which they have set out the problems now confronting the european community and in my few remarks i propose to follow the example of their brevity <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment so ably moved by the noble lord lord stoddart <e> <s> as he stated in moving the amendment it is common ground in this house that we should be supporting by all the means at our disposal the development of our communications industry <e> <s> what more appropriate means could be devised than to use all or at least a major part of the proceeds from the sale of the telecommunications industry to the public <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness confirm that it will remain an objective of the governments policy to pursue positive purposes within the european community the creation of a real common market collaboration in technical development creation of western europe as an important world power and that it will be demonstrated that the negotiation over the budget contributions and the negotiation over the common agricultural policy are subservient to those important objectives <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all members of this house very much regret that this dispute should be taking place <e> <s> it raises three questions at present <e> <s> the first is can the government tell us in view of the situation now developing whether they can see any way in which this can be brought to a speedy end by action on the part of any of the parties concerned <e> <s> it may be a difficult thing to say but clearly it is necessary from industrys point of view and from the countrys point of view that this dispute should be ended as quickly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords the great merit of the important motion which has been so ably introduced by the noble lord lord beswick is that it is possible to choose one or more of the items without dealing with the whole lot and at this advanced hour of our debate i shall try to be selective as indeed was the noble lord lord mcintosh who has just spoken <e> <s> as he pointed out we have had a series of very eloquent speeches made on the subject of the third world and i should like to join in particular my noble friend lord walston in paying tribute to the noble lord lord soper for his very learned and compelling speech in which he drew our attention to the moral aspects of the third world problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble earl for that reply may i ask him whether he is aware that on an authoritative estimate it is considered that starting in after the present programme has been completed something of the order of million to million per annum should be spent on the development of alternative energy sources in order to achieve results which would justify previous expenditure <e> <s> i should be very glad if he would comment on that estimate <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say to the noble earl that i would never do anything that would take the place of coal <e> <s> all that i would do would be to supplement coal <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble earl for that reply may i ask him whether he considers in the light of the european agreement to which he has referred that there will be a beneficial impact on the development of our energy strategy by collaborating in this way with our european partners as this will diminish the cost that we would otherwise be involved in if we were to go on our own and increase our technological capability <e>", "<cs> my lords may i in my turn thank all noble lords who have contributed to this very important debate <e> <s> it is a pity that it had to be constrained within such a short time but it is remarkable how much wisdom has been distilled during that period <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to the minister for having given us such a wide-ranging reply and i know that he had to speak fairly rapidly covering most of the points raised <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl not agree that there is some risk of confusion surrounding the fixation of electricity prices in this country <e> <s> further-more would he not agree that if the european commissions ideas on price transparency and energy were to be applied electricity prices in britain would not stand up very well to such an examination <e>", "<cs> my lords during the course of this important debate two overriding issues have emerged <e> <s> the first is the constitutional issue <e> <s> several of us feel misgivings on that score <e> <s> these were very powerfully ventilated and exposed in the remarkable speech made by my noble friend lord hooson during the course of which he quoted the most impeccable source <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the very encouraging report that the noble earl gave us would be agree in view of the fact that the peak of our activities in the north sea is likely to be reached very soon that it should be the objective of the government to see that this becomes one of the growth industries of britain worldwide that we do not limit ourselves purely to our own shores but that we go out for business on the basis of a very determined plan <e>", "<cs> my lords all noble lords who have spoken so far have rightly deplored the scenes of violence which were witnessed yesterday <e> <s> these indeed exceed anything that has occurred in an industrial dispute since the war and far exceed even those scenes of violence which occurred in the miners strike <e> <s> so we must by every possible means ensure that these scenes do not recur <e> <s> it is therefore necessary to try to consider what are the causes of this dispute continuing <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that there is growing uncertainty in the public mind about the relations of government with nationalised industries and that the time has come when this situation should be clarified in the form of a white paper or by other means as previous governments have done <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord the minister for that information may i ask him whether or not he is aware that during the course of our adverse balance on manufactured goods with germany alone was no less than billion and that adverse trend is now looking worse so far this year <e> <s> in view of the fact that we are also encountering similar difficulties with other countries although not on such a large scale would the noble lord the minister not agree that it is now time to take very urgent action to correct this trend and would he kindly advise the house what the government have in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the intervention of the noble lord lord thorneycroft with whom i had much contact in the british overseas trade board may i now say that of course i see the importance of multilateralism <e> <s> my question was related to the federal republic of germany as one of our major competitors <e> <s> what i should like to ask the noble lord the minister is this if the federal republic of germany have built up such a very positive balance in their manufactures with us both in motor-cars and in other products can we not at least study the way in which they have achieved this both by the policies of government and by the reactions of industry and see if we can follow in that direction <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord indicated what was earned by foreign tourists coming to britain <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl kindly indicate whether he considers that the governments privatisation policy both past and present will necessarily lead to greater competitiveness <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the sympathetic reception which the government are apparently giving to the cbi report may i ask whether the proposal for increasing the essential road-building programme by the modest extent of million per annum over the next decade is acceptable to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the department of transport have estimated that road traffic could increase by no less than per cent <e> <s> between now and the end of the century is the noble earl going to tell us he is satisfied that the road building programme is going to be adequate to meet that increased need <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not extraordinary that this problem should recur regularly in certain parts of the country every time we have the slightest spell of warm weather <e> <s> why do we not have a water supply system that can supply water when people need it <e>", "<cs> my lords the big advantage that my noble friend lord diamond has conferred on us this afternoon is not only the timeliness of the motion that he has put to the house but also the wide ranging way in which it has been framed <e> <s> it enables those who speak to choose particular aspects instead of going over the same ground again <e> <s> i should like to choose the aspect of the levels of industrial production and the state of the infrastructure <e> <s> i should like to get there by considering for a moment some of the difficulties that i feel we are confronting as a nation <e> <s> whether these difficulties are due to external or internal factors they are nevertheless difficulties <e> <s> they are emerging in different ways <e> <s> for example one rather unsettling report in the newspapers this morning is the cbi quarterly review <e> <s> it is the most disturbing quarterly review for the past months still on balance optimistic but the measure of optimism has been very much reduced <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene and thank the noble earl for giving way i certainly had no <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the noble lord lord stoddart in thanking the noble earl for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> however as the noble lord lord stoddart made clear the statement simply summarises what occurred in the mining industry during the recess <e> <s> what it does not do is indicate what other steps the government may now have in mind to try to accelerate the conclusion of this unfortunate dispute <e> <s> it would be useful to hear from the noble earl what thoughts the government have in that connection however difficult it may be <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to intervene very briefly in this debate so ably introduced by the noble lord lord obrien <e> <s> i wish to make only one point <e> <s> that point is to remind ourselves that the communitys regional development policy can form only one part of a wider-ranging initiative which is now required to address itself to the basic economic industrial and social problems facing the community as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> would he not agree that too little is being spent on energy efficiency and conservation <e> <s> this is an area to which the government are devoting a great deal of attention <e> <s> does he not believe that the efforts being made by the secretary of state for energy to spread the concept of energy efficiency could be supported by a greater allocation of research and development expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for that information may i ask whether he is aware of the research carried out by the keep britain tidy group with which i happen to be connected which has proved conclusively that most of the litter on our beaches particularly bordering the north sea and the channel derives from the dumping of garbage by ships at sea <e> <s> in those circumstances why is great britain one of the few maritime nations that has not signed annex v of the convention to which the noble lord refers <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to put to the noble viscount a question arising out of the discussions on economic strategy briefly referred to by my noble friend lord gladwyn <e> <s> it was satisfactory to note that some time was devoted to this matter and that in particular it was considered that an attempt should be made to increase productive employment <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all indebted to the noble lord lord irving of dartford for having raised this important question <e> <s> in my remarks i should like to complement and support what he has had to say <e> <s> i should also as he has done like to declare an interest in this matter as i am chairman of the keep britain tidy group and have been involved in all aspects of the problem of litter abatement waste collection disposal recycling and reclamation <e> <s> i have mentioned all those words because i believe that this is and has to be seen as a comprehensive process <e> <s> there are many valuable efforts being made at the present time at various stages of the process but it is a comprehensive continuous process which needs to be encouraged in that form <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to thank the noble lord for repeating the statement <e> <s> i should like to say first that we on these benches fully support the intention of the government to review the banking supervisory arrangements <e> <s> we possess in britain one of the most efficient and reliable banking establishments in the world and as necessary we need to ensure that that continues whenever weaknesses arise <e> <s> having said that however in the case of the particular rescue operation that has given rise to this review i think it is permissible to ask a few questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that not unexpected reply <e> <s> however i should like to ask him first whether he considers that the recent sale of british telecom yielding something of the order of billion does not represent a thoroughly exceptional transaction <e> <s> secondly in those circumstances should it not as in the accounts of any normal enterprise be shown as an extraordinary item <e> <s> thirdly as the income arises from the sale of assets should it not be reserved for the creation of new capital assets of which the country stands sorely in need <e>", "<cs> my lords virtually all noble lords who have spoken in this important debate so effectively initiated by the noble earl lord bessborough have judged that the time is right for a fixed link to be constructed across the channel <e> <s> there is no doubt that the need is there <e> <s> there is no doubt that the technical capability is there <e> <s> there is no doubt that the resources to construct such a fixed link could be made available both in human and material terms <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware of the findings of the recent nedc report on investment in the infrastructure <e> <s> among other things it drew attention to the very large amount of repair and maintenance now required in the public housing sector <e> <s> in view of the fact that the report was published <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that most of the countries of the world which have benefited from surplus oil earnings including those in the developed regions have devoted a large part of those earnings to expanding their infrastructure and their industrial capability <e> <s> does he not believe that there is a strong case for pursuing such a policy in britain today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to be following the noble lord lord thorneycroft with whom i had the pleasure of collaborating some years ago in trying to stimulate our exports <e> <s> it is always a pleasure to listen to his ringing and reasonant tones <e>", "<cs> my lords i am told it is billion and that is still worse <e> <s> i have not seen the final figures <e> <s> whatever it is the movement is adverse and it is a reflection of our diminished industrial capability <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly notify the noble earl of some of them <e> <s> some are very exciting <e> <s> there is the flexible manufacturing through micro-electronic control of a series of machine tools which gives enormously greater variations in shop-floor operations <e> <s> far from displacing labour some of these applications have actually enabled firms which would otherwise have gone out of business to continue working <e> <s> these new technologies have come to their aid <e> <s> i should like to see something approaching a crusade to make sure that these inventions are applied in existing enterprises <e> <s> that is the third step which i think should be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble earl for repeating this statement and to reiterate the concern expressed by the noble baroness lady birk on this whole issue <e> <s> this is a very delicate matter and it is one of great public concern <e> <s> it is satisfactory to note that the government are dealing with this question with great care and circumspection and particularly that the billingham issue has been resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say that the private notice question was asked by a member of the alliance in another place <e> <s> may i reiterate the points raised by the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon in drawing attention to the seriousness of this situation <e> <s> we are concerned that the answer to this pnq was given in such laconic terms <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for repeating the statement i too should like to express some apprehensions about the subject notified to this house <e> <s> in the first place it would be helpful if the noble lord were to tell us what is the opinion of the british gas corporation of the governments decision <e> <s> according to press reports the gas corporation which must presumably contain the leading experts in this field in the country was keen for reasons of security of future gas supplies to proceed with this negotiation <e> <s> it would appear therefore that it has been overruled <e> <s> if that is the case i feel we ought to know about it <e>", "<cs> my lords we from these benches welcome the decision to retain the aea <e> <s> we feel that a great deal of expertise has been built up in that organisation and we are glad that it is the firm intention of the government that it should continue in existence <e> <s> we also think it is right that organisations such as this should be reviewed from time to time as to their financial operations and we would support some degree of a commercial structure so long as it is very clearly defined <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord dean of beswick has introduced an important topic which merits longer time for debate <e> <s> as both he and the noble lord lord broxbourne indicated the building industry has tended in these last few years to suffer a good deal more than the average sector in the economy <e> <s> it is important to try to find out and determine why that has been the case <e> <s> i believe that the reason lies largely in the fact that the building and construction industries not only serve the private sector but also serve the public sector in a large way and it is the massive reduction in public sector capital investment which has led to the dire state in which the building industry of britain now finds itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to express appreciation for the statement which has just been made by the noble lord to keep us informed of the latest developments in this important and distressing situation <e> <s> i too should like to join in the tribute which has been paid on both sides to the tireless efforts of mr norman willis and the tuc in seeking to find a solution <e> <s> i think that it already marks some progress in this tragic dispute that the intervention of the trade union organisation has been of such a positive nature <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that since this inquiry started over two years ago the advanced gas-cooled reactors at hinckley b and hunterston b have worked very successfully and that the construction of new agr stations at torness and heysham have also been progressed with great success <e> <s> in the circumstances would he not agree that this throws doubts on the desirability of changing over to another nuclear station with which we are as yet unfamiliar <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like on behalf of these benches to express satisfaction that this sad dispute is due to end tomorrow <e> <s> the main objective for the coal industry must now be to rebuild its fences get the industry moving again and repair the physical and human damage that might have been created by this long-running strike <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted to my noble friend lord diamond for introducing this debate at the present time <e> <s> he has set out very clearly i believe what are the increasing concerns of people within this country and outside it about the situation of our currency <e> <s> this is a very appropriate time to be having a look at this situation <e> <s> we have just heard the views of the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne who is very close to financial circles on how he sees the situation <e> <s> i am closer to industrial circles <e> <s> i should therefore like to talk more from that point of view and so add to the breadth of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am referring to the index of currencies and to the period <e> <s> since that period we have fallen in regard to these other currencies <e> <s> the other petroleum producing countries have not shown the same degree of fall <e> <s> therefore there must be a third factor <e> <s> the strength of the dollar is one the fact that we produce a large amount of oil is another <e> <s> the third must surely be the factor to which my noble friend lord diamond referred namely some increasing lack of confidence in the economic policy of this country as seen from the outside <e> <s> it is an unfortunate statement to have to make in this noble chamber but it does not seem that the two other factors on their own can account for the present situation of sterling <e>", "<cs> i should just like to point out to the noble viscount that i do not believe that the cbi ever claimed that it would be a panacea <e> <s> in their recent debate they concluded that on balance they thought that the time was now ripe to join <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be the view of the bank of england <e> <s> all i can say is that the view of very many industrialists with whom i have had recent contact both in your lordships house and elsewhere is much to the contrary <e> <s> they find it very hazardous to operate in markets where they will be selling ahead for two or three years not really knowing how exchange rates might operate in that period <e>", "<cs> my lords does what the noble earl is saying mean that the government still do not consider that the time is right for joining in spite of a growing body of opinion which appears to favour it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to be associated with the welcome which other noble lords have given to the statement and to be particularly associated with the remarks of my noble friend lord taylor of gryfe <e> <s> it is an essential feature of the statement made by the two governments that this project should go ahead without support from public funds or government guarantees <e> <s> it is therefore all the more important that there should be a minimum of constraint on commercial exploitation because otherwise viable propositions could not be put forward <e> <s> in that connection i put two questions to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to add to the embarrassment of the noble lord lord murray by congratulating him on his maiden speech which many of your lordships have done this afternoon <e> <s> however i should like to recall the unfailingly objective and sympathetic way in which he helped to resolve many industrial relations problems in the coal industry during the latter part of my period there <e> <s> a continuance of that attitude as between trade unions and management is something which we should all try to see restored at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords in making those remarks has the minister taken fully into account the views expressed by the cbi in its report on the fabric of the nation and the views expressed by nedo in its recent report <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all indebted to the noble lord lord boardman for introducing this very important and timely subject for our debate today <e> <s> i think that we would all agree with the principle that we should all forever be vigilant against obstacles hindrances and regulations which impede our normal activities <e> <s> i think that the proposal that he has put forward for a standing committee of both houses with all parties represented and with provision in the legislative programme each year for amendment or removal of or changes to regulations is a good one and i am delighted that the noble lord lord young has said that this will be studied with interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased to be following the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal and the right reverend prelate the bishop of coventry in this important debate <e> <s> they have spoken tellingly of the social problems created by homelessness and inadequate housing in our midst in the midst we should remind ourselves of a country which is among the most affluent in the world <e> <s> we are in the affluent group of countries and yet we have these problems in our midst <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware of the intense and growing concentration of coach traffic in the victoria area around the coach station <e> <s> is he further aware that in recent tests carried out the emissions of smoke and sulphur dioxide in ebury street which is a residential area were in excess of the ec limits <e> <s> what are the government going to do about this threat to health and the environment in this important part of central london <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl not agree that this petro-currency argument is being overdone <e> <s> it was not so long ago that the government were saying that only per cent <e> <s> of our national product was due to oil <e> <s> we cannot keep on using this argument in opposite directions <e> <s> the sooner we strengthen the european monetary system the sooner we can bring some stability to world currencies <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord kinnoull has raised a question of considerable significance and it is particularly timely as the green paper to which he has referred intimates that in due course there will be legislation legislation which we all hope will recognise as the noble earl has emphasised and as the green paper itself mentions the increasingly important role that building societies play in our way of life in this country <e> <s> since the early legislation and even since the legislation of the societies have grown considerably in size and scope <e> <s> therefore it is important that there should be this legislative review which is contemplated <e> <s> the noble earl has dealt with many aspects of their operations which need looking at and most of those were in fact referred to in the green paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful for the statement which the noble lord has repeated in this house <e> <s> i should like to ask three questions <e> <s> first it is difficult to see in all the circumstances the industrial logic for this proposal <e> <s> the british gas industry has been one of the success stories of british industry in recent years <e> <s> i was associated with the gas industry in my previous occupation in the fifties <e> <s> that was an industry in the doldrums <e> <s> by remarkable achievement and great technological advances it has turned out to be one of the most successful industries in britain with a turnover in excess of billion and profits of billion <e> <s> it seems remarkable that anything should be done to interfere with this success <e> <s> in view of the fact that as the statement has said many of the safeguards and other qualifications to protect the consumer in the existing act will be introduced in the new act it becomes even more difficult to understand why this transfer is being made <e> <s> that is the first point i should like to put to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord indicate whether the amounts that our competitors are devoting to export promotion are comparable with our own and whether this is kept regularly under review <e>", "<cs> my lords i consider myself fortunate in following the right reverend prelate the bishop of ripon in his maiden speech <e> <s> he will no doubt have been advised by his colleagues that we always treat maiden speakers with great courtesy in this house and thereafter they are treated as one of us <e> <s> but on this occasion in making these remarks to congratulate him on what he said i go beyond the courtesies because it is very clear that he has spoken as one who in his early career started in the high technology about which we are all speaking so he knows what that means which may be more than some do here <e> <s> he has also clearly given great thought to this problem and he has in this debate on this important subject emphasised very eloquently the deeper significance of what we are trying to do <e> <s> so for that we are much indebted to him and we look forward to many contributions from him in our future debates <e>", "<cs> if i may i should like to talk on the subject of waste disposal and in that connection i should like to support the proposition put forward by the noble baroness lady birk that the waste disposal services having been so much of a success since they were last reorganised in should be kept in that state for the benefit of the people they serve <e> <s> i believe that since that date subsequent legislation particularly relating to hazardous waste disposal and monitoring site licensing waste disposal strategies and siting make it imperative that county-wide bodies deal with this subject <e> <s> if we were to change this system not only would we get back to the unco-ordinated system that was present before and was then corrected but it would be worse because the whole question of waste disposal has now become very big business and requires considerable expertise <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has kindly allowed me to intervene <e> <s> in fact the shires handle this and therefore there would be a discrepancy in the way that this is handled if it were to go through <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has suggested it may i say that i was in no way impugning the capability of the local boroughs <e> <s> i should like to say that was not my intention <e> <s> i believe that he has in fact made a mistake in talking about these local boroughs putting waste disposal out to contract <e> <s> what they have done is put waste collection out to contract <e> <s> the waste disposal function since has been in the hands of the metropolitan counties and the glc and because it has now become so complex and because we have the hazardous waste problem that we have there is no suggestion that the boroughs are not capable of handling whatever they handle at the moment <e> <s> however what we have seen over the last years is the very efficient handling of this very big and hazardous business and the one thing this country has suffered from is continual chopping and changing <e> <s> once we have got something working well why do we not leave it working well <e>", "<cs> may i say that i have no intention at all of suggesting that anything we do now should last forever <e> <s> all i said was that what we are doing now is totally different from what we were doing before it is a great improvement on what we were doing before and what noble lords opposite are suggesting is that we should go back to that situation <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask for clarification <e> <s> are we also at the moment discussing amendments nos <e> <s> to <e> <s> they propose another possible solution <e>", "<cs> my name was on the original amendment and therefore i should like to crave your lordships indulgence for just two minutes for one minute on the subject <e>", "<cs> i have the agreement of the noble lord who moved this motion to speak in his place and i will therefore do so <e> <s> i should like to suggest that we should do best to regard this proposition strictly on the grounds of which would be the best the most efficient and the most cost-effective way of doing what we have set out to do <e> <s> it seemed to me all along that the whole underlying purpose of this bill as frequently proclaimed by government was that by removing one tier of the local authority in certain parts of the country we would thereby and the ratepayers would thereby achieve significant savings <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that there is a growing feeling that the main purpose of the governments privatisation policy now is to enable the treasury to rake in as much money as possible <e> <s> will he kindly inform the house whether that is indeed the main purpose of her majestys governments policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little reluctant to intervene in this debate especially as my name is not mentioned on the list of speakers because i am neither a scot nor directly involved in the tourist industry <e> <s> however i am very interested in our balance of payments and i happen to be a member of your lordships select committee on overseas trade <e> <s> we had the benefit of the evidence from the british tourist board on the great contribution that the tourist industry is making to our balance of payments <e> <s> i am also keen to intervene because the noble lord lord parry who so eloquently introduced the debate is a colleague of mine on the keep britain tidy group and the noble lord lord forte who made such an important contribution is a great supporter of that campaign the objective of which is to improve the quality of the land in which we live for those who live here and to make it more attractive for those who visit us <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord grimond has given us the opportunity of discussing an important white paper issued at a time of momentous change in the nature of the financial services of this country <e> <s> i am

as to whether there should be one or two boards <e> <s> that was the question i put to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there have been certain normally well-informed press comments to the effect that the governments response to these proposals was somewhat muted <e> <s> if these comments are not correct will the noble lord say so <e> <s> if however they are correct will he indicate on which parts of the proposals the government have reservations <e>", "<cs> my lords those who support britain playing a more positive role within the community will have been reassured by the answers that the noble viscount the leader of the house has given in connection with the next conference <e> <s> it is satisfactory that we shall be adequately represented there and that we shall continue to press for those points previously made <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that our major competitors abroad have achieved a considerable degree of consensus on the industrial revival policies that they pursue <e> <s> is it the policy of her majestys government to seek to achieve a similar degree of agreement in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord indicate to us whether if and when the government decide to privatise the electricity industry they will do it <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i should certainly like to thank the noble lord the minister for his very positive response and for the fact that the government in formulating this bill are prepared to take into account the interests of the public in all their capacities <e> <s> i am sure that in showing details of fares and routes a suitable solution will be found <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in the meantime would the noble lord tell us what the government are doing to try to stimulate the improvement and the efficiency of coal-fired power stations bearing in mind that coal represents our largest source of primary energy in this country <e> <s> furthermore what is being done to complete the investigations into pressurised fluid combustion which will enable coal to be used with the minimum of pollutants <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene to say that the private sector concern is not only with their current contracts <e> <s> they are concerned also about the arrangements under which they can make future contracts <e> <s> they are very concerned about the multiplicity of organisations with which they might have to deal <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord perhaps indicate why it is that in spite of those reassurances the private sector contractors are virtually unanimous in still expressing major apprehensions about the way in which these matters will be handled <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> i should like to say that i was extremely disappointed by the response from the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i consider that the case made regarding the congestion which is likely to get worse in victoria and other central london areas is such that i had hoped that the government would at least recognise the problems and tell us what ideas they have to deal with it <e> <s> in my opinion it is wrong for the government to assert that the local authorities now have adequate powers to deal with this problem <e> <s> that is certainly not the view of the local authority most involved in the area we have been talking about namely westminster city council <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that it is necessary for this country as a primary producer and user to be permanently looking at new sources of energy is the noble lord satisfied that we are allocating sufficient resources to those ends <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for that laconic reply may i ask whether he is aware of the widespread concern about the condition of housing in this country which based on the survey indicated that one in four houses were in urgent need of repair <e> <s> may i also ask the noble lord for his confirmation that he agrees that regular detailed and comparable information should be provided on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord gowrie started his speech to which we all listened attentively as we always do with three questions <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord barnett that many other questions could have been asked but the noble earl asked the three questions and so i shall start my remarks by trying to answer them <e>", "<cs> my lords the report of the meetings of the nedc on th july appears to suggest that more importance was attached to this document than the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne indicates <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is very eloquent in his point of view about running a business <e> <s> but the cbi put entirely the opposite case <e> <s> the cbi said that if the infrastructure services on which industry depends to move its goods which ensure that we receive adequate water supplies and everything else were not kept in good repair then the ultimate cost of putting that right when leaving it could no longer be avoided would be considerable <e> <s> in the meantime much damage would be done to industry <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that at this time when there is a substantial net import of manufactured goods into this country large-scale enterprise whether in the public or the private sector should bend all its endeavours to stimulate suppliers within britain <e> <s> what measures do the government intend to take to secure that objective <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak in place of my noble friend lord lloyd of kilgerran who spoke during the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> i support the amendment now proposed by the noble lord lord stoddart <e> <s> he has made a very telling point that in the establishment of this agency it should be provided with the capability of operating effectively <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add to the point that the noble lord lord stoddart has made <e> <s> it seems to me that if the amendment were accepted we should still be leaving in and not wishing in any way to emend the overall powers reserved to the minister under subsection <e> <s> we are simply saying that we consider that the disposal of royalty oil requires some degree of flexibility in the operations of the agency <e> <s> this can be done in one of two ways <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord stoddart that it can best be done by the acceptance of his amendment but if the noble lord the minister feels that he cannot accept the amendment then could he state quite categorically so that it can go into the record of this debate that in fact that is precisely what the secretary of state intends to do in practice <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting this amendment i believe that the noble lord <e> <s> lord stoddart has raised a very important issue which has of course been discussed at earlier stages <e> <s> the issue is this important one of security <e> <s> we have in the past years or so been through two major oil crises and it is conceivable that at any time in the future we could go through further crises <e> <s> it is very proper in a debate of this kind on the bill for us on these benches to ask the noble lord the minister to indicate to us more precisely than has been done so far how the government would propose dealing with such a crisis <e>", "<cs> my lords in the debate we had a few minutes ago upon the first amendment it seemed that the government were minded to lay down a framework under which the agency would operate <e> <s> presumably that framework for the purchases of oil outside the royalty arrangements would be such as would be agreed between the two parties <e> <s> if there were cases where the government withheld their consent in spite of that framework it would seem to me not unreasonable that those probably quite exceptional cases should be divulged to parliament <e> <s> indeed <e> <s> in the case of the nationalised industries it was written into the statutes that where the ministers concerned overrode the views of the nationalised industries in particular respects that should be made public <e> <s> we are therefore used to that sort of legislation <e> <s> it is difficult to see why if the secretary of state were to divulge his refusal in broad terms any commercial problems should arise <e> <s> therefore i urge the government to accept this very modest amendment which would help us to understand more clearly at parliamentary level how the system will operate <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord bessborough has introduced a subject which has led to a very informative and stimulating debate <e> <s> he introduced it with an admirable speech which covered the years over which he has been associated with the developments in this field <e> <s> we have subsequently had the remarkable maiden speech from the noble lord lord marshall of goring in which i think he made very clear to all of us what are the practical issues in this exciting and scientific adventure as he described it <e> <s> in particular what i was most grateful for was the very clear way in which he described break <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt about the timeliness of this debate <e> <s> at the present time the intergovernmental conference set up as a result of the meeting of the european council in milan is deliberating and preparing its report to be submitted to the next meeting of the council in december <e> <s> according to informed or normally informed newspaper reports such as that in the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that a clear commitment by government to the regeneration of manufacturing industry would go a long way to deal with the issue raised by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i regard it as a great honour to be speaking at this early stage in the debate initiated by the noble earl lord stockton <e> <s> he is someone who has already entered into the history of our country as a great postwar prime minister <e> <s> but he also continues to make history with the remarkable speeches which he delivers in your lordships house and elsewhere on the business of the nation <e> <s> the speech that he gave today was remarkable for its breadth and for its logic and for its compelling conclusions <e> <s> i was glad to note that the noble lord lord bruce of donington fully supported the thrust of the speech <e> <s> all that remains is for the noble lord lord young also to support it and then we shall have re-established consensus in the nation <e> <s> but let us wait for that <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord taylor of gryfe in a clear succinct and powerful speech drew our attention to a matter of great public interest <e> <s> that question is how should we deal with monopolies when they are moved from the public to the private sector <e> <s> in making his speech my noble friend said that he was not raising the question of whether or not this should be done but if it were done how we should handle the situation <e> <s> in the course of this very interesting debate however the question of whether it should be done was inevitably raised <e> <s> in a very compelling speech the noble lord lord beloff drew our attention to the logic of the situation and so did my noble friend lord grimond <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord finishes with purchasing may i clarify the position we have taken on this side of the house <e> <s> i do not think that anyone here supports a buy british policy <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord indicate whether steps have been taken to convert the smaller coal-fired stations which might be taken out of service to combined heat and power <e> <s> was that not in fact one of the objectives of the recent energy legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by expressing appreciation not only of the important speech made by the noble lord lord aldington in introducing this debate today but also as a member of the select committee which served under his chairmanship and the first of its members to speak in this debate to pay considerable tribute to the patient sympathetic but at the same time firm way in which he led our deliberations and brought us to a clear conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords has it not made it a very successful economy and is that not what we are talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that information and express appreciation of the research work going on <e> <s> however is it not a fact that it is generally recognised that emissions of sulphur <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the interesting series of amendments put forward by the noble lord lord stoddart <e> <s> having had some experience of the financing of a public enterprise over some years i believe that there are a number of anomalies which need to be ironed out in time <e> <s> here is an ideal opportunity to start on a workmanlike basis <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord not feel that that is an unduly complicated financial structure <e> <s> here was an opportunity for a financial reconstruction which had a commercial element in it <e> <s> had it been based on the proposition put forward by the noble lord lord stoddart earlier on it would have been comprehensible to all concerned <e> <s> i regret to say that the more the noble lord has tried to explain what the system is the more some of us have become confused <e> <s> i can only hope that the financial director of the aea is being <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord stoddart has raised the important point of participation <e> <s> i am sure that the governments policy must be to encourage the maximum degree of effective participation in <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord stoddart has raised an important issue in connection with research and development in energy <e> <s> we need to mobilise all the resources at our disposal to promote this research <e> <s> my experience of the work being done at harwell in my time at the ncb was that indeed they were spilling over inevitably into other forms of energy research and doing some very valuable work in that connection <e> <s> therefore i hope that with this important nucleus of technological skill that has been accumulated at the aea it will be enabled through this legislation to spread into other forms of research where it may make a valuable contribution <e>", "<cs> before we conclude i should like to say that i find the governments position a little anomalous in respect of some of the matters we have discussed today <e> <s> on the one hand we are told that the intention is to make the authority a more commercial organisation and yet the various very reasonable amendments put forward to do so rather more than would the government have been rejected <e> <s> we are told also that an amendment to safeguard the authority as a publicly-owned enterprise is equally undesirable <e> <s> i had hoped that we could clarify rather more than we have done this afternoon the governments real intentions in regard to this body <e> <s> perhaps we may pursue that discussion in the next phase <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there are well-tried processes for converting waste straw to building board and that this would have the added advantage of reducing the need for imported timber <e> <s> what is being done to encourage this use <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister in a position to give any assurance that whatever may be the outcome of the inquiry the government will give serious consideration to the future of the agr which after a very painful process of development is now showing signs of success <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say how the quantum of public investment that he has indicated for the united kingdom compares with that of the major countries in the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that while there have been striking successes in the manufacturing sector of british industry in recent years we need many more such successes <e> <s> how do the government see their role in stimulating these further successes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am one of those who have gone over to water metering <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord whether he does not agree that when the water authorities increase the charges to those who have gone over to metering they should give a full explanation for that <e> <s> so far as i am concerned i have received no explanation at all and i feel i may not have gained anything <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been many reports on housing and there will be many more but i believe that the report which we are considering today is of exceptional scope and importance and it has been remarkably presented to us by the noble lord lord seebohm and by the right reverend prelate the bishop of southwark <e> <s> i believe it would be true to say that after unemployment the need for improved housing is the most important social priority in the nation and it is right that we should be devoting quite a bit of our time today to considering this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly intervene and confirm that i have seen that publication but of course as it deals with the whole effort of r d throughout the country it really is rather brief in any particular subject and i did not think that it was adequate for the purpose i had in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he agrees that the present coinage is much less satisfactory than the coinage which it replaced and that there is serious risk of confusion between a number of the coins currently in use <e> <s> would he not therefore consider it to be in the public interest for a more logical sizing difference between the coins to be introduced progressively <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that one of the most important aspects of industry year is the strengthening of links between industry and schools <e> <s> are the government taking specific action within their powers to stimulate that process <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt that the statement we have heard today raises major matters of public policy <e> <s> the noble lord lord elton in repeating the statement to us said that the government accepted the maintenance of the principle of integrated river basin management and the maintenance of existing boundaries <e> <s> i am sure that we would all agree with that <e> <s> one of the greatest achievements of the british water industry in recent years has been this principle of integration <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that in view of the fact that there is a present world oil surplus which could continue for some time and that the reserves of britains oil in the north sea are limited there is a good case for considering a policy of conservation <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the excellent news which the minister has given us about progress in the coal industry at the present time can he assure the house that care will be taken in the substitution of oil for coal in power stations due to the present perturbations in the oil market <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for his statement i should like to ask him whether the government have fully realised the growing concern at these developments in relation to britains motor industry and to our manufacturing industry <e> <s> this is in no way to suggest that when circumstances are right parts of enterprises should not be disposed of and indeed foreign interests could well be involved <e> <s> but what is happening here seems to indicate that a serious weakness could result in the whole of the british manufacturing scene <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to express my particular appreciation to the noble lord lord barnett for introducing the motion that is before the house today <e> <s> i do so on two grounds <e> <s> first because of the extreme timeliness of the question that he has put forward for debate secondly because he has exposed the issues with his customary moderation and constructiveness <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has repeated to us a statement today which indicates the further steps which the government intend to take to deal with this very difficult problem of finding a safe way of disposing of nuclear waste <e> <s> he has also as has the noble baroness referred to the mounting amount of public concern on this issue <e> <s> it therefore may be asked whether this is the right time to proceed even at this measured pace <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount the leader of the house has told us that this is an interim statement <e> <s> nevertheless the moment of decision is approaching on this very important issue for british industry <e> <s> as i understand it from the statement which has been repeated to us the board of british leyland have to make recommendations to the government <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord whether he would agree that among the various criteria which should be taken into account in reaching a decision there should be the following <e> <s> first as regards local content as i understand it the vehicles which are in question use up to or per cent <e> <s> of british supplies <e> <s> would it be a condition that this degree of local content should be maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that a per cent <e> <s> saving in energy consumption would amount to some billion per annum and that in five years time this could well exceed the earnings which we receive from north sea oil <e> <s> in that case can we be assured that as well as the efforts put in this year to stimulate energy saving the government are taking steps to see that the momentum is adequately maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord given further thought to ways in which major purchasers can assist their suppliers to become more competitive and therefore to replace imported goods <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the advantages that the channel tunnel will bring us will the government ensure through the necessary improvement of our transport infrastructure that all parts of the country can benefit and not only the south-east <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that the noble lord has drawn our attention to the fact that this bill still has to go through many stages would he nevertheless not agree that it would be desirable for us to aim at simplicity of organisation and have clearly defined rules for the various regulatory bodies and not have too many sros <e>", "<cs> my lords the question that has been posed by the noble lord lord hacking is particularly approprite at the present time even though it was only in january that a similar motion was debated <e> <s> i believe that it is very appropriate for two reasons first because there is a massive amount of change going on in the commercial and industrial world and secondly the secretary of state for trade and industry has decided that there should be a full inquiry into competition policy <e> <s> i think it right that in advance of that inquiry the views of this house should be made known clearly on the subject just as i hope that when the inquiry has been completed we shall have a full opportunity for debating its conclusions or recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the noble lord lord bruce of donington in thanking the noble lord lord lucas for telling us about the statement in another place <e> <s> the government have reached a decision in the current negotiations with general motors <e> <s> that is clear <e> <s> what is not clear is what the alternative is <e> <s> here is a major sector of british industry that is in difficulty not through any fault of its own but because it is in a general market problem as the statement indicated <e> <s> yet we are not clear what the alternative is <e> <s> is this not a demonstration of the lack of an industrial strategy for this country <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord indicate what the government are doing about the report of the keep britain tidy group on the deposition of litter at sea and the consequent littering of beaches <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that this report was referred to with some concern in the last report of the royal commission on environmental pollution <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that the prices of oil had improved recently <e> <s> would he not agree however that this is entirely due to the fortuitous circumstance of a strike in the norwegian oil fields <e> <s> is the governments policy therefore to live from hand to mouth <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord rightly agreed with the noble lord lord rodney that it was important to stimulate smaller companies in exporting <e> <s> would the noble lord indicate to us whether additional resources have been made available to the british overseas trade board for this purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of the select committee on overseas trade which was so ably led by the noble lord lord aldington i am delighted to be taking part in this debate and am particularly grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington as other noble lords have been for introducing it <e> <s> i hope very much that this will not be the last time that we shall be talking on this vital subject <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> one part of my question was concerned with whether the government intend to replicate the successful dockland experiment elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate in which we are involved at present raises a number of very important issues <e> <s> we are concerned with the biggest privatisation measure so far contemplated by the government <e> <s> we are concerned with the transfer of a major monopoly from the public to the private sector and with a measure which is intended to last for at least years <e> <s> on those three counts i believe that in this debate we shall be considering many issues crucial not only to this countrys future energy success but to its economic organisation in general <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord kindly indicate whether what he said was the spur to success in the private sector would apply to a private monopoly of the size of the british gas corporation <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord referred to my intervention on this point i wonder whether i may explain what i meant <e> <s> of course there is competition now and there will continue to be in new business <e> <s> what i was saying was that where in the domestic sector or in a large part of the commercial and industrial sectors there are existing installations variations in price are unlikely to move people to indulge in the capital cost of changing <e> <s> the vast bulk of the market is fixed for some time because of the capital involvement <e> <s> of course there is new business all the time but that is a smaller proportion <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord concludes will he briefly answer the point i raised <e> <s> which was also raised by the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne <e> <s> will the privatised gas industry be able to re-engage in those activities which in its nationalised form it was prevented by the government from doing and particularly will it be able to go back into oil in the north sea <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that over the past three years on visible trade account we showed a deficiency with western germany of no less than billion and that last year this result was arrived at even after we had earned over billion on oil exports <e> <s> in view of the fact that germany represents our second largest export market should we not now be mounting a special effort to recover our situation there having regard to the improvement in the currency position <e>", "<cs> the time has come when we must decide what we are to do about this amendment <e> <s> i should merely like to say that this question arises from the decision to transfer a monopoly from the public to the private sector <e> <s> i think that we are all at one in believing that this creates a situation which has to be handled with great care in order to safeguard the public interest <e> <s> indeed the noble lord the minister said so <e>", "<cs> noble lords on the government bench opposite must by now surely be aware that the main reason motivating us on this side of this series of amendments is our concern about the efficacy of the regulatory machinery <e> <s> we are moving into uncharted seas in british industry <e> <s> as was pointed out in the second reading debate the government themselves in their manifesto of said that in privatising it would not be their intention to transfer monopolies simply from the public to the private sector <e> <s> apparently they have changed their minds on that score and they having changed their minds we must now make absolutely certain that private monopolies are regulated effectively in the interests of the consumer <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord in his definition of incapacity or misbehaviour specifically exclude differences of opinion <e>", "<cs> i share the uncertainty expressed by the noble lord lord bruce as to the significance of paragraph <e> <s> the preceding paragraph paragraph makes due provision for providing pension or other arrangements on the retirement or death of the incumbent <e> <s> this is normal for any such appointment <e> <s> what seems rather abnormal is what is said in paragraph <e> <s> i therefore hope that the noble lord in replying will elucidate the circumstances which could lead to this special compensation presumably in addition to whatever was provided for in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not as disturbed as the rest of us that every time in the postwar economic history of britain there has been a resurgence of economic activity and in particular new prospects for our exporting abroad we seem to come across the same problem <e> <s> may i mention that i have just come back from visiting an exhibition held by gec at wembley where i was speaking to its executives about problems over the recruitment of trained engineers <e> <s> i was told that the company was extremely short of people in this category <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that it is a source of great mystification to our friends on the continent why in this particular conjunction we have not joined the exchange rate mechanism <e> <s> it is a source of great mystification to a large number of people in this country why we are not increasing our links with europe in this very desirable manner <e> <s> will the noble lord not agree that the governments total refusal to give us reasons for the present position is very unnerving to those of us who believe that by increasing our links with europe we shall achieve greater success economically and politically in the world <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow the remarks of the noble lord lord bruce of donington by saying that clearly in our view there is a conflict of interest here <e> <s> the treasurys concern is to save money on behalf of the nation which is a very worthy concern <e> <s> however the other aspect of this matter is that we should have a regulatory body which is adequate for its purpose <e> <s> these two issues are in conflict <e>", "<cs> it is surely paradoxical that while the gas industry was under public ownership there was an organisation to safeguard consumers interests which had a national and a regional presence <e> <s> yet during that period in addition the public had the safeguard of parliamentary supervision and government supervision <e> <s> now that both parliament and government will be removed from the scene on the privatisation of the enterprise as it now stands at the very same time it is proposed in this bill that the consumer organisation be weakened <e> <s> this is very difficult for us to understand <e> <s> i fear that as we go <e>", "<cs> may i intervene <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord whether under the paragraph he has cited the national consumer council would if it felt it desirable be able to appoint regional consumer councils <e>", "<cs> in supporting the amendment that has been moved by the noble lord lord stoddart i should like to say that quite apart from the benefit that the council would derive from having representatives of industry commerce and labour among their members there could well be instances when some of the problems with which they have to deal will come from the smaller commercial or industrial consumers and therefore a knowledge of the way to deal with those problems within the council would also be helpful <e> <s> in these circumstances i hope that the minister will be able to accept this very useful amendment <e>", "<cs> the amendment moved by the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne raises a very important point as the noble lord lord williams has just made clear <e> <s> the underlying significance is that it implies that the bill as drafted changes nothing at all so far as british gas is concerned <e> <s> however what it does do is imply a degree of risk for third parties <e> <s> on this side of the house we feel that the third party most likely to be adversely affected unless suitably protected is the consumer <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne takes the view that the third parties most likely to be affected are the suppliers and the potential shareholders <e>", "<cs> the issue raised by noble lords who have spoken on both sides of the committee is of such far-reaching importance that i hope that we shall be able to do it justice either now or at some later stage <e> <s> there is this fundamental issue of a change in the whole deployment of the energy resource of the country with as has been pointed out two major enterprises remaining under public control and one now being put under private control <e> <s> unless there is some long stop or provision of the sort proposed under this amendment it looks as if there could be very serious situations arising at some future date as a result of the inequality of this situation <e>", "<cs> i must say that i too was somewhat concerned about the cavalier manner in which the noble lord spoke on this subject <e> <s> after all we are having a very serious debate and when we raise matters of fundamental energy policy and express concern about what could happen as a result of the major change which is contemplated in this bill we expect at least to have a serious response from the other side of the committee <e>", "<cs> the only point i want to make is that i did not suggest at all that the gas industry should have to meet all requirements <e> <s> the wording that i specifically said should be left in was all reasonable requirements <e>", "<cs> in the light of what the noble lord has said i wish to withdraw the amendment that i proposed <e>", "<cs> in view of the fact that the minister has said that this matter might more appropriately be dealt with under clause that is something we must obviously take into account <e> <s> however i shall comment on the ministers remarks concerning the principle of least cost resource acquisition <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord indicate whether in view of the auspicious occasion of spain joining the european community the british overseas trade board is mounting any special initiative in the spanish market <e>", "<cs> my lords following up the point that was made by my noble friend lord winstanley would it help if the life expectancy of a drug were to be indicated clearly on the container <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that in the long run we need to restore a positive balance in our visible trade exports apart from oil <e> <s> will he indicate therefore whether he considers that present policies will lead to that desirable result <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord elton on the stirring party political speech that he has just made <e> <s> it seems to me that it is not a realistic response to the very moderate and positive motion proposed by the noble baroness lady nicol <e> <s> i should like to keep to the motion and say that the benches from which i speak take a very objective view of what should be publicly and privately owned <e> <s> however i do not believe that this is the second reading of the governments bill yet to be published on the privatisation of the water industry it is a motion directed to a consideration of the requirement for capital investment in the water industry and it expresses some concern about what might happen to the environmental pollution and consumer considerations under possible privatisation <e> <s> i should like to speak strictly to the motion <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord not agree that there ought to be in such an important matter consultation with other relevant bodies <e> <s> if the noble lord would be prepared to consider such an amendment i think that some of us would be quite happy with that <e> <s> but the suggestion of simply consulting the director and not other relevant bodies seems to us to mean that a decision could be reached without full consideration of the issue <e>", "<cs> i rise to support that which has just been said by my noble friend lady burton of coventry <e> <s> indeed i support what the noble lord lord bruce of donington has said that consultation before a decision is taken is far better and more democratic than consultation after a decision has been made <e> <s> if the noble lord lord belstead were to argue that supplies of gas to consumers would be seriously jeopardised if the amendment were agreed then i am sure we would have to think again <e> <s> if that is not the case however then there is a strong argument for supporting wider consultation before decisions are reached <e>", "<cs> i rise to support my noble friend lord diamond in the amendment that he has proposed <e> <s> i should like to suggest to the committee that this is one of the most sensitive issues in this very important bill <e> <s> there must be grave concern in the country about the impact of the transfer when a very large enterprise which is a monopoly in the public sector becomes a monopoly in the private sector <e> <s> the government have gone some way towards recognising this through the various provisions they have made for safeguarding the public <e> <s> an essential provision however is to safeguard the individual consumer of gas over the prices to be charged for the supply of gas <e> <s> there is a formula on the tariff price <e> <s> but so far as the standing charge is concerned the best endeavours clause does not really go far enough as my noble friend has indicated <e>", "<cs> throughout the debates that we have had on this bill so far none of us has criticised the present management of british gas <e> <s> we think that it has done a marvellous job <e> <s> however we are here concerned with a bill which is looking forward years <e> <s> that alters the whole complexion of the situation <e> <s> we have to legislate for that period ahead irrespective of the very successful way in which the present managers of british gas have run the enterprise <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord lord campbell of alloway telling us that <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord very much for that concession <e> <s> naturally we would like to look at the words very carefully i hope that they would go a bit further than merely saying provide information <e> <s> i hope they would include the words encourage by various means the efficient use of energy and that it would not merely be a passive proposal <e> <s> in the hope that it would be of a positive nature i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as someone who has had some experience of being involved in a large-scale enterprise i should like to say that i fully support the noble lord lord stoddart <e> <s> i think it will be important in this legislation that there are some clauses in it whether they be precisely what is proposed or something else is a matter for the government to decide which pay regard to the need to stimulate full participation on the part of those who work in the enterprise <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord diamond in this amendment because in our opinion in deciding to privatise the gas industry with the very substantial powers which they will possess in this area in which they are going to move the government have not taken fully into account the impact that it could have on certain competitors <e> <s> this could be particularly so in the case of exploration in the north sea <e> <s> effectively the gas industry is going to remain the sole purchaser of gas found in the north sea <e> <s> although in theory others could use this gas in practice that is the way it is worked out <e>", "<cs> the trouble with clause is that it deals largely with remedial action to be taken after damage or alleged damage has been done <e> <s> we are trying to ensure that under the conditions of authorisation this misuse of privileged information should be regarded as a condition and therefore i would have thought it not unreasonable that this should be included in support of the intention in clause <e> <s> let us take it as read that the gas industry in its privatised state will still be a very large enterprise with monopolistic aspects and therefore that those who are in competition with it are not unreasonable in saying that they should to some degree be protected by that very situation <e>", "<cs> i believe that this amendment proposed by my noble friend lord diamond is of considerable importance because one of the things from which we suffer in this country is that in our industrial development we think too short term <e> <s> the exigencies of the market emphasise that <e> <s> the exigencies of the institutional investors emphasise that <e> <s> therefore because we are talking about a very valuable national asset namely an essential ingredient in our energy supplies there ought to be a condition that those who benefit from an authorisation to undertake this operation should have an obligation to undertake the necessary long-term research so as to secure not only that we as a nation benefit from the supply of gas for as long as possible but that we also make the very best use of it <e> <s> it would seem that this is an extremely reasonable provision in the interests of the nation and could quite fairly be included in the conditions for authorisation <e>", "<cs> i feel that the noble lord lord stoddart has an important point <e> <s> it has been the policy of successive governments in this country as i well know from my past experience to minimise the use of gas in power station generation <e> <s> the proper fuels to be used for that purpose are coal oil in certain circumstances and nuclear energy <e> <s> to use gas for that purpose is totally wrong yet here we have legislation which will enable that to be done <e>", "<cs> on a matter of elucidation where in clause does it refer to clause <e>", "<cs> there seems to be a bit of belt and braces in this because not only does paragraph <e>", "<cs> the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon is very much in line with others we have debated throughout these discussions relating to the promotion of energy efficiency <e> <s> it is something which i believe most of us feel very strongly about <e> <s> naturally there are some who take the view that this is a matter best left to the enterprise when it is privatised <e> <s> there are others however who feel that this is of such overwhelming importance that it should be mentioned as a condition of the granting of the authorisation <e> <s> we on this side certainly hold that view <e> <s> the government in an earlier discussion conceded that they would consider introducing something to this effect and i therefore hope the <e> <s> will extend that consideration to this amendment <e>", "<cs> i find it difficult to understand why the government should neither in the bill itself nor in the proposed authorisation put in place what the existing british gas corporation are doing and are saying that they wish to continue to do <e> <s> they have shown the way for good practice by undertaking this extra half-hour of repair work without charge <e> <s> why do the government feel that this excellent example should not be enshrined either in the legislation or in the authorisation <e>", "<cs> in regard to amendment no <e> <s> b are we right in understanding that according to the minister the wording means quite clearly that there will be no charge <e> <s> if that is so we must accept his interpretation <e> <s> i would only say that i think that it is a bit hard to expect the average consumer of gas to be a constitutional lawyer and to understand that even though a statute does not say so in fact the service will be rendered without charge <e>", "<cs> i was asking why the average person reading the bill would suppose that the provision meant that the service referred to would be rendered free of charge <e>", "<cs> those people would be unlike us because we did not understand the provision to mean that <e>", "<cs> we seem to be trying to prevent the noble lord lord stoddart from finishing what he was going to say <e> <s> but i shall like to say upon the question of competence and qualifications that we should be very careful where safety is concerned <e> <s> i have had some experience in the mining industry and i may say that where safety in mines was concerned for any person having any responsibilities in that connection experience was of course vital <e> <s> the qualifications were laid down by law <e>", "<cs> the issue raised here is a matter of very great importance <e> <s> the fact is that we are here talking about the million consumers of gas who have over the years been used to having somewhere to which they could go to pay their bills to see the newest appliances or to obtain advice <e> <s> to do that by any other means would impose difficulty and a degree of uncertainty on the customers <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord feels that the scheme as explained so clearly by my noble friend lord diamond contains certain difficulties would he however be prepared to consider the principle of franchising at some later date <e> <s> the whole object of this discussion is to see whether over a period of time some greater measure of competition can be introduced <e> <s> we have already dealt with the question of the pipelines being made available to other suppliers <e> <s> we are here talking about the possibility of introducing the concept of franchising the gas supply in a given area <e> <s> would the noble lord be prepared to give some consideration to that broad concept as opposed to this detailed proposal before we come to report <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not the first time in recent years that we have debated this issue <e> <s> to go back no further than three years ago we had the very important report of the select committee of this house which sat under the chairmanship of the noble lord lord obrien who is going to speak to us later which analysed very clearly and impressively the whole question and which concluded at that time in the debate which took place in this house on th november that the question was then what were the reasons which had led the government not to feel that the time was right <e> <s> if i may quote from the speech of the noble lord lord obrien at that time he said <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord how he would explain the fact that those countries which are members of the exchange rate mechanism and have varying strengths of economy as one must accept have nevertheless all brought down their interest rates in recent times <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the substantial benefits which this project will bring would the noble earl care to indicate how long the legislative process to approve the treaty will take in the light of the recent prolonged debates in another place <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i feel that small and medium-sized businesses play an increasingly important role in this country a role to which i believe all parties subscribe <e> <s> it is important therefore that their interests should be safeguarded as much as possible so that they may <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the view of the noble lord lord gallacher <e> <s> it seems rather unrealistic to argue that a tenant who is concerned to keep on good terms with his landlord would somehow be ready to take civil but not criminal proceedings <e> <s> i think that there is no difference between the two with regard to good relations <e>", "<cs> eleven dollars <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord saying as the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne was trying to elicit from him that the governments prime concern will be to estimate a fair price in relation to any given set of market conditions <e> <s> does that mean that they are relatively indifferent to the market conditions and that all they will seek to ensure is that they will get a fair price in relation to those conditions <e>", "<cs> that i believe is the issue upon which we appear to be divided <e> <s> we are saying that this sale should take place in favourable market conditions by market i do not refer only to the price of oil although i agree that that is very important not at a level which is judged by the government to be fair in respect of any market conditions <e> <s> there appears to be a fundamental difference between us <e> <s> if the noble lord is right in his preliminary assertion which was amended after the intervention of the noble lord lord stoddart that the government would be aiming to get the best price they must surely be seeking to dispose of these assets in the best market conditions <e> <s> is that what the noble lord really means <e>", "<cs> i was pleased to note that the noble lord lord belstead said that he would take amendment no <e> <s> away and have a look at it <e> <s> in so doing i ask him to bear in mind the concern on the part of potential vendors of natural gas about the difficult position in which they may be put in dealing with such a powerful dual-functioning organisation as the new british gas plc <e> <s> they feel that the proposal for the intervention of an independent expert in certain cases would be fair to both sides <e> <s> in seeking to sell the gas they will have to reveal to somebody the relevant technical information <e> <s> in certain cases where that geological information could be misused they would like to do so through a third party approved by all concerned <e> <s> with those remarks i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware of the continuing undue congestion of coaches in the victoria area <e> <s> are the government concerned with this problem and if so will he kindly indicate what progress is being made in dealing with it <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted to the noble lord lord dean of beswick for introducing this motion for debate today <e> <s> it is not the first time that we have directed our attention to the housing problem of the nation <e> <s> it will certainly not be the last time because as the noble lord has rightly said this is one of the most important social and economic problems that we face <e> <s> the evidence as he has pointed out is overwhelming that the state of british housing is rapidly deteriorating <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is surely indebted to the noble lord lord holderness for introducing this motion to annul the order <e> <s> i had the pleasure of close contact with him when he was minister of power and i was particularly struck then by the broad view that he took of energy problems <e> <s> listening to him speak tonight i notice that he still retains that breadth of view <e> <s> he has raised a number of key issues arising from what might appear to be a relatively simple exploratory operation <e> <s> as he rightly pointed out public opinion is now profoundly disturbed about the whole nuclear issue and it is important that there should be a period in which there can be some detailed explanation of the whole nuclear problem and such reassurance as can effectively be provided <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has mentioned so often the relatively little harm associated with low-level waste that it seems to be a crucial part of his argument <e> <s> grave doubts seem to be expressed in paragraph of the environment committees report about the classification of this waste <e> <s> indeed there is a sentence at the end that i find rather worrying <e> <s> the committee said <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that the extension of the drax coal-fired power station was accomplished with remarkable success and that there are other very efficient coal-fired power stations in this country which could be similarly extended <e> <s> this would avoid the need for lengthy and costly procedures for consent <e> <s> are not these matters which should be very seriously considered in supplying the necessary resources for electricity generation in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords in the impressive list of research that the noble lord indicated as being done in this matter he mentioned pressurised fluidised bed combustion <e> <s> would he not agree that this is one of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that the existing environmental organisations have done an excellent job within limited resources and could have done more had more resources been available <e> <s> would he therefore indicate whether under this new initiative such additional resources will be made available to them <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment moved by the noble lord lord stoddart and the other amendments to clause relate to a fundamental concern which we on this side of the house have namely that the regulatory body proposed by the government is inadequate for the important task which it faces under the bill <e> <s> we believe that there should be a stronger regulatory body to ensure that this new privatised organisation shall in all respects do things which are consistent with the interests of consumers and of the public <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i add one further point and ask whether he does not feel that the appointment of persons to regulate privatised bodies of this sort does not raise entirely different issues from all public appointments hitherto and whether he does not agree that parliament has a special role in such appointments <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord shepherd has made some telling points in support of the proposal moved by my noble friend lord diamond <e> <s> i have been a little surprised to hear the views expressed by noble lords on the othe side about the need to have a single person making all the decisions in organisations of this kind <e> <s> i would remind <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that this affair has been handled in a somewhat confusing manner bearing in mind that according to a document that i have received from the electricity council tariff rates for electricity went up by an average of per cent <e> <s> on the st april and it was then announced that they would be reduced by per cent <e> <s> with effect from st july the publicity being related exclusively to the subsequent smaller reduction <e> <s> furthermore in view of the massive reduction in the price of coal charged to the cegb namely a reduction of million over two years and the fact that the oil price has more than halved since the st january was it not to be concluded that the least that the tariff consumer of electricity could have expected would be a net reduction and not a net increase in the tariff charges <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter always speaks very logically and effectively but it seems to me that on this occasion he has missed an important issue these are three industries which for the moment are crucial to the energy supply of this country and which are under public ownership <e> <s> under public ownership they come under the same sort of control and supervisory powers of the secretary of state for energy <e> <s> now one of them is being removed and is being privatised the other two are to remain as they are <e> <s> it seems not unreasonable that the secretary of state who will still retain a role in regard to the privatised gas industry because indeed it is defined in this bill should include in that role the overall relationship between the three industries and should bear that in mind <e> <s> surely this is the point of the amendment that has been moved by the noble lord lord stoddart and of the other amendment of my noble friend lord diamond <e>", "<cs> coal and oil my lords <e> <s> the noble lord asked whether the minister should then intervene <e> <s> my opinion is that he should not <e> <s> but if a future gas enterprise were deliberately to reduce its prices in order to acquire a dominant position in the market and having acquired it then put up its prices in a new captive situation i should have thought that those were circumstances in which the minister should have the power to intervene <e> <s> therefore we merely propose that in addition to the other powers that will be given to him under this bill the secretary of state so long as other sectors in the energy group of industries remain under public ownership should have an overall responsibility for the public interest <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment was intended as a relatively minor step towards increasing the flexibility in the cirumstances in which gas could be supplied <e> <s> i regret to note that the government are still adamant in not accepting it <e> <s> nevertheless i do not wish to press it to a division and therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty arises surely from the use of the word secure <e> <s> it implies that in some way or other the government will ensure that these people for ever and a day will remain in a viable situation <e> <s> what i suppose it is meant to mean is satisfy themselves <e> <s> if that is what it is meant to mean it would have been better if it had said it <e> <s> the reason for the amendment moved by my noble friend is to overcome that implication <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord in particular for the last part of his <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord bruce of donington because it raises a very important issue that goes considerably beyond the scope of the bill <e> <s> first i am glad that the noble lord lord campbell of alloway has confirmed that the wording put forward in the amendment does not contravene article but that in particular cases there might be held to be a contravention <e> <s> obviously that could be overcome by avoiding particular cases of that kind <e> <s> that is the point i should now like to discuss because british gas as currently constituted like the other nationalised industries has for years pursued a policy very success-fully of giving full opportunity to british suppliers to compete for its business <e> <s> i know from my personal experience with the coal board that that has been done on a proper competitive basis <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to follow why the competition should be restricted to the contract area where it already exists <e> <s> the bill itself implies by the regulatory system and by the pricing system that the contract area is a competitive area <e> <s> it is difficult in all logic to see why the competition should implicitly be eliminated from the tariff or domestic area <e> <s> in practice it exists there anyway as the noble lord has said so why does not the bill allow it to proceed as it now is <e> <s> this implication that there can be competition in the contract area but not in the tariff or domestic areas seems rather surprising <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very pleased when the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter rose <e> <s> i was hoping that he would go on and say as he did in connection with a previous amendment we were considering regarding when the secretary of state and the directot are to take into account the interests of british suppliers that he would equally have said in the case of the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord belstead that taking into account the interests of those who are disabled or of pensionable age is itself a somewhat vague formula <e> <s> that i understand is what the noble lord lord campbell of alloway was trying to put right by getting into the bill itself much more precision than this wording proposes <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord stoddart has put his finger on the real issue that we are debating <e> <s> we are not saying in this amendment that we are against competition <e> <s> we are saying that we consider that competition should be fair <e> <s> on authorisation a privately-owned gas enterprise will be given considerably more freedom than at present it possesses <e> <s> it will compete with an electricity industry which will continue to have the restraints which at present it possesses <e> <s> it will therefore be at a competitive disadvantage <e> <s> that is what we are drawing attention to <e> <s> to say that the solution then lies in privatising the electricity industry may be logically <e>", "<cs> my lords can we be quite clear on up to what point in all this the government can change the authorisation <e> <s> i am quite clear that once the procedure starts operating the changes are covered by clauses and <e> <s> but up to what point can the government unilaterally alter the authorisation <e>", "<cs> my lords in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that i have raised a totally different issue from the question of energy efficiency <e>", "<cs> my lords in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment on the ground that we have here a situation in which virtually a single purchaser is facing a number of suppliers <e> <s> while that single purchaser was under public ownership there was recourse to the public organisations responsible for supervising the operation of that public supplier to take the necessary action were it necessary <e> <s> under private ownership however that will be removed and therefore the non-discrimination principle which is already applied in the clause that we are talking about in relation to those who purchase gas should also be applied in the case of the purchase of gas by the supplier <e>", "<cs> surely my lords the underlying proposition of this amendment is that in every area in which a public gas supplier operates there should be publicised a point of contact to which the tariff customer could go to lodge his complaints to seek advice or service or for other purposes related to the supply of gas <e> <s> it seems to me this is a totally reasonable proposition which should appear either in the bill or in the authorisation <e> <s> if no point of contact is given how is the consumer to be able to relate to the gas supplier in matters of day-to-day requirements and how can complaints be submitted first to the gas supplier before going to the consumers council or being dealt with in other ways <e>", "<cs> my lords do noble lords opposite not agree that in a bill of this importance it is rather surprising that the definition of what we are talking about should not figure in the bill itself so that it may be fully debated and agreed upon <e> <s> i find it rather surprising that it should be relegated as a schedule in the authorisation and be capable of being changed from time to time <e> <s> i hope that for that fundamental reason noble lords opposite will consider it appropriate that the definition of what the whole bill is about should figure in the bill itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment moved by the noble lord lord stoddart because as he rightly said in the cost of tariff gas the supply of the gas itself naturally plays a large part <e> <s> we believe that the director should have access to all this information so that he can satisfy himself that the make-up of costs passed on to the tariff customer is fair <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord in replying to this amendment will tell us either that he will accept it or that it is in the opinion of the government firmly implied in the wording as presented in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords who have spoken in this debate i wish to declare certain interests in the city <e> <s> i also happen to have a number of active interests in industry <e> <s> i am hoping that one of the consequences of this important bill will be that the links between financial services and industry will be strengthened and that the services rendered by the financial institutions to industry will become all the more extensive <e> <s> this point was referred to by the noble lords lord bruce of donington and lord wolfson and by my noble friend lord chandos is his eloquent and well-constructed speech earlier today <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take up a point made by the noble lord lord belstead at an earlier stage when he said that it was in the interests of the gas industry to maintain the highest level of efficiency bearing in mind that it would be competing in the tariff market with the other forms of energy <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for the answer that he has given on this issue <e> <s> however i am somewhat saddened that after the month in which he <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne i have been approached by the association of corporate treasurers <e> <s> they are concerned in spite of what they have seen of the proposed government amendments about their position under this proposed legislation <e> <s> the bill while seeking to provide proper safeguards for investors nevertheless does not extend those safeguards to the point of frustrating other activities <e> <s> there is grave concern among these people that some of the things they do in the normal course of their business could be caught <e> <s> i believe that the amendment proposed by the noble <e>", "<cs> i am very glad that this issue has been given an airing <e> <s> it is obviously an omission from the bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord lucas has explained why it has been left out and other noble lords have expressed different views <e> <s> at this stage i should not like to press the amendment but will reconsider what we do at further stages <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord grimond put his finger on the point <e> <s> we are now getting to the nub of the issue which is the protection of the small investor <e> <s> i find myself getting confused about the question of certification <e> <s> it seems that those who are not certificated can still plead in accordance with the clause that they were perfectly entitled to print what they did on city matters <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for saying that he agrees with the principle underlying this amendment <e> <s> it may well be that it is in the wrong place <e> <s> it may even be that it does not need to be explicitly stated <e> <s> but i should have thought it was in the interests of all concerned that the number of sros should be kept down to the minimum <e> <s> having aired this point i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> included in the grouping which the noble lord mentioned are three amendments in the names of my noble friend lord taylor of gryfe and myself namely amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>

word enforcement were left out the noble lord will accept it <e> <s> where it seems to me that sub-paragraph is deficient is that it does not give a sufficiently wide range of options <e>", "<cs> i should like to associate myself with the mild strictures indicated by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> we are here presented with over amendments by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl give an assurance that when the time comes to dispose of the victoria coach station presently operated by the national bus company full regard will be had to the need to reduce the undue accumulation of coach traffic in that part of london <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak to amendment no <e> <s> although paragraph <e>", "<cs> together with the amendment which the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> has mentioned goes the succeeding amendment which has very similar wording and i would therefore like to say that i fully agree with the arguments which he puts forward <e> <s> i seem to recall that in a recent publication the sib made it clear that it was their intention to appoint an ombudsman to look at complaints <e> <s> if that is their intention and if we want to ensure that that intention which is presently indicated quite voluntarily by the sib shall be enshrined in the legislation as it ought to be i can see no possible objection from the government side in so doing <e> <s> this should make it absolutely clear that there is a desire to ensure that all complaints shall be dealt with fairly and independently <e> <s> there should be no conflict of interest between what we should like to see in this committee and what the sib are apparently prepared to do <e> <s> i therefore hope that on this occasion at any rate the noble lord the minister will see his way to agreeing to the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord lucas in introducing the amendment said that the proposed new clause was not intended to circumscribe the promotion of international co-operation between regulators <e> <s> of course one of the important aspects of the whole bill is that while providing suitable safeguards for investors the development of the financial services of this country should be continued in a world-wide sense <e> <s> it is probably already known to the noble lord that the stock exchange is a little concerned about some of the wording of the clause <e> <s> it recognises that in certain cases information must be safeguarded but it has notified certain noble lords of its fears <e> <s> i am reasonably convinced that it is justified in expressing some concern <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly intervene as someone who has no interest to declare in the matter not being a member of any of the professional organisations concerned <e> <s> but i should like to say in that objective capacity that i have found the arguments in favour of this amendment very convincing <e> <s> i think that it would be to the detriment of the smooth operation of this legislation if that omission in the matter of immunity were made <e> <s> in seeking the adequate protection of investors we need to have the full support of all the bodies which will have to apply this law <e> <s> in order to get that support all must be treated alike <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for the explanation that he gave of the governments position <e> <s> i sympathise with the governments desire to ensure that there should not be too many limitations on the operation of the rehabilitation of offenders act <e> <s> nevertheless i believe that they are drawing a false distinction between the listed and the unlisted securities market <e> <s> they are close to each other these <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves part v can he indicate what impact he thinks these provisions will have on the future level of opencast coal mining <e>", "<cs> my lords as the person who was responsible for setting up the minestone executive of the national coal board the purpose of which was to make the best use of waste material associated with mining coal may i ask the noble viscount whether he is aware of the great efforts made by that executive to segregate and grade minestone to make it suitable for road building <e> <s> in the light of the governments decision to give up dual tendering nevertheless will great efforts be made to use this material wherever possible <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the cegbs stated requirement for additional electricity generating capacity in the s is it not essential that it should very quickly come forward with an application for new power stations and is not coal the one source of energy which creates the least problems <e> <s> in the case of acid rain would the noble viscount agree that if the flue gas desulphurisation plant which is already working very effectively in other countries were to be installed there would be no problem over acid rain <e> <s> so pending receipt of the sizewell report and in view of the time which the secretary of state will necessarily have to take to come to a decision would it not be desirable in the national interest to go ahead with a coal-fired power station in the meantime <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may speak to amendment no <e> <s> b and do so in the spirit in which the noble lords lord lucas and lord morton have conducted the debate so far i believe that our aim at this stage must be to achieve as much clarity and consistency as we possibly can in the wording of this very important bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord lucas for having agreed to two of the amendments which i propose in this grouping <e> <s> i suppose that scoring two out of four is pretty good going judged by the progress we have made so far <e> <s> on the other two amendments i should like to emphasise that there is a very real purpose behind them because i have the feeling

the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself with those noble lords who have spoken in favour of the amendment <e> <s> at an earlier stage a number of us made it clear that we did not regard the word sufficient on its own as being an adequate definition of what was involved <e> <s> the best definition would be a proportion <e> <s> this was however opposed by the government <e> <s> the next best solution would be to introduce the wording proposed by the noble lord lord morton <e> <s> i hope that the government will be prepared to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indebted to the noble lord the minister for the time that he has devoted to commenting on the various interventions and i was heartened by his remark that the sib will undoubtedly be taking careful note of all that is said <e> <s> i believe that the interventions made by noble lords in support of the amendments which i moved were motivated by a desire to get the best possible compensation scheme going and they raised various points in relation to the proposition put forward by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord williams has a point here <e> <s> i am not clear why subsection should have been put in <e> <s> it seems rather to be an invitation to have an open-ended arrangement <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down would he not accept that there is very strong concern as expressed by many noble lords tonight about the way in which this arrangement could interfere with the long-standing relationship between branches of banks and building societies and their customers <e> <s> i think one of the most telling points was made by the noble lord lord coleraine who referred to small communities where the diversification of financial interest would be non-existent and where the only source of knowledge on the subject would be the local branch of one or two banks and possibly a building society <e> <s> to try to impose the whole paraphernalia of this bill and its very careful distinctions upon a small community would i suggest make an absolute nonsense of normal community relationships <e> <s> this is the issue we are really talking about it goes beyond the question of financial structures and is a social matter <e> <s> i hope that the noble and learned lord will accept that this is a serious issue and will use his best endeavours to make sure that the sib take the matter into account <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the response of the noble and learned lord and bearing in mind that we have debated this question at great length and that the points have been very well made and in the hope that the sib will take full account of what has been said i seek leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount not agree that another of the objectives of the energy act was to stimulate combined heat and power projects <e> <s> is it not the case that we are lagging behind many other european countries in this development <e> <s> what is the policy of the government towards expediting it <e> <s> to what extent has the electricity supply industry conducted the policy laid down in section of the act to adopt and develop such schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness in her supplementary question referred to the possible use of straw for other products namely paper <e> <s> however i should like to ask the noble lord whether the government are supporting projects for converting straw into building board <e> <s> i believe that there are very satisfactory technological processes for this conversion and it would appear to be a very useful alternative role for the surplus straw <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord dean of beswick <e> <s> what he has suggested would enable the secretary of state under paragraph of schedule effectively to carry out what is proposed therein <e> <s> how is the secretary of state to find out what the majority of the tenants feel on the subject other than by consulting them <e> <s> it seems to me that to do it by a postal ballot <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all who have participated in this debate and many words of wisdom have been uttered will be pleased to have heard what the noble baroness has just said that the government will come forward with an amended subsection at the third reading <e> <s> before withdrawing my amendment i should like to emphasise among the many words of wisdom uttered <e>", "<cs> my lords in the hope that the grant system now introduced in this legislation will be more flexible than hitherto which i gather was the purport of the remarks of the noble lord and in the hope also that the provision of finances will be handled more expeditiously than hitherto which i believe he also said i am ready to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment proposed by the noble baroness because i think there is great merit in subsection of clause being drawn as widely as possible <e> <s> it does not necessarily commit the secretary of state to do any of these things <e> <s> it means that he can look at schemes which come within a very broad perspective in these urban areas <e> <s> i think that he ought to have the freedom <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that short reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he will confirm that when mr poehl the president of the german bundesbank visited the uk on th october he had a meeting with the prime minister and as was widely reported in the press the prime minister then reiterated her firm opposition to full british membership of the ems ahead of the next general election <e> <s> does that mean that there is now a political issue involved whereas previously by using the term when the time is ripe the government had given the impression that when monetary and economic conditions were satisfactory full membership would take place <e> <s> does that mean that even if those other conditions were right nevertheless the government would not do anything about this before the next election <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel considerable sympathy for the views so cogently expressed by the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e> <s> however i have certain reservations <e> <s> the fact is that we are in the process of enacting a very complex bill <e> <s> we are likely to put very serious and complex duties upon the designated agency the sib <e> <s> the takeover panel has now worked for a number of years and has worked successfully <e> <s> i should like to suggest that this is one of those issues which could with advantage be deferred <e> <s> the sib will have quite enough to do to carry out the tasks which are likely to be entrusted to it under present and proposed legislation <e> <s> we should see how the two work together <e> <s> if the comments of the noble lord lord williams of elvel turn out to be correct in practice then there is always a future date when the matter can be corrected <e> <s> but i should like to suggest that we do not put upon the sib these additional duties at this stage <e> <s> i therefore feel some reluctance to agree with the noble lords proposition <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene <e> <s> i always listen with great attention to everything the noble lord lord williams says because of his great knowledge of the city <e> <s> in his amendment it was implied although not stated that if the secretary of state were to exercise his powers it would be through the sib <e> <s> indeed if this were not so it would add a <e>", "<cs> my lords as reference has been made to the liberal front bench perhaps i may reply on its behalf <e> <s> we believe not only that the panel has worked quite successfully in the past years but that it is in its own interest and in the interest of those it represents that it should continue to do so and that is a very big motivating factor <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the noble lord lord hacking <e> <s> it is true that on report i moved an amendment to this effect because under this bill which is of such great importance for the conduct of the countrys financial affairs we must be fair to all parties <e> <s> because of the complexities of the provisions as to who should be authorised and who not we feel that those who may conduct affairs believing themselves to be fully entitled to should nevertheless not lay themselves open to any penalties under the bill <e> <s> it is to make that point absolutely clear and to give guidance to the courts that the amendment has been moved <e> <s> i hope that the government will be able to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords after the noble and learned lord lord edmund-davies i should like to speak also in support of the amendment <e> <s> there is an inconsistency as the noble and learned lords lord morton and lord edmund-davies pointed out between subsection and subsection <e> <s> the views read out to us by the noble lord lord morton quoting the noble and learned lord lord roskill confirm that view <e> <s> the evidence from eminent legal personalities is i think overwhelming <e> <s> therefore in the interests of proper safeguards there should be a consistency of wording throughout this clause of the bill <e> <s> i very much hope that with that endeavour in mind the government will be prepared to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we must all have been very impressed by the powerful speech by the noble lord lord elystan-morgan <e> <s> he did make it clear beyond any doubt at all in my mind that the real change that is being introduced in the and acts is by clause which has been inserted in this bill and not by the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in this grave dilemma <e> <s> there are peoples interests involved here <e> <s> on balance i have come to the conclusion that because there are peoples interests which might be jeopardised although i totally disagree with that interpretation of retrospection and on the firm understanding that an amendment on the lines that i have proposed but with a different cut-off date will be introduced at the commons consideration of this matter on monday i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to intervene in this debate as i had not taken part in earlier stages <e> <s> i tried to intervene during the speech of the noble lord lord bruce of donington but he did not allow me to say the few words that i wanted to say then so i should like to say them now <e> <s> it seemed to me that in his vigorous as always intervention he was not so much addressing himself to the bill before us as to our membership of the ec <e> <s> in my opinion that had been settled by the referendum which was held during a previous labour government and our role now within the european community is to play the best part we can <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down let me say that it was not my intention to say that the referendum settled anything forever <e> <s> what i intended to say was that it was the view of the british people that we should continue in membership of the community and try to make it work <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my appreciation to the noble lord lord skelmersdale and the noble baroness lady hooper for having taken account of the points raised in favour of leaseholders who had made their applications in what they considered to be the state of the law at the time <e> <s> i should have preferred the cut-off date for those applying for extended leases to be th october which was the date on which the amendment was originally moved <e> <s> nevertheless this is an important concession <e> <s> i am obliged for it and i am grateful for the change introduced in another place in accordance with the agreement reached here <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to put a particular question and also a general question to the noble lord arising from the statement which he has just read out to us <e> <s> the particular question relates to the north sea <e> <s> i was glad to note that the government have recognised that it was harmful that there had been such a reduction in investment in the future development of oil resources <e> <s> is he satisfied that the changes now proposed will deal sufficiently with the question <e> <s> there has been a massive reduction in investment having a harmful effect on current employment and a harmful effect on our future prospects for oil production <e> <s> is this something which the government will review again at a later date <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very pleased to have been privileged to hear the remarkable maiden speech of the noble lord lord derwent as i had the pleasure of meeting him on a number of occasions in one of his previous incarnations and i look forward to hearing him many more times in this house <e> <s> i am also pleased to be following the important speech just made by the noble earl lord ferrers on the export problems that we face because i should like to begin my brief remarks by turning to the balance of payments <e>", "<cs> my lords may i answer the question of the noble lord <e> <s> i was certainly not suggesting anything like a plan <e> <s> i was talking about a greater coherence of policy <e> <s> one of the things that my colleagues and i on the committee of the noble lord lord aldington were struck by was the greater coherence of policy in germany and france than there appeared to be here <e> <s> that was the only point i was making <e>", "<cs> my lords we are now nearing the end of this long but very interesting and well-informed debate <e> <s> i had the pleasure of serving on the committee responsible for producing this report and i should like to join all those who have paid tribute to the noble viscount lord torrington for the masterly and skilful manner in which he blended our various opinions in order to produce a single report <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am glad that we have the opportunity of discussing the most recently published current accounts results for the month of october <e> <s> it is most desirable that we should improve our balance under any heading whether it be visibles invisibles or anything else <e> <s> nevertheless the changes indicated in the figures for the month of october raise one or two questions <e> <s> i should therefore like to follow on the questions already posed by the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are all still interested in knowing at the earliest date the reason for this apparently happy development of moving up from million surplus in june to the figure of million in october <e> <s> am i right in assuming that when further information is available on th december a detailed background to this situation will be revealed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount mentioned in the statement the continued determination of her majestys government to work for a single market within the community <e> <s> he indicated various steps that had been taken with that in mind <e> <s> would the noble viscount inform us whether he thinks that progress so far made will mean that the objective of creating a real and effective single market within the european community will be achieved within the timespan laid down <e>", "<cs> my lords we have now reached the closing stage of this debate on the consumer protection bill <e> <s> i believe that two issues have clearly emerged <e> <s> the first is the virtually unanimous support for the objectives and the purposes of the bill <e> <s> the second is i think an equal degree of agreement on the particular issues which still require attention on not all of which are we of the same opinion <e> <s> what the debate does portend is a very important committee stage for which i hope we shall be given sufficient time <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords who have spoken in this debate so ably introduced by my noble friend lord winstanley i should like in the very limited time available to concentrate on one particular issue <e> <s> the issue i should like to address is that of home improvement <e> <s> during the course of this debate so far we have heard of the very serious human and health implications of the housing situation in britain today and of its impact on school children and on youth <e> <s> all this stems from a condition of housing which is sadly wanting and which compares very badly with many of our continental neighbours <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord comment on the trend in the non-oil visible balance underlying the overall balance bearing in mind that so far this year there has been a deficit of some billion on the non-oil visible balance compared with billion for the whole of last year <e> <s> does this not indicate that in spite of improvements in our export trends imports of goods continue to surpass them <e>", "<cs> my lords nonetheless is it not surprising that as we indicated in the debate on the occasion of the statement being made by the noble lord estimates should have been made on invisibles so close to the period when the actual figures would emerge <e> <s> in the event the actual figures were somewhat lower than the estimates then made <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord williams that if this is to become a regular practice even if a lack of credibility may not be the case nevertheless we could become confused <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to the question on the order paper about wind power may i draw the noble viscounts attention to the important export spin-off from this technology <e> <s> have we captured any markets abroad and is there a prospect of doing more if we develop this process successfully in the uk <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord taylor of gryfe in the admirable way in which he introduced this motion took an objective view of the situation which has indeed been followed by all other noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> it is important that one avoids exaggeration in this difficult situation <e> <s> to claim that all that is north is in great difficulty and recession is as wrong as to claim that everything in the south is doing very well <e> <s> what we need to do is to be selective in our understanding of this situation and find the measures within the total economy of the country that will resolve the problem areas <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> when this aspect was being discussed earlier there was grave concern about the meaning of the term industrial process as applied to agricultural products <e> <s> the directive is clear <e> <s> we are talking here about an initial process <e> <s> there may be subsequent processes to which these products can be subjected <e> <s> therefore i feel that if the word initial is not retained in the legislation we ought to be clear as to why the change has been introduced <e>", "<cs> i have been involved in industry all my working life in the public and then in the private sector <e> <s> i fully support the view that we should do everything possible to regenerate industry in this country and give every opportunity for innovation development and skill to be stimulated <e> <s> on the other hand we are here concerned with the consumer protection bill <e> <s> therefore as the noble lord lord williams said in his address we have to find the right compromise <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble viscount for such a clear answer to that question <e> <s> i should like to ask him whether in view of the very great public interest in the prospect of another nuclear power station there would be adequate debate in your lordships house on the report before a decision is taken by the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with other noble lords who have spoken in welcoming this report <e> <s> it represents a further step in strengthening the regulatory framework within which various parts of the city of london operate <e> <s> i believe that what is now important is to make sure that these different regulatory frameworks are compatible with one another <e> <s> my noble friend lord diamond in his remarks asked whether there would be a continuing and very close liaison between the sib and the new council of lloyds to make sure that they operate in tandem wherever their interests come together <e>", "<cs> all the members who have spoken in this debate have expressed grave concern about the code of practice and the noble lord lord lucas in replying to the discussions at an earlier stage indicated that the government were reviewing the whole position and were in the process of talking to interested parties <e> <s> however what worries me as it has worried the noble lord lord williams is that in the governments present thinking we shall not have the opportunity of coming back to this question before the bill leaves this chamber <e> <s> i feel that that is a matter of very grave concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to express my appreciation of the constructive manner in which the noble viscount presented the bill <e> <s> it comes to us at a time when the coal industry is recovering impressively from the aftermath of the long-running strike to which both noble lords referred <e> <s> i believe it is important that the industry should be given every support in these endeavours <e> <s> it is from that point of view that i shall make a few comments on the contents of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord ferrier pointed out we have debated this subject recently and indeed on many occasions in the past <e> <s> nevertheless i think that the noble lord lord stallard is quite right in introducing the motion in view of what has so recently happened over the winter <e> <s> he has also drawn the subject more widely than we debated it on the previous occasion <e> <s> i should like to respond to the opportunity that this has given us by speaking on the subject within a wider framework <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has given us some reassurance on this very important point but will she give any indication of when the changed arrangements will be announced <e> <s> as i mentioned in the case of neighbourhood energy action unless we know by october or november we shall in all prudence have to start running down the programme and that would be very serious <e>", "<cs> my lords in regard to the mersey barrage project is the noble viscount aware that it is very largely supported by local private interests and that it is a project which will cost considerably less than the severn barrage scheme and be completed sooner and therefore be able to demonstrate more quickly the feasibility of such tidal schemes <e> <s> in those <e>", "<cs> my lords in listening to the noble lord lord teviot i felt tempted to redress the balance and speak about west sussex where i happen to live <e> <s> however i shall reserve that for another occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords in his remarkable maiden speech the noble lord lord dainton reminisced about his experiences some -odd years ago as a university lecturer <e> <s> i too should like to go back some years because that was the first time i met the noble lord lord sherfield <e> <s> he was then as sir roger makins a powerful figure in the treasury and he was chairman of a committee which co-ordinated our overseas trade <e> <s> i had to appear before that committee to beg them to let us export some coal which was then in very strong demand <e> <s> i always used to prepare for those meetings with great care because of his logical and probing approach which of course we have seen in full measure today in the speech with which he introduced this report <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> but may i ask him whether he agrees that long-term measures are preferable to short-term palliatives and that organisations such as neighbourhood energy action which draughtproof and insulate the homes of elderly people on low incomes are much to be encouraged <e> <s> in that connection will he indicate what replacement is <e>", "<cs> my lords without in any way wishing to impede the third reading of this very important bill i should like to draw attention to what i consider to be an important aspect of the future prospects of the british coal industry namely the development of new methods of combustion of coal <e> <s> there are very big prospects in this respect and i am concerned about the relatively small effort in terms of funding relating to the combustion of coal compared with the development of nuclear power <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with the noble lord lord bruce of donington in expressing appreciation to the government for the way in which they have handled this inquiry <e> <s> it is unusual for an inquiry of this sort to be subjected to debate in both houses of parliament before a decision is reached <e> <s> that is a good move <e> <s> although the right honourable gentleman the secretary of state for energy stated that the move was without precedent i hope that it will in fact become a precedent <e> <s> i believe that it adds to the democratic way of dealing with our affairs and i <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may answer the noble earl i should like to say i was trying to speak quite objectively <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt again but what i was saying was that there was an urgency to supply the additional amount of generating capacity required <e> <s> what i said we ought to take a bit more time over is what sort of nuclear station we should now go for <e>", "<cs> i was using figures because figures were used in the report we have before us <e> <s> what i was trying to demonstrate was that on the assumptions then made they came to certain conclusions <e> <s> if we were to make those assumptions today we should come to other conclusions <e> <s> therefore there is grave uncertainty about this <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that delay in reducing interest rates at the present time is having three harmful effects first it is creating uncertainty secondly it is causing borrowers particularly in industry to pay more than they otherwise would and thirdly it is pushing up the value of currency and thus diminishing the competitiveness of british goods abroad <e> <s> are the government taking these factors into account <e>", "<cs> my lords we have today due to the motion presented to us by the noble lord lord cledwyn a debate of crucial importance to the future of the country and we have heard two vitally important speeches on that subject <e> <s> if i may deal first with the speech of the noble viscount the leader of the house he has told us of the tactics and the measures pursued by the government in support of manufacturing industry which in his opinion have led to a situation in which there is now a sign of recovery <e> <s> the noble lord lord cledwyn referred to certain underlying trends which are cause for concern <e> <s> i personally take the view that there has been some recent improvement but i also take the view that we are right to be concerned about the future <e> <s> i think that the purpose of this debate should be to identify what our problems are in the longer term and to try to devise and recommend to government a strategy for dealing with those problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with the noble lord lord bruce of donington in thanking the noble viscount for repeating the statement <e> <s> it is of course a matter of great importance <e> <s> i should like to put three questions arising from the statement to the noble viscount <e> <s> the first concerns the economic case to which the noble lord lord bruce has already referred <e> <s> the secretary of state said that he had concluded that sizewell b remained the cheapest option for meeting the anticipated needs for new capacity despite the much reduced prices of fossil fuel since the report was prepared <e>", "<cs> i thought that he was the noble viscount unless the noble and learned lord has elevated him <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to invite the noble viscount to tell us whether he is prepared to let us have the basis on which this conclusion was reached so we can have before us the figuring which the secretary of state used in reaching his decision just as we had before us the figuring that the inspector used <e> <s> i do not think that that is an unreasonable request <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord what he would do about weekends <e> <s> if goods were seized for the preliminary view late on a friday or early on a saturday as might arise will he agree that the weekend problem creates difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to the question on the order paper does the noble lord not agree that towards the end of last year when the cso introduced

replacing estimates with estimates be discontinued in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i follow the points made by the noble lord lord williams particularly in regard to the figures which are published from time to time on the invisible balance <e> <s> we were all concerned last november when the central statistical office contrary to normal practice having issued estimates month by month of the invisible figures which in due course according to practice were corrected when the firm figures were available brought out some new estimates which considerably increased the previous <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not whether the figures had been moved up or down that we are concerned about <e> <s> the normal practice with invisible figures is to put in estimates and to leave those estimates in the figures until the real figures are known <e> <s> the government seem to have departed from that practice last year in replacing estimates with further estimates which in turn turned out to be wrong <e> <s> that is what we are criticising <e>", "<cs> my lords as the question is closely intertwined with productivity will the noble lord kindly indicate how british industrial investment has compared with that of other developed countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that expected answer <e> <s> but is he aware that the reason for m delors making the statement was that he considered this to be an essential ingredient in creating an effective internal market <e> <s> in view of the governments commitment to the creation of an effective internal market do they now consider that they should give more thought to supporting the ems <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall that the chancellor of the exchequer was recently reported as having said that he thought that sterling ought to have a specific relationship to the deutsch mark <e> <s> if that is so is not the best way to do that to join the system which precisely provides for that eventuality <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord saying to the house that recent press reports on the governments refusal to support the last and most recent phase of the european research programme when mr geoffrey patties name was specifically mentioned are totally erroneous that they are in fact supporting all these projects and that the press has it all wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords who have intervened in this debate so far have taken a broad view of the economic and financial policies of the government and have expressed their views according to their particular party affiliations <e> <s> this is absolutely right and proper particularly in this context of an approaching election <e> <s> but i feel at this stage that it might be helpful if i were to concentrate on a particular aspect of policy because i have no doubt that my noble friend lord diamond who will be summing up for the alliance will be taking a broad sweep of the economic and financial policies of the nation <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that i said that there were two extraordinary items which had helped to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the report on the brain drain which was published today pointed out that one of the major factors leading to it in so far as it occurs and apparently it occurs less than it was at one time thought was the lack of career prospects and research facilities in this country <e> <s> the question of taxation was not mentioned as a major factor <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it is the task of those in opposition to probe behind the glowing statements of ministers <e> <s> we have had such a glowing statement today from the noble lord lord young of graffham vigorously and eloquently supported by the noble lord lord harris of high cross and the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i think that our most valid contributions could take the form of asking a few leading questions designed to see whether the statements made by the noble lords who represent the government at a particular time are justified in the event <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has reiterated yet again the governments firm opposition to any public funding of this project either directly or indirectly <e> <s> may i ask him however whether that restatement of a well-known position would inhibit the railways from making the necessary investment to realise the full potential <e>", "<cs> my lords as president of the trading standards administration perhaps i may ask whether the noble lord is aware that there is serious concern in that organisation at the lack of legislation on this matter and whether before coming to the negative conclusion which the noble lord announced to the house earlier he consulted the trading standards administration <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of being told

and more efficient than we have now <e> <s> that is a perfectly fair question to put <e>", "<cs> my lords before the motion proposed by the noble viscount is put to the house may i point out that the change of date for the debate on this subject has caused some inconvenience to those who want to speak on it <e> <s> i hope that this may be borne in mind for the future conduct of our business <e>", "<cs> my lords the draft order before us comes at a time when the whole energy scene in great britain and now in northern ireland is being looked at again <e> <s> it is therefore of great importance that we should be clear about the implications of this order <e> <s> following upon the intervention of the noble lord lord prys-davies i should like to put a number of questions to the noble lord lord lyell on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords it is nie and there is no word missing <e> <s> we now know where we stand <e> <s> it is of course very much affected by this order <e> <s> it has served

elucidation <e> <s> is he referring to the first two sets only or to the conversion of the four sets at the station <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl whether the government have received complaints from certain industrial consumers about the pricing and contract policies pursued by british gas in view of its strong market position and if so what they propose to do about it <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord feel that he went a little far when he said that the report of the select committee on overseas trade was largely discredited <e> <s> as a member of that select committee i can recall will not the noble lord recall <e> <s> that the government themselves in commenting on that report accepted a very large number of recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords before making my contribution to this important debate i should like to crave the indulgence of the house if i absent myself for a short period during the dinner hour for another engagement entered into a long time ago <e> <s> but i hope to be back before the winding up <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that at this time of enormous perturbation in the stock exchanges of the world every effort should be made to keep currencies stable <e> <s> would not great britain finally joining the exchange rate mechanism help to do that in the important european area <e> <s> is it not therefore surprising sterling having openly cohabited with the exchange rate mechanism for the past nine months

institute of trading standards administration in which post i succeeded the late lord drumalbyn to whom i am sure the house would like to pay tribute <e> <s> can the minister indicate to the house the response that is likely to be forthcoming from the government to representations made recently by the trading standards administration and other bodies about safeguarding the public interest in regard to the sale of used cars and particularly the clocking of speedometers <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble viscount for repeating the statement i must express some puzzlement as to its contents <e> <s> the noble lord lord stoddart in concluding his remarks referred to privatisation <e> <s> i waited carefully while the statement was being read for any reference to privatisation <e> <s> therefore will the noble viscount first of all confirm that it is still the governments intention to privatise the electricity industry <e> <s> secondly if that is so will he confirm that it is their intention to privatise it with the maximum possible degree of competition particularly in the generating sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased to be standing here tonight in support of the question asked by the noble lord lord aldington <e> <s> together with other members of the select committee i spent many months in very fruitful and useful discussion on the issue which was put to us by your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords for those who live in wooded areas and who have regularly suffered over the years from interruptions in electricity supply would it not be a sensible long-term policy selectively to put cables underground <e> <s> i feel that here there is a question of saving money in the short term but incurring much more expenditure in the long term <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount tell the house whether it is part of the governments plan to reduce the flow of heavy traffic through residential areas <e> <s> is he aware for example of the undue accumulation of coach traffic in the victoria area which is causing a lot of problems for residents there <e> <s> some noble lords may be among those residents <e> <s> can the noble viscount promise some alleviation of the problem before long <e>", "<cs> the problem is that i have not been able to put those objectives in order of merit because the government have somewhat changed the emphasis as time has gone on as i shall now try to show <e> <s> if you take the privatisations which have so far occurred they fall into two categories <e> <s> the first category is those enterprises which were in a competitive situation and remain in a competitive situation such enterprises as cable and wireless amersham international britoil associated british ports enterprise oil jaguar national freight and national bus <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords who have participated in this debate <e> <s> i think they have shown remarkable skill in concentrating so much wisdom and experience in such a limited time <e> <s> in particular i feel that what was said about the prospective privatisation will be very carefully heeded by government <e> <s> these are going to be very difficult issues and i am glad that the noble lord lord young of graffham has made it clear that we shall have many further opportunities for debate on these subjects <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw my motion <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that while british industry has done extremely well in recent months in increasing its exports it now has many obstacles in its path that interest rates in real terms are still higher than those in most of our competitor countries that it is faced with a currency which is increasing in value every day and therefore making competition more difficult and that on top of that the government have chosen this very moment to add to electricity costs which in the case of many leading export industries are very serious indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased indeed to be able to take part in this debate so ably initiated by the noble lord lord thorneycroft <e> <s> i have not only known him for many years but for a number of years worked closely with him <e> <s> he has quite rightly a reputation for being one of the most effective and witty speakers in the house and from my certain knowledge also outside it <e> <s> he has chosen as a subject for debate today one which is worthy of his skills and which i am sure will also be worthy of the skills of the three noble lords who will be making their maiden speeches later on <e>", "<cs> my lords the secretary of state has made it clear that the proposed privatisation measure for british steel will comprehend the whole of the organisation as it now exists <e> <s> while it is perfectly true <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount recall that his right honourable friend the secretary of state for energy recently gave it as his view that on privatisation the generating companies would be bound to generate a certain proportion from nuclear sources <e> <s> is that still the opinion of the department <e> <s> would that commitment be irrespective of commercial considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister can indicate what progress has been made in opening up the market for public procurement bearing in mind that that could present many opportunities for our capital goods manufacturers <e> <s> at the same time it would open our markets to competition <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to the statement made by the noble lord i should like to address a question on the procedure for our short debates to the leader of the house <e> <s> while i fully concur with the concept of the short debate as i am sure we all do when some of the subjects proposed for a short debate are of sufficient interest to attract so many peers as will be the case today i should like to ask whether the procedure could be modified so that those subjects can be transferred for a longer period of debate <e>", "<cs> my lords in listening to the remarks made by my old friend the noble lord lord mason of barnsley i was sorely tempted to use my limited ration of time to talk about coal <e> <s> however as there are other things that i wish to talk about i shall limit what i have to say about coal to a few short sentences <e> <s> first i agree with what the noble lord said about the fluidised combustion process <e> <s> i think that it holds out great promise not only of improving the efficiency of combustion but also of reducing emissions in the atmosphere <e> <s> i like the noble lord would like to know what progress has been made in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that the noble lord lord mountevans has been absolutely justified in raising at this relatively early stage after the construction of the channel tunnel has been committed the question of the rail link on the british side <e> <s> both he and the noble lord lord deedes have very clearly set out the issues that are worrying a number of us <e> <s> indeed they are not new issues <e> <s> they were seen at a very early stage <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord on this subject whether similar constraints as to government funding have been applied on the french side <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a vigorous and informed debate on a subject which as the noble lord lord williams said we shall no doubt return to many times <e> <s> i think it is right that as we are nearing the half-way stage of the preparations for the single market we should have had this debate tonight <e> <s> i am <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to lend my support to the amendment which was so ably moved by the noble lord lord stanley <e> <s> in doing so he drew attention to the five objectives which would be achieved by the acceptance of the amendment <e> <s> i should like to refer specifically to this third objective which is to limit the fouling of pavements <e> <s> i do so as president of the tidy britain group <e>", "<cs> my lords although the minister indicated that there had been no green papers issued <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that whereas the treasury had previously forecast an outturn for this year of something of the order of a deficit of billion most external experts consider it to be billion on the balance of payments <e> <s> that therefore would be a very serious situation bearing in mind that at the present time the rate of imports is three times in volume the rate of exports <e> <s> have the government in mind any policies which will stem the situation by stimulating import substitutions <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for introducing this debate at this time particularly as there has been a great deal of publicity concerning the service from both industries <e> <s> as she rightly said we are entering an entirely new era in certain basic industries <e> <s> the privatisation of telecommunications and gas creating either monopolies or virtual monopolies in the private sector has raised in a new form the ways in which consumers should be protected <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a breakdown in the annual report prepared by the gas consumers council <e> <s> it gives a breakdown and of the total figures quoted about half are general inquiries and the rest are detailed complaints <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will permit me to intervene perhaps he could indicate in what form that was done <e> <s> was it done through the cbi or were all contract customers consulted <e> <s> i must say that although i sat through the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> i was not aware that that had emerged <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to welcome the statement and the opportunity that it gives us of initially having a discussion on this important issue and asking some questions <e>", "<cs> my lords it is undoubtedly one of the major roles if not the major role of the legislature of any democratic nation to exercise continued vigilance of the executives actions to ensure that there is no excessive concentration of power and that that power is not exercised unduly strongly <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all particularly indebted to the noble lord lord beloff for venturing into the energy field which i believe is a new one for him in his usual logical and rational way <e> <s> he has introduced a debate which enables us to review energy policy which we do from time to time <e> <s> as he rightly said in the terms of the motion energy plays a key part in the economy of the country <e> <s> i think it is right therefore that we should come to it from time to time <e> <s> this is the basis on which the noble baroness lady nicol also made her contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble viscount if he can say whether meanwhile as it seems to have been hinted in the white paper there could be some modification to the act <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with great pleasure that i congratulate the noble marquess lord huntly <e>", "<cs> my lords as someone who for many years has been connected with the tidy britain group i should like to express my appreciation for the kind remarks made by the noble earl about the activities of the group <e> <s> does he not agree that of the many initiatives that it has launched its community environment initiative and the schools initiative are two especially deserving of support to ensure that local authorities have a clear and defined objective to remove litter and that school children are aware of the problem <e>", "<cs> in supporting this amendment proposed by my noble friend perhaps i may say that i believe this raises a matter of principle <e> <s> i do not believe that legislation which comes through this chamber should give any government unlimited power <e> <s> if the government propose to undertake certain measures they should not only identify the measures but identify the time-span within which they want to take those measures <e>", "<cs> the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord williams of elvel ties in with the previous amendment which has been rejected by the committee namely that we want to know from this side of the committee where we stand <e> <s> the government are taking such very wide powers under this clause that we feel that some definition is required <e> <s> surely it is not unreasonable to suggest under our due processes that the proposal that the secretary of state might have at any time should be submitted for debate to parliament <e> <s> i very much hope that the noble earl will be able to agree to this amendment <e>", "<cs> in supporting my noble friends amendment i should like to say that we are doing the <e>", "<cs> the disposal of assets in this way is a subject which we have discussed on previous occasions <e> <s> i agree that it is difficult to define the nations assets <e> <s> however in the case of the proposed privatisation of the electricity industry in particular a vastly greater amount of money will be realised than on any previous occasion <e> <s> therefore it is not unreasonable to have an indication of how the matter will be dealt with whether it be the form of words represented by my noble friend or in some other way <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl replies i should like to comment on the remarks made by the noble lord lord rees whose views i greatly respect <e> <s> however having said that in the case of the electricity industry as the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon has mentioned it is indissolubly linked with the feedstock you cannot generate electricity unless you have something to generate it with <e> <s> the government have already decided that in respect of one of our national feedstock elements namely nuclear there should be some degree of safeguard <e> <s> i find it somewhat illogical that in the case of another source of that nature there should not also be written in some safeguard <e>", "<cs> i think it is right that we should raise this important issue at this stage <e> <s> noble lords have expressed their opinions on the subject and i was glad to note that among his remarks the noble earl has reiterated the governments strong support for the coal industry and the strong investment which they intend to continue to put into it <e> <s> i believe that we should come back to this at a later stage <e> <s> on this occasion we on these benches have made known our views on the subject <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i too feel a certain degree of confusion in trying to understand what the words proposal or proposals mean <e> <s> there is an apparent distinction between proposals in subsection b and proposal in subsection a <e> <s> i fear that this adds to our sense of difficulty in following the drift of what should be a very simple piece of legislation <e>", "<cs> following on the elucidation for which the noble lord lord williams has asked perhaps i may ask whether the proposals in clause are the related proposals referred to in clause b <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that the reports of recent disagreements in high places on exchange rate policy have caused confusion and unsettlement <e> <s> will he tell the house whether those disagreements have been resolved and whether in the light of the reduction in interest rates last week it is now the firm objective of government policy to ensure that we have a stable exchange rate at a competitive level in order to enable us to counter the increasing imports coming into this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord dean of beswick on giving us the opportunity today to debate this very important report <e> <s> had it not been for his initiative i believe that we would have passed over without comment a report which raises very important issues <e> <s> as he has rightly told the house this concerns billion of the assets of the country <e> <s> if we were not concerned with the way in which those assets were being maintained and refurbished i think we should be failing in our duty as a responsible house of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the spirit of the amendments of both the noble lords lord renton and lord mcintosh <e> <s> there is a degree of obscurity about clause <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton has already referred to the fact that the marginal note is more illuminating than the clause itself <e> <s> furthermore in the arrangement of clauses clause is defined as <e>", "<cs> my lords while i am of course impressed with the argument put forward by the noble lord lord renton i must say that right from the start the clause has caused most of us a great deal of concern <e> <s> i entirely agree that if the amendments put forward by the noble lords lord renton and lord mcintosh earlier had been accepted there would be less reason to press for some time limit but without a clearer definition of the objectives and with a totally unlimited time scale i feel that we shall be passing legislation which will have been far too broadly drawn to be appropriate for its purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords while i agree with the noble lord lord renton that the definition of the word proposal is a difficult one and that if one took it too far it might just be a broad idea which the minister wanted to discuss with the chairmen of the relevant bodies nevertheless we are talking here of two vital issues which are of grave concern to the nation and certainly of grave concern to both houses of parliament as the legislation goes through <e> <s> so i <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express appreciation to the noble lord lord underhill for giving us the opportunity of looking yet again at the problem of traffic congestion and public transport <e> <s> what makes it all the more important that we should be considering these problems today is that the evidence suggests that the difficulties could progressively get worse unless urgent action is taken <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting this amendment i should like for my part to remind the house that on these benches we have always felt that this first clause is too widely drawn in terms of both time and content <e> <s> the purpose of the first clause was made very clear in debate not least by the noble earl himself <e> <s> it is made very clear in the marginal note and on the first page of the document with the arrangement of clauses but surprisingly it is not made sufficiently clear within the body of the bill itself <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill particularly clause which has taken up so much of our time is the precursor to two major bills that will shortly come before us <e> <s> i regret that we have not been able to agree at least on the wording of the clause <e> <s> it seems to me a bad foretaste of what may come <e> <s> i hope that as regards clarity the succeeding bill will be clearer than this clause has been <e>", "<cs> my lords we are particularly indebted to the noble lord lord joseph for introducing a motion which enables us to do something which i believe this house is fairly skilled at doing namely pondering over a major issue of policy <e> <s> we have had important contributions from the noble lords lord young and lord williams on this subject and we shall have many other important contributions to follow <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to be reassured on that point <e> <s> i can only point out to the noble lord that this point was recently mentioned <e> <s> if it is incorrect that there has been a cutback in statistical staff that should be made known officially <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that it was inhibited by the share price having gone down <e> <s> i said that it having made a completely green field new investment the analyst took a dim view because it was long term <e> <s> that is the point i was making <e>", "<cs> my lords for many years i was involved in an industry closely associated with the steel industry <e> <s> i was able to witness at first hand the debilitating effect on the steel industry of the continued changes of ownership <e> <s> i believe that it is a remarkable testimony to the ability of the present management that with that background it has achieved such a remarkable turn-round <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to put three questions to the noble lord on this statement which he has been kind enough to repeat to us some of which tie in with the remarks just made by the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> first on the question of competition it seems to me implicit in the governments proposal that this measure this way of disposing of girobank would increase the area of competition <e> <s> i am not at all sure that it would <e> <s> if girobank which has established itself as a successful banking operation and created a clearly defined niche in the banking marketplace is to be absorbed in another financial institution it could lose its identity and its niche and the area of competition could thereby be reduced <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not query the governments intention of selling the bank off to the private sector i queried the method that they propose to adopt <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked the noble lord what assurance there would be that the purchaser would necessarily agree to girobank doing all these things or indeed to completing its substantial investment in information technology <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the noble lord lord williams in thanking the noble lord lord young for making this statement and in expressing appreciation for the prompt action of the dti in setting up this inquiry to deal with the public comment so far made on the issue <e> <s> i should like to address two questions to the noble lord one affects licensing procedures and the other compensation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in financial circles the estimate is that the net effect on the balance of payments for the end of this year will be a deficit of approximately billion <e> <s> that may or may not be right <e> <s> however bearing that prospect in mind will the noble lord indicate whether in addition to increasing interest rates which appears to be the policy of the government they have in mind any other measures which may deal with the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords can the house be given some clarification concerning the prospects for the freer movement of individuals which was the first point to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> he said on the one hand that the objective was that individuals would be able to move around more freely within the community from onwards <e> <s> on the other he referred to the very desirable objective of dealing with drug trafficking etc <e> <s> will the two be related and will the result be that the movement of individuals from one country in the community to another will remain as restricted as it now is for those reasons <e> <s> or will the two issues be separated and will those of us who are not engaged in those nefarious activities be able to move more freely while action is taken to deal with the others in the necessary manner <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for indicating what measures are now being taken but is he aware that delays in take-off from airports in the london area are now becoming the rule rather than the exception <e> <s> these delays mean that passengers are required to sit in often fully laden planes for anything up to half an hour or more sometimes on journeys which themselves take only minutes <e> <s> that is totally disrupting for the individual programmes of people <e> <s> is it not possible for some short-term measures to be taken while these longer-term investigations are being undertaken <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> i am glad that he has restated the governments firm commitment to put private generators on the same basis as the existing electricity supply industry <e> <s> the government cannot support the wording of the amendment but i regret that they are not prepared to come forward with an alternative which can deal with the matter more quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment moved by the noble lord lord morton of shuna and supported by the noble lord lord williams of elvel raises some very important issues <e> <s> the noble lord lord morton of shuna said that so long as the company remains in the ownership of the government the articles that is the conditions under which the company should operate should form part of the bill <e> <s> as he pointed out there is a risk that if that is not so then we could be passing a bill which could become law and the articles which lay down the basis upon which the company should operate could be altered at will <e> <s> we are entitled to know precisely what the basis is upon which the company should operate so long as it is owned by the crown <e> <s> therefore <e> <s> i fully support the first contention <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to join in expressing appreciation for the early deliverance to us of the statement on this very serious affair <e> <s> we too wish to express our sympathy to all those affected and our appreciation of the selfless service rendered by those involved in the rescue operation <e> <s> those who toil in the north sea not only contribute great wealth to this country they are all the time taking risks <e> <s> it is a very difficult environment <e> <s> theirs is a service we have come to respect and must safeguard in every possible way <e> <s> that is why we too welcome the fact that the government are very quickly to set up a full-ranging inquiry into the causes of this tragedy <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord barnett referred to a possible level of about billion before the end of this year which is commonly mentioned in the city <e> <s> if that were to increase during the course of next year at what level would the government become concerned because that would start to represent per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> of our gdp <e>", "<cs> my lords as the use of fossil fuels is likely to contribute to energy production on a large scale for some time to come would it not be desirable for the british research effort to concentrate on that impact in order to take a lead position and thereby repair the omission that we committed in not taking acid rain seriously enough when that matter first arose <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for discharging his commitment to this house of keeping us informed before the summer recess of the progress of the negotiations in this deal <e> <s> having said that like the noble lord lord williams we are in a state of confusion <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving his important amendment the noble lord lord morton of shuna has made two major points <e> <s> first he has raised the proper question of the importance of ravenscraig to the scottish economy <e> <s> its importance to the scottish economy is one matter its importance as part of the total of the british steel industry may be another <e> <s> the two must he weighed up and whether that has been done sufficiently so far is not clear <e> <s> the second important issue he raised is whether the governments proposal to privatise the steel industry as a whole is the best proposal in the interests of the nation <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord nevertheless not agree that there are certain potentially dangerous signs in the economy the continued high level of consumer expenditure the continued expansion of credit the low level of personal savings the continued increase in house prices particularly in the south-east and the consequential impact on the balance of payments <e> <s> are these not all causes for concern <e> <s> all of us are keen that the economy of britain should be properly managed <e> <s> what are the governments measures to deal with those problems <e>", "<cs> my lords while it is encouraging to note that industrial

whether the prime ministers speeches on th september to the royal society and on th october to the conservative party conference mean that britain will now take the lead in these matters instead of lagging behind as hitherto <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl not agree that there is some concern among consumers at a possible increase in prices of electricity that might result from a fixed component of nuclear energy in the privatised sector <e> <s> will he not agree that if that is so it is unfair to burden the consumer with the extra cost based on national policy and that if there is

railway stations there is still only one main coach station <e> <s> this is causing undue congestion in the victoria area and considerable inconvenience to those who wish to travel by coach north

company area of contracted-out services in some cases and its own provided services in other cases <e> <s> it is not a question of trying to find comparisons between one company and another but of a company being able to test its own ability against an external contractor <e> <s> that is what i had in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for his answer can i ask how he reconciles the governments evident intention of promoting exports with the fact that expenditure on export promotion has fallen in the last three years from million in to an estimated million last year <e> <s> would it not have been more desirable to have had increased effort in this sector in view of our present position <e>", "<cs> my lords in answering my question the noble lord said that the quantum of

plans for expansion and improvement in the underground system include more rolling stock so that those of us who travel in the rush hour can avoid being squashed like sardines <e>", "<cs> my lords in preparing for my contribution to the debate on this bill i looked up the debate on the earlier bill to which the noble baroness referred namely the bill of <e> <s> i found that on that occasion in place of the noble baroness herself the participant was the noble lord lord strabolgi and that the role of the noble lord lord williams of elvel was taken by the noble lord lord trefgarne <e> <s> the role that i am taking now here at least there is a degree of consistency was taken by my noble friend lord avebury <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may revert to what the noble baroness said earlier <e>

the rest of the electricity industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mountevans for raising the subject for debate not only because it enables us to express an opinion on the possible privatisation of the railways but because we can comment on the present situation in the railways <e> <s> we must look at the railways future prospects in the light of what is now happening

britain <e> <s> therefore anything that is done in that connection has to he very closely examined <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that it will affect all committed future fields from <e> <s>

should apply from now as is normally done in any budget <e> <s> it is the retrospective element over which there is some doubt <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that londons traffic is becoming increasingly congested and that public transport facilities in particular are proving unequal to the increased demands being put on them <e> <s> bearing in mind that all forms of urban transport are interdependent are the government right in pursuing this policy of reacting to particular situations as they arise <e> <s> has not the time come to look at londons transport as a whole

efficiency is one of the most effective ways of achieving the containment of the greenhouse effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that we must treat our valuable natural gas to best advantage <e> <s>

party political view to take that concern seriously into account and to make suggestions as to how this big national problem can be resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact that so many peers wish to

am delighted that the government have recently given us additional support <e> <s> however in connection with the noble lords original question could a greater effort be made in the countryside which

to be gained <e> <s> in the days when i was involved at the coal board it was conceived on a somewhat larger scale than that on which it is now i understand proceeding <e>", "<cs> from what the noble lord has said i take it that he feels this would not be a relevant amendment to consider in the present circumstances but that it could arise on a later occasion in other circumstances <e> <s> on that basis i withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i find the ministers answer rather puzzling <e> <s> when we consider clause the question will arise of shareholders declaring an interest when their holding

lord said that the government would not accept that the threshold should be reduced below per cent <e> <s> is this therefore an instruction to the takeover panel <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister

have the advantage of a less acute bend and that it would go underground earlier <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the remarks of the noble viscount lord caldecote <e> <s> i think that we should be warned by the experience of the united states whose practices in relation to mergers are tending to spread here <e> <s> the motives for many recent mergers have been of a purely financial nature

will not spread either to the united kingdom or to the community <e>", "<cs> since the noble lord referred to me perhaps i may say that the point i was raising was the fear that some of the practices

support the amendments which i think are very timely and appropriate <e> <s> the noble lord lord young has himself played a leading role in stimulating industry to prepare for and the single market

context add the words european community <e> <s> we are talking here about merger policy and approaches to mergers <e> <s> there are any number of firms which are preparing themselves for the larger market by merging and linking up <e> <s> i mention the case of gec and siemens <e> <s> if that had been purely related to the uk market i presume it would have been regarded as far too large a grouping <e> <s> but because it is seen in the ec context in the new situation it is regarded quite differently <e> <s> the ec introduces a specific new dimension which has to be taken into account in relation to merger policy <e> <s> i do not understand why it need be left out <e>", "<cs> my lords as a corollary to stimulating investment in the motor industry will the minister use his best endeavours to ensure that we have an adequacy of roads on which to use those cars <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord chance his arm and tell us what kind of air traffic problems we will have this summer <e> <s> will they be as bad as last summer or will the position be somewhat better <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that to join the exchange rate mechanism now would take pressure off sterling enable interest rates which were discussed earlier this afternoon to be reduced below their present very high level and prepare us more effectively for the competition that will arise from the single market <e> <s> furthermore perhaps he can explain something which is puzzling me and maybe other noble lords <e> <s> why is it that when ex-cabinet ministers go to brussels

debates in your lordships house <e> <s> every time we have debated it and the secretary of state has been present he has fully supported it <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the regional effort being made in energy efficiency but can the noble baroness indicate whether the funds made available for regional offices and the funds made available for the centre add up to what was available last year

was just over million and that that will be reduced in the coming year to million and in the year after that to million <e> <s> that includes all that is being done to support the regional effort <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord was quite right in his answer to the noble lord lord mason it is not for government to create exports but they can provide the climate in which exports can be developed <e> <s> in that connection will the minister indicate what is the governments present policy towards the british overseas trade board <e> <s> to my knowledge it has had its resources progressively diminished over recent years <e> <s> can the minister say whether that trend is now going to be reversed and that we are going to make a real effort to improve our trade balance with our european partners <e>", "<cs> my lords i too from these benches wish to express appreciation to the noble lord for the considered statement which he gave in response to this question <e> <s> however i wish to ask him three short questions <e> <s> first of all the noble lord said that the legal proceedings presently in train would be prejudiced if there were early publication <e> <s> however the knowledge of the contents of this report is now so widely spread that it is difficult to see how if there is to be prejudice that prejudice has not already been created <e> <s> would it not therefore be much simpler to publish the report so that all could see it in a proper manner rather than clandestinely as at present <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that in respect of competitiveness british coals achievement over the past few years in producing an enormous increase in productivity has been something to be admired <e> <s> secondly does she also accept that the import of coal is an uncertain thing as the price of imported coal depends upon the level of freight rates at any one time the level of sterling in relation to other currencies and the performance in the countries concerned and that we should be well advised as a country to continue to depend as much as possible upon our indigenous and certain reserves <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister first indicate why it has taken so long to get our bathing beaches up to the standards of other countries especially as measures to that effect were envisaged as long ago as in the control of pollution act <e> <s> secondly is it right that the cost of getting our beaches up to the right standard should be borne exclusively by the users of water <e> <s> should they not be borne by the public at large which benefits from those beaches <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that in spite of the commendable growth that has taken place in the last few years in manufacturing industry our capacity is inadequate to meet the requirements of the nation <e> <s> what steps will the government take to make sure that we increase the competitive capacity of manufacturing industry so that the enormous deficit totalling no less than billion on our manufacturing account last year can be overcome <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl care to comment on an incident which occurred on the morning of nd march <e> <s> on that occasion there was only one immigration officer on duty at heathrow for outgoing passengers and there were between and passengers trying to get through to catch early morning planes <e> <s> that caused total confusion chaos and a good deal of complaint <e> <s> is he further aware that i was informed that this was not an isolated incident in recent times <e> <s> if the government intend to go ahead with a customs and immigration hall at waterloo in connection with the channel tunnel can he indicate whether such delays could also occur <e> <s> that would frustrate the whole endeavour of having a channel tunnel <e>", "<cs> my lords i express my appreciation to the noble lord lord montagu of beaulieu who introduced this debate for the way in which he did so <e> <s> the noble lord has clearly studied these matters with great care <e> <s> he made a presentation of this imaginative scheme in such a way that it has led me at any rate to take a different view from that expressed in the speech of the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth <e>", "<cs> my lords the privatisation of water is probably the most controversial of the privatisation measures which this government have introduced <e> <s> i think it right to recall briefly the way in which their thinking on privatisation appears to have developed <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the

"<cs> my lords i too wish to support this amendment <e> <s> i have had some experience of agms <e> <s> it will be highly desirable for smaller shareholders who cannot be present to be encouraged to make their views known <e> <s> the big institutional shareholders will always make their views known and the mass proxy votes will come from them <e> <s> these days it surely must be an objective that

unfortunately is absent because he has to attend a memorial service out of london i should like to say that we much appreciate the kind remarks made by the secretary of state which were addressed to my noble friend <e> <s> he had to bear the brunt of the bill <e> <s> our benches are not as fully supplied as our friends next door with the panoply of talent that they have been able to muster on this occasion <e> <s> we shall try to do better next time around <e>", "<cs> my lords while we must all be pleased that the csos responsibilities will be enlarged and will cover all statistics is the noble lord aware that there is serious concern that that body will come under the control of the treasury <e> <s> as he may be aware the treasury is no longer regarded as thoroughly objective in its use and treatment of statistics <e> <s> would it not have been far better if the body had been put under the control of some central office such as the cabinet office so that we could be assured of its total objectivity <e>", "<cs> during the second reading debate many of the noble lords who participated drew attention to the public apprehensions which have been created by the bill <e> <s> one of the apprehensions was the question of what would happen to the land <e> <s> the landholdings of the water authorities are substantial they are approximately acres <e> <s> those pieces of land have important environmental value <e> <s> the bulk of the landholdings are in fact required for operational purposes <e> <s> they are required to safeguard water supplies <e> <s> in those circumstances and having created the national rivers authority a body which will be concerned with safeguarding the environment and the protection of water supplies it seems to me that that would be the proper body to own the freehold to that land <e> <s> it should make sure that it is used for the best purposes as regards the protection and environmental impact of water supplies <e>", "<cs> in supporting amendment no <e> <s> and the related amendment no <e> <s> i like the noble lord lord mcintosh remind the committee that the government have laid enormous emphasis on the division of responsibilities and functions as between the nra on the one hand and the operating water companies on the other <e>", "<cs> in supporting the amendment perhaps i may say that an amendment of this kind would be of extreme convenience <e> <s> the difficulty with this type of legislation is that one has to search right through the bill to find out what are the functions of the various bodies created by the legislation <e> <s> unless one peruses the bill and all its numerous schedules it is very difficult to form a clear impression of the functions of the nra <e> <s> they are simply described at the beginning as setting up regional bodies and that is about all <e> <s> one has to search much further on to find out what else it does <e>", "<cs> leaving aside the first subsection of the amendment to which the noble earl has a fundamental objection does he not agree that it would be useful at this early stage to define the functions of the authority even though they are dealt with in greater depth later in the bill <e> <s> it is difficult without a detailed perusal of the bill to find out what the functions of the authority are <e> <s> they are spread throughout this gargantuan bill <e> <s> would it not be a matter of convenience whatever wording might be thought of as appropriate to set out at this early stage the broad functions of the authority <e>", "<cs> are we to take it that the request made by the noble lord lord crickhowell that the issue should be looked at again has been heeded and that the answer is negative <e>", "<cs> i have listened to what the government have said on this relatively small issue <e> <s> it is certainly not a matter on which the committee should be asked to indicate its views in a division <e> <s> we may come back to it later but in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am pleased to learn that the nra advisory committee has agreed that some of the regional bodies should be open to the public <e> <s> it would be better if it had also agreed that in some form all their activities should be open to the public apart from those that were necessarily of a confidential nature affecting commercial considerations that might come their way <e>", "<cs> i certainly hope that situations would not frequently arise where the nra was at variance with the advice received from a regional committee <e> <s> that would mean that it was imposing on the region things which those who were selected to represent it in these matters did not agree with <e> <s> it was to strengthen the regional position that these amendments were introduced <e> <s> however having heard what the noble earl has said i should like to reflect on the issue and consider whether to come back to it in some other way at a later stage

contributions than we have had this afternoon <e> <s> to be one of the concluding speakers after such a galaxy of talent is quite daunting <e>", "<cs> i believe that we must all be beholden to the noble baroness for moving this simple but important amendment because the protection of customers interests must be paramount <e> <s> after all we have already spent nearly three hours talking about the relationship between the consumer and the shareholder <e> <s> at the very least we should be sure that these customer service committees will be set up and that the wording in this clause will be made totally consistent and should reassure all those who are concerned about the protection and safeguarding of consumers <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord lord mcintosh has made a very important point <e> <s> legally this drafting may be technically correct but the interpretation by the very large number of people who will use the bill when enacted could raise doubts <e> <s> i ask the noble earl at least to take back this amendment <e> <s> if it requires some redrafting for legal purposes perhaps the government could return with a proposal at a later stage <e>", "<cs> the question of the independence of consumer advocacy is of vital importance <e> <s> in this very complex legislation which is transferring a basic monopoly enterprise from the public to the private sector it must be seen that the consumer is protected as much as possible <e> <s> the director has many functions to undertake in that respect but the consumer organisations that are set up under this bill should be seen to be as independent as possible <e> <s> it is for that reason that i support this amendment and i very much hope that the government will be persuaded by the argument to accept it <e>", "<cs> the number of noble lords who have intervened in the debate on this amendment demonstrates the importance attached to it <e> <s> in fact that is a reflection of public opinion <e> <s> the public is concerned about what will happen to the land which is associated with the water industry and which has substantial environmental and recreational impact <e> <s> it would be in the governments interest to show beyond any doubt that it is their intention to safeguard those aspects <e> <s> that is what the public wants <e> <s> clause as presently drafted does not go far enough <e>

lord lord norrie replies to the minister i should like to add a few comments <e> <s> the minister has touched on the nub of the whole issue which we touched on earlier today and which is still recurring <e> <s> these privatised water companies are not going to be ordinary private companies <e> <s> they are going to inherit a great tradition of efficient water supply and of responsibility for the lands associated with their operations <e>", "<cs> i wish to follow up what the noble lord lord renton said in the latter part of his remarks <e> <s> with a complex measure of this sort it is clearly right to do things in due order <e> <s> everyone has agreed that the nra has a very important function to perform <e> <s> the date on which the various other bodies and the plcs come into operation is something that has to be worked out to get the best results <e> <s> if clause gives that discretion to the secretary of state then i hope that when the noble earl replies to the debate he will indicate how the discretion will be used in order to make sure that the bill when enacted comes into operation in the most effective manner <e>", "<cs> from what has been said so far particularly from the interventions of the noble lords lord jenkin and lord renton there is some confusion about the wording of clause <e> <s> it says that the appointment may be made either by the secretary of state or with his consent and authorisation by the director <e> <s> the interpretation of the noble lord lord jenkin was that the initial appointment was to be made by the secretary of state and subsequently it would be made by the director <e> <s> that is not what the wording says <e>", "<cs> one could debate a good deal the question of when the detailed information about the flotation of the companies should be made known <e> <s> i have a certain sympathy for saying that the full details should be presented in the prospectus <e> <s> nevertheless what worries me about what the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey pointed out is that there already appears to have been something of a leak to the financial press <e> <s> that happens all too often <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness indicate to what extent she considers economic considerations would be taken into account in any future planning inquiries for new nuclear stations <e> <s> does she not agree that whereas in

electricity there must be a limit where cost is concerned <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee for arriving late but i have come back from abroad at breakneck speed to be here <e> <s> as my name is attached to this amendment and i feel strongly on the subject i should like to say a few words at the risk of perhaps repeating what others have said <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what the noble lords lord stoddart and lord peyton have just said <e> <s> the director should have a responsibility for energy conservation because that strikes at the root of what we are talking about <e> <s> this should be stated somewhere unequivocally <e>", "<cs> i wish to suport what the noble lords lord williams and lord peyton have said <e> <s> i very much fear that the treasury whose main task is zealously to guard the public purse and to say no on every conceivable occasion may not be the right people to ensure that the person who is selected by the secretary of state for the job will receive the remuneration and conditions consistent with the responsibility and status involved <e> <s> while no doubt we shall be told that this has always been put into legislation we are after all approaching the st century <e> <s> it is about time that a few changes were made <e> <s> one of the changes that i believe we should make is to try to restrict the treasury to those things which are important for it to do and not to enable it to spread its tentacles into every other conceivable activity <e>", "<cs> to follow up that last point i do not see where the treasury comes into this <e>

be able to go to the secretary of state that relieves my mind <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add that there are two aspects of the wording which concern me <e> <s> the first was referred to earlier in connection with the amendment of the noble lord lord peyton and concerned why the secretary of state should suddenly be brought into the matter <e> <s> we have heard the government argue vigorously that the director should determine all these matters and now we have the secretary of state coming in <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has just referred to experience in consumer issues and that is <e> <s>

noble baroness quite rightly said in moving this amendment it flows naturally from the debate which we have had in this chamber during most of this afternoon and evening <e> <s> concern has been expressed all round about the adequacy of the consumer arrangements in particular as regards their independence <e>", "<cs> i should simply like to say that i believe that this modest amendment would reinforce the role of the consumer committees <e> <s> it would make them more visible to the public and the public would be able to be more conversant with what they do <e> <s> the matters discussed by the committees would be of direct interest to the public anyway <e> <s> therefore with other members of the committee who have spoken i very much hope that the government will accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords while the chief secretary to the treasury referred to the road programme in particular can we take it that this relaxation of the ryrie rules will also apply to other public sector projects for example those undertaken by local authorities hospitals and schools <e> <s> apart from transport would they cover heating projects concerned with energy efficiency and conservation <e> <s> this needs to be clearly stated and i wonder whether the government will so enlighten us <e>", "<cs> my lords in considering projects of this kind in the future will the treasury still be taking the line that the cheapest way to raise money is for it to do so in the public sector <e> <s> is this not regarded as the biggest inhibitor to private funds being put into public projects <e>", "<cs> my lords following on from the question of the noble lord lord cledwyn what is the governments attitude towards initiatives taken in the european community for improving the environment and dealing with the matters to which this question refers <e> <s> one hears that we have been reluctant to join in new initiatives which the ec has recently propounded <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord lord renton does not agree with the proposition because i believe that local authorities have an important role to play in this connection <e> <s> the local inhabitants are much concerned about the quality of water and its standard <e> <s> i myself happen to be involved in a trading standards organisation and i know what a great role such organisations play in ensuring that standards are maintained with the wishes of local people <e> <s> i do not see this as a duality so much as national authorities and local authorities working together to the same end <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that the amendment that is proposed would create confusion in ensuring that water supplies and quality of water were up to the right standards <e> <s> i draw the attention of the noble lord to subsection of the proposed amendment which states <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord mcintosh has said the statement made by the noble lord lord hesketh is of the utmost importance <e> <s> the gist is that the government have taken most seriously the standards laid down in the european community and will seek to do everything possible to carry them out <e> <s> that being so we on these benches fully support the amendments <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord lord mcintosh is right in seeking to have a definition of the word trivial because otherwise we might run the risk that the secretary of state or the director could give this a wider interpretation than we might give it <e> <s> i believe that the interpretation as proposed is reliable <e> <s> i hope that the government will accept that but if not perhaps they will give their own interpretation of the word <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord lord mcintosh made a perfectly reasonable request <e> <s> he did not demand anything but merely said that it would be helpful if he got the information <e> <s> i believe the government are to be commended for providing him with the information that he required and that our debates will gain as a result of that <e>", "<cs> i shall be much happier with what the noble lord has said if we can resolve this matter of shall and may that we have referred to many times <e> <s> the noble lord has referred to clause <e> <s> subsection states <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord for the detailed answer which he gave in response to my amendments <e> <s> it is very gratifying that the government both in response to this amendment and previous amendments have emphasised the importance which they attach to the whole question of disconnections <e> <s> they fully recognise the public concern on this matter <e> <s> i am delighted to learn also that as regards the customer service committees the government will now take this away and think about ways in which they can be kept regularly informed about disconnections occurring in each local authority area on grounds of non-payment <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> far be it from me to wish to engage in a scientific discussion with the noble lord but i should have thought that the words so far as reasonably practicable cover all the points he made <e> <s> however i do not wish to press the matter further <e> <s> we have been given an assurance that the maintenance of quality will be a prime consideration as it should be and that only matters effectively outside the control of the water companies will be excepted under the terms of this clause <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for the careful consideration that he gave to the amendment which once again emphasises the importance attached to the supply of wholesome water to penalties for the supply of unwholesome water and certainly to strong enforcement <e> <s> however in the light of the explanation which he has given i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> earlier this afternoon the noble lord set a very good standard of sympathy which he extended toward us in regard to a number of important amendments which had been moved <e> <s> unfortunately his ration of sympathy seems to have run out on this occasion <e> <s> i think that we must take the matter a little further <e> <s> i should have liked very much to have been able to withdraw this amendment but i do not think that i can do so <e>", "<cs> i quite agree and in the light of that explanation i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am indebted to the noble lord for the very full reply which we have received <e> <s> i am also very pleased that he expressed sympathy with the purpose of the amendment <e> <s> as i understand his explanation he said that the powers of the nra are sufficiently flexible to take account of what is proposed here and that individuals will be fully protected where questions of prosecution may arise <e>", "<cs> i must say that i feel some disquiet about that answer <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble <e>", "<cs> in spite of the late hour i very much regret that in the light of the discussions that we have had on these three amendments i cannot consider myself to be satisfied with the response of the government <e> <s> therefore i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i consider that the noble lord lord underhill is absolutely justified in introducing yet another debate on transport <e> <s> we have had many in recent weeks but as we face here one of the most serious economic and indeed social problems in the country today i believe that bringing the subject to the floor of the house at the present time particularly in the light of the two recent government publications is entirely appropriate <e>", "<cs> i was interested to hear the comments made on this proposed amendment <e> <s> the difficulty is that this appears to apply to all consumers whereas i believe there is a distinction to be made between domestic and other consumers <e> <s> in the case of domestic consumers i should have thought it reasonable as the noble baroness lady gardner pointed out to ask what sort of appliances they are likely to use <e> <s> if they have whole house electricity heating that will require one sort of supply but if they are to have a normal supply which excludes a basic heating requirement then another sort is required <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady hooper said that we must endeavour in legislation to make life as easy as possible for people and not more complicated <e> <s> we gathered from the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes who is familiar with these matters that when a new house has to be connected to electricity people are asked what appliances they use <e> <s> that information is converted by the skill of the electricty board into what they need to be supplied with <e> <s> it will know roughly what the figure is <e> <s> what worries me about the present wording of the bill is that a duty is put on all potential users to indicate precisely the maximum amount of electricity they are likely to require <e> <s> i do not believe that the ordinary domestic consumer should be put under that obligation <e> <s> he might feel that if he does not meet that commitment his supply will be cut off because he has failed to give the information required <e> <s> i would be happier if the noble baroness would take this away and think about it from the point of view of making life easier for the ordinary domestic consumer bearing in mind that what we have heard is done already <e> <s> why not mention it in the legislation <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to divide the committee on this issue <e> <s> however the point remains that it must be our aim and object to make life easy especially for the domestic consumer of electricity <e> <s> i reserve the right to come back to the matter at a later stage and think about the advice and assistance that should be given to the domestic consumer to comply with this requirement <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the position is that notwithstanding what is said in clause the licence terms will oblige the public electricity supplier to provide stand-by or back-up supplies in such circumstances <e> <s> that is what i understood the noble baroness to have said <e> <s> all i can say is that i am a little concerned that that should not be written on the face of the bill <e> <s> it seems to me to be quite an important issue <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord hanworth and i have tabled one of the amendments in the group <e> <s> i too should like to support the point of principle <e> <s> the legislation will suffer enormously if as has just been said it were shown immediately to react against those who live in rural communities <e> <s> if we were all starting from scratch and choosing where we lived according to what electricity water and so on were to cost that would be different <e> <s> we live in a situation in which those discriminations do not exist <e> <s> it is important that that situation be continued and that suitable safeguards are incorporated into the legislation <e>", "<cs> i wish to support what the noble lords lord peyton of yeovil and lord peston have just said about competition in rural areas <e> <s> that is surely an illusion <e> <s> if there is to be competition under this bill it will occur at the generating end to some degree and it could also occur in the supply to big industrial consumers <e> <s> however what we have been saying here in relation to domestic consumers is that there will be public supply companies which will have a private monopoly <e> <s> it is of vital importance that they be curbed in the use of that private monopoly <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that detailed explanation and also to the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes <e> <s> i should like to read <e>", "<cs> i listened with care to what the noble earl said and i should like to study it <e> <s> the object of my amendment was not to impede anything connected with safety <e> <s> that could have been stated as an exception because clearly one must move quickly in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that assurance <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as my name has been mentioned and as i moved a similar amendment at the previous stage i wish to say that this is a matter of some concern to many of us in this house <e> <s> we have welcomed the establishment of the nra and we believe that it is going to do a very useful job <e> <s> but as the noble lord lord crickhowell himself said there seems to be some doubt as to the freedom with which it can operate <e> <s> if such detailed matters as are indicated here are to be dealt with by the government department responsible and the treasury it is to be doubted that in more important matters it will not also be supervised <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as pay and rations are concerned there is no doubt that on a reading of this paragraph of the schedule the treasury will have the last word <e> <s> if the financial memorandum is to modify that all well and good <e> <s> however the schedule and after all this is what the government propose should be enacted says <e>", "<cs> my lords it was only on rd may that the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos introduced an important debate on the challenge of <e> <s> i think that in spite of the relatively short lapse in time the noble viscount lord chandos is absolutely right in introducing a similar subject for debate today <e> <s> after all as he has pointed out this is the week before the european elections <e> <s> it therefore gives noble lords the chance to survey the whole european scene <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords lords mcintosh and lord stanley have now touched on what i think is one of the most serious issues in this <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the important underlying feature of this amendment which enables local interest to be brought into the enforcement procedures <e> <s> water is a matter of local interest and it is organised on a local basis <e> <s> while it is quite clear in the regulatory system which has been created that the secretary of state and the director general must play the predominant role i think that we should always be searching for ways in which local interest can be introduced <e> <s> it is on this basis that i hope the government will give sympathetic consideration to the underlying objective of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that considered reply which i found most helpful <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment was to facilitate perusal by the public <e> <s> i hope that whatever system is finally devised it will have in mind that objective <e> <s> in the light of the ministers remarks i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his comments and for the assurances that he has given <e> <s> i am sorry that he was not prepared to accept the amendment where efforts were made to take account of what we thought to have been the governments objections to the previous proposal <e> <s> however i should like to study carefully what he has said and perhaps come back to it at the next stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for making it clear that the government do not at present propose to privatise the bank of england and that there are limits to their <e>", "<cs> in my contribution at second reading i expressed reservations about the way in which renewables did not appear to be entering into the picture <e> <s> the reference to non-fossil fuels did not appear to specify which were nuclear <e> <s> i was also concerned that there might be a cut-off point for renewables <e> <s> i am glad that the statement which the noble baroness has made has gone a long way towards allaying those fears <e> <s> we now have a definition of renewables that will be included within the non-fossil fuel element <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank all noble lords who have taken part in this debate because it has been very useful and a good preliminary to other important issues which will arise in a few moments <e> <s> perhaps i may deal briefly with the three amendments <e> <s> as regards amendment no <e> <s> i was very glad to note the views expressed by the noble baroness of the support which will be given whenever possible to ensure that there is a fair share for the smaller generators <e> <s> they feel that they are being launched on to an unknown sea and they are genuinely very worried about the new situation in which they may find themselves <e> <s> so it is important that the noble baroness made the remarks that she did and that they be in <e>", "<cs> having started as vigorously as i could to promote the amendment i end by feeling dejected <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lord hanworth that this would have been the opportunity to be imaginative <e> <s> we have at our disposal potentially a vast amount of energy which could be <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord for that detailed response <e> <s> i should like to study it and in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment which has been so ably spoken to by the noble earl lord halsbury <e> <s> i must say that i am among those who were extremely surprised when the governments proposals for the privatisation of the electricity industry emerged to note that they did not separate off nuclear power <e> <s> in fact as so often happens they do these things better in scotland <e> <s> there the nuclear stations have been separated off leaving aside the question of ownership to which i shall come in a moment <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord with his great knowledge of scottish affairs whether he supports the proposition in the bill that there should be a separate nuclear power company for scotland leaving aside the question of ownership <e> <s> if he agrees with that does he believe that a similar arrangement should be made in england and wales <e>", "<cs> i consider that the noble lord lord williams of elvel has raised a very important point here <e> <s> as a result of this bill we must not allow the rules appertaining to responsibility for prospectuses <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord williams has made an important point <e> <s> many people will be reading these prospectuses with a view to putting their savings into these companies <e> <s> at the very least they must know who is responsible for what they read and take on trust <e> <s> my understanding from the rather complex answer given by the noble baroness is that various people will be responsible for various parts of the prospectus <e> <s> i do not find that a very satisfactory situation <e> <s> i have always assumed that a prospectus is the responsiblity of the issuer and that it is the issuers job to make sure that everything in the prospectus is valid proper and could be defended in a court of law <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord peston has raised an important point at this stage <e> <s> for many years i was concerned with advertising in a publicly-owned enterprise <e> <s> i must say that we were always most cautious of spending a lot of money which ultimately belonged to the public in merely image building however highly we thought of our enterprise <e> <s> most of our advertising was directed specifically to selling <e> <s> however the kind of advertising which is going on now as regards the electricity and water industries is not selling indeed if the water industry was proposing to sell water now it would be doing something most peculiar as the authorities are in the process of stopping us from using it <e>", "<cs> i must tell the noble baroness that i fully agree with what she just said <e> <s> i said that i thought that if advertising took the form of information and explained to people what was in <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for that explanation and also for the assurance that she is looking at this whole question of undergrounding particularly in regard to areas of outstanding beauty <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords many of us wish to speak on this subject <e> <s> i shall not ask the question which i was going to ask and which i have tried to ask for the last half-hour <e> <s> however i ask the leader of the house whether we can have an early debate on this subject so that we can express our opinions on this important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords as president of the institute of trading standards administration i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that trading standards officers are seriously concerned about the limits of the law enabling them to follow up the clocking process <e> <s> recommendations have been made by all the motoring and consumer protection organisations <e> <s> can we not have stronger penalties and controls imposed on this most fraudulent practice as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord stanley of alderley on this issue despite what the noble lord lord trafford has just said <e> <s> your lordships will recall that when we debated the telecommunications bill and the gas bill we were all concerned about people in rural areas <e> <s> it is a fact that to supply them with basic services costs more but under public service arrangements they were not discriminated against <e> <s> there is concern that under privatised arrangements they could be <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may point out to the noble baroness that my understanding of the kind of competition that will arise as a result of this measure is not at all in line with her interpretation <e> <s> i believe that there will be a certain amount of competition at the generating end and a certain amount of competition in the supply to large industrial consumers <e> <s> i cannot see for many years competition in the supply to domestic consumers which is what the noble baroness has been discussing <e> <s> i do not believe that that is a feasible proposition under this legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the amendments proposed by the noble lord lord peyton <e> <s> an important principle is at stake here <e> <s> we are privatising a basic industry and it is vital that it should be shown that the consumers interests will be fully protected <e> <s> under this bill as drafted it is intended that there should be consumers committees but these committees will be the creatures of the director <e> <s> the directors task covers not only consumers interests but the interests of producers distributors and everyone else involved <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been over this ground before <e> <s> it is rather unfortunate that the government did not take note of noble lords concerns and introduce their own amendment to widen the membership of the committees <e> <s> i have had experience of consumer committees in the coal industry <e> <s> it was certainly not a condition that everyone on those committees should be a mining engineer <e> <s> there were no mining engineers on the <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the amendment because it accepts in broad terms what we were seeking to achieve but like other noble lords who have spoken i am a bit dismayed at the complicated procedure <e> <s> it is difficult to know at what stage the public will be allowed to stay and at what stage they will have to move out <e> <s> there could be a good deal of time wasted on this whole issue <e> <s> i wonder whether it is not asking too much if this could be simplified at a later stage so that people could know whether they were allowed in or not without having to work their way through the whole bill a course which i feel would be necessary under this proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my support to the amendment moved by the noble lord lord williams and on which the noble lord lord norrie has just spoken <e> <s> although when we come to schedule we shall be dealing in more detail with the impact on the environment of electricity generation transmission and supply this is now a matter of such overriding importance that it must surely be stated right at the beginning of the bill where the duties of the secretary of state and the director are specified <e> <s> if that is not done the bill will suffer from a fundamental weakness in not recognising our present position <e>", "<cs> i am glad that we can discuss it because if the noble lord were to move amendment no <e> <s> we would probably go over the same ground again <e> <s> i therefore speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and which is the new clause to which the minister referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot hide my disappointment at that response however kindly the words were uttered <e> <s> i am very sorry that the government are not giving chp a greater push and greater support <e> <s> the word promote means simply to stimulate and to encourage <e> <s> i find it very surprising that the government are not even prepared to say that they wish to stimulate and encourage a process which will almost double the effective efficiency of power stations where it can be appropriately introduced and which will enormously add to the environmental benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord peston is right to raise these issues because we form part of the european community <e> <s> we are moving into the single market and preparing for <e> <s> electricity is being traded internationally more and more <e>

considered that that could not be done taking account of the practicalities but that there are schemes in hand to bring it about at the earliest practical date <e> <s> that is the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for permitting me to speak at this stage <e> <s> i should merely like to say that that is certainly not what i was saying <e> <s> i was saying that if we as two houses of parliament agree that we shall attain the objectives of the directive set out in the ec regulations it is not unreasonable that when the companies are floated they should indicate how they are to achieve what parliament has decided that they should achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of sub-committee b and having had the honour to serve under the noble lord lord shepherd i support his amendments <e> <s> i do so because we spent a great deal of time on the whole question of renewable sources of energy <e> <s> it is quite clear that these sources of energy

down will she explain what would be the rateable situation of those generators which do not export electricity but which could be quite sizeable supplying the internal requirements of industrial activities <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for his statement which has finally clarified a question that has led to a great deal of speculation <e> <s> i much appreciate the first part of his statement in which he expressed the view that the whole purpose of such monopolies and mergers commission inquiries is to look into cases where competition might be in question and for the government to take stock of the position and take decisions <e> <s> however i should like to ask him one or two questions <e>", "<cs> my lords we have heard a most forceful logical and clear analysis of one of the major problems arising in the bill <e> <s> let us be quite clear and remind ourselves that essentially the electricity supply industry consists of three parts the generation the transmission and the distribution of electricity <e> <s> regarding england and wales under the existing arrangements the generation of electricity is a virtual monopoly and the generating company owns the grid <e> <s> that is a clear system which as the noble lord lord peyton has said has worked well over a number of years <e>", "<cs> my lord i realise that the noble baroness has been interrupted a number of times but i wish to ask a question because i am very puzzled <e> <s> if the government and the director between them are going to lay down exactly how the grid company is to operate it seems to me that the locus of the technical owners of the business is diminished enormously and that their existence as such seems to be very much in question <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord renton may well be right in that parts of what is intended in the amendment put forward by the noble lord lord williams might be covered elsewhere and in other legislation <e> <s> nonetheless the importance of the physical environment is such that i can see no harm in the restatement of such proposals at this stage of the bill where the functions of the successor companies are mentioned <e> <s> therefore i hope that even though there may be some risk of repetition the amendment should be considered seriously by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that when the government came to power they set great store by controlling the money supply as a means of regulating the economy but that progressively over the years they have discarded the use of the various money aggregates <e> <s> are we now to assume that the control of the money supply no longer plays a part in the governments policy towards the economy <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the substantial gap in our manufacturing balance of payments is the minister of the opinion that policies are being pursued now regarding the rebirth of manufacturing industry in this country which will eventually close that gap <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the statement given to us by the secretary of state <e> <s> i should like to raise three specific issues on the statement that he made and make a more general point <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give us his view of what he thinks the trend will be over the next years <e> <s> if in his opinion this unfortunate trend is likely to be reversed will he give us the reasons why he comes to that conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene and declare an interest <e> <s> i happen to be chairman of a company which is providing that heating now <e> <s> we were asked to do it simply because battersea power station closed down <e> <s> to my certain knowledge there was no intention to close down the scheme <e> <s> the power station itself was to close and some other way had to be found to provide the heat <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may mention to the noble baroness that the object <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much indebted to the noble baroness for the considered reply which she gave to the amendment <e> <s> however before i proceed i wish to ask about the procedures of the house during third reading <e> <s> i am clear that no noble lord apart from the one introducing an amendment can <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much indebted to the noble lord for that clarification <e> <s> he could not have known what i was going to do because he interrupted me as soon as i got on my feet <e> <s> however let that pass i shall deal with it in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble baroness and her colleagues for their courtesy and for the consideration which they gave to all the points made from these benches <e> <s> i should like to thank her specifically for her reference to my colleague the noble viscount lord hanworth and myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that statement <e> <s> i should like to carry on where the noble lord lord peston finished <e> <s> i have always believed that the nuclear aspect was the albatross hanging around the neck of the electricity privatisation bill and that it was the big problem which must be faced <e> <s> i am not particularly surprised that the government have now come forward with this statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord lord williams of elvel was quite right to raise the issue at this stage late though it be <e> <s> those of us who heard the statement yesterday on the magnox stations were amazed to say the least <e> <s> that this major change had been made at such a late stage passes beyond reasonable belief and understanding <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment passed by your lordships was one of the most important amendments carried during the long drawn-out debate on the electricity bill <e> <s> it was a measure of the importance we attached to it that we had support from all sides of the house <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment was not only to emphasise the importance of energy efficiency in the use of electricity but to introduce a degree of mandatory control and regulation which would ensure that energy efficiency was achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indebted to the noble lord lord sanderson for the detailed reply which he gave in respect of the amendment which i moved and also to those noble lords who have spoken in support of it <e> <s> i shall try to be as brief as possible <e> <s> two specific issues arise in connection with the amendment that has come to us from another place <e> <s> the first is that in spite of the wording can we be satisfied that the director will establish these standards of performance in relation to energy efficiency <e> <s> we have been assured by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords does that imply that if the licensee does not do so the director can apply the various sanctions allowed for in the licence <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that the government have come a considerable way to meeting our requirements <e> <s> i have elucidated the two points which seemed to me to be of prime importance in putting forward the amendments namely that the director will set those standards and that he will have powers of enforcement <e> <s> i should have preferred it all to have been stated clearly in the bill <e> <s> however if it is contained within the meaning of the clause supported by the appropriate condition of the licence i ask your lordships leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before i make my brief contribution to this important debate i should like to state that a long time ago i made a firm commitment for eight oclock tonight when i hope to receive some guests and so i shall absent myself for a few minutes if i may to receive them and then return with all speed to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble earl could not be a little more precise <e> <s> virtually everyone else in the country has worked out that unfortunately on present trends the figure is likely to be around billion for the year as a whole <e> <s> furthermore does the noble earl not agree that the recent increase in interest rates which may have been necessary for other reasons is likely to widen the gap further by making british goods less competitive as recent business surveys have stressed <e>", "<cs> this is clearly a highly complex and technical issue <e> <s> nonetheless i believe that the noble lord lord mcintosh put his finger on it <e> <s> what is involved is the state of repair the maintenance and the quality of the housing stock <e> <s> this is becoming more urgent as time goes on <e> <s> what i am unclear about is whether the outcome of these evidently very complicated negotiations will mean that there will be an increase in the effort put in to the repair of the housing stock a maintenance of the effort or a diminution of the effort <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to the minister but i believe there is a slight misunderstanding about the wording <e> <s> the word assistance is not intended to mean financial assistance <e> <s> it is the sort of assistance given to people who wish to improve their homes and receive the best advice they can get <e> <s> i therefore hope that on the basis of my explanation of what the word means when these further discussions take place they will do so on the correct understanding <e>", "<cs> my lords following on from the remark which the noble lord has just made about competition to what extent will there be effective competition in the electricity industry over the next four years in particular having regard to the arrangements which the secretary of state has apparently recently made with the generating and distribution companies <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may comment on those two remarks <e> <s> of course special situations can arise <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> it is to make sure that the work shall be done in accordance with estimates properly submitted <e> <s> otherwise it could be done by anybody in any circumstances <e>", "<cs> in those cases the local authority would no doubt agree <e>", "<cs> the purpose of this amendment as of the previous two is to provide safeguards <e> <s> in replying the noble earl stated that there are safeguards elsewhere in the bill <e> <s> it will be for the committee to decide whether in the totality of these provisions there are adequate safeguards to ensure from both the local authoritys point of view and the occupants point of view that the work carried out under this grant system is effectively carried out <e> <s> i should be quite satisfied if we came to that conclusion <e> <s> the point of my amendment was to raise that issue <e> <s> it has been well aired and in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that at some per cent <e> <s> of gdp personal savings are now at an abnormally low level and that they should be raised by every possible means to a higher level in order to correct the various imbalances in the economy <e> <s> does he not feel that it is therefore somewhat paradoxical that holders of national savings certificates should be discouraged from continuing to hold those certificates <e> <s> is there not a risk that when they cash in those certificates having held them for more than five years part of that cash finds its way into further consumption <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that noise can be as much of an environmental nuisance as litter and air pollution <e> <s> does he also agree that the code of practice to which he referred which was issued in is almost totally ignored <e> <s> i have made considerable inquiries in the city of westminster <e> <s> i am told that the local authority officials are quite incapable of taking action against those who misuse their burglar alarms <e> <s> therefore as a result of continued public complaint should not the code of practice be converted into a mandatory obligation to limit the intrusive effect of these alarms <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that during the past four years productivity in british mines has risen by more than per cent <e> <s> and that during the past two years imported coal prices have risen by more than per cent <e> <s> will the minister agree that on economic grounds and bearing in mind the long term prospects it would be highly imprudent for there to be further substantial substitution of indigenous coal by imports <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that in spite of what he has just said there is growing confusion in the public mind about the governments attitude towards the ems and the exchange rate <e> <s> on the one hand the chancellor of the exchequer seems to prefer to have the currency linked to those of the major european countries and to regard the ems and the exchange rate mechanism as desirable means of achieving that while on the other hand it is reported that the prime minister and her adviser sir alan walters take a different view <e> <s> they prefer a market approach to the currency and do not favour the erm <e> <s> does he not agree that this difference of opinion is causing a good deal of disquiet and is not adding to business confidence <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount prepared to give an indication to the house of what he considers to be the likely comparative trends of the costs of nuclear power taking all factors into account <e> <s> will he say the extent to which existing nuclear power stations in the united kingdom are competitive with other forms of electricity generation or to what extent that could become the case in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that answer <e> <s> does he agree that energy efficiency has now come to the centre of energy policy <e> <s> it has been a matter of grave concern that in recent years the government have reduced the contribution to the energy efficiency office <e> <s> can he give an assurance that in the forthcoming statement to which he referred that factor will be taken properly into account and that proper signals will be given to the country at large that energy efficiency is now crucial both from the point of view of savings and of the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the leader of the house has read to us a most important statement made in another place <e> <s> we spent many days debating the electricity bill in this place <e> <s> we are now confronted with the situation in which the whole nature of that bill has been fundamentally altered <e> <s> at the start i should like to ask the noble lord the leader of the house who in a sense is the guardian of the constitution so far as we are concerned whether or not he thinks that a constitutional issue arises <e> <s> we have after all spent a long time debating a bill on the basis of certain clearly defined principles <e> <s> the principle of the bill was that the whole electricity industry would be sold to the private sector <e> <s> we are now told that the government have reached a decision that we should have a combination of private and public ownership and that the whole of the nuclear side something for which we pressed at the time should now be taken away <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may put this point to him <e> <s> those of us who said that the exclusion of nuclear which we certainly pressed for and which we welcome raises a number of other issues had in mind the point that it could affect the remaining structure <e> <s> we raise that point because we believe that the proposed division of the cegb into two parts which was relevant when nuclear was included is now no longer relevant <e> <s> how will that issue be addressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for reading out the statement <e> <s> as someone who has been familiar with the scottish electricity industry over many years i should like to say that i fully concur with the tribute paid to that industry in the statement <e> <s> i was always under the impression that the agrs in scotland had been operating very successfully <e> <s> therefore while i was not surprised that the decision had been reached by the government to remove the nuclear stations from the english and welsh electricity industry i had not come to the same conclusion about scotland <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord can explain why that decision was reached <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that at their present level interest rates continue to cause great hardship to individuals particularly those with mortgages <e> <s> does he further agree that the problem is now spreading to industry and trade as demonstrated by the latest cbi returns issued yesterday <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that on st october in another place his right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer said that it was absolutely right that all practicable measures should be used to deal with inflation and that they included fiscal measures <e> <s> will the minister therefore indicate to the house whether those steps portend a change in policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased in this important debate on our economic affairs to be following the noble viscount lord caldecote <e> <s> he is a person of great eminence in the manufacturing sector his particular experience having been in engineering <e> <s> we should take serious note of his analysis of our situation <e> <s> i intend to follow in some of the directions to which he has pointed <e>", "<cs> my lords in preparing the new standards which we are all pleased to learn will lead to increased energy savings did the government carefully consider the practices pursued in continental countries where it is generally recognised that the insulation methods and energy savings on the construction of buildings are better than ours <e> <s> if that is the case did we learn any lessons from that study <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a well-informed and vigorous debate on an important issue <e> <s> i wish to thank those noble lords who have taken part and also the noble viscount for the detail in which he dealt with the questions raised <e> <s> however i wish simply to identify two issues which i believe have emerged from our lengthy discussion on this subject tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord gallacher i wish to welcome the bill <e> <s> it contains many positive features which are clearly stated <e> <s> however like the noble lord i should like to see some modifications which i shall discuss in a moment <e> <s> i wish to begin by declaring an interest as president of the institute of trading standards administration <e> <s> i am glad to say that in that capacity i had a helpful meeting with the noble baroness a few weeks ago which led to a clearer understanding of what was in the mind of the ministry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased to support the noble lord lord mason of barnsley in this second reading <e> <s> i had the pleasure of many dealings with him in the past when we were concerned with another important and indeed basic product coal <e> <s> on this occasion it is a more liquid product but one might say it is just as basic <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the fact that as we all know after four or five years the code of practice is not being observed is the noble viscount going against what his noble friend lord strathclyde said on th may namely that legislation always remains an option <e> <s> will the government continue to allow the code of practice not to be observed and do nothing <e> <s> is legislation not an option <e> <s> is that what the noble viscount is saying to us <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by expressing appreciation to the noble lord lord shepherd for the excellent and comprehensive way in which he introduced the important report on transport infrastructure which we are debating <e> <s> furthermore as a member of his committee i should like to pay tribute to the manner in which he conducted our affairs <e> <s> undoubtedly without his careful understanding but at the same time firm when necessary conduct of the business the report could not have been produced <e> <s> both he and the noble lord lord nugent made some important comments on the transport situation in the community and in the uk to which should like to return in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of emissions which is an important question it is categorically stated in the cbi report that the figure was per cent <e> <s> has the noble viscount taken this up or will his department take this up with the cbi so that we can have clarification <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a feeling that this question is not being treated with the gravity with which it should be treated <e> <s> i welcome the noble earls answer and i express the hope that one day we will not need passports to move around in the european community <e> <s> if one is waiting to obtain a new passport what can one do if one has to travel during that period <e>", "<cs> my lords to the extent that the statement which we have just heard and the supporting documents recognise that there is a serious traffic problem in london it is undoubtedly to be welcomed <e> <s> to the extent that it summarises proposals which have already been made and adds a number of new ones it gives us a good deal of food for thought <e> <s> however what perplexes me as has been mentioned by my noble friend lord tordoff and others who have spoken is the problem of how this will all be co-ordinated <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always an interesting experience both to listen to and in this case to follow the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls <e> <s> he made many trenchant and vigorous statements some of which i found rather surprising <e> <s> he was speaking about the undoubted contribution to our overseas balance of the financial services <e> <s> he said that they have always contributed to a positive balance whereas material substances i believe that was the phrase he used have always been traded at a loss <e> <s> that is totally untrue <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to restrict my observations to two matters <e> <s> the first relates to the question of compensation referred to in the statement and secondly the conduct of the department as the regulator <e> <s> on the question of compensation i wish to express satisfaction that a decision has been reached and that in very large measure those who have suffered from this series of occurrences will be promptly compensated and that they will also receive interest for the period during which they have suffered <e> <s> i think that is very fair and proper <e> <s> i am glad to note that this matter was agreed in the full report by the ombudsman <e>", "<cs> my lords while the news which the noble viscount has given us is very welcome in his opinion does he consider that this increased capital investment will meet the much increased needs for railway services in this country <e> <s> will we at the end of this period reach the much higher standards that exist on the continent <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree that improved energy efficiency can contribute most to improving the environment in future years <e> <s> is any of the additional funding likely to be allocated to basic research on energy efficiency <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that there is a trend particularly within the european community for central banks to achieve greater independence <e> <s> in the light of that trend would it not be desirable that we in the uk responded to it and made our central bank less an arm of the treasury and more an independent body directly answerable to parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords in the unfortunate absence due to illness of my noble friend lord banks i beg leave to ask the question standing in his name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that positive response <e> <s> however is he aware of the eagerness with which the friendly societies await a positive response from the government in this matter which has now been subject to discussion for several months <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for her comments on my amendment <e> <s> i am still a little surprised that the government are so reluctant to include in the bill a general definition of food <e> <s> i have read carefully the notes on clauses <e> <s> as background there is reference to the food and drugs act <e> <s> that act defines foods comprehensively as being any article used as food or drink for human consumption <e> <s> i should be happy with a similar definition <e>", "<cs> in the light of the comments which have been made and in the hope that we can return to the matter at a later stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> does the noble baroness accept that there is a good deal of concern expressed on all sides of the committee by the wide manner in which clause b has been drawn <e> <s> it appears to give the minister virtually unlimited powers though the noble baroness has said that in some ways he would not exercise those for example in connection with what goes on in the home <e> <s> nevertheleless would she be prepared to take the matter away and to consider it again as to how the problem might be represented in ways such as to allay some of the fears which have been expressed <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment to which my name is attached <e> <s> the government must surely agree that it is right that arrangements in scotland should be on all fours with those proposed for england and wales and that therefore the reference to regional bodies should be introduced <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may probe a little further <e> <s> as i understood it from what the minister told us when rejecting the amendment the governments opinion is that the wording properly mirrors the situation in scotland <e> <s> as i recall she then went on to say that some of the monitoring staff are employed at district level and some at regional level <e> <s> the whole purpose of the amendment is to include regions <e> <s> if some of the staff are employed at that level what can be the objection to including the word region <e> <s> i fail to see where any constitutional issue arises it is a matter of fact <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will be able to accept the amendment <e> <s> it seems to me to be very much in line with what she has said repeatedly during our deliberations so far <e> <s> there are a number of <e>", "<cs> we too should like to support the amendment from these benches <e> <s> it is important that in the bill we seek to have an even-handed approach to the various problems <e> <s> those who are shown not to have been guilty of the fault indicated and who can get a magistrate so to agree should be dealt with in the way proposed <e> <s> we therefore support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment in view of a similar amendment which i shall move later <e> <s> the bill causes confusion in the mind <e> <s> there has been a case of a can of peas containing a caterpillar <e> <s> if that were purchased by ones wife and served to the rest of the family it is not clear whether there would be any recourse by those who ate the intruder in the can of peas by failing to observe it soon enough <e>", "<cs> in the light of what the noble baroness has said i shall remind myself as to the other piece of legislation i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as my amendment is one of those contained in the group i should like to support what the noble earl lord baldwin said in proposing his amendment <e> <s> he was right to draw attention to the fact that there is growing public concern about the extensive and widening use of food additives <e> <s> he was also right to draw attention to the fact that the use of this kind of wording in previous legislation did not seem to have much effect <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount indicate whether it is a rule that a member of the staff of london transport should be present wherever those barriers are installed in case anything goes wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords the stage has been reached in this important debate so effectively introduced by my noble friend lord tordoff to begin the winding-up process <e> <s> i propose to do so under four heads <e> <s> the first is the problem <e> <s> it is very clear from every noble lord who has spoken in this debate that they all feel that not only at present is there a very serious transport problem in greater london but that in all likelihood it is going to get worse <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to make provision for effective enforcement of the law relating to the supply of unroadworthy motor vehicles and trailers and the alteration of vehicles so as to be unroadworthy and to provide powers for regulating the manner and cicumstances in which vehicles are supplied repaired and serviced including powers to make provision for the recording of mileage information <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords the report on the greenhouse effect so ably introduced by the noble and gallant lord lord carver is one of the most balanced that has appeared in recent times amid a welter of documentation on this subject <e> <s> it enables us to form a clear view of the state of knowledge on the subject the gaps that need to be filled and action that should be taken pending the achievement of certainty in this somewhat uncertain science <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl indicate whether the government attach any importance these days to the related indicator of broad money <e> <s> they paid attention to it up to but have since lost interest in it <e> <s> is the minister aware that the broad money indicator for the uk is substantially in excess of that for any other oecd country with the possible exception of australia and that that is an indication of an excess amount of credit in the economy <e>", "<cs> my lords as we are on the subject of medium term strategies are the government contemplating the introducton of a medium term <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say how much is expected to be saved as a result of the re-lamping programme once it is completed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to associate myself with the opening remarks of the noble lord lord graham of edmonton by expressing appreciation of the very clear way in which the noble viscount introduced the second reading of this bill <e> <s> it is a most important bill and for anyone connected with the coal industry it ranks among some of the most important developments in the industrys history since the last war <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham also made some moving comments about the human aspects of mining <e> <s> i hope that i shall be forgiven due to my long past association with the industry if i also talk a little about the past before talking about the present and the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords who have participated in the debate <e> <s> i believe that i can conclude that although not necessarily in support of the bill or of particular clauses in it all nonetheless accept that there are problems and that we should do something about them <e> <s> to that extent we have had a useful debate <e> <s> i should like to consider briefly some of the points raised by noble lords comment on them and then conclude <e>", "<cs> my lordsis the noble lord aware that in july the average return on premium bonds was reduced from per cent <e> <s> to the present level of per cent <e> <s> the reason for that was the reduction in interest rates <e> <s> since then interest rates have very substantially increased <e> <s> can the minister say whether the government are considering reviewing the position <e> <s> is the minister also aware that people can invest in any building society and receive something like per cent <e> <s> interest tax paid for their money <e> <s> if the government are really serious about persuading people to hold their money in the long term does not the minister agree that the government should move somewhat nearer to the market rate <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for the full comment in the amendment that i have moved supported by the noble lord lord gallacher <e> <s> as she expected i was sorry to hear her remarks <e> <s> at first i was disturbed by her suggestion that the object of the amendment was to put the clock back <e> <s> there is no question of doing so <e> <s> as she later mentioned it is a proposal for a permissive amendment to put scotland on all fours with england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that our important debate today has got off to a very good start with the speech made by the noble lord lord williams in introducing the debate and the speech which we have just heard by the noble lord lord joseph <e> <s> although they approached these problems from different points of view i believe that there is common ground on two aspects of the matter which we are discussing <e> <s> first both noble lords agree that there is a serious problem in regard to manufacturing industry secondly they both agree that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree <e> <s> many excellent things have been done in the past decade but we are concerned with the springboard for the next decade <e> <s> i am merely suggesting that our level of investment has been too low so far <e> <s> what is worse is that if we depend on that level of investment in order to maintain and sustain productivity we will be woefully behind <e> <s> that is a conclusion one inevitably comes to <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say what effect if any the separation of nuclear power from the scottish electricity boards has had on the privatisation programme and indeed on their prospectuses <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree that the time would now be opportune to put more emphasis on forms of energy which are environmentally satisfactory for example combined heat and power a barrage scheme and other possible projects <e> <s> it seems that these are still moving forward fairly slowly <e> <s> in the circumstances does he agree that they should be stimulated <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house how well the rover group has done under the new ownership <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord lucas was absolutely right to emphasise that the citizens advice bureaux have now existed for just over years having been set up in at the onset of war to advise citizens of this country of the problems that were likely to occur during that difficult wartime period <e> <s> however the need for the bureaux continued after the war right up to the present <e> <s> we are therefore particularly indebted to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for enabling us to look at the work of these bureaux and to identify some of the problems associated with them <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to say that i was extremely surprised at the brevity of the statement <e> <s> we have now received this report which was put in train on th april <e> <s> it has been with the government since it has pages and we are told practically nothing about what the government wish to do about it <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to his noble friend the minister said that the department was keeping in close touch with developments abroad <e> <s> can he say whether statistically what has happened here is mirrored by what is happening in other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that there is something of a paradox in the government saying that they wish to stimulate personal savings while on the other hand in very large parts of the national savings campaign interest rates are paid which are no stimulus whatever <e> <s> does that not call for some revision of government policy perhaps in the forthcoming budget to encourage people to save rather than spend on consumer goods which unfortunately due to the reduced capacity of manufacturing industry we cannot produce in this country and which have to be imported from abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make three comments on this short but important bill <e> <s> first i am wholly in favour of the capital reconstruction of the coal industry <e> <s> that is something which i should have liked to see in my time in the industry <e> <s> the remarkable productivity performance of british coal in recent times has fully justified that long-awaited reconstruction and i wish it well under the new arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill the second reading of which has been so ably introduced by the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes contains an interesting miscellany of provisions <e> <s> i do not imagine that we shall wish to speak on all of them <e> <s> my noble friend lord tordoff will be concentrating on part ii on the parking provisions <e> <s> i should like to concentrate on three clauses audible intruder alarms clause scaffolding licences and class of use <e> <s> i was struck with the importance of all three <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite understand that these departments could have reservations <e> <s> but i hope that at the committee stage if they express those reservations they will put forward alternative proposals to safeguard people who want to preserve their sleep <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount kindly elucidate what he said about the installation of combined cycle gas stations <e> <s> that is obviously for the future <e> <s> there are no such stations in operation at the moment <e> <s> does he agree that what is at issue is the existing stations which will continue to operate for many years <e> <s> will he therefore confirm that the new owners of the industry will go ahead with the originally proposed plan for getting rid of acid rain emissions <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the deficiency shown for the first time in the invisible account in the fourth quarter of last year which amounted to over million and in view of the forecasts of a nil balance in the first two months of this year <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be best for the post office not to issue that type of stamp again in the future <e> <s> it will only lead to confusion <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the brief statement that was made about the voluminous detail of the report of the inspectors i believe that my noble friend lord jenkins of hillhead was totally justified in tabling this motion for debate <e> <s> i am convinced that had the statement been more detailed the <e>", "<cs> my lords given the experience accumulated by older workers of which this house in many ways is an example would it not be desirable to launch a special campaign to retain older workers in a specific and constructive way without diminishing the promotional prospects of younger workers <e>", "<cs> my lords as the government are committed to joining the exchange rate mechanism in due course can the noble earl indicate whether they have formed a view about joining this year next year or at some later date <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that when the layfield report was debated in this house on nd march there was already evidence in the light of the substantial fall in fossil fuel prices that even the estimates contained in the report were likely to be optimistic <e> <s> is it not correct that the costs of nuclear generation based on those figures were already likely to be higher than those for fossil fuel generation <e> <s> as the noble viscount has already said the gap has widened since then <e> <s> can he give us an indication of when the government feel the gap will start to narrow <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl comment on the widespread press reporting after the recent meeting of european community finance ministers at ashford castle in ireland to the effect that there was a noticeable softening of the british attitude towards the possibility of moving ahead with monetary union and particularly with the creation of a european central bank <e> <s> will he furthermore reassure the house that in any discussions on a european level of these matters affecting future monetary and financial arrangements the government will bear carefully in mind the need to safeguard the position of the city of london as the financial centre of western europe and will not jeopardise that by appearing to be standing aside from the mainstream of development <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree that there is increasing concern by the <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord seems to have so many statistics on emissions at his disposal can he advise the house what were the emissions of sulphur dioxide for the two years in question <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl prepared to chance his arm on a hypothetical question <e> <s> if we had been members of the exchange rate mechanism would not sterling have been under less pressure <e> <s> would it not then have been possible to have lower interest rates and in turn would that not have reduced the rate of inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been involved in the community for many years mainly at the industrial and commercial level <e> <s> undoubtedly a very strong momentum has developed over the years toward firms with mixed ownerships getting together on a consortium basis and working more closely together <e> <s> the fear of those who do that work at the commercial and industrial level is that their momentum may not be matched by the momentum at the political level <e> <s> they fear that they may find obstacles at the political level for example in the exchange rates or other arrangements which could stultify that highly desirable growth <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the amendment moved by the noble lord lord lucas seeks to delete the requirement that a car dealer charged with selling or exposing for sale an unroadworthy car could use the statutory defence only if he had also displayed a prominent <e>", "<cs> i cannot refrain from intervening again in the light of those critical comments from the noble lord on what i thought was a quite limited and on the whole helpful amendment <e> <s> he says that he does not believe that any of the variants that i indicated could work that he does not understand what is meant by fleet car owners and that the only measure that could possibly work would be some form of tamper-proof odometer which has still to be devised marketed and introduced into cars as yet unborn and unmade <e> <s> obviously that will take a very long time <e>", "<cs> i am pleased to note what the noble viscount had to say <e> <s> i believe that this is an important issue <e> <s> the amendment does not deliberately lay down precisely how the matter should be dealt with but discussions are taking place <e> <s> i believe that the amendment will help to focus attention on this issue <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his remarks and for the fact that the government take note of the amendment <e> <s> i listened with care to the comments of the noble lord lord lucas particularly about the insurance companies <e> <s> i am sure that they would wish to co-operate in any scheme which at the end of the day would be as much in their interest as anybody elses <e> <s> it would keep cars on the road in a safer condition than would otherwise be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords we are particularly indebted to the noble earl lord shannon for enabling us to have what could be described as a curtain raiser debate to the debate which we shall have in a few days time on the environmental protection bill <e> <s> our attention has already been drawn to the unfortunate choice of a friday for such an important debate but quite apart from that the bill deals with so many wide-ranging matters and waste is one of the more important of them that to have a preliminary discussion at this stage seems to me entirely appropriate <e> <s> this is all the more the case as noble lords who have spoken so far have personal experience of the subject and i believe that they have made a very positive contribution to the developing debate <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl indicate whether he is aware that under section of the new zealand act to which i have referred and a copy of which i have with me the primary function of the reserve bank is laid down as being to determine monetary policy which will lead to the stability of prices in line with government policies <e> <s> is he further aware that the policy agreed between the government of new zealand and the reserve bank is that by the end of inflation should be running at a rate of per cent <e> <s> does he not agree that those procedures and that objective might be highly desirable in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that in many countries now central banks are beginning to play a more independent role to buttress the efforts of their governments <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that in a recent ballot among such bodies as the association of corporate treasurers there was an per cent <e> <s> response in favour of a more independent central bank <e> <s> should not such opinion be taken more account of in the formulation of government policy <e>", "<cs> my lords although there are benefits of a short term nature from inward investment in scotland will the noble lord say to what extent he believes that the large amount of money which has been invested in scotland from outside will have long-term advantages <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to redress somewhat the balance of the debate so far i do not propose to refer to part vii <e> <s> i should like to concentrate instead on part ii dealing with the important subject of waste and part iv dealing with the important subject of litter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that during the second and third weeks of may speeches made by the prime minister at the scottish conservative party conference and subsequently by the chancellor of the exchequer were reported by newspapers such as the <e>", "<cs> my lords with very great pleasure it falls to me speaking after the noble lord lord richard to congratulate him on his maiden speech all the more so because i fully support the thrust of his remarks <e> <s> as the noble lord lord cledwyn reminded us he had a remarkable career at the united nations when he led our delegation there <e> <s> subsequently he was a commissioner in brussels <e> <s> as he has told us in that capacity he was concerned with the formulation of social policy <e> <s> there is not the slightest doubt that when we come to that subject and later phases of considering our relationship with the european community he will be able to play a major role in advising us <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say whether his reference to prospective changes in savings certificates means that those people who are long-time savers in savings certificates may cease to see the value of their investment eroded <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to the noble viscount and the noble lord <e> <s> they both feel that while this is a desirable route to take at the present state of technological development it is not possible in practice to ensure that tamper-proof odometers can be installed <e> <s> in the knowledge that this has the full support of the government as a longer-term objective and that they will give encouragement to manufacturers and at the right time will be ready to take this up within the european community i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my colleagues and i have had informal discussions with the insurance industry <e> <s> it accepts the principle of what is being attempted and has done so for a long time <e> <s> i must accept however that it would prefer this not to be done through legislation <e> <s> nonetheless i feel that as this is such an important issue and as it has been carefully considered by the police and others it would be desirable to bring this further definition into the wording of clause <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles could be minimised by diverting more passengers to public transport with its larger carrying capacity <e> <s> does he further agree that that should be part of government policy <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebed to the noble lord lord williams of elvel for introducing this debate at the present time <e> <s> noble lords opposite seem to be somewhat disturbed but i was advised by the whips office that i should speak next <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted to the noble lord lord williams of elvel for introducing this <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that positive reply <e> <s> i wonder whether he has seen the moving declaration by maurice druon the permanent secretary of the french academy to mark the occasion of years ago as reproduced in todays <e>", "<cs> my lords while i welcome those developments does the noble viscount not agree in the light of the increasing importance of environmental issues and of the major impact which energy efficiency can bring to bear on those issues that a major reappraisal of the role of energy efficiency should now be undertaken <e> <s> in particular will he indicate the extent to which the government are specifically promoting combined heat and power schemes which virtually double the efficiency of power stations and substantially reduce co <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment moved by my noble friend <e> <s> it would add substantially to the clause that we are debating <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for his response <e> <s> in view of his remarks i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish to consider carefully what the noble lord has just said <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in the light of that categoric statement that the provisions of the present bill when passed will apply to any modifications of plans prepared under the previous control of pollution legislation i am glad to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his consideration of the proposal and for his emphasis on two points which i think are most important <e> <s> the first is that the way in which waste management licences are intended to be applied will be flexible and will take full account of the activities of the licensee <e> <s> it follows that if the licensee is largely recycling valuable materials to make them even more valuable the conditions of the licence will reflect that activity <e> <s> i take it that that is what he meant <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e> <s> i should like to remind your lordships that the bill attempts to draw together and deal with certain of the difficulties suffered over many years by the car buying public in particular with clocking of odometers and the sale of unroadworthy cars including the faulty rebuild of insurance write-offs <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the amendment which was so vigorously moved by the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment <e> <s> starting from exactly the same position as the noble lord lord mcintosh namely the need to apply the code of practice i agree with him that it is another matter that needs attention <e> <s> a number of the contracts for litter or waste collection have already been negotiated <e> <s> quite clearly the standards have now been increased as a result of the code of practice <e> <s> we should like to see these standards applied <e> <s> therefore those contracts will need to be renegotiated <e> <s> if more onerous tasks are put upon the contractors that will cost more <e> <s> that has to be provided for <e> <s> it seems to me that it is a thoroughly logical and desirable amendment which flows from our common interest in seeing that the code of practice on litter is effectively applied <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment <e> <s> this problem is taken seriously on the continent where they have gone a step further <e> <s> instead of people using pooper-scoopers there are people who go around on motorbikes known as pooper-scooters who are trained using an instrument and a flick of the wrist to collect the droppings <e> <s> that would add further to the expenditure which members of the committee opposite are not prepared to allow for this purpose <e> <s> there is growing concern particularly in urban areas for this form of pollution to be dealt with <e> <s> the noble lords amendments are well worthy of the support of the committee <e>", "<cs> in supporting the amendment proposed by my noble friend i should like to remind members of the committee that the tidy britain group has achieved a great deal in this area <e> <s> i hope that if this amendment or something similar is adopted this group will be closely associated with any such campaign <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the concept of promoting the use of an anti-litter warning of some kind on as much packaging as practicable <e> <s> it clearly helps to get the message across <e> <s> as has been pointed out a number of manufacturers already do this <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to thank the minister for repeating the statement on an issue which raises major problems of industrial policy and ethics <e> <s> however desirable the objective may have been to transfer the rover group into a wider industrial group and give it greater opportunities for growth nonetheless it is very clear that the methods adopted for that purpose were to say the least questionable <e>", "<cs> my lords on the basis of getting a bit of information in view of the recent speech of the chancellor of the exchequer to financial institutions is it now the intention to use some form of credit limitation to try to reduce inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount reminded us that in there will be a review of the future of the nuclear industry in this country <e> <s> will he indicate whether at the same time there will be a review of the privatised organisation in view of the fact that there are many people who feel that it should have been done differently and that after three or four years of experience it might well need to be reviewed <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome the initiative taken by the chancellor of the exchequer in contributing a further dimension to the interesting debate on the future of monetary policy in the european community <e> <s> but does the noble earl agree that there is uncertainty about the long-term objective of this proposition <e> <s> does he accept that the chancellor and the governor of the bank of england have given the impression that ultimately this could lead to the creation of a single currency whereas the prime minister in answer to questions in another place gave the impression that in her view the ecu would remain a parallel currency <e> <s> if it were to remain a parallel currency would it not simply be a thirteenth currency within the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to understand from earlier answers given by the noble viscount on this question that the government could be considering designating routes for heavy vehicles coaches and other large vehicles in congested areas <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall that in recent years there has been more than one occasion on which relations between the european community on the one hand and the united states on the other on matters of trade policy have been somewhat strained <e> <s> would he say that as a result of the recent summit relations are now improved <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has referred to the underground system but will the noble lord also comment on the obstructive nature of unregulated coach travel <e> <s> i am finding it extremely difficult to approach your lordships house from the south because of all the coaches collected there <e> <s> in areas like victoria they are an even worse obstruction <e>", "<cs> my lords while it is important that we maintain an expertise in nuclear power does the noble viscount agree that there should be a proper balance in our research into all forms of energy in particular into the more efficient use of energy <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble earl has reiterated the governments policy with regard to the erm namely that the madrid conditions must be met does he agree that the question of inflation in this country is probably one of the most important <e> <s> in that connection is he satisfied that the way in which we calculate inflation in this country and the way in which it is calculated in the other countries of the community are sufficiently comparable to enable a valid conclusion to be reached <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord indicate the extent to which the industry is itself trying to remedy the defects identified in the report by the director general of fair trading and the extent to which he feels that this might go some way to solving the problems <e>", "<cs> my lords we are coming to the close of this wide-ranging debate <e> <s> many noble lords have talked about broad issues of policy <e> <s> a number have talked on specific clauses in the bill <e> <s> the noble earl did so when he introduced the debate as did the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter my noble friend lady seear and the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> others dealt with broader matters in particular the two noble lords who made their most impressive maiden speeches today <e> <s> i was pleased to be present when they did so because i have known them for many years in the period when i was in the energy industry <e>", "<cs> that is right <e> <s> i never thought it would receive this amount of praise <e>", "<cs> my lords as he intimated in his answer that the coal industry has achieved a remarkable amount in improving its productivity in recent years does the noble viscount agree that it is to be commended on the efforts that it is now making to develop clean burning processes for coal which are of great importance in view of environmental considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords in the course of this important debate noble lords have dealt with the political military economic and social issues connected with the crisis in the gulf <e> <s> closely intertwined with all those issues is the question of oil supplies and energy policy <e> <s> as the noble lord lord hatch indicated that is the aspect on which i should like briefly to concentrate <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for notifying us of the action being taken by the government to put this matter right <e> <s> is he not especially concerned at the weakness of some of our basic statistics which has lasted for some time <e> <s> for example we know that massive changes are introduced to the balance of payments from time to time on the invisibles side <e> <s> the statistics relating to the retail prices index have also been criticised recently <e> <s> gdp figures are known to be false <e> <s> in all these circumstances is it not a fact that the wrong policy decisions over a number of years must have been taken and are likely to be taken in the future <e> <s> should this matter not be considered by the government with a good deal more urgency than at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief <e> <s> i should like to start by saying that we from these benches whole-heartedly welcome the step which the government have taken to join the exchange rate mechanism <e> <s> it is probably a subject about which we in this chamber have asked more questions than any other <e> <s> i may say that i had a few more in reserve which i am happy now to set on one side <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to what has been said and i am anxious about the way in which the many admirable objectives of the legislation will be carried out <e> <s> the noble lord lord jenkin of roding has enormous experience in government <e> <s> he conjured up in my mind the picture of virtually every issue having to go before an inter-departmental committee for endless debate before any action was taken <e>", "<cs> my lords as someone who from time to time has been into hospital for surgical purposes and invariably has had blood samples taken in order to carry out certain tests i cannot understand why the minister did not accept the reasonable proposition put forward by my noble friend who said that among those tests there should now be an automatic test for hiv <e> <s> that is now so important that i believe any normal patient would automatically agree <e> <s> why should a patient be asked specifically about this aspect of the test but not about all the others <e>", "<cs> my lords i have never been asked about the blood tests <e> <s> they just take the blood and test it <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a more fundamental issue involved here <e> <s> we are now living through the third oil shock in years and we are suffering as much this time as we did from the first such shock <e> <s> would it not be desirable for ourselves and other developed countries through the iea or in other ways to work out measures which would modify the impact of those disturbances <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the obvious need to continue to expand our exports would the noble lord indicate whether the government have in mind to review the services to exporters rendered by the british overseas trade board with a view to expanding and strengthening them <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can now respond having listened very carefully to what noble lords have said in this short debate and in particular to what the minister said <e> <s> i too am extremely disappointed <e> <s> the minister couched his remarks as he always does in a conciliatory tone but the fact remains that many very desirable initiatives for which the bill exists have already been taken <e> <s> those who have taken them are now very discouraged and they do not face with equanimity the thought that they have to bring their initiatives to a stop and go through the lengthy process of finding others to carry out what they themselves have done with signal success <e>", "<cs> my lords even though the government decided in principle against the creation of a new single authority for london is there not a case for creating a single authority to deal with major specific issues <e> <s> for example it could deal with the subject of transport which has been so often debated in your lordships house <e> <s> does not such an issue call for greater co-ordination <e> <s> waste disposal is another matter which was frequently discussed during the debates on the future of the glc <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that investment in manufacturing industry has shown a worrying turndown and that investment intentions suggest that the situation may be even worse in the future <e> <s> are the government concerned about this and in particular are they looking at measures which could be taken to counteract this trend <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to press the noble lord further <e> <s> can he say whose responsibility it is to ensure security of supply <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware under the previous regime it was the cegb <e> <s> no doubt he will recall that under present arrangements it was originally proposed when we discussed the electricity bill that this should be transferred to the distribution companies <e> <s> therefore can he advise us precisely who has the responsibility at present <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord barnett i welcome this desirable result for the recent quarter <e> <s> however in order that we may understand the longer-term trends will the noble lord indicate the extent to which he believes that the import figures have been affected by the reduction in consumer demand in this country and by the higher level of sterling <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for the very full answer he has just given <e> <s> i am to some degree reassured by the fact that as the government see it there is greater flexibility in these provisions than might have appeared to be the case from a simple reading of the bill <e> <s> in addition it is in the power of the government to apply those provisions flexibly <e> <s> i hope that they will do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow the example of the noble lord in declaring an interest <e> <s> i am concerned with certain as i consider them wholly desirable renewable schemes <e> <s> does the noble lord agree that government policy is strongly to support the renewable generation of electricity particularly in view of what is written in the white paper on the environment <e> <s> if so does he further agree that a period of eight years for which there is levy support is too short a time in which to raise project finance for some of the larger schemes and to prepare a viable plan <e> <s> while a number of smaller schemes could get by on that basis is he aware that great difficulty could arise for larger schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred to the number of renewable schemes that have recently been agreed <e> <s> they amount to <e> <s> however the total amount of megawatts installed will be only <e> <s> perhaps i may remind the noble lord that a small sized power station would amount to more than that <e> <s> is that not evidence that only the smaller schemes are getting by and that many desirable larger schemes are finding difficulty in getting moving <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that as a country we are committed by treaty to the eventual achievement of economic and monetary union and that the real debate is about how we get there <e> <s> does he agree that there are two ways of getting there by the route which of the members of the community wish to take or by the evolutionary route <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord for reading us the statement <e> <s> like the noble lord lord peston i am fully conscious of the fact that next week we shall have an opportunity to dwell in much greater depth on these economic matters <e> <s> therefore i shall limit myself to asking four questions relating to the economic forecasts because it is on the basis of the economic forecasts that other policy decisions particularly in relation to expenditure have to be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had many important speeches in the debate so far not least from the noble lord lord callaghan <e> <s> i was especially pleased like the rest of your lordships to hear the maiden speech of the noble baroness lady castle <e> <s> i had the pleasure of sharing a platform with her in the late s when together but on different subjects we addressed the national union of mineworkers in lancashire <e> <s> i was impressed then with the vigour of her presentation as we all have been today <e> <s> i should like to come back to the substance of her remarkable speech in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the increasing amount of coach traffic in residential areas particularly in central london quite <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin my contribution to this important debate by stating that my noble friend lord bonham-carter should have been speaking at this stage <e> <s> he was a member of the committee chaired by the noble lord lord aldington but unfortunately he is indisposed <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble baroness agree that another reason for the uk to take an initiative is that such an initiative could give rise to useful technical developments which in view of the worldwide interest in this matter could have export prospects <e>"]
