["<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> in my <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the government will not accept this amendment <e> <s> we must remember that it is dealing with the employees of a public authority who know their duty to people <e> <s> they have a good record for their safety <e> <s> if this extra burden is put on it is another expense for local authorities <e> <s> there is the cost of special training and possibly putting employees jobs in jeopardy <e> <s> i would ask your lordships not to support this amendment where we have a good record of safety on school buses <e>", "<cs> it might be for the convenience of the committee if i spoke to amendment no <e> <s> as that cannot be called should a certain result attend this amendment <e> <s> i ought to explain to the committee that in the first marshalled list an and was added to the end of my amendment which completely altered the whole meaning of it <e> <s> therefore i hope that your lordships will bear with me if i read out the paragraph as it would be if my amendment were carried <e> <s> it reads <e>", "<cs> on this idea that people are making a lot of tax-free gains they are also paying <e> <s> the whole basis of this bill is that instead of paying small rents they will be paying very sizeable extra amounts and i do not accept that we should think it absolutely wrong that someone should make a gain <e> <s> that person is putting an investment into his <e>", "<cs> surely one of the results of this measure will be that landlords will no longer have to look for such loopholes because there will be shorthold tenancies <e> <s> i believe that putting the onus on the landlord to ensure that what the tenant says is correct is adding to the complications <e> <s> we know how difficult holiday lettings are anyway and i should have thought that what the noble baroness proposes is unnecessary at this stage so far as holiday lettings are concerned <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble kinsman in this amendment <e> <s> as vice-chairman of an english county council i am horrified to learn that my equivalents north of the border apparently are illegitimate <e> <s> i believe that they exist even though they do not seem to be allowed <e> <s> vice-chairman is an important office from the point of view of the working of the council and in regard to other aspects of succession <e> <s> i should like to ask whether this allowance is of the type that we have just discussed in relation to clause or whether it is the equivalent of what we call the chairmans fund which is an allowance to enable official hospitality expenses to be incurred <e> <s> in other words is it for the actual expenses of the individual or is it for expenses of his office when entertaining other people <e>", "<cs> i have some experience of this problem being a ratepayer in the republic of ireland where a revaluation has not been done since the th century and i am paying something like in the pound <e> <s> luckily my ancestors were clever but some inflated their rateable values at that time because that enabled them to get bigger mortgages and they have been paying ever since <e> <s> however having seen all those and realising the disadvantages i must support this clause because i am a supporter of the rating system <e> <s> but i believe that it needs to be reformed and this gives the govern <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend the minister can tell us whether this adjustment is likely to be significant because he will well remember the frustration at budget time of not knowing what the final grant will be <e> <s> one of the reasons for the block grant being put forward is that it will be more open and more certain <e> <s> anything that puts off the day when one knows the final amount is bad and it encourages treasurers to over-budget <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister could give us some idea as to how this allocation will be made <e> <s> will it be on a basis that the country can afford <e>", "<cs> i was going to ask whether this did in fact apply to the <e>", "<cs> in supporting my noble friend lord ridley and opposing my noble friend lord sandford i should like to emphasise the genuine nature of the differences between counties and districts <e> <s> very often there is a conflict of interest between local voters and the general good and there is no doubt that many local voters in town or borough can affect the opinion of their councillors <e> <s> i think it is important in this matter that the question should not be left merely as being the opinion of the local planning authority <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment on behalf of the association of county councils because my noble friend lord ridley has tabled almost identical amendments which i shall not move should this amendment be successful <e> <s> i shall not repeat the noble baronesss cogent arguments but i should like to highlight one particular aspect which is the importance of amendment no <e> <s> d which enables the secretary of state to designate districts for prohibiting unauthorised camping instead of waiting for the whole county area to have sufficient sites <e> <s> my county of dorset is the only one so far designated but i must tell your lordships as chairman of the committee which provided these sites that it was very frustrating when having covered more than per cent of the county we still had to wait a long time before designation <e> <s> i think the facts speak for themselves <e> <s> twelve years after this act was enacted only one county has been designated <e> <s> i am sure that if we can proceed by districts it will be of great advantage <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for that reply <e> <s> i am afraid we had appreciated that our attempt to shorten this might pose problems for the parliamentary draftsmen <e> <s> but it is a most welcome assurance that legislation will be produced <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this amendment has been slipped in here without consultation <e> <s> so far as i know it is the first time that a separate commission of the peace has been set up in a district council <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon mentioned other districts <e> <s> i think he must be <e>", "<cs> amendments nos <e> <s> to a will not now be moved since what they propose has already been accepted in another form <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend on this amendment <e> <s> it goes some of the way to satisfying my noble friend lord ridley who introduced a similar amendment at committee stage <e> <s> i wish to emphasise two points <e> <s> this will help the administration of local police authorities and it fits in with the <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the association of county councils i should like to thank the minister for this amendment which goes a long way towards relieving <e>", "<cs> my lords i was speaking to the main amendment and i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord bellwin on his second and third thoughts <e> <s> we have heard so often from the benches opposite that the government are intransigent and will not listen <e> <s> it surprises me that noble lords opposite then criticise the government when they do have second and third thoughts <e> <s> on behalf of my noble friend lord ridley i should <e>", "<cs> my lords the county councils have only a small number of direct labour organisations but we have done a survey of our members and this shows that this part of the bill will result in the need for new technical officers and new accountants <e> <s> these will be required regardless of when it comes into force but in the first year it is obviously going to be that much more difficult to get the organisation going <e> <s> i should particularly like to support my noble friend lord sandford who says that the cipfa computer accounts programme will not be ready until probably next year <e> <s> the noble lord lord bell-win said that we had had lots of warning but when you are talking of this number of staff surely you cannot employ them in advance of a code of practice which has not yet been approved and the form of which you do not exactly know <e> <s> most local authorities do not have surplus manpower <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not entirely happy but i thank the minister for some of his words <e> <s> i believe that there still is a danger <e> <s> i will certainly keep a copy of his speech in <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is quite right that local authorities have a majority on these committees but if you take only these local authority members provided they agree it can be increased <e> <s> i feel that this is a proper safeguard <e> <s> however i must admit that as usual the noble lord lord collison speaks with a lot of sense <e> <s> i can see the objects behind this and if the noble earl the minister would agree to make a suitable undertaking that the government would consult with the local authorities before making any order i would be prepared to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i can say that east sussex certainly had no consultation and as far as counties are concerned i think the noble lord may be misinformed as to how much consultation there has been <e> <s> i will not repeat all the arguments we had in committee but i would say that the savings if any are assured to be minimal <e> <s> there will be <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bellwin drew the distinction in committee between consultations and the power of deciding planning applications <e> <s> i should like to point out that in this case there would be a power of deciding if the applicant was not a government body <e> <s> therefore this is not consultations in the true sense it is an alternative to the planning application <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl for that very long reply which was given in some detail <e> <s> i would sum up what he has said by saying that the government are relying on site licensing and assure us that better controls on per cent <e> <s> are being produced without relaxing the rest <e> <s> this is <e>", "<cs> my lords when i started looking at rights of way i always thought that if there was a bridleway it was as good as having a footpath from the walkers point of view but of course it is not <e> <s> if it is a footpath it should be classified as such because a bridleway can get very muddy if used by a lot of horses and i think that the footpath should be left in <e>", "<cs> my lords as a signals officer i spent a great deal of time trying to communicate with the noble earl lord ferrers in the depths of the jungle <e> <s> i hope that he gets the message loud and clear from this house today certainly louder and clearer than i ever achieved <e> <s> i think that everyone has been of one voice <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the ncc have declared that they are unwilling to accede to any afforestation within the boundaries of this sssi <e> <s> is he also aware that in the area below metres there are many areas suitable for small-scale planting which would not interfere with the habitats or the prey of these birds <e> <s> many of those affected are farmers with small farms who will resent this restriction <e>", "<cs> with your lordships permission i feel i must say a word about amendment no <e> <s> because so far as local authorities are concerned amendment no <e> <s> is the sting in the tail <e> <s> what these amendments are really doing is trying to speed up the implementation of the warnock report <e> <s> we all want that to happen as quickly as possible but i must point out that it is inappropriate in the present financial circumstances to impose extra duties more quickly <e> <s> local authorities are trying their best to implement warnocks proposals <e> <s> these amendments would have great cost consequences and while we are absolutely ready to understand the urgency it must be left to the normal building programmes within our financial resources <e>", "<cs> we have heard from both the noble lords who have spoken that local authorities would use this as an excuse <e> <s> it seems to me that the present two subsections are very clear <e> <s> the one which it is proposed to put in their place is much more vague <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> i was delighted to hear that this was just a probing amendment because i really am worried about the wording <e> <s> one might think that the local authority officials did not have an understanding of the whole situation <e> <s> surely this is particularly a case where you cannot lay down rules from the government or by statute <e> <s> this is a case where the local authority may do it <e> <s> of course in a number of cases they will do so but every situation is different <e> <s> i cannot see the advantage of putting shall in the place of may <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the main amendment no <e> <s> and oppose my noble friend lord rentons amendment <e> <s> we went into this in great detail at committee stage and if i remember rightly despite the noble baronesss offer to look at it the amendment was pressed to a division and was lost at that stage <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but i think we must look at amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble baroness lady young because as i see it the undertaking was that under clause she would bring in this amendment that parents could have meetings <e> <s> i personally am absolutely convinced that rather than seeing all the professional documents a meeting with the local authority officials concerned is of far greater value <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand the noble baroness to say that we also are discussing here amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments are about confidentiality <e> <s> together with the amendment that my noble friend lord renton has put down to amendment no <e> <s> they are trying to go part way <e> <s> in fact they are liable to make the situation worse <e> <s> if you are going to show everything then show it <e> <s> we have just decided we will not do that <e> <s> it is going to create grit in the wheels of the relationships of the local authority and the parents <e> <s> i believe even worse are these half measures where they have to be told that they are not seeing a report and they say why have i not seen that report <e>", "<cs> my lords in the last year we have suffered great damage to our reputation in the world <e> <s> the ira propaganda followed by riot news has for the first time made some of our friends wonder for the stability of this country <e> <s> yesterdays wedding showed a completely different face of britain and i suggest a much truer face <e> <s> the bbc can show this face precisely because it has never used propaganda but uses objective truth <e>", "<cs> i very much wish to welcome the amendment and i am glad that my noble friend lord renton has not moved his amendment <e> <s> the important point is that there should be confidence between the authority and the parents and that the whole process should go as smoothly as possible <e> <s> i appreciate that this does not always happen but i believe that the amendment will help that confidence and will ensure that the parent can be told by the officials exactly what is the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords this may well be a different point but the basis is still the same and i must repeat my objection to this which is that those writing reports will always be looking over their shoulder and saying if someone queries this opinion here or that opinion there <e> <s> i believe that the reports will not be as full and as helpful as if they are made in the normal process without having to be looked at in detail by the parents <e> <s> i also feel that this sort of amendment rather invites friction by giving these rights suggesting that they must get all these things <e> <s> i hope that it will not be passed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord onslow has i think in effect said that one noble lord is profligate and all arbitrators are incompetent because if indeed the noble earl lord peel could have got a year extra income by developing his moors he is pretty incompetent not to have done so in the past <e> <s> i am of course talking about extra income <e> <s> i believe that the noble earl has misunderstood the basis of compensation for this <e> <s> the first point is that an owner of land will have his potential income diminished by not being allowed to carry out a normal agricultural operation on his land <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact remains that if this goes through surely the noble earl lord peel will not be able to improve his moorland <e> <s> the basis of compensation here must be and as i understand it is the difference between the income that that land is producing at the moment the income that it would produce if developed less all the costs that that development would involve <e> <s> first there are reclamation costs <e> <s> i have been through this although i admit not in this country but in ireland <e> <s> the process of reclamation there turned out to be five times as expensive as the value of the land would be when reclaimed <e> <s> therefore there was no financial advantage <e> <s> so from the extra income that he would receive reclamation costs say over years have first to be deducted by the arbitrator <e>", "<cs> my lords yes but the argument has been produced that huge amounts of compensation will be paid by the national parks <e> <s> i do not believe that that is true at all <e> <s> the actual compensation will be quite small <e> <s> not only are there all the initial costs but the costs of keeping it and the costs <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says that that is not true <e> <s> doubtless the noble earl the minister will correct me if i am wrong <e> <s> after all all the arguments used by the noble earl lord onslow were on the point of compensation and there is also the existing use value that must be taken off this <e> <s> an arbitrator will purely assess the amount that the owner is losing <e> <s> if he is not allowed something in the public interest i think that it has been accepted so far in this bill that he should be compensated <e> <s> i shall leave the matter there at the moment and doubtless i shall be corrected if i am wrong <e> <s> if i am correct i am sure that my other noble friends will take up my argument <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness lady white has already spoken to her amendment no <e> <s> b perhaps it would be for the convenience of the house if i spoke to my amendment no <e> <s> aa at this stage <e> <s> my amendment is very much in agreement with her amendment but i am concerned that the noble baroness has imposed a maximum of five years <e> <s> so often a maximum becomes a minimum and i believe it is better to leave the authority to decide as it thinks fit <e> <s> i am concerned about the requirements to review a map yearly <e> <s> if my amendment was agreed the county planning authorities would have to review the map as they think fit <e> <s> i would remind your lordships that they are responsible bodies and will review as necessary <e> <s> the association of county councils is concerned at the expense involved in a yearly review <e> <s> as the past chairman of a committee dealing with rights of way and definitive maps i have so often found that new duties imposed by parliament have meant that other duties possibly of greater importance have had to fall by the wayside <e> <s> we all know that there are not enough staff to deal with all the things that we would like to have dealt with <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i do <e> <s> i think that this is something that can well be done <e> <s> it would be normal practice for those in charge of the authority and i would certainly support that amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the ministers assurance that subsection <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down may i ask him to say whether this means that the requirement that treasure trove should have been hidden will be taken out or just that with a view to its recovery will be taken out <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady birk has read into this amendment something quite different from what i had intended <e> <s> i was intending to bring that up and will do so on the question that clause stand part which i thought the right moment to consider rewards <e> <s> i would like to say that everything the noble baroness lady white said has really clarified much better than i could have done what i was after in this amendment <e> <s> i am concerned that if hidden remains i do not believe that the object of this bill will be achieved <e> <s> in the case of the single bracelet for instance the court will say it was not hidden <e> <s> it is no longer relevant whether it was hidden for purposes of being recovered <e> <s> but if hidden remains that is the situation <e> <s> i feel that this point must be resolved <e> <s> i am no lawyer and i may read this in the wrong way but i understand from the promoters of the bill that hidden which has always been an essential part of treasure trove would remain under this bill <e>", "<cs> at second reading the noble baroness lady birk suggested that the system of rewards should be revised so as to recognise the claim of the landowner <e> <s> the noble earl lord avon pointed out that this bill makes a fundamental change in the laws of property that the bill proposes the curtailment of centuries old rights of ownership <e> <s> landowners on the whole are prepared to accept this if the object is achieved of preserving the heritage for the good of all <e> <s> this is the essential point that i think we all want <e> <s> however definition is now being drawn so widely that it would be appropriate to recognise that owners should be compensated under the reward schemes as otherwise we are removing the existing rights of ownership and compensating not the owner but the third party who finds the object <e>", "<cs> i did not want to make this into a major issue <e> <s> the precise reason why i brought it up on the question whether the clause shall stand part is that i do not think that it is suitable for an amendment at all <e> <s> i hope that our discussion will certainly be read in <e>", "<cs> this amendment deals with the same points covered by amendments nos <e> <s> and tabled by my noble friend lord ridley who apologises to your lordships for his absence abroad but who has asked me to speak to these amendments on behalf of the association of county councils <e>", "<cs> i can see the logic of this amendment but i am slightly concerned because i believe it is important that the custodial sentence should not be seen as an alternative to supervision or as a second stage in a procedure following a supervision order <e> <s> supervision orders must stand on their own feet but this amendment implies the threat of a custodial sentence which is merely suspended in the forlorn <e>", "<cs> i want to raise one point about the curfew orders and the nomenclature involved <e> <s> in this respect i think that curfew has an unfortunate <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> i deliberately left out references to arboricultural and silvicultural because had we known the position we should not have tabled those particular words <e> <s> i think that they have a basis but it may be said that they are more scientific aspects <e> <s> that is why i emphasised the artistic side <e> <s> in view of the reply of the minister i hope that we can look at the matter again perhaps at report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee can accept this because there are many instances such as sir winston churchills memorabilia and so on which would never have been at chartwell for example and might have been in no <e> <s> during the war <e> <s> these are things which it should be possible to acquire under these terms <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that answer but i am not entirely satisfied <e> <s> i think i must ask him whether he would be prepared to accept this or some similar formula with the word may so that this will be available <e> <s> i take his point that this commission is going to have a lot to do and it may not wish straight away to do anything about listing but it would keep it in the mind and there is no reason why if the word were may it should be implemented straight away <e> <s> i hope my noble friend would consider something on those lines <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a bill that i approach with some trepidation because although i believe that the bill is necessary i also believe that unless we are very careful we may find ourselves doing more harm than good <e> <s> it is an old clich that legislation too often has the opposite effect to that which parliament intends <e> <s> therefore although i support the principle of the bill i think it is vital that the practices the practicalities and the effects on individuals should be thoroughly tested at the committee stage which i am sure we shall do <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to come to the rescue of my noble friend lord avon because it seems to me that historically appropriate here means not necessarily historically attached to the house it could well mean things that are historically appropriate to the period of the house <e> <s> therefore i believe that it is a wide definition <e> <s> however i should like the ministers confirmation of this wider interpretation because i am most grateful to him for bringing forward this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord avon wrote to me after i raised this subject at committee stage and i should like to take up two points which he made <e> <s> first he said that while circulating a list to local authorities would certainly advance their knowledge it would do nothing explicitly to protect such gardens <e> <s> of course it is quite true that there would be no teeth with this register but this view ignores the effect that a statutory register would have on members of planning committees <e> <s> the object of the register is not to introduce a new set of controls but to bring forcefully to the attention of planners and public bodies who are planning roads and other things the value of these gardens and landscapes <e>", "<cs> i rather like this amendment <e> <s> the lindop committee wanted codes of practice by law but the government replied that it would entail too many resources although in their white paper they accepted that professioanl bodies might well produce these codes <e> <s> i appreciate the governments point but i feel that the concept of codes of practice being framed by the organisations involved and then approved by the registrar is very cost effective <e>", "<cs> the implications of this amendment are that if a data subject applies to say one local authority for information about himself and that local authority holds many different files such as social service files education and many other files he would be allowed on one payment to get all the data available in all departments <e> <s> even if this information is on one computer the administrative burden caused by this would be great because very often the information will be on different files <e> <s> the fact that the data are on the same computer does not mean that there will not be considerable administrative expense in providing the data <e> <s> if there is one single fee i feel that local authority resources will be used up to quite a large extent and the revenue intended to finance meeting the requirements of the bill will be lost <e>", "<cs> i welcome this clause <e> <s> it is of great importance that records required for social work should be completely confidential <e> <s> in the bill we are particularly concerned with the rights of the individual as against the data user <e> <s> however in social work the rights of children are paramount <e> <s> there is a great public outcry when children are harmed by parents who with hindsight are patently quite unfit to look after them <e> <s> but any evidence which the social workers have acted upon is very often subjective or hearsay <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> i intend to say a few words here but i shall not move amendment no <e> <s> until i have heard what the government say on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> as the bill stands there is a lack of opportunity for the discussion of data protection by interested users as the implementation of this bill develops <e> <s> local authorities in particular are concerned at this gap <e> <s> they administer a wide variety of services requiring the storage of data <e> <s> as the government have decided to appoint a registrar rather than set up an authority as previously suggested there should be in my opinion a committee of this type to provide a forum for energetic consideration of data protection as it develops and to advise the registrar on the practical implications of any step which he chooses to make <e> <s> in my amendment this committee would include representatives of local authorities and certainly under this amendment could do so <e> <s> they have tremendous practical experience or will have of these problems <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i should like to take up his point about subsection <e> <s> i have no doubt that from a legal point of view he is probably right <e> <s> i should like to make it quite clear that my object is that when a code of practice is brought in users will be able to rely on the fact that they follow that code of practice and therefore are immune in law <e>", "<cs> with both front benches against me i shall certainly read the <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept that this amendment limits the advice that can be given which is the whole basis of my noble friends arguments <e> <s> he says that there might be a particular expertise that was not represented on the committee <e> <s> no committee can have expertise from every field <e> <s> if a particular expert witness is required the registrar will still be perfectly capable of obtaining the advice <e> <s> i still do not understand the ministers objection to the general principle <e> <s> i believe that this committee is necessary and i <e>", "<cs> my lords the registrar needs the statutory advice in my opinion a committee laid down for that purpose which will come into effect <e> <s> it can always be said that anyone can take whatever advice he likes <e> <s> presumably the registrar can set up a committee of his own <e> <s> but we have had no particular assurances from the government as to what form that committee would take <e> <s> i must admit that i feel that we have not had the assurances that we should have had <e>", "<cs> my lords here again we have general agreement that there will be codes of practice <e> <s> the issue is who will formulate them and what will their status be in law <e> <s> i had all sides of the chamber against me although i am not sure that lindop was when at committee stage i suggested that the codes should supersede their principles <e> <s> i entirely accept this and this amendment makes the codes advisory <e>"]
