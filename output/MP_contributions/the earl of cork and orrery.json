["<cs> my lords it is both noteworthy and agreeable to be able to welcome and congratulate four maiden speakers particularly in a defence debate <e> <s> i confess to a slight twinge of disappointment in connection with one of them in that the noble lord lord hill-norton did not elect like his noble friend to make his maiden speech in an earlier debate so that he might have regaled us with total freedom from inhibitions concerning provocativeness <e> <s> he might have been provocative to his hearts content and possibly to ours as well <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me for intervening he has been speaking for minutes may i inquire whether this has got anything whatever to do with the subject of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords will her majestys government ensure that whenever the report may be published there will thereafter be ample <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend accept the suggestion of my other noble friend lord boyd-carpenter that a declaration of policy by a government any government has some sacred quality which forbids it to be overturned by public acclamation or resistance <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend prepared to comment on the governments view on the joint national farmers union-potato marketing board potato working party proposals and to say whether they may find a deal with the eec broadly in line with them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend to say what degree of consideration has been given to the possibility of constructing a complete airport on the severn-side site linked as it is to london by the motorway and the high-speed railway <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a fearsome matter to have to follow a chief of the defence staff on his own subject <e> <s> it becomes positively nerve-racking when one knows that another is to follow immediately afterwards <e> <s> it would be agreeable to the nerves to be able to agree with both but i suspect that it may turn out that they do not agree with each other <e> <s> therefore i find myself compelled to disagree with one or the other <e> <s> a certain boldness is needed to take this course and luckily i am feeling slightly bold i believe this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble baroness i think that i must wait until <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend and kinsman whether he thinks that the government might consider being a little more specific in the slogans that they issue bearing in mind that it is a question not merely of lung cancer that is involved but of respiratory diseases and diseases of the circulation <e>", "<cs> my lords you are witnessing a ventriloquial turn <e> <s> my noble friend lord gainford is sitting beside me in silence and he is going to speak after me <e> <s> we have agreed for reasons which will probably emerge to change places <e> <s> i mention this for the comfort of the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead who may have become confused as he is to follow us both <e> <s> i find myself in great and unexpected agreement with my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter unexpected to me and unexpected to him <e> <s> he will probably be startled to hear me say this <e> <s> he need not be too startled too quickly <e> <s> i am indeed in agreement with almost everything he said almost but there are certain things he has not said with which i am in total disagreement <e> <s> there is one thing he said with which also <e>", "<cs> that is a very rash remark from any front bench or indeed from anywhere else <e> <s> no my lords i think that is not the case <e> <s> of course there is planning which is going on now but which is <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i think so <e> <s> i must be cautious over this <e> <s> i certainly think that it could be done not in the same timescale but in a quite different and shorter time-scale so far as construction is concerned <e> <s> i have no doubt at all about that <e> <s> all <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept entirely my noble friends correction though i did forearm myself against it by saying that i did not want to paraphrase him incorrectly <e> <s> i am sure that i did paraphrase him correctly <e>", "<cs> my lords a parody <e> <s> well it was the impression that i received whatever may have been meant <e> <s> however let us not pursue the matter any further <e> <s> the point is that we have not heard any reference of significance or any at all to the people who live on the ground except from my noble friend lord abinger who did not speak particularly about people as people or about people as economic units <e> <s> he referred to the land upon which they live and the surroundings they love farm cherish and grow up in <e> <s> these are all of a piece <e>", "<cs> my lords am i right in suspecting that there may be a scheme already on foot for building a second severn bridge <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i may be forgiven by the noble lord lord boothby and others if in the interests of time-saving at this rather late hour i do not comment in any detail on any preceding speech not even in fact upon that highly-congratulation-worthy maiden speech if i may so put it of my noble and patient friend lord murton of lindisfarne <e> <s> i want instead if i may to ask a question and it is this how fiercely self-defensive are we the british <e> <s> or rather more to the point how fiercely self-defensive do other people think we are <e> <s> i suggest it is high time we faced the fact that the answer to this question will be pretty rude <e> <s> so disinclined do we appear to be to defend ourselves that it is very hard to see how an ill-disposed foreigner could experience so <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in fact the orthodox churches now usually have easter on a different date from anybody else <e> <s> would it make any <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not slightly off line here <e> <s> if these trees die then they do not come within the provisions of the bill which deals with trees actually cut down by the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i too feel that a good deal of merit should descend gently upon the head of the noble lord lord somers for introducing the bill <e> <s> as one who started his life and has since spent a great deal of it in under and around trees perhaps not in yes even sometimes in and having always been closely associated with trees which are the first things i see when i look out of my window in the morning i feel very strongly about the disappearance of trees of almost any kind and i wish nothing but well for the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords it is st georges day <e> <s> we have neglected our patron saint to such an extent that i hardly think he will respond to a call this evening as he might have done conceivably in other circumstances <e> <s> according to byzantine iconography his destruction of the dragon was a posthumous miracle carried out on behalf of a persecuted village <e> <s> if he were to come back this afternoon in response to our prayers i am inclined to think that the dragon to which i would invite him to pay his attention or one of the dragons would be the dragon which i would describe very nearly but not quite as defeatism <e> <s> defeatism is not part of our make-up and it has certainly played no part in this afternoons debate but something not unlike it has i believe <e> <s> one might describe it as did the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee as a sense of doom which hangs like a cloud over the world <e> <s> i think i have his words right from that memorable and moving maiden speech which we were privileged to hear him make earlier in this debate <e>", "<cs> i am not at all sure that i am entirely in agreement with the noble lord lord kilbracken as i call to mind a spectacle that i have witnessed in the past and others of your lordships may also have done so <e> <s> i refer to the spectacle of several hundred thousand starlings flying to roost at sunset time and coming down in a small wood <e> <s> it is not a very frequent happening i am glad to say but it is a quite well-known one and if it is a wood of small trees certainly trees that would be covered by the provisions of this bill it will be totally destroyed <e> <s> this might amount to the sudden death of several hundred trees <e> <s> if the objection of the noble lord lord kilbracken is accepted who will replace all those dead trees <e> <s> the onus falls upon the local authority <e> <s> the local authority is presumably the <e>", "<cs> i am inclined to support the noble lord lord kilbracken in his amendment <e> <s> he is a little hard on the noble lord lord somers in rather high-handedly abolishing the whole of this schedule upon which the noble lord has spent so much time <e> <s> it goes against the grain to be hard on the noble lord but i am afraid that i am inclined to be a little hard on him <e> <s> one could go on amending a schedule of this kind practically for ever taking trees out and putting others in <e> <s> as many as there were people engaged upon this exercise so many different versions of the schedule would i suspect emerge at the end of the exercise <e> <s> in any case the schedule would be likely to get longer and longer as the noble lord lord kilbracken has said <e> <s> on the whole probably the best thing to do is to leave the whole thing out <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i perfectly understood my noble friend lord mowbray and stourton <e> <s> he appears to me to have been making a second reading speech attacking the whole bill <e> <s> we had that speech from somebody else on second reading <e>", "<cs> i should like to join with the noble lord lord kilbracken in expressing a somewhat similar sentiment <e> <s> it would be a most appalling idea that anybody should wish to destroy this bill nor do i think that this amendment or any other amendment runs the risk of doing anything of the kind <e> <s> i know that it is close to the noble lords heart to have this bill with a particular purpose that is to replace a small number of hardwood trees but if other noble lords see in it a different purpose and choose to move amendments to the bill to sustain that purpose the particular purpose of the noble lord lord somers may be lost <e> <s> what the rest of the committee is trying to do is to support this bill and make it into a good bill and i hope the noble lord lord somers will accept that <e>", "<cs> i think i owe the committee an apology <e> <s> it may have been noticed by some noble lords that i tabled amendment no <e> <s> and did not move it <e> <s> this was not a device as some may have supposed although i hope they did not to get my name at the top of page it arose from the fact that i made a mistake by not seeing something until it was too late to table another amendment <e> <s> if your lordships will look at clause you will see that it begins <e>", "<cs> i am not so sure about this <e> <s> this time i support the bill against its mover and also against the amendment <e> <s> if this subsection is taken out i think that local authorities would find themselves obliged at least by implication to plant a new tree in the place where the old one was growing <e> <s> i think that is the inference that -flows from this <e> <s> it is therefore right to put in a proviso that they may plant it somewhere else <e> <s> so far so good <e> <s> the noble lord lord kilbracken is not objecting to that i think <e> <s> what he says is that it is unnecessary to say that they may plant it in any other place or places within the local authority area <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think probably i was paying more attention to this amendment than to what the noble lord was saying on the previous one <e> <s> it is certainly arguable that this amendment has become unnecessary in view of the amendment we have just passed <e> <s> i do not know whether anyone else would like to comment <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord kilbracken would like to enlarge upon it <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i should have spoken to that later amendment <e> <s> the amendment to which the noble lord lord wynne-jones referred will arise in a moment <e> <s> i should like to stick for the moment to the amendment presently under discussion <e> <s> i entirely take the point made by the noble lord lord kilbracken <e> <s> i am not at all sure that it has any particular effect on the amendment or this subsection because i do not know whether this is necessarily the appropriate place to insert any penalty clause <e> <s> whether it is or is not perhaps it ought to go in somewhere else <e> <s> i suggest that the amendment might be allowed to pass now and that another <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak to the next amendment to leave out clause but i understand that there is no way in which i can do so at present <e> <s> the noble lord lord somers wants to omit the word supersedes and insert shall apply notwithstanding <e> <s> it appears to me to be unnecessary to have anything like this at all <e> <s> if there is a clash between an act of parliament and a local regulation no doubt the act of parliament will supervene and have rights over the matter <e> <s> but the noble lord wants to insert shall apply notwithstanding <e> <s> i do not think that it is possible for a local authority regulation to defeat an act of parliament <e> <s> therefore if nothing is said and if this clause is omitted entirely any regulation made by a local authority which is in conflict with this bill will automatically fall and the result proposed by the noble lord lord somers in his amendment will occur that is to say the bill will apply notwithstanding the local government regulation <e> <s> this amendment appears to be unnecessary and indeed ineffectual <e>", "<cs> if there are no regulations i do not see to what the clause applies <e>", "<cs> in spite of what my noble friend on the front bench says i still regret to say that there is absolutely no point in the amendment to which the committee has just agreed <e> <s> i have said why i think it is useless and i beg to move that clause be omitted from the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a somewhat daunting experience to follow a field marshal <e> <s> in the previous defence debate we had i was cast between an admiral of the fleet and a field marshal so that the erstwhile field officer of long ago begins to feel smaller and smaller in such exalted company <e> <s> none the less it is inspiring <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for stepping into the breach at short notice to answer this question on behalf of his and my noble friend the minister <e> <s> is he aware that it is precisely because i received that answer from the minister of state in the debate to which he has referred that i tabled the question again the answer having been totally unsatisfactory in the first place and therefore equally unsatisfactory now <e> <s> does the noble viscount further appreciate that if the responsibility for the defence of britains north sea oil and gas in time of war were not to rest with the royal navy the royal air force the army the ministry of defence the british government or indeed the british nation the inference must be made and is made that there is no intention to defend these energy resources at all <e> <s> in that case what particular measures do the government have in mind for defending our other sources of oil notably those which come to us around the cape of good hope <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord somers has accepted the amendment i am loath to waste the time of the house by saying any more about it <e> <s> but i would draw attention with diffidence to the words naturally regenerated <e> <s> i believe that they emanated from the noble lord lord balerno who is a scientist <e> <s> the noble lord is not in his place but i am not quite sure whether he was speaking from his scientific knowledge or simply <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not also be a matter of a miracle to get an express train through an underground tube <e>", "<cs> there is one particular difference between humps and depressions which has not yet been mentioned <e> <s> a hump is bound to slow down a driver for reasons of safety or comfort but the way to get over a depression is to drive over it as fast as possible <e> <s> the higher the speed the greater the safety <e> <s> no depressions please <e>", "<cs> my lords i followed one admiral of the fleet into membership of your lordships house and that must be some comfort to <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to ask him one short question for clarification <e> <s> in the third minute of his speech he used the words counter-offensive to dtente <e> <s> this implies that from the soviet point of view dtente is an offensive <e> <s> is that what he intended <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be right in fairness when referring to the all-party defence committee to say that it is not only under the secretaryship of my noble friend lord kimberley but under the chairmanship of the noble lord lord chalfont <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been a keen user of seat belts for a long time i suppose more than years and for most of that time i have been opposed to the idea of making their wearing compulsory <e> <s> on the whole i am inclined to think that now i have changed my mind although i do not propose to enter into that particular controversy at this moment beyond saying to my noble friend lord balfour of inchrye that i do not personally take great stock of his objection to the principle of freedom because i do not believe that any law has ever been made could be made or ever will be made which does not inhibit somebodys freedom in some way <e>", "<cs> my lords there are all sorts of things we should think about too <e> <s> my only point is that we should think about this one thing <e> <s> i inhibit nobody from thinking about anything else <e>", "<cs> my lords i looked forward with great interest to hear what the noble and learned lord who initiated this debate would have to say upon this subject <e> <s> i found myself cast into a great cloud of wonder as to what advocacy he could put forward in favour of simplifying the english language <e> <s> my wonder is not totally dispelled now because if i may say so with respect he has not made much in the way of recommendations for reforming the language beyond doing away with a certain number of irregular verbs <e>", "<cs> i apologise for interrupting my lords but did i hear the noble lord refer to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> i think he meant to refer to the noble lord lord kilbracken <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have a great deal to say about the bill except to say a cheerful hallo to give a welcome return to an old friend and to wish the noble lord lord somers success with it <e> <s> he has pointed out the alterations he has made since a similar bill was before us last session and how he has retained certain amendments that were made on its first appearance <e> <s> the noble lord lord kilbracken and i had a hand in tabling some amendments some of which were successful and some were not from our point of view and as the bill stands now i feel quite happy with it <e>", "<cs> with deference to the noble lord if he goes round to the antique shops and the junk shops he will find birds for sale-stuffed owls in cases-and these must have come from people who were keeping them or who had them in their possession with the idea that they would sell them sooner or later otherwise they would not get into the shops <e>", "<cs> there is an element of heavy weather blowing up over this <e> <s> i am not entirely certain and i say this with respect but i think it was started by the noble lord lord donaldson with all this talk about eggs <e> <s> this amendment has nothing to do with eggs <e> <s> it is purely to do with any dead wild bird not parts of the bird or the egg blown or otherwise <e> <s> it is simply to do with dead birds <e> <s> whether the bird is edible or otherwise has nothing to do with it either <e> <s> there seems to be an idea that many of these birds are going into the deep-freeze <e> <s> i should be sorry to discover a stuffed owl in my deep-freeze <e> <s> it is clear that the government have in mind the matter of stuffed birds otherwise they would not have included in the clause a reference to taxidermists <e> <s> the business of a taxidermist is to stuff birds and to sell them <e> <s> when this bill becomes law taxidermists will have to sell to other taxidermists because nobody else will be legally allowed to buy the stuffed birds <e> <s> i do not know whether it is intended that taxidermists should go round selling stuffed owls to each other but i do not think life is like that <e> <s> it is all very well to say that you could get a licence to sell one of these creatures but it says in the bill that you also must have a licence to buy it <e> <s> it says that you are committing an offence if you have it in your possession <e> <s> you must have a licence to buy a stuffed owl or any other bird and you must have a licence to sell it as though it were a firearm <e> <s> it is going too far altogether <e> <s> i am really inclined to think that this is rather a good amendment and i beg to move <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend says or by a physiotherapist or even by a psychoanalyst in certain cases <e> <s> one does not always have to send for the vet <e> <s> yet it is only if the vet is examining the bird that it must be confined in a small cage <e> <s> if the owner is examining it it need not be confined in a small cage <e> <s> i would say that if it is necessary for a vet to confine it in a small cage in order to treat it it is even more necessary for the unqualified owner to do so <e> <s> i therefore propose to leave out the words treatment by a veterinary surgeon and so on making it read <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> can i help my noble friend by suggesting a possible transposition in the drafting so that it reads a person who causes or by his unreasonable inaction permits <e> <s> would that solve the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that anyone who considers at all seriously taking steps to abolish your lordships house will pause for a moment to reflect on the extraordinary characteristic so familiar to us of having in our midst not only experts but actual professional experts in almost anything one can think of from beetles to bombers and in this connection helicopters where else could one hear a speech such as the one to which we have just listened from my noble friend lord glenarthur <e> <s> he made a great contribution to this debate <e>", "<cs> that is my opinion my lords and it is probably not without foundation <e> <s> i say that in connection with stansted for a particular reason especially in relation to the magnitude of the planning <e> <s> the planning which is now the subject of an application which is coming up for inquiry in september of this year is for an expansion to an airport capable of handling million passengers a year <e> <s> but beyond that the possibility is envisaged this is where i speak with some admiration for the new idea of planning in advance of expanding the same airport to a capacity of million passengers a year <e> <s> we must remember that million passengers a year is more than all the passengers handled in one year by all the london airports now <e>", "<cs> may i agree with the noble lord lord peart <e> <s> i feel that this bill is becoming something of an old friend small but an old friend none the less <e> <s> this is an improvement and i shall support the noble lords amendment <e>", "<cs> i take it that this clause is drafted in favour of the person who is walking along the footpath <e> <s> therefore the key question is whether or not it benefits him <e> <s> is he better with the subsection or without it <e> <s> to answer that question it is necessary to look at the matter from the point of view not of the bull nor of the farmer nor of my noble friend lord massereene and ferrard but of the walker <e> <s> the walker is likely to be a pretty ignorant sort of person <e> <s> for the sake of argument you must consider that kind of walker only even the one who cannot tell a bull from a cow <e> <s> however he may be confident that there is a law which operates in his favour to safeguard him <e> <s> therefore he walks across the field perfectly happily knowing that this law or a similar law has been passed <e> <s> he is therefore surprised to find himself suddenly tossed into the county hospital or even frightened and caused to have a heart attack or to sprain an ankle or to do something to his detriment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that there are in that part of somalia bordering on the ogaden something in the neighbourhood of million refugees or displaced persons somalis who represent a great problem both financially and materially to the somali government <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble noble friend lord kimberley has done well to ask this question of her majestys government and i doubt whether he is so sanguine as to expect when my noble friend comes to reply anything quite so definite as what might be described as plans for stansted <e> <s> if the government have plans even if they are only contingency plans which i hope they are that would be a startling new departure in the aviation business for i do not personally believe that any government have ever had plans for any airport before and much less a co-ordinated plan for a whole group of airports <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble baroness would allow me to intervene and add a footnote to what she has just said about distance <e> <s> i think the argument in favour of severnside includes the fact that its distance from london is not miles but about an hour and minutes by high-speed train <e> <s> we have -miles-an-hour trains and it is a journey of about an hour and minutes <e> <s> if immigration and customs procedures are carried out on the train the actual time involved which is what matters not miles is about the same as from gatwick <e>", "<cs> my lords it is miles and it is an hour and minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that the british airports authority have sent out a brief of which i hold a copy in my hand which includes the following words <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friend understood <e> <s> i think perhaps i did not make it clear <e> <s> what i was referring to in the british airport authoritys note was the statement that the department has agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to all noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> i have the impression that on the whole there is approval for the intention that lies behind the amendment faulty though it may very well be i do not pretend otherwise <e> <s> i am slightly puzzed by the criticism of my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth who accuses me of making a design requirement which of course is not the right thing to do i think that that was the phrase he used <e> <s> i was so greatly aware of the impropriety of placing on the manufacturers a design requirement that i drafted the amendment with the deliberate intention of not doing so and i thought that i had succeeded <e> <s> as i reread the amendment now i do not see in it any requirement on a manufacturer telling him how to do anything <e> <s> the amendment states that there is required a simple device for releasing a seat belt one that is easily accessible and can be easily understood by everybody including someone standing outside the car <e> <s> how the manufacturer achieves that is his business i do not presume to lay down a design requirement for anyone <e>", "<cs> my lords for the past years i have heard a lot of defence debates <e> <s> i have taken part in not a few <e> <s> there have been times when i have had a feeling of something like unreality i do not think that this is peculiar to me in which the atmosphere has been that there are not many people taking part and they are people really committed to the subject and are talking to one another but the people they would really like to be talking to are not listening or are not even here <e>", "<cs> that my lords is a wrong question in spite of lord gladwyns hear hear <e> <s> the deterrent is being used all the time already <e> <s> the question is really when will the rockets be fired if at all <e> <s> this is a question which must not be answered by anyone in any circumstances at all <e> <s> the reason why is this the missiles in their submarines in the depths of the ocean are not really the deterrent in themselves <e> <s> the deterrent is ignorance the ignorance of the russians as to whether and in what circumstances those missiles might be fired <e>", "<cs> my lords i am talking about deterrents <e> <s> there will be no war breaking out that is the object of deterrents to prevent war <e>", "<cs> my lords the force is quite big enough being undetectable and therefore invulnerable to a pre-emptive strike <e> <s> what needs to be improved from time to time is not the hitting power but the means of delivery <e> <s> what we need sometimes are cleverer missiles not more and bigger ones <e> <s> i return to my statement that the true deterrent is ignorance <e> <s> to lessen or remove this ignorance is to remove or destroy the effect of the deterrent <e> <s> that can be done in two opposite ways <e> <s> first we could let the enemy know in what circumstances we would fire <e> <s> to do this would enable him to alter his strategic planning so as to make sure that those circumstances would not arise and therefore that would be self-defeating <e>", "<cs> my lords the thing is that we expect the russians not to start a war <e> <s> they have the deterrent and we should not expect ourselves to start a war <e> <s> that is what i am talking about deterrence a no-war situation <e> <s> i wish the deterrent to exist and i do not wish people to say that we would not use it <e> <s> nor do i wish them to say that we would use it <e> <s> i wish silence to be maintained on this subject <e> <s> the question now is do the soviet leaders believe the noble lord lord gladwyn <e> <s> because if they do he has dissipated their ignorance and the deterrent is dead he has killed it <e> <s> he may believe i am sure he does that trident is simply not credible those are his words but what are we to think of a man who stands up in parliament and says so for publication to the world <e> <s> but do they believe him <e> <s> not entirely i suspect <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the orthodox church does not take the slightest notice of anybody elses fixing of easter now and that whether the orthodox church agrees or not has absolutely nothing whatever to do with the case <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it is as well that due to lack of time i am prevented from replying to the noble lord lord jenkins of putney <e> <s> at the risk of striking a slightly discordant note i should like to refer to two recent happenings both on the other side of the atlantic one of which at least your lordships will already have heard of perhaps almost too often <e> <s> i refer to the recent exchange between mr haig and mr weinberger <e> <s> as your lordships will remember mr haig as the secretary of state is reported as referring to the fact that nato had a contingency plan for firing a demonstrative nuclear weapon across the bows as it were of the russians in time of war if they thought that they were going too far <e> <s> that was contradicted by mr weinberger the minister of defence who said that there was no such contingency plan and i think i am right in saying this there never has been <e>", "<cs> my lords like many others i have enjoyed a rather neat concatenation this afternoon of three circumstances <e> <s> the first was the admirable speech with which my noble friend lord cathcart introduced this important debate <e> <s> second the happy conjunction with that of the question put down by my noble friend lord orr-ewing concerning intelligence relating to russian activities third arising directly he told us out of that question and the question and answer that it gave rise to the speech of the noble lord lord chalfont <e> <s> in my opinion that speech alone would have justified this debate <e> <s> if it could be printed as leaflets and dropped by the royal air force all over europe it would be a far more useful endeavour than any of those pamphlet raids we went in for in and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the noble lord lord davies of leek is asking me a question or not <e> <s> but if he is i do not think it has anything to do with my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to my noble friend for that answer i suppose but i did ask him on what evidence they based their statement <e> <s> he did not mention any evidence in his answer <e> <s> may i ask him therefore whether he is aware that on th october last year in reply to a question from mr abse in another place the minister for trade stated that no member of the committee had in fact visited the site so that nobody had taken any evidence on the ground <e> <s> is he further aware that a glance at a map will show that the distance from the motorway to the edge of the airport site as proposed is just about miles <e> <s> if one extends the distance which is referred to in the committees report as miles to the nearest intersection on a motorway a very labour-saving device and a very under-used intersection no <e> <s> it is found to be about miles <e> <s> what reliance can we therefore place on anything else in this report <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he is aware that the thames-severn estuary is in fact tidal and that the site of the airport which we are discussing lying as it does wholly below high water mark is in fact flooded twice a day <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend

academic legal lecture on the rights and wrongs of this particular position <e> <s> it is equally possible as we have seen from the speech of the noble lord lord mccarthy to give a diffuse and

noble friend the leader of the house and in particular the eagerly looked-forward to and keenly awaited speech for the first time after his return of my noble friend lord carrington who made an enormously distinguished speech in its own right as a speech and also produced not only a complete vindication of his own actions in resigning though that was not his intention particularly but a vindication of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee will acquit me of discourtesy if i do not follow him closely <e> <s> perhaps my words may contain

conclusion <e> <s> i shall not even congratulate the noble and gallant lord lord lewin on his maiden speech because i think that it would be an impertinence for me to do so <e> <s> instead i would

question has nothing whatever to do with the regimental headquarters which consists of one officer and one clerk but is to do with the depot and the training and the recruiting of the whole regiment

kind or another <e> <s> it is simply what is best for the royal air force and therefore for the nation <e> <s> if no clear-cut answer to that question immediately emerges then and only then should we move on to other subsidiary considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords in case i hear no audible sounds of approval at the end of my speech i will make sure of some at the beginning first of all by adding a word of congratulation and welcome to those expressed by the noble lord lord brockway to my noble friend who sits behind me lord eden of winton <e> <s> now we have had another greatly distinguished speech from the noble lord lord moran <e> <s> those of us who remember his father may perhaps wonder what he has been doing all this time because i think i am right in saying that the late lord moran died about seven years ago <e> <s> i believe the answer is that the present lord moran when his father died was british ambassador in portugal since when he has been our high commissioner in canada

my noble friend <e> <s> leaving aside the military arguments in this case is my noble friend aware that it is already being said in northern ireland that this is the first sign of a surrender

armoury of the ira <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the noble lord be no more heard <e>", "<cs> my lords it is by no means as a matter of form or as a matter of course that i wish to add my congratulations and expression of appreciation on the achievement of my noble friend lord renton in introducing this debate <e> <s> i wish to say something else about that and it is this <e> <s> if i

concerned among the advantages i number is that i have the pleasure of being able to congratulate the noble lord lord mulley upon his birthday and wish him many happy returns <e> <s> as a former secretary of state for defence he is enjoying a sort of busmans holiday but it is certainly a pleasure to know that he is doing it on his birthday <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question

noble earl will forgive me for interrupting him and i apologise but i am not quite clear whether he was trying to make the point that a request or a wish to be helped to commit suicide was essential

thing is a good deal less simple than perhaps the noble earl lord halsbury would like to think that it is <e> <s> i wish to ask one particular question <e> <s> but before i do that as a little more

points both those made by the noble and learned lord lord denning and also by my noble friend the minister <e> <s> the reason that i had not touched on them in advance of my remarks was that i thought that my amendment was so simple and so obvious that i could get away with that one get past it and proceed to the more important matter <e> <s> as these matters have been brought up now perhaps i may proceed and speak also to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i hope that will meet with the approval of the committee <e> <s> they are intended to meet the objection of the noble and learned lord that definitions have been made of surrogate mother and surrogacy arrangements in the act <e> <s> this is true and the act was based on the warnock report which i suspect though i am not sure took the word
