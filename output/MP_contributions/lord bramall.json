["<cs> my lords i am sure that many noble lords will have felt a deep sense of diffidence when addressing your lordships house for the first time and i am certainly no exception <e> <s> however i feel proud that my presence in the house seems to indicate continuing recognition of the valuable and constructive role that the armed forces of the crown play in the service of the nation in peace which thankfully but not accidentally has come to be the more normal state for the british people as well as in more war-like operations <e>", "<cs> my lords first i must apologise to your lordships for being unavoidably detained from attending the beginning of this debate and i therefore crave your indulgence <e> <s> but there are one or two points that i should like to leave with your lordships house before the debate closes <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope your lordships will forgive yesterdays military man for presuming to enter this very important debate on current education reform <e> <s> my detailed knowledge of this highly complex subject must inevitably pale in comparison with the depth of experience available elsewhere in your lordships house as typified by the noble lord lord glenamara who has just spoken and the noble lord lord joseph who will speak after me <e> <s> that is a formidable sandwich to be inside <e>", "<cs> i doubt whether i shall put my finger on the point again as the right reverend prelate so kindly suggested <e> <s> i was going to apologise to the minister for rather straying off my subject expertise <e> <s> however i understand that my erstwhile colleague the minister of state for defence procurement may be dealing with the amendments on grant-maintained schools and opting out therefore i do not feel quite so embarrassed <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the noble lords question is both irrelevant and unwise <e> <s> it is irrelevant because surely it is not the comparative yields of certain types of weapons which have any significance in establishing a credible deterrent to war which we all hope we will never have to use and unwise because surely it is highly undesirable that such sensitive information should be discussed in open forum <e>", "<cs> my lords hitherto for a number of reasons which noble lords will appreciate i have been most reluctant to get involved in our debates on the problems of education in inner london <e> <s> however i have been so depressed that what seems to me to be the almost irrefutable logic against rushing out of a long-established in certain areas respected and in all areas tried if not perfect system into an unknown field manifestly fraught with enormous problems as yet uncalculated and <e>", "<cs> my lords each year for the past few years the defence white paper setting out the estimates and giving the ministry of defence commentary on them has been produced in even glossier form calling on the latest marketing techniques <e> <s> there is nothing intrinsically wrong in that <e> <s> it makes what could be rather turgid stuff a great deal easier to read and gives to the armed forces of the crown a modern businesslike and up-to-date image which they thoroughly deserve <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say as an ex-professional soldier with as the noble lord the leader of the house is aware some experience in these matters that i would be the last person to suggest that in a civilised country like ours the activities of the armed forces should be generally cocooned from media comment or that they should ever be above the law and outside proper constitutional control <e> <s> i also happen to believe that the freedom of the press with all its irritations is one of the essential guardians of our liberty <e> <s> but i hardly need remind the house that when it happens that our special forces are properly called in by the civil power a request incidentally that they cannot constitutionally refuse it is invariably a matter of the highest delicacy and sensitivity with much at risk and much at stake otherwise they would not have had the incident handed over to them in the first place <e> <s> happily in our system there is no freelancing of military forces <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the governments assurances does not the minister agree that the retention of playing fields for young people in london remains a very serious problem and indeed a vital one if the amount of sport already on the wane in the state education system is not to go down still further <e> <s> does not the minister agree that with the great financial temptations to which the noble baroness referred of property development of open spaces there is a real risk that even if these playing fields are handed over to inner or outer london boroughs they will not continue to be used for the purpose for which they were originally intended <e> <s> will the minister therefore give an assurance that before any irreversible steps are taken on the transfer of ileas grounds the two voluntary bodies dealing with londons playing fields and the sports council all of which have a spiritual mandate to watch over and safeguard such facilities i hope i may use the word spiritual here are consulted so there is the maximum chance of retaining such grounds for recreational purposes and of maintaining them thereafter <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his quietly encouraging although surprisingly somewhat cautious reply <e> <s> does he agree that whatever the longer-term plans for the shape of the brigade and i agree that there are a number of factors to take into account in the shorter term while we still have responsibility for the stability and security of hong kong while there are very real problems of recruiting and retention in the british army there can be no justification whatsoever for restricting the number and strengths of gurkha units for which no recruiting problems exist <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not rather surprising that the government have taken so long over this matter <e> <s> as has already been stated it is over three years since the initial announcement was made envisaging a continual role for the gurkhas after <e> <s> the admirable parliamentary select committee report has been published for quite a long time <e> <s> can the minister say why there has been this delay <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply which i might describe as being of some help on the peripheral areas of the problem <e> <s> does the minister agree that domestic and family problems relating to difficulties with housing continue to be one of the greatest incentives to leaving the services early <e> <s> does the minister not agree that at a time of acute manning difficulties what is really required is a much more comprehensive scheme which will allow the soldier to save for his retirement home in a tax-effective manner without being forced to buy a home prematurely and at a time when he is being encouraged to live in government accommodation often abroad <e> <s> at present at the end of his service he has nothing to show <e>", "<cs> my lords as someone who has been closely connected with the gurkhas for a number of years i add my welcome to the announcement made by the leader of the house on a worthwhile and viable future for the brigade after <e> <s> the government have kept faith with the hill men of nepal who have for over years never failed to rally to this countrys support however adverse the circumstances or gloomy the forecast and who in large numbers have laid down their lives with the utmost gallantry for our security and our future <e> <s> at the same time emotion and gratitude apart the government have sensibly assured a continuing supply of some of the finest infantry men in the world to reinforce and supplement our own proud regiments for the inevitably unexpected emergencies with which our history is riddled <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is for hong kong a silver lining to the ominous cloud that hangs over china it is that the people of this country can now be seen by the people of hong kong to have woken up to their responsibilities for what may happen there after instead of perhaps giving the impression that the agreement signed with china enabled them to forget some of the intense human problems which might arise when sovereignty is due to pass <e> <s> i believe that every noble lord in this house will agree that the people of hong kong certainly deserve all the understanding and interest that we can muster since their confidence has been so badly shaken in the arrangements that this country has been making for them <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a highly interesting and also a difficult time for defence planning <e> <s> it is interesting because as has been said much is happening which may affect the general threats and balances in the international scene <e> <s> it is difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords i also congratulate the noble lord lord sharp on his most impressive and knowledgeable speech and thank the noble lord lord bonham-carter for the opportunity to discuss a most important subject <e>", "<cs> my lords despite what my noble friend lord wyatt asked only in the nick of time does the minister agree that we can take some encouragement from the fact that the senior member of omelco is on record as saying that the compromise reached with the chinese government under the circumstances was sensible and that it would be up to the hong kong elected members to show that democracy can develop sensibly and in harmony not in conflict with china which may have moved more in that direction when supreme authority passes in <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> some would say it indicates that taxation without representation is as evident today as it was in and that the principle of accountability which i thought was the object of the exercise can be abandoned on the slightest pretext <e> <s> does the minister not agree that it is manifestly unfair that a gurkha solider who has no vote no right of abode at the end of his service who makes minimal if any <e>", "<cs> my lords after the magnificent speeches from such distinguished noble lords what hope is there for a simple soldier <e> <s> perhaps to keep my end up although i feel diffident about mentioining this i should say that i reminded your lordships house during the debate on the defence estimates on th july that the middle east might explode at any moment that it was not difficult to imagine a scenario in which our armed forces might be needed in some capacity to counter or balance a pervading threat and that if that happened it would not be a question of meddling in affairs that did not concern us because we would perceive that our interests were much affected and because the result of not becoming involved was likely to be more serious still <e>"]
