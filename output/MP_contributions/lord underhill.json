["<cs> my lords when considering this privilege of addressing your lordships house for the first time i had to face the problem of how after years active work politically i was to make a non-controversial speech on a highly critical political subject and i should like your lordships to accept that it is not my intention to be controversial but that i am endeavouring to give a factual account of this subject from deeply-held views <e> <s> we will all agree that millions of families depend upon the services provided by public spending for an effective standard of life and as my noble friend lord wells-pestell has made quite clear we cannot deal with this debate without considering the cuts in public services which seem to be intended or proposed <e> <s> life is to be made much harder <e>", "<cs> my lords it was my intention to intervene in this debate at the start and raise the matter of the british council but in view of a number of speeches that have been made i decided not to say anything <e> <s> however in the light of the debate i still believe that the minister must tell us precisely what will happen as regards the british council <e> <s> it is not only a question of the educational work that the british council performs it is not only a question of the image which it gives of this country the achievements of this country and the background of this country but even from the narrow angle of dealing with our friends in the world and letting them know precisely where we stand and of our own interest <e>", "<cs> my lords as a comparative newcomer to your lordships house i too would like to express warm appreciation of the four speeches from the four noble lords who made their first speeches here this afternoon <e> <s> i am certain that their collective experience and knowledge is going to be very helpful to the deliberations of this house <e> <s> may i also thank lord thorneycroft for opening this debate and not being unfair to him say that i thoroughly enjoyed his rumbustious speech which i am certain again without being unfair was directed outside this chamber as well as to those within it <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to deal with part ii of the bill relating to epping forest <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord mais for the detailed explanation he has given of the position therefore enabling me to cut down my remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether it is not a fact that past parliamentary boundary commissions have exercised a toleration limit both above and below the electoral quota and that although the commissions act non-politically it so happens that in many of the large county constituencies the recommendations of the commissions have had a tendency to favour the conservative party <e> <s> also is it not a fact that some of the small electorate constituencies are in areas of inner city decay and acute deprivation which means that members of parliament for those constituencies have a high intensity of problems with which to deal <e> <s> finally has the noble lord any information at all on the work of the local government boundary commissions as the progress of their work will depend upon the speed of the parliamentary commissions <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the minister for that very informative reply may i ask whether he <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord accept my assurance that i understand the difference between tax evasion and tax avoidance <e> <s> would he not agree that they are both immoral and both disliked by the average taxpayer <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the views of a number of my noble friends that the present government cannot be held responsible for all our present ills <e> <s> however what are happening now are the consequences of some of the governments actions <e> <s> even at this late hour i must indicate a number of points in order to come to one rather important point <e>", "<cs> which has had so much success in providing job opportunities and training <e> <s> i hope it is not true but i see in todays newspaper that the government are even planning to close down or more of the centres for training in new skills <e> <s> because of the new techniques which are being developed one would have thought that these are the very centres that ought to be kept going in fact even added to <e>", "<cs> my lords one could go into the whole policy of british leyland and one cannot just blame the workers <e> <s> of course government money has been put into british leyland and without it british leyland would have gone <e> <s> i worked for years in birmingham and i know that without british leyland not just british leyland would suffer but the whole of the industrial west midlands would have suffered <e> <s> therefore i am glad that governments have put money into british leyland <e> <s> but there is still not the back-up of equipment and modern technology in british industry as compared with other countries and that is where we have failed in our investment programme <e> <s> how will that be dealt with merely by a policy of leave it alone to market forces <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not suggesting that but i should like to echo what others of my noble friends have said <e> <s> that was one reason for the existence of the national enterprise board <e> <s> that is why we want to see boards such as the scottish development agency succeed why we want the welsh development agency to succeed <e> <s> and whether my front bench agree or not i <e>", "<cs> nobody is going to assure the nation that the present situation is the responsibility solely of a few years of labour government <e> <s> private enterprise has failed to deliver the goods <e> <s> we believe in a mixed economy and i should love to hear what i have not heard in the short time that i have been in this house and this is why i will pay a tribute to the need to have an effective private industry i should like to hear government ministers agree with the need to have effective publicly-owned industries as well as private industries <e>", "<cs> my lords i did say that one can be provocative <e>", "<cs> it is always difficult when one is giving facts and information to be told that one is provocative <e> <s> unless we solve why there are strikes we shall not get out of this situation <e> <s> may i in conclusion because time is getting on refer to the public expenditure cuts <e> <s> of course we all support cutting out waste <e> <s> i do not know the attitude of my front bench on this <e> <s> i am not an economist <e> <s> i left school when i was <e> <s> i joined the labour party early in during the period when we were going up to million unemployed <e> <s> i know what i as a young man used to say then that a time of <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the bill and i should like to speak in particular about clause <e> <s> i do so because i was a member of the home office working party on the electoral register to which the noble lord lord lloyd has referred <e> <s> peoples names are left off the register for all kinds of reasons <e> <s> sometimes the household form a is not received or for various reasons there may be a failure to complete it <e> <s> some people either do not care about it or forget about it <e> <s> sometimes people will put on the form the names of themselves and their family but leave off the names of other qualified persons living in the dwelling <e> <s> we all know that only about a third of the eligible young voters who become in the course of the year appear to become registered <e> <s> all of us who are involved in elections at various stages know that at election times there are countless people who suddenly find that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for agreeing with that proposal <e> <s> the major problem in northern ireland is that of unemployment <e> <s> the latest available figures that i have for november are that unemployment in northern ireland stands at per cent <e> <s> of the insured population some persons out of work per cent <e> <s> are males per cent <e> <s> are females <e> <s> unemployment in northern ireland is double the level namely per cent <e> <s> of that for the united kingdom as a whole <e> <s> there are of course parts of great britain which are just as bad but unemployment in northern ireland as a complete region is by far the highest of any region of the united kingdom <e> <s> and i understand i may be wrong that it is the highest of any region of the eec <e> <s> unemployment has for many years been well above that of great britain and the figures in some individual areas are very alarming <e> <s> just look at a few strabane has per cent <e> <s> male unemployed in a population of some newry has over per cent <e> <s> of male unemployed cookstown also over per cent <e> <s> male unemployment and we have dungannon and londonderry with per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> respectively <e> <s> these are figures for male unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all those noble lords who have taken part in this debate for their helpful and constructive contributions <e> <s> in view of the time factor may i briefly say that everything will be on the record and will no doubt be commented upon widely in northern ireland <e> <s> i can only hope and i am sure that your lordships will hope that what has been said here may be of help to the people of northern ireland in their determination to get over their problems <e> <s> with those few words i beg leave to withdraw the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mais has mentioned i intervened at second reading of this bill and it is not my intention to speak in opposition to its third reading particularly as a committee has sat for five complete days and gone into this matter exhaustively <e> <s> however perhaps i should say that the petitioners have raised with me purely as a member of your lordships house the whole question as to whether or not this matter should have been the subject of a private bill on the grounds that the proposals can be of no benefit to the forest or to the city of london as such <e> <s> it may be of benefit to people in parts of greater london but it cannot be of any benefit to the forest <e> <s> your lordships will he pleased to know that i do not intend to pursue this legal argument and in any case it may have been better for this matter to be raised through the city and corporation of london because as conservators i recognise that they have done a splendid job for the forest over the years <e> <s> i am sure they will continue to do so and even in this particular case they have mitigated any damage to the forest <e> <s> i should like to place on record an appreciation of voluntary bodies which take up matters of this kind because unless we have such bodies we could find ourselves in the hands of planners who leave us with concrete jungles and damage a great deal of our heritage <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether the government accept the report of the eec commission of july that the proportion of gdp spent on central government and local expenditure in britain is the lowest of all nine eec countries and per cent <e> <s> below the eec average <e> <s> and in the light of that what are the governments criteria for determining their own level of public expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords one thing certain is that the governments announcements of the extra charges for gas and electricity were a great bombshell to a vast number of people in our country <e> <s> i am concerned that some noble lords opposite have referred to the gas increases as being per cent <e> <s> spread over three years <e> <s> i may be wrong but my understanding is that the gas charges will be in two stages this year per cent <e> <s> in the coming year and that electricity will be in two stages per cent <e> <s> in the coming year <e> <s> perhaps the noble earl lord gowrie will make this clear in his reply because it is clear that some noble lords opposite disagree with the view that i have just put forward <e>", "<cs> i should like the noble earl to say how we are intervening in steel <e>", "<cs> my lords we have a situation where a moderate trade union has been forced into an industrial dispute for the first time for years <e> <s> we have a situation where a moderate and excellent trade union leader is forced into a situation of threatening to defy a recently i will not say a trumped-up law but a made-up law <e> <s> this surely is a case for intervention if ever there was one but the government are remaining quiet and yet they can deal with this instruction to the gas industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> in view of the general agreement and there seemed to be sympathy in this house when i expressed this view only a few weeks ago as to the usefulness and value of the electoral advisory committee is it not unwise to abolish it particularly as it was only called together as required <e> <s> would it not be better to leave it to be called together because it has proved to be a most useful body for the widest possible consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord stated that the body had not met since and had only been called together as required would it not be best to leave it to be called together as required <e> <s> would he not agree that there is a great difference in consulting political parties or local authority representatives and calling together the conference where they can have the most valuable interchange of opinions <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put one further question <e> <s> as in section of the report on non-departmental bodies there are four questions about their use if i put down a question for written answer because i know the noble lord cannot answer this afternoon will he tell us exactly how these four questions do not fall into line with the value of this body in past years <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down does he agree that in the event of amendments nos <e> <s> a b or c being carried it would be necessary to reconsider the position on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> in the light of what the noble lord has said i shall withdraw the amendment <e> <s> however the noble lord has brought forward some points <e> <s> he says so long as the driver has taken reasonable steps <e> <s> the point i was making in my remarks was what are reasonable steps <e> <s> anybody who has seen a crowd going on a football coach knows that very little can be done reasonably <e> <s> what reasonable steps have been suggested <e> <s> does one search people or announce to <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord say when the practice of issuing that leaflet was commenced <e> <s> i became a pensioner last july but i never received a leaflet and it was two months before i got a pension book <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to thank my noble friend lord kaldor for his stimulating address and for initiating this debate <e> <s> he gave what to me as an ordinary individual was an intelligent persons guide to economics <e> <s> i must also congratulate the two noble lords opposite who have stuck through this debate because for most of the debate they seem to have been deserted by their flock <e> <s> whether that means that they have given up the ghost of trying to work out any solutions or that they are so cocksure about their policies i do not know <e> <s> i must also apologise to the noble lord lord cockfield because i may not be here when he replies since i have a very important engagement which i must attend later on <e>", "<cs> although accepting the explanation of the noble lord could he explain the reason why a district council which is a non-metropolitan district should be excluded <e> <s> in the mets we are all right they are educational authorities <e> <s> while appreciating why the parish councils because of their <e>", "<cs> although i accept the ministers point that the secretary of state may carry out this function we should be careful to put something into the bill now <e> <s> i do not see why we cannot delete this phrase <e> <s> we have had experience of other people being summarily left off boards of governors <e> <s> my wife was a councillor and a member of a board of governors <e> <s> the moment she lost her seat the conservative majority dropped her off the board of governors and she was summarily dismissed <e> <s> we are trying to ensure that the person concerned is a parent of a child at the school <e> <s> it seems sensible for the government to accept our argument because the minister already admits that the secretary of state will adjust the matter in an instrument <e>", "<cs> i just cannot understand the reasoning of the minister on this issue <e> <s> if he regards it as an automatic thing then why not put it in the bill <e> <s> because at the end of the day we could come to the decision that all we need to do is say let us have an education bill and leave everything to either the secretary of state or the minister <e> <s> this ought to be put in because it is a safeguard and the minister himself says that it will actually be carried out <e> <s> therefore why not put it in the bill and be reasonable <e>", "<cs> may i support the noble baroness in this amendment <e> <s> some years ago there was such pressure in the labour party where i was in the west midlands that we had to produce our own memorandum for school governors throughout the whole of the counties of the west midlands <e> <s> this is still necessary and the labour party head office far from being an affluent body runs a correspondence course for school governors and managers <e> <s> that is still continuing and has been going now for a few years <e> <s> our course could only be for those representing local authorities who are labour party members <e> <s> it can do nothing for non-political representatives <e> <s> this would indicate that there is a grave need for school governors to have something of this kind <e> <s> the ilea considers it necessary to have a handbook and i hope that this helpful suggestion will be accepted by the minister <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble baroness would give me some advice <e>", "<cs> subsection refers to <e>", "<cs> i should like if i may to press the noble baroness lady young on the question i asked and which i do not believe she answered <e> <s> perhaps i did not put it very clearly <e> <s> i should like to put it another way <e> <s> in the light of the wording of subsecton is it possible for an authority to exercise its functions in the area of another authority <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say just a few words on this order as it arises from the elections and i was privileged to be one of the ten members who went out to observe the elections over a period of three weeks <e> <s> your lordships will not wish to have a travelogue from me but i think it ought to be placed on record how we arrived at the statement which was made by the delegation before the actual voting took place <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether the noble viscount would agree that commercial management is not always wise and that interest and encouragement by the government may avoid a repetition of management failure which lost us the motor cycle industry <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has said that the report of the national childrens bureau is a matter for them to publish but irrespective of that point will the noble baroness confirm that the statement made by my noble friend baroness bacon is in that report because travelling to the house today i heard on radio that very statement which was made by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i had considered intervening on a previous debate when i saw the words the local authority considers it appropriate to do so but i did not do so in the interests of getting through the business <e> <s> if the government are going to take a hard line and are not going to move even when the minister says there is reason in this matter then the minister ought to be taking another careful look at what is being proposed <e> <s> the minister has said that this proposal was sensible <e> <s> why not put it in the bill so as to give guidance to the local authorities to do the decent thing <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of the members of this select committee may i say how much i appreciate the very fair account which the noble lord lord ampthill has given of the proceedings and the general summary of the select committee <e> <s> may i also say this is my first experience of a select committee how much i appreciated the firm but very fair chairmanship of the noble lord himself <e> <s> i am certain all noble lords will join with me in regretting the very sad death of lord hamnett who was a member of this committee <e> <s> i knew cyril hamnett long before i came into this house and i have always been impressed by his quiet fair manner and the sincerity with which he held his views <e> <s> in presenting my views to the house i should like to feel that i am reflecting his views as well as my own <e> <s> he was a first-class committee man and i am certain the house will badly miss the value of his services <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain the house for very long since the noble lord lord bellwin has given a lucid explanation of the order which frankly proposes a very sensible arrangement <e> <s> in saying that we on this side of the house do not necessarily <e>", "<cs> my lords i could support many of the criticisms and apprehensions of my noble friend lord hatch of lusby in his opening speech but i shall not do so primarily because i think we ought to be looking at the present position in zimbabwe and to the future <e> <s> also as i made no comments on the elections except to their success i will not make a criticism of what took place on many sides during the period of the election <e> <s> however i should like to make one comment <e> <s> reference has been <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> could i ask him whether he recalls that on th december in answer to a somewhat similar question he intimated that these matters are under constant review <e> <s> could he indicate the results of any recent review <e> <s> does he not agree that the amount of tax evasion is still so high as to be a matter of great concern that some people are not meeting their responsibilities while the great mass of citizens of this country have only one source of income <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that it is very difficult to publish figures as to the number of people who are guilty of evasion because the only figures that can be published are of those that are found out <e> <s> can the noble lord give us figures as to the amount which the inland revenue estimate is lost by evasion <e>", "<cs> i wish to move amendment no <e> <s> and also to speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> both these amendments are concerned with the same principle <e>", "<cs> i will speak on amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> provides for the amount of the permitted earnings to be increased from the existing a week to a week <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady young referred to the fact that in her brief there was a technical reason for rejecting the amendment <e> <s> would she give the rest of the committee the advantage of that technical information <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has said that this would be spelled out in regulations <e> <s> but i should like to put it to the minister that if it is to he spelled out in regulations why cannot he accept the amendment <e> <s> it seems logical to me that the amendment covers the very point which he made <e> <s> however if the regulations are to attempt to spell out every single urgent case there will be some cases that will not be covered <e> <s> either we must have an escape clause leaving discretion to the officers concerned or we shall find that certain hardship cases will arise because we have tried to spell it all out in some detail <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> he said that the scale of payments are intended to cover normal clothing requirements <e> <s> how many people who are in receipt of supplementary benefit will find it possible to meet normal clothing requirements from their normal-scale receipts <e> <s> i could give personal examples of people i know <e> <s> one such person a young teacher is very close to me <e> <s> prior to clegg his eldest boy had to have a clothing allowance quite apart from someone who is on supplementary benefit <e> <s> therefore i still think that my principle is the correct one <e> <s> before deciding whether to withdraw my amendment i should like to ask the noble lord this question <e> <s> in the earlier part of his speech he said that the government are considering a change in the categories <e> <s> then towards the end of the speech he said that they think the three categories are sufficient <e> <s> are they suggesting a change or is it intended to keep the present three categories <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw this amendment but we should like to have a further look at this situation because we still believe that it is not possible to meet clothing needs from the supplementary benefit <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness but could she just tell me who will give the guidance to the benefits officers <e> <s> she said that the benefits officers will be expected to rely upon case law that has been built up and also the document <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i support what has been said about the supplementary benefits commission reports <e> <s> there will be this gap <e> <s> the important thing is that it was an independent commission <e> <s> its reports were independent and sometimes critical of legislation and even of what the government of the day might be proposing <e> <s> i am certain that the committee will be pleased to learn from the noble baroness that the secretary of state says that he intends to ensure the independence of the chief supplementary benefits officer <e> <s> but surely that independence should not go so far as he deciding whether or not he will produce a report <e> <s> surely it is up to parliament to say whether it wants to have a report and he should be completely independent and free to produce it <e> <s> that is the most important aspect of this matter <e>", "<cs> i wish to support my noble friend in what he said in moving the amendment <e> <s> time after time upon clause after clause ministers in replying to criticism have made quite clear that the details of claimants benefits and other matters will he fully published <e> <s> before the noble lord the minister replies i wish to <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that this amendment is misconceived and endeavoured to argue a logical case <e> <s> i may be an ignorant man but i could not follow the logic <e> <s> it seemed to be that merely because something is done somewhere else we must do it in this case <e> <s> in view of the facts of the delay and the backlog of appeals that i outlined i hope that this matter will be given consideration <e> <s> i know that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor will act as he thinks fit and in the best interests but equally this committee has a right to decide what it will do <e> <s> nevertheless we will give the matter further consideration and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i completely agree with the noble baroness but i should be very surprised if the government could not say that they have certain things in mind now <e> <s> from my knowledge of how government departments work there is a panel of persons already under consideration <e>", "<cs> in the light of the noble lords reply i will withdraw but it is our purpose to make the very best of a bad job which this bill is making <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down is he able to tell the house on which departments or authoritys advice the government decided to drop the car and van question <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the noble lord lord bellwin for his very clear and comprehensive review of the contents of this bill <e> <s> may i also add the hope as a fellow first-timer that i may be as successful in demolishing his arguments as he was in putting them up <e> <s> in our view this bill will have grave consequences for the future of our public bus services and it would seem that in their enthusiasm for relaxation of licensing and their desire for free-for-all competition the government are ignoring the serious effects of some of their proposals <e> <s> it would seem that the attack on bureaucracy which the noble lord lord bellwin has mentioned is an excuse for all sorts of things which should not be put forward <e> <s> at the committee stage we shall seek to ensure that the worst features of this bill are removed or amended <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord did not my lords <e> <s> it shows the achievements of a publicly owned industry <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord reads the report tomorrow he will find that i referred to both the minimum distance and the minimum passenger journey <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the whole house will be grateful to the noble lord lord cullen for his moving this modification to the order and particularly for the frank way in which he did so <e> <s> when this order was originally before this house a number of noble lords questioned whether or not the government had had correct advice <e> <s> it is clear from what the noble lord has said that the advice given at the time was wrong <e> <s> it was absolutely clear to many of us particularly from these benches that this is a question which should have been asked <e> <s> it would have given valuable information not only to the department but to the local authorities <e> <s> i am grateful that the government have now decided to reconsider the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an unusual clause and we on this side of the house could have moved an amendment to almost every subsection <e> <s> it is not at this stage my purpose to go into another second reading debate but i should like to make just three points <e> <s> first part i of the bill deals with the general question of transport licensing and conditions <e> <s> here i should like to say to noble lords that there will be various provisions in the various clauses and in the amendments which will have some bearing on the rural areas <e> <s> we would like to stress to noble lords i am certain they will take note themselves that it may well be that what appears to be an advantage for rural areas may not be when one looks deeply into it <e> <s> therefore i hope that your lordships will give very careful consideration to the various amendments as they come before the committee <e>", "<cs> it is not just a question of the overloading of the car as the noble lord lord lucas of chil-worth suggested <e> <s> we on this side of the committee are worried that unless the bill is carefully worded there will be an encouragement for commercialisation to enter under a cloak <e> <s> the noble lord lord bellwin said that he does not think that will arise <e> <s> in discussions in another place a number of examples were given of trips to and from heathrow <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the statement of the noble lord lord bellwin that they will take note of what we have said <e> <s> if it was a matter left to he and i i am sure that we should have no problem at all because we would not trouble to charge depreciation or anything <e> <s> under the circumstances we withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i first thank the noble lord lord bellwin for letting a few of us have a note on this clause which has been very helpful and has enabled us in the last few hours to take a very careful look at it <e> <s> i must ask is this a public transport decision or is it a decision in an endeavour to get more revenue for education in the light of the rejection of the proposal regarding school transport <e> <s> when that decision was taken to remove the proposal to charge for school transport we believed that we would have the <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that he was speaking to a number of <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me to intervene i appreciate his explanation but i should like to know this in what locality would a local bus service apply <e> <s> would it be the area of the education authority <e> <s> if so that is not made clear in the bill <e> <s> or would it be a local bus service anywhere <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bellwin has said that this is a minor matter with the number of vehicles involved <e> <s> i am sure your lordships would agree that it would not matter if only half a dozen were involved <e> <s> we all know that there have in recent years been a number of most unfortunate accidents affecting public service vehicles and we cannot play ducks and drakes when we are moving passengers about <e> <s> the noble lord said the commissioners would hardly give a licence <e> <s> well why have we got in the present provisions in the education miscellaneous provisions act that before consent is given to an education authority to use its bus to pick up children other than those who are being taken free the commissioners must be satisfied that there are no other transport facilities available <e> <s> that is the instruction now <e>", "<cs> in england and wales <e> <s> why is there any doubt about putting that in the new clause so as to give a direction to the commissioners as to exactly what they should do <e> <s> i cannot see why <e> <s> we are looking at it from that angle <e>", "<cs> in the light of what the noble lord has said we shall read very carefully the words that he used when we have the <e>", "<cs> in view of the generous gesture by the noble lord lord bellwin that he will give this matter consideration we will withdraw this amendment <e> <s> i am not a legal expert but you will notice that the words used in paragraph ii are

light of the reservations he made but as a new clause will be presented on report i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should mention that although reference has been made to amendment no <e> <s> i have not spoken on no <e> <s> because it is a separate principle <e> <s> i have been dealing solely with the principle contained in nos <e> <s> and which have the same wording <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord has said that while the government in their proposals are determined to sweep away controls and restrictions we on this side are apprehensive of that and apprehensive of freedom <e> <s> what i thought we had made absolutely clear time and time again is that what we are apprehensive about is damaging the general network of public services <e> <s> that is what we are concerned with and that is what will worry people living in the rural areas <e> <s> as i said when i spoke on clause although you gain in a limited way in one direction you may do immense damage to the network of public services in this country which is a credit to this country and the envy of the world <e> <s> that is what we are worried about and i hope it will be seen in that context <e>", "<cs> naturally i would be challenged in your lordships house if i said that they definitely will be damaged <e> <s> what i am saying is that there is a possibility and if there is a possibility then we have to avoid it <e> <s> it all depends on the circumstances in the area it all depends on the effectiveness of the transport service in that area and it depends on whether that particular route is one which is being run by cross-subsidisation <e> <s> i know that noble lords opposite do not like us constantly talking about cross-subsidisation but this is something which enables a great number of routes in the rural areas to be run <e> <s> they may be damaged and we want to avoid that possibility <e>", "<cs> there is obviously no difference between us about the necessity for publication as i said earlier <e> <s> for the life of me i just cannot understand why as the noble lord lord lucas said if there is no disagreement these four or five simple words should not be put into the bill <e> <s> the government have put down amendments to their own bill <e> <s> this is another one which they might have slipped in having left it out by mistake <e> <s> it is such a simple little thing and it makes the position quite clear <e> <s> why leave this to be dealt with solely by regulation when by putting in these few words everybody would be completely happy because we are in complete agreement about the need for publication <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord is saying quite definitely that the government see that there is a case for looking at some improved procedure and he also gives an assurance that the industry will be consulted we shall be quite happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in the light of what the minister said previously and the withdrawal on that occasion i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to make just one point <e> <s> if the noble lord and other noble lords opposite will look at clause dealing with certain excursions and tours he will see that there are clear instructions given to the traffic commissioners that the proposed service would not compete directly with any other road service for which a licence has been granted <e> <s> it is good enough to put it in that clause let us put it in this one which is an even more important clause and affects all stage bus services <e> <s> in no circumstances can we withdraw this very important amendment <e>", "<cs> the point made by the noble viscount lord simon is covered by the amendment stating <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should apologise to the committee <e> <s> it is my intention not to move amendment no <e> <s> because it was consequential <e> <s> what i have spoken on is actually amendment no <e> <s> which i should now like to move if that is acceptable to the committee <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is in fact not moved <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that this matter has been discussed in another place but of course that does not debar us from discussing it <e> <s> we can make improvements which the other place has missed <e> <s> in fact even the government are doing that judging by the number of amendments of them to the bill that they have proposed <e> <s> so it is possible that we have found something that is wrong <e> <s> i accept the assurance of the noble lord that this matter will be covered in regulations but if one looks through the bill one finds that the very provision for which we are asking here is written into other clauses that the commissioners should not do this unless they consider objections and other representations <e> <s> whenever we ask that that should be included in the bill in the same way that it has been included by the government in other clauses we are told no <e> <s> the matter is as simple as that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bellwin is in his most persuasive mood <e> <s> i am delighted to see it <e> <s> i follow the point that the noble lord lord teviot made <e> <s> the question of years does not arise <e> <s> there was not the supplementary transport grant years ago there were not then county council transport policy plans <e> <s> they came into operation only in recent years <e> <s> that is why this amendment was put down <e> <s> therefore we hope that the government will consider it from that angle <e> <s> we are <e>", "<cs> i am certain that we from this side would be very grateful to the noble lord for the readiness he has displayed to have another look at this otherwise frankly we would have had to decide not to withdraw the amendment because we would want to go on record as regards the governments attitude on <e>", "<cs> i am sorry the noble lord feels that he cannot accept this and i would just draw attention to some words in the amendment <e>", "<cs> on this occasion we on this side of the committee cannot accept the full proposition put forward by the noble lord lord teviot and the noble lord lord morris <e> <s> we can readily understand the proposal but it appears to us that this is not the way to deal with the problem with which they feel they are confronted <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> i am sorry but it is a separate principle which i should like to deal with separately if i may <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is concerned with simplifying licensing procedures for excursions or tours within the -mile radius <e> <s> the longer tours are now of course to be completely de-licensed <e> <s> clause <e>", "<cs> i am referring to the question of excursions and tours paragraph <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton for his assurance that he will have a careful look at the matter <e> <s> we too will look at it with our advisers and when we come to report if the government feel they cannot move on it we may then have to consider the position <e> <s> in the light of the noble lords assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i find it very difficult to follow the logic in the governments case in relation to the bill <e> <s> on the previous amendment the argument was that we could safely leave this matter to the commissioners <e> <s> that is what i want to do <e> <s> let us leave it to the commissioners <e> <s> we should take out the word directly and the commissioners can then decide whether direct competition is injurious or whether indirect competition <e>", "<cs> with all due respect to the noble lord this is a separate matter <e> <s> that is why i wanted the two issues discussed separately <e> <s> previously we were discussing solely whether or not the commissioners should be bound to give a licence in the case of an excursion or tour <e> <s> we dealt with that thanks to the attitude adopted by the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton <e> <s> the present amendment deals with another instruction to the commissioners that they shall take into consideration only direct competition <e> <s> all we are saying in the amendment is that the word directly should be left out and the commissioners could then take into consideration whether there is competition direct or indirect <e> <s> that would appear to me to be a most sensible matter for us to leave to the commissioners to decide <e> <s> we shall not press the matter to a division but i do not propose to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords instead of this pinpricking type of question would not the noble and learned lord agree that it would be better if the government got down to the real reason why millions of workers are dissatisfied with conditions today and why millions of workers are taking action and losing a days pay in order to put their point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that there have been meetings throughout the country in factories and depots which have decided what free action the individual trade unionists will take today <e> <s> would he not also agree and this does not apply to him that the levity cynicism and jocularity with which this matter has been discussed in your lordships house might have made many people change their views as to what they would do today if they had heard those remarks previously <e>", "<cs> the question has been raised of the position of our partners in the eec <e> <s> i must ask another question <e> <s> what are the relative values of a greater commitment to our european partners on a policy a policy on which there has been no evidence at all advanced this afternoon that it will be adequate and no denial that it may be even harmful to our own economic position to the steps that we ought to take as adherents to the charter of the united nations <e> <s> i may be old-fashioned and i hope not but i believe that if we fail to take every opportunity to use the channel of the united nations this country is helping to move towards international anarchy no matter what might be the sound objectives at which we are aiming <e>", "<cs> it is with pleasure that i support the noble lord lord teviot in the amendment that he has moved <e> <s> as he has rightly said the effect of the two amendments in his name and that of the noble lord lord morris is precisely the same as the effect of the amendment which stands in my name and that of my noble friends <e>", "<cs> i know the noble lord lord bellwin is trying to be very helpful but really what different word can there be which conveys what we want <e> <s> instead of notify there could be inform there could be intimate <e> <s> but they have nothing to do with consultation there can be no other word but consultation <e> <s> therefore much as i should like to agree to withdraw i do not think we possibly can on this occasion <e> <s> if it is suggested that these words should not be put into the bill why is it necessary to put into the bill under clause to which the noble lord referred that operators must give information to local authorities and district councils <e> <s> if that is going to be done automatically why put that into the bill <e> <s> schedule on page says that they must notify district councils <e> <s> if there is going to be this automatic goodwill why put that into the bill <e> <s> it is put into the bill to make certain that it is done <e> <s> therefore we want this put into the bill the district councils want it put into the bill as my noble friend lord mishcon has said to safeguard the situation <e> <s> therefore much as i should like to be helpful on this occasion i think we must insist on this amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his comments and my noble friend for his concern but i have to say <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is being extremely helpful <e> <s> even before he got up i was going to surprise him by saying that he had been helpful so far as he had gone because what we are arguing about is not the minimum period of a trial area being two years or the maximum period of a trial area being five years <e> <s> what the bill says is that the period for the trial area can be a minimum of two or a maximum of five years and whatever period is designated it cannot be revoked before then <e> <s> if the noble lord is saying that he will give serious consideration to writing into the bill i do not mind <e>", "<cs> i accept the point made by the noble lord that if at report we do get an amendment to clause which permits earlier revocation than the maximum period contained in an order these three amendments may be affected <e> <s> under the circumstances we wish at this stage to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we will look carefully at what the noble lord has said when we reach the report stage <e> <s> there is just one point i should like to make now let us say that the order was for five years and it is revoked after two years that means that he will have the continuation of his licence for another three years <e> <s> that is what we are worried about but in the light of what the noble lord has said we will see what comes forward on report and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that offer and in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in the light of the assurances that have been given i shall withdraw the amendment <e> <s> however we shall of course wish to ensure that the industry will be consulted before the regulations are drawn <e> <s> i gather from the noble lords opposite that they are both nodding their heads in agreement <e> <s> in the light of that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in those circumstances might i be permitted not to move the amendment and perhaps the noble lord will check the position for me because if it is still possible for us to move this amendment despite amendment no <e> <s> being carried we should wish to do so <e> <s> we feel very strongly about this <e> <s> having said that i do not wish to move the amendment <e>", "<cs> in the light of what the noble lord has said i shall withdraw this amendment on the assurance i understood he was giving that first there will be discussion with the operators <e>", "<cs> and secondly that it is not the intention to omit operators premises for testing stations <e> <s> i should add that one reason that one wants to be clear on that is because of the suspicions maybe suspicions that should not be there in the transport industry that the government will not permit operators premises to be used unless they take the form of official testing stations to which other operators must be allowed to bring their vehicles <e> <s> if that is to be looked at as well we shall be happy to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the ministers offer and i gather he is saying that if it cannot be included in the bill he will ask the secretary of state to look into the general problem <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i was unable fully to follow the case put forward by the noble lord <e> <s> i am not saying that he did not put the case extremely well but he referred to the eec directive on this matter and so i should prefer to withdraw the amendment so that we can consider what the noble lord has said and perhaps study the eec directive <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his detailed reply which will enable us in the <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord and delighted that <e>", "<cs> at this hour when noble lords are suffering from exhaustion if not hunger i will not delay the committee on this matter <e> <s> i am sorry the minister seemed to imply that this is an unimportant issue <e> <s> it could be very important to the individual <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to see this amendment because in effect it brings in the district councils which is what we have tried to do by proposed amendments <e> <s> therefore we express great appreciation to the government for bringing in this amendment <e> <s> but in view of what appears to us to be a conflict <e>", "<cs> there is just one minor point <e> <s> when we discussed this in conjunction with amendment no <e> <s> i raised the question of the definition of local bus service that appears halfway down on page of the marshalled list <e> <s> while the definition is given here the point i raised was whether or not the local bus service was to be in the locality covered by the education authority or whether it could be anywhere <e> <s> it would appear to me that that needs to be clearly defined one way or the other otherwise there could be quite a lot of controversy and argument later on <e> <s> we of course would prefer it to be within the area of the education authority <e> <s> it needs to be defined <e>", "<cs> i wish to thank the noble lord for his explanation <e> <s> when we first heard the noble lord lord bellwin mention the possibility that the introduction of an amendment was in mind we were frankly apprehensive <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that kind gesture <e> <s> i should like to make one final point before i leave the matter <e> <s> the noble lord said lets see how it works <e> <s> however there could be a fatal accident while we are seeing how it works <e> <s> even if there were only one accident it could be a great tragedy it could ruin a scheme and it could lead to loss of life <e> <s> therefore we hope that the matter will be looked at very carefully <e>", "<cs> this clause deals with the abolition of the need for conductors licences <e> <s> it may seem rather a small matter but when i have explained a few points your lordships will see that it could be of some consequence <e> <s> first i wonder whether or not there have been consultations with the union which covers the personnel involved <e> <s> the transport and general workers union which covers a great number of these personnel has made certain points quite clear to me <e> <s> it is concerned that the conductors licence which is at present required gives some partial protection to conductors <e> <s> it gives them a greater authority to collect fares <e> <s> the union feels that the absence of a licence could expose a conductor to a greater degree of assault from those who seek to avoid paying fares <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to learn from the noble lord that the amendment cannot be accepted because one would have thought that this would fit in with the very thing which the government seek that is the widest possible competition <e> <s> i simply cannot understand why british rail should be the one body that is precluded <e> <s> i do not know whether or not british rail has made representations to the ministers noble friend the secretary of state but i do know that the right honourable albert booth member <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has explained quite definitely that some services outside the trial areas will lose government grants <e> <s> what he has not <e>", "<cs> i will take note of what the minister has said and look at this more carefully in the <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for explaining why we cannot be helpful to him <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry to hear what the noble lord has had to say because i am sure that the whole committee will wish to see in undertakings of this kind that there are not only satisfactory industrial relations but also opportunities to consult with the appropriate unions on the workings and efficiency of the company <e> <s> in the past when companies have been transferred or broken up maybe under separate public ownership we have been able to maintain these provisions <e> <s> but in the light of what the noble lord has said it is clear that there is no intention of including this in the bill <e> <s> therefore we shall read very carefully what he has had to say in the <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry to have to be critical because the noble lord has been so helpful and co-operative on other matters <e> <s> but i am surprised that in the light of this amendment frankly the department has not supplied the minister with the figures as to the number of personnel in the corporation and its subsidiaries who are engaged on research and development work particularly in view of the praise from a number of places that has been given to this development work <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly intervene because i think the noble lord said that one reason why the government wanted to change their policy on the freight corporation was because it has made so many losses over recent years <e> <s> i have been looking quickly at the report of the freight corporation for the last months <e> <s> there was a trading profit in of million <e> <s> this was an increase of million over the previous year <e> <s> profit on trading has risen by some million over the past three years <e> <s> i believe that some five years ago there was a loss but ever since due to their forward-looking policy and forward-looking management there have been consistent profits <e> <s> therefore that appears to be a very bad argument that the noble lord has put forward <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord cannot accept the amendment <e> <s> his reference to the schedule related to the obligations at present existing it has got nothing to do with the position of employees who are to be transferred as a result of the disposal of the national freight corporation <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord used the words stifling restrictions because we are talking about compensation for employees who suffer not as a result of <e>", "<cs> it was not my intention to intervene but the noble lord the minister has compelled me to do so <e> <s> i rise to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord teviot <e> <s> noble lords will realise that we have been critical of some aspects and we are very pleased that the noble lord the minister agreed to look at a number of these otherwise i would have taken part in the discussion on whether clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> however the minister has agreed to look into certain aspects of that clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i always find it a delight to listen to my noble friend lady gaitskell because she brings sincerity and humanity to these matters and that is what we are really dealing with <e> <s> the noble baroness the minister was very honest when she made it quite clear in her opening speech that the purpose of this bill is primarily financial <e> <s> at one time it was my intention to tear up my notes and to follow my noble friend lord wells-pestell in making an appeal to the consciences of noble lords in this house but on reflection i thought it best to deal with some of the points in this bill in order to indicate that we have arguments as well as a feeling of sentiment as to what it is correct to do in these matters <e> <s> it has often been said that the test of a civilised society is how it looks after the children the aged the sick and the needy <e> <s> have we really reached such an economic state and i will come to this question when i close my remarks that we can survive only by hitting the needy in our society <e> <s> because that is what this bill is doing <e> <s> i am certain that the minister cannot be very happy at having to introduce some of the proposals that are in this bill <e>", "<cs> i am pleased that the noble lord who has just spoken has picked up some of the points on the amendment <e> <s> i should like to do that rather than to speak on generalities <e> <s> taking up some of the points in the amendment i should like to ask how the members or the per cent <e> <s> will actually give the notice <e>", "<cs> that is not in the amendment either <e> <s> i am not a lawyer but my reading of the amendment is that if the certification officer receives this written request he must conduct a ballot whether the union has ballot rules or not <e> <s> that is a recipe for trouble not for industrial order but for disorder <e> <s> let us say that at the time he receives this request which he must carry out and i agree that it seems to be mandatory the question that he will decide and there is no suggestion that he will consult the union about this question is very embarrassing to the situation of negotiations that are taking place and that publicity on this matter would be extremely harmful the certification officer must conduct the ballot <e> <s> he has no option he will decide the question <e> <s> it seems to me that although there may be good intentions behind the amendment it is highly dangerous and far from helping the situation will make it more inflammatory <e>", "<cs> if i may have the indulgence of your lordships i should like to make sure that the official record is absolutely clear because it would be wrong if i remained silent and gave the impression that i was completely in favour of the principle behind this amendment <e> <s> i am not <e> <s> i said that my remarks were not to be generalities <e> <s> i believe the best way to destroy an amendment is to attack the actual wording of it and what is proposed <e> <s> that is what i attempted to do but basically i am opposed to the principle <e> <s> i said it would be a disaster to industrial relations <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of some of the remarks that i am to say to the noble lords the ministers later i must say in connection with this amendment and amendment no <e> <s> c with which the noble lord lord bellwin associated it that we complain that the first we saw of it was when we arrived here this morning and consulted the marshalled list and the supplementary marshalled list <e> <s> this is a very important matter and it requires the most careful consideration <e> <s> from what the noble lord has said it seems that it is all right but to a great extent we shall be guided by what the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth says about it since he moved the original amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not the most important amendment before us nevertheless it is an important one <e> <s> the minister refers to operators tricking by going round a tortuous route <e> <s> those are the words the minister used in committee <e> <s> if one looks at the example that i gave and it is in the <e>", "<cs> my lords what we are concerned about is that we do not want to give the impression that we do not want the commissioners to act in this matter <e> <s> i am certain that having heard the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton amplify the letter that was sent to us it will be on the official record it will be noted and the commissioners will undoubtedly take note <e> <s> we do not want it to be in the negative <e> <s> it is the governments view that they should act where it is necessary <e> <s> on that basis i withdraw the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always anxious to accept good advice that is given to me but most of the reply of the noble lord the minister has dealt with the legal argument as to what is a special event and a special occasion <e> <s> the purpose of our amendment is to avoid that legal argument by taking out those words altogether <e> <s> the noble lord said that there has been litigation <e> <s> that proves the very point that we have been trying to make that there is a possibility of litigation in interpreting special event and special occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords the point just made by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran is not what we are seeking in this amendment <e> <s> we are not seeking perpetuity <e> <s> what we are suggesting is an administrative item when a licence is granted and if the commissioners in their wisdom have not thought to specify a date at which it would end it means they are pretty satisfied with the application and therefore it will continue until it is either revoked or suspended by the commissioners which they would have power to do <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear from the fact that no other noble lords wish to take part in the debate that we are not likely to get very far if we press this matter <e> <s> may i just say that we are not proposing to take matters out of the local authorities hands except where the minister is satisfied that things <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene the noble lord referred to a maximum period we are saying that no order shall be revoked before a minimum period of two years <e>", "<cs> my lords if the argument is finely balanced i hope we may be able to shift the balance in the right direction <e> <s> perhaps it is our fault that we have not explained it simply enough but three noble lords who have spoken have not understood the point of the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord nugent said that operators must be protected that there must be a longer period than two years <e> <s> we are not arguing about that <e> <s> the amended provision would read <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it very difficult to understand the ministers reasoning on this matter <e> <s> this is absolutely new <e> <s> the experimental areas act was nothing like this but there the maximum period was two years a period of two years was laid down in that act <e> <s> the relaxation of licensing was nothing like what is being proposed here <e> <s> complete relaxation is proposed here except for what is called co-ordination by the local authority but obviously the local authority will do very little co-ordination <e>", "<cs> my lords it is fairly clear that the government are not going to move on this matter <e> <s> we will not ask the house to divide but since once again a question of principle is involved we will not withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i would agree with the noble baroness my lords <e> <s> that is one of the problems of the trial areas experiment which is not our problem but is a problem relating to the relieving of all road service licensing in those areas <e> <s> the government wish to have complete free competition for as many operators as wish to enter subject to some form of co-ordination by the county council <e> <s> all we are saying is that surely it is asking too much that one operator shall tell another operator exactly what he is doing thus enabling the other man to intensify the competition <e> <s> that is what would happen and we consider it unreasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that i am very grateful to the noble lord the minister for his acceptance of this amendment <e> <s> it has proved that we can put a reasonable case and that he can put a reasonable acceptance <e> <s> i am very grateful to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord the minister and in the light of that assurance i beg leave to withdraw these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to see the amendment put down by the noble lord lord bellwin <e> <s> he gave an assurance that he would be introducing an amendment <e> <s> i am not only pleased that he has done so but that he has done so in the terms in which it is before us <e> <s> i had put down an amendment but on receiving information about this amendment mine was withdrawn and does not appear on the marshalled list <e> <s> i have pleasure in supporting the government amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i must deal with this amendment in relation to the clause as it stands not as i hope it will be after we have dealt with the next amendment which no doubt will be taken after we have adjourned <e> <s> as it is at present all the safety provisions are being excluded yet the proposal under <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first deal with the comments made by the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth <e> <s> i am relatively new to this house but i am certain that the procedure that we have adopted on this clause is proper <e> <s> when we debated this in committee we debated an amendment to introduce a new clause <e> <s> we had no chance to put down amendments on the safety provisions <e> <s> the whole matter was discussed as a new clause a new scheme and a new innovation <e> <s> admittedly in the debate from this dispatch box we put certain queries and reservations about safety <e> <s> however the principle before the committee was the new clause the new experiment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wanted to give the minister an opportunity to make that statement <e> <s> that is important because the traffic commissioners will have to consider applications and they should appreciate that it is not the wish of this house that education authorities should make applications outside their areas <e> <s> in view of the noble lords remarks i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of that readiness to consider this amendment along with the previous amendment i shall beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> but make no mistake about it my lords we on these benches are so concerned with the safety provision that if after reflection and after the minister has discussed the matter with his colleagues the government feel that they can do nothing about it we shall use the third reading in its right way and will bring forward amendments on this matter and on that relating to the school system to ensure that for the good of the public of this country the safety provisions are introduced <e> <s> with those words i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the firm attitude of the government i will not press the issue to a division but we do not propose to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i must disagree with the last two <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord the minister and in view of his statement i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he answer <e>", "<cs> my lords is it amendment no <e> <s> with which we are dealing <e>", "<cs> then we have agreed amendment no <e>

the view of the scottish development agency and the highlands development board and is this not a case where if private industry cannot solve what is really a social necessity of the area there is possibly a case for public industry <e>", "<cs> both today and when your lordships last debated this matter we moved a whole series of amendments and we do not think we have made anything like sufficient progress with them to put ourselves in the position where we need not oppose this clause <e> <s> indeed we still believe the clause to be fundamentally unnecessary <e> <s> it should never be lost sight of that so far as exclusions or expulsions are concerned the position is considerably dealt with by the existing common law and the government have done nothing to explain what the relationship will be under the new situation between the decisions of the industrial tribunals arising out of clause and the jurisdiction of the common law courts arising out of their practice of regarding the trade union rule book as a contract between members <e>", "<cs> can we bring the debate back to the actual point of the clause <e> <s> despite what the minister has <e>", "<cs> it was not my intention to speak on this amendment but in view of the remarks that have been made about this amendment wasting the time of the committee frankly i felt compelled to do so <e> <s> we are talking about the position of a dismissed employee in relation to a tribunal <e> <s> it seems to me most unfortunate that whenever a question is raised from this side of the committee the balance is always shifted in one direction <e> <s> that is what is happening on this occasion <e>", "<cs> i must disagree with what my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby said because he did not understand what i said <e> <s> conscience is in and we wanted it in for the very <e>", "<cs> i will reply to people in the same way as they talk to me be they noble friends or opponents and i replied to my noble friend in like manner <e> <s> what frankly we are mainly concerned with is industrial peace and having made certain that we have conscience in and having made it clear that religious belief is in we go on to deal with the question of a deeply-held personal conviction <e> <s> nobody has dealt with the fact that deeply-held personal conviction is so sweeping and wide that all sorts of meanings could be attached to it and instead of industrial peace we should have trouble on the shop floor <e> <s> that is our concern and i thought the whole committee was concerned to do something to promote industrial peace <e>", "<cs> i think that we will deal with the amendment on principle as it stands <e> <s> what the noble and learned lord says is perfectly correct there may be a change of view on the part of some people in the same way that the government have changed their view from the act <e> <s> but it is something that we <e>", "<cs> i must say something on this in view of the remarks of the noble earl lord gowrie <e> <s> time and time again we have had quoted to us in various debates the remarks of my noble friends lord houghton of sowerby and lady burton of coventry <e> <s> frankly i will give second place to no one in my opposition to certain things that have happened in recent years <e> <s> as my noble friends have said we oppose violence and intimidation <e> <s> to attempt to divide the committee as if some of us do believe in violence and others do not <e>", "<cs> it may not have been what the noble earl said but that was the implication <e> <s> otherwise there would be no need to refer continually to the remarks of my noble friends <e> <s> i am <e>", "<cs> my noble friend did say that he would be asking me to deal with the question of the numbers and the problem involved in invalidity benefit <e> <s> i think your lordships will agree that it is important we get this matter clarified quite early on in consideration of this bill <e> <s> it will be recalled that on second reading i referred to there being persons on invalidity benefit and i mentioned a communication from the royal association for disability and <e>", "<cs> i am surprised that the minister said that these were desirable changes <e> <s> i thought the argument had been put forward that these were undesirable changes which were necessary not that they were desirable changes <e>", "<cs> it was my intention to ask precisely what was the purpose of this particular clause but the noble earl lord de la warr seems to have given the answer <e> <s> in the second reading debate it was emphasised by the noble baroness that one of the purposes was to ensure that the unions accepted some responsibility for their members and made a contribution <e> <s> the noble earl lord de la warr emphasised the damage done to the country by strikes and whether he intended this or not the inference was that we are going to punish the unions for doing it <e>", "<cs> i am prepared to accept what the noble earl says about not punishing the unions but as i try to explain how i look at this i think he will <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for carrying out the undertaking which he gave at the report stage which led me to withdraw the amendments in the names of myself and my noble friends and to say how much we welcome the amendments now before the house <e>", "<cs> my lords at the report stage i indicated that i was sorry that over the years this has not been insisted upon <e> <s> if you carry amendment no <e> <s> then of course this would apply when the vehicle in addition to being used for school children is used for fare-paying passengers <e> <s> it is in the hands of your lordships whether you wish to carry amendment no <e> <s> because that would deal with the situation in amendment no <e> <s> as well <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally i am most disappointed at the attitude expressed by the minister on behalf of the government <e> <s> i fully accept that the noble lord is as concerned as any other noble lord with safety <e> <s> however i should like to deal with one or two other points that have been made in the debate before turning to the ministers reply <e> <s> a number of noble lords have stressed that we are dealing with public authorities which know their duties <e> <s> are not ptes public authorities <e> <s> who would ever suggest that a pte could put a bus on the road without having to meet the requirements regarding a public service vehicle drivers licence simply because it happened to be a public authority <e> <s> the national bus company in a way is a public authority <e> <s> the scottish transport group is a public authority <e> <s> yet it is suggested that this is the one case in which because the bodies concerned happen to be local authorities the requirement <e>", "<cs> my lords the very fact that these may be volunteers makes the position even more serious <e> <s> while we do not want to deter people from volunteering we must be very careful because these are large vehicles which will be travelling in busy streets <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not the purpose of this amendment to endeavour to set up any arguments between the private hire trade and the taxi-cab trade <e> <s> we are endeavouring as are the government in their clause to make it clear that nobody misrepresents a vehicle to be a taxi when it is not <e> <s> if my remarks are read carefully in the <e>", "<cs> my lords logic is on our side <e> <s> i hope that that will be taken into consideration when this review takes place <e> <s> in the light of the ministers statement that he will discuss this too with his right honourable friend and colleagues and that this review will take into consideration what i believe to be the logic of the argument i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as my colleague says it would give the parliamentary draftsman some activity <e> <s> there are other colloquial expressions one sometimes finds in bills <e> <s> i hope that this matter will also be included in the general review of signs on vehicles <e> <s> if that is the understanding in the light of what he has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first express warm thanks to the noble lord lord bellwin for the courteous and efficient way he has handled all stages of this bill <e> <s> he has shown courtesy in all directions and has been extremely helpful <e> <s> as i mentioned in a previous debate i and my colleagues are very grateful for the various exchanges of correspondence with the minister <e> <s> i only wish that he had a better bill on which to bite his teeth <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord two simple questions <e> <s> reference was made to the per cent <e> <s> at which it would be possible for a sitting tenant to negotiate a private sale <e> <s> has any survey been conducted to achieve the figure of per cent <e> <s> or is it something that has been gathered as perhaps being possible <e> <s> was there a survey <e> <s> secondly i know he will deal with the financial implications later but this does affect this particular issue now <e> <s> what will be the effect on local authority housing finances if houses are sold at very low cost <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies i wonder whether i could follow up this particular point <e> <s> we are being told at the present time that local authorities must do everything possible to keep within financial limits and here we have a case where due to inflation because we must assume that inflation is continuing at the particular time we could easily find ourselves with house prices having gone up per cent <e> <s> in a period of two years and yet here we have a contract which is to be kept at the original purchase price agreed two years previously <e> <s> we are always being told by noble lords opposite that public authorities should be looking at things on a commercial basis <e> <s> it seems that everything possible is being done in this bill to ensure that those persons who wish to buy are going to get every opportunity which is not open to people in other spheres <e>", "<cs> my lords briefly may i say how much we appreciate the amendment made in the commons <e> <s> this <e>", "<cs> i should like to comment on one or two things that the noble baroness said <e> <s> she made it clear that the reason for the per cent <e> <s> abatement is the question of the benefits not being taxed <e> <s> there is no argument about that at least as far as i am concerned <e> <s> the noble baroness will be pleased to know that i am not going to argue figures again <e> <s> but once again we must face the fact that a very large proportion of these short benefit claimants either do not pay tax or will not pay anywhere near the per cent <e> <s> abatement <e> <s> therefore that makes the position of the shortfall of even greater concern to those people <e> <s> i hope that point is going to be considered when noble lords vote upon this <e> <s> the noble baroness also commented about the secretary of states assurance <e> <s> i may be wrong on this if i am no doubt the noble baroness will correct <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has given her explanation but it still does not meet the point that there will be this shortfall <e> <s> when the government took their decisions there could be no argument that this proposal was an economic necessity i am not talking now about the per cent <e> <s> abatement <e> <s> nor could it be said that it was done in order to keep down public borrowing requirements <e> <s> the fact is that the words here are <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment and i wish to emphasise that we are not arguing about the taxation of benefits in relation to the amendment nor are we arguing about the general question of abatement we are discussing solely the position of invalidity payments and their restoration when they come into taxation to the position as of now <e> <s> i would remind the house that this is the first time that invalidity benefits will be out of step with retirement pensions <e> <s> as i said previously on the figures which we accept of the invalidity claimants some either will not pay tax or will be paying less tax than the abatement and we have the assurance of the secretary of state which we accept but which has the qualification as the noble lord lord banks emphasised that it is subject to the availability of resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend in moving this amendment and to draw attention to the fact that the report he has asked for is on both the provisions in this clause that is the change in waiting days for sickness benefit and also the reduction of the period for interruption of unemployment and sickness <e> <s> the reason why i think the house should agree to this report is that these provisions the whole of this bill are put forward on the grounds of economy <e> <s> we are not arguing whether or not that is justified <e> <s> what we need to ascertain is what will be the effects of the provisions in this clause <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter endeavoured to appeal to our consciences on the grounds of the comparison between the better off unemployed f you can use such an expression and the worse off unemployed <e> <s> i would like to know how the noble lord reacted to the appeals we made on this side on the question of the disabled <e> <s> one would imagine that we are talking about people who have got <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister said that he hoped we should not go over the discussions that we had last thursday <e> <s> i am an innocent abroad and it may be that there are experts in the committee but i am wondering how many other noble lords are really confused as i am as to exactly what will be the position of a local authority when it looks at its finances <e> <s> when i raised this question in a previous discussion the minister asked us to leave it until we dealt with the financial implications <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not disposed to take part in this debate until i heard the speech of the noble lord lord robens <e> <s> i believe that the two members from the opposition front bench understand the law of industrial relations and that everything they have tried to put forward is in the interests of better industrial relations <e> <s> i resent any <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for that answer <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down could she explain this to me <e> <s> she mentioned the possibility of extra cost and therefore there must be a limitation but if general practitioners employed secretaries who were not their wives apparently there would be no difficulty in paying the costs <e> <s> is that so <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for that helpful explanation <e> <s> he has elaborated far beyond the explanatory note in the order which is very helpful <e> <s> from what the noble lord has said it would appear that the matter is thoroughly satisfactory from the standpoint of british rail and all we can hope is that as the carriage is of coal and steel it is one way only and that is exports <e>", "<cs> my lords again i would like to thank the noble lord for his very detailed explanation <e> <s> naturally we on this side of the house welcome the first part of the order and as the noble lord says it was stated in the labour governments own white paper in that the bus grant should be phased out by <e> <s> naturally we are very happy with the decision of the government to ensure that it will continue until <e> <s> but we are not happy with the second part of the order which is to phase out the whole grant by <e> <s> perhaps i should elaborate a little on that <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who has no direct or indirect association with northern ireland it may be that i should be hesitant to join in this debate <e> <s> however i believe that those of us who are outside northern ireland have some concern and some responsibility for this problem and on a previous occasion i outlined my own interest in the matter <e> <s> i am certain that all noble lords have listened to the noble duke the duke of abercorn with very great interest because he brought the human side of the reality of the situation in northern ireland to our attention <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate the noble lord lord hunt of tanworth on his maiden speech and to add that as a comparatively new member of your lordships house i soon found that the house was eager to listen to speeches of sincerity of the type that we have heard from the noble lord lord hunt today and which i am certain he will repeat on other occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for repeating this statement <e> <s> i must say that it is an amazing statement because it gives the house very little information as to the governments actual proposals <e> <s> on the surface it looks as if it is another repetition of a doctrinaire policy on which we have no information as to what is actually proposed except that it suggests the disposal of what appear to be to us very valuable public assets <e> <s> four subsidiaries are involved which according to the report of british rail made an operating surplus of about million <e> <s> further the br report states that the property subsidiary contributed no fewer than million to the cashflow of british rail <e> <s> a lot is involved hotels in the hotel subsidiary in the sealink subsidiary ships and harbours <e> <s> the hovercraft subsidiary operates the seaspeed service i believe jointly with french rail and belgian rail <e> <s> that is a very important undertaking and doubled the number of passengers and cars in over and above <e>", "<cs> may i comment on what the noble earl has just said <e> <s> i have just looked at the amendment which refers to <e>", "<cs> my lords as i supported the original bill which is now the act of parliament upon which these regulations are based i should like to say a few words <e> <s> i have had an opportunity to check these proposed new forms against the existing forms and i agree both with the noble lord the minister and with my noble friend lord boston of faversham that the simplification is a great improvement and i echo the comment that i hope the political parties and representatives of the electoral registration officers were fully satisfied with the new forms <e>", "<cs> my lords it was because of the complications of regulation that i had to read it four or five times <e> <s> i may have made a mistake even now <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not ironic that we are discussing the third reading of this bill today after having considered the expenditure yesterday of billion on weapons of destruction <e> <s> i am one of those who with other noble lords sat throughout all stages of this bill <e> <s> despite the amiability and the pleasant way in which the noble baroness introduced the bill the fact cannot be obscured that it is a harsh and mean bill <e> <s> there are one or two points which struck me as the stages went on <e> <s> first the government were not prepared to move at all despite all the pleas for the disabled <e> <s> they were not even prepared to write into the bill the assurance that we were told has been given by the secretary of state to put back the position of the disabled on a level with the retirement pensioners when the benefit comes into taxation <e> <s> there is no reason why that should not have been written into the bill to give an assurance to the disabled but the government would not move <e> <s> the whole of this bill means that we are putting some of the economic responsibilities on to the weakest section of the community <e> <s> that is the thing which came out clearly during all stages of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> could he tell the house the organisations which were invited to make comments on this document and could he comment on whether or not it is correct that some organisations are stated to have made comments including bodies such as the national parks authorities the forestry commission the national trust and the national conservation council but that only one of the organisations the forestry commission has declared in favour of the proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords in the statement kindly read by the noble viscount the minister he referred to the privilege of the post office telecommunications in supplying its own equipment <e> <s> am i correct in saying that the telecommunication side of the post office does not manufacture its own equipment and that it supplies equipment on design and safety provisions that it lays down <e> <s> in view of the new outlook for private companies do i take it that the telecommunications side will now be enabled to manufacture its own equipment which it has requested over very many years <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether it is not the case that parliamentary reviews are based to a great extent on the areas of district authority wards <e> <s> it is not also the case that the parliamentary reviews will be followed by the local government review and therefore is there not a case for endeavouring to synchronise both local government and parliamentary reviews <e> <s> otherwise we shall find that parliamentary constituencies based on district boards will be soon out of date <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for outlining so clearly the provisions of the order <e> <s> in general we welcome this order as it is a preparatory step for the united kingdom ratifying yet another convention to which it is a party <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord lyell for his explanation and particularly for outlining the advantages of the order <e> <s> no one reading the order would have any idea of the advantages and therefore his explanation has been most helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to give general support to the principle behind this bill but in giving it that welcome i want to make it clear that it is a cautious welcome because there are a number of points which i wish to raise for clarification in the course of my remarks <e> <s> i can see three reasons justifying the bill <e> <s> the first is to stop what the minister in the standing committee in another place referred to as <e>", "<cs> my lords i may not have had the same experience as other people i have been driving for only years but my first experience of humps on public highways was only this easter when i was in rotterdam driving in the vicinity of a very large and excellent old persons home <e> <s> i can assure noble lords that i slowed down and i am certain that other people did so <e> <s> what is more <e>", "<cs> my lords that brings in the point which i raised under subsection regulations so made may include the word is may <e> <s> it is permissive it is not an instruction <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise because i did not hear the amendment moved as i was attending another meeting in the parliament building <e> <s> however i have heard the ministers replies <e> <s> frankly i am amazed <e> <s> i may be a simple soul but perhaps the noble earl would explain matters to me <e> <s> if one leaves out the reference to being one of a group one finds three phrases <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl a question on a similar line <e> <s> could he tell us why a council tenant who is considered to be undesirable as a tenant that is the point should be enabled to have a per cent <e> <s> discount maybe going up to a per cent <e> <s> discount and if he cannot take the option for two years he will not feel any effect from possible inflation <e> <s> can the noble earl tell us why that should be considered fair and just <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the chief whip to look at columns and of the noble earls reply as to why he could not on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure noble lords in all parts of the house will share my keenness to hear more of the sort of informed debate we have had so far <e> <s> all of the speeches have been informed and all have expressed a passionate desire to ensure that democracy in local government in this country not only continues but is further developed <e> <s> as has been said this is a massive bill sittings in standing committee in another place indicate the amount of attention which your lordships house will need to give to its various clauses in committee <e>", "<cs> i am not at all happy with the full details of this amendment <e> <s> i speak on this not only as an ordinary citizen <e> <s> for five years during the war i served in the fire service and although that is years ago i believe that some of the points that arose then are pertinent to this amendment <e> <s> i was one of those who welcomed the introduction of the national fire service <e> <s> it introduced better training standardisation mobilisation and i was heartily in favour of its introduction <e> <s> much as i would like to see as much abolition of bureaucracy from our administration and domination by central government as possible this is an issue in which we are looking at fire risk fire hazards and the protection of the lives of people <e>", "<cs> the minister is always persuasive and plausible but to dismiss what i said by saying it is only a question whether three or four or fewer persons are contacted does not cover the point <e> <s> the two clauses deal with far more than that <e> <s> the one on works contracts contains a limitation on powers to enter into works contracts and the secretary of state has power to lay down conditions and the conditions are what we believe this house should thoroughly discuss something which cannot be done by the annulment procedure <e> <s> i will not weary the committee but if one looks at clause dealing with functional work one sees that we are not dealing with minor matters <e> <s> it concerns whether a local authority shall carry out functional work if certain conditions are not observed <e> <s> that is a matter of great importance <e> <s> in view of the adamant attitude of the minister however pleasant and plausible he may be i will not divide the committee but i feel the matter should be determined by a negative vote <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister and in view of the assurance given i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> may i say also that this will give us the opportunity before the report stage to compare the importance of these particular clauses with others in which the government are asking for affirmative resolutions <e>", "<cs> in the light of that generous statement by the minister i am only too pleased to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the intervention of the two noble lords and for the promise of the noble lord the minister to have a look at the matter <e> <s> may i make just two points which i hope he will consider <e> <s> he made the point that the local authority concerned would be consulted <e> <s> that is all it says <e> <s> it does <e>", "<cs> in dealing with this amendment i should like to speak also to amendment no <e> <s> because if amendment no <e> <s> is carried there is no point in considering amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> subsection to which this amendment refers was not in the original bill <e> <s> it was inserted during the committee stage in another place <e> <s> in my innocence i thought it was just a mistake in the use of the word differently <e> <s> when that amendment was introduced in the other place the under-secretary said it was a mistake in view of the different responsibilities of the ministry of transport in england and in wales the secretary of state for wales <e> <s> the minister added <e>", "<cs> i am still not satisfied with the explanation because the two ministers must adhere to the provisions of the local government act <e> <s> naturally they will take into account the terms of that act <e> <s> but i can see that the minister is adamant about this and i shall not move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> the minister has in effect said that he wants this as a reserve power <e> <s> it must be clearly <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord gainford replies to the minister i wonder whether i could refer to the question of assurances <e> <s> in the standing committee in another place the amendment of the standing committee was withdrawn because the minister suggested that discussions were taking place with the associations and he would give assurances to the committee <e> <s> at the report stage in another place the same member of parliament for ilford south was still not satisfied and wanted assurances that there would be no disparity for london in the event of tsg continuing <e> <s> the minister then said that he would have to draw the attention of his honourable friend the minister of transport to the observations that had been made <e> <s> i wonder if the minister could indicate whether there is a definite assurance that whatever happens if tsg is to continue there will be no disparity whatever concerning the position in greater london <e>", "<cs> i have no desire to detain the committee unduly but there is a question which i should like to put <e>", "<cs> i am obliged for the statement by the minister <e> <s> it greatly improves what is in the bill <e> <s> i accept what he has said <e> <s> i am certain that if by any chance the government slip up the local authority associations will now follow up this assurance that has been given <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> what the noble lord the minister has said is surely justification for opposing the inclusion of this clause in its entirety because if i listened correctly to the noble lord he said that we just cannot chuck the whole cost of this on to the big developers <e> <s> therefore it means in effect that the government have in mind making a charge on the small householder and as has been made quite clear percent <e> <s> of the applications are for the small householder <e> <s> it seems to me that this is a justification for opposing the clause in its entirety <e>", "<cs> the noble earl referred to the labour party and registers of land <e> <s> but that is a different register of land from that referred to in this bill <e> <s> this is not all land <e> <s> this is only land held by local authorities and public bodies and it would be wrong to assume that all unused and under-used land is in the hands of public bodies and local authorities <e> <s> one has only to travel around the country to see derelict sites attached to commercial undertakings many with for sale notices up due to the present circumstances <e> <s> if we are going to have a register of land available for developers which is what clause says then it ought to be a register of all land and not only part of the land <e>", "<cs> in view of the statement by the noble earl i shall beg leave to withdraw the amendment but having said that we shall watch the position carefully <e> <s> there have been published statements by the secretary of state which seem to suggest that he might be prepared to see encroachment on certain parts of the green belt <e> <s> that will have to be watched with care <e>", "<cs> although i appreciate the statement made by the noble lord the minister i am still not satisfied <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> however this may be justification for the discussion which we could not carry through last night because of the lateness of the hour on the value of positive planning in the community land act <e>", "<cs> i appreciate and i am certain all members of the committee will admire the enthusiasm with which the noble lord lord bellwin has presented his case <e> <s> but equally i am convinced that if we had the leaders of the joint dockland committee here they would speak with the same enthusiasm and with more knowledge of the area and would convince your lordships of the work which has to be done and how they are getting on with it <e> <s> i should like to know precisely the information on which the secretary of state was able to base his decisions before the proposal to have the udc <e> <s> i am talking now about londons dockland the noble lord lord evans can deal with liverpool <e> <s> what information did he have <e> <s> how many visits were made before the proposal was originally made <e> <s> what consultations were there with the djc and the authorities before the decision was taken <e> <s> what detailed study was there of all the problems <e> <s> or was it a question of saying this is the answer and as we go along we will find justification for it <e> <s> it is that which appears to have been done <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister said that there was no <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that generous offer to look at this and i give him the assurances that he wants <e> <s> we also want these to succeed but we want them to succeed on proper lines <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i can assure the noble lord that the purpose of this amendment is not in any way to frustrate the work of the development corporation <e> <s> what we wish to do is to safeguard the future when the work of the urban development corporation is finished because there will still be local authority work to carry through <e> <s> any land which is held and for which there has been planning consent may be vital to the work of that local authority after the work of the corporation is finished <e> <s> in view of what the noble lord the minister has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i would like to support my noble friend in the proposal he has just put forward <e> <s> looking at the notes on clauses it is stated that normally a local authority will be expected to continue to exercise its housing functions in the udc area but that it may be necessary to the udc to exercise some housing powers <e> <s> it then goes on to say that this clause has been drafted in very general terms <e> <s> it is in such general terms that it is one of the reasons why we should not agree to incorporate this provision in the bill <e>", "<cs> is it really a technical amendment <e> <s> i cannot fully grasp these points but when one quickly looks at them one wonders whether it is entirely necessary for the corporation to have these particular powers <e> <s> surely they can be exercised by simple agreement with the local authority <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that offer <e> <s> we shall obviously wish to see the code to see whether what he says is justified <e> <s> i am glad that the general principle is accepted and also that he agrees that it does not go far enough <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl able to say whether there is a survey which shows whether or not this nuisance is due to the power of the vehicle <e> <s> also is it not true that there are many high-powered machines which do not cause nuisance because they are owned by experienced riders who do not tamper with their machines <e> <s> is not the problem in many residential areas due to the lesser-powered machines whose exhaust systems have been deliberately tampered with and which create a considerable nuisance in the belief by youthful people that more noise is exciting <e>", "<cs> there are two or three other points on enterprise zones that i should like to put to the noble lord <e> <s> i wish to say nothing to hinder enterprise zones particularly as this is an experimental scheme which will help to find out the successes or otherwise <e> <s> having said that i am a little concerned that they may be too small and may have an adverse effect on other parts of an area or even a region and thus create problems <e> <s> the minister may be able to give me the answer <e> <s> the limited size of a zone could have the effect of siphoning development away from other areas in a city <e> <s> little advantage would be gained if a number of small firms decided to move out of one area and to move into the enterprise zone <e> <s> nothing would be gained except that the community would receive considerable financial benefit <e>", "<cs> i very much appreciate the detailed outline given by the minister of the procedure prior to the order being placed <e> <s> i think the safeguards are excellent <e> <s> the point i was trying to emphasise is that parliament wants to have control over public expenditure which i would have thought noble lords opposite would very much appreciate <e> <s> there could be an argument as to why one area is given a zone which will be very costly and another area is not given a zone <e> <s> but in the circumstances and in view of the explanation given by the minister i shall not press it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for his explanation and also for his replies on the other points that i have raised <e> <s> in view of what the minister has said about the merits of this amendment and of the fact that consultations with the local authority associations on this important matter will take place should the bill become law i will withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i also do this for the reason that the minister has given that an amendment of this kind could imperil the passage of this bill <e> <s> we have no wish to do that <e> <s> when we come to other amendments of mine i may take similar action <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> a number of speeches made by noble lords have dealt with the general principles of the bill and have not been confined to this amendment <e> <s> as i understand it the whole

appreciate that while i <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble earl agree that there are times when commercial considerations are not the only factors to be taken into account and that where there is the possibility of an important industry such as forestry not only having unemployment but not being able to use our timber something needs to be done <e> <s> when are government plans for a permanent solution likely to be announced <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the local government boundary commissions having completed their review of electoral areas so that the parliamentary boundary commissions can do their work will then have to look at the boundaries of local authorities <e> <s> therefore could we not once again have a situation where if we have an early report from the parliamentary commissions we shall find the parliamentary constituencies out of step with local government areas <e> <s> therefore would it not be best to try to unite the work of the two commissions and delay the report of the boundary commission as long as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble lord for that reply is it not a fact that the governments proposals for privatisation of the testing of both public service vehicles and heavy goods vehicles have met with overwhelming opposition from the operators <e> <s> is it not a fact that the opposition has come from the confederation of road passenger transport the road haulage association the national freight association and the institution of traffic management and that the cbi has also expressed its concern about the matter <e> <s> in view of the general appreciation of the present scheme run by the department of transport would it not be advisable for the government to concentrate their consultations on improving the present system which is generally regarded as efficient and drop their own

referred to are related to occurrences and not to work <e> <s> would that be more appropriate than amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords i readily accept the ministers assurance <e> <s> the reason for bringing forward the amendment in rather a different form is that in committee the noble lord said he agreed with the spirit and intention and would like to see something on the face of the bill as well as in regulations <e> <s> however in view of his assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords on this side of the house we support the amendment so ably moved by the noble lord lord renton in a very concise and cogent manner <e> <s> it qualifies an arbitrary power given under this subsection to the secretary of state <e> <s> it lays down an essential qualification before the secretary of state acts to direct a local authority that it shall cease work with its direct labour organisation <e> <s> your lordships will see that we have tabled amendment no <e> <s> a which argues the whole case <e> <s> it is not my intention at this stage to argue the case for that amendment <e> <s> however the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord renton will

lords i am sorry the minister cannot accept the amendment because we want to give an opportunity for local public opinion to play its part <e> <s> the minister says this will happen when all else has failed but there will have been no opportunity for all else to fail no consultation no opportunity for representation only the demand for a report and on that report the secretary of state will take this arbitrary power <e> <s> it is not a weapon of last resort but of second resort the first being to demand a report and the second to act without any conditions not even an attempt to state in the clause that there must be opportunity for consultation and representation by the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the support of the noble lord lord evans of claughton and of my noble friend lady fisher <e> <s> i believe they have put forward common-sense arguments as to why this amendment should be carried <e> <s> it does seem so much common sense <e> <s> a local authority may say look here you can do this job better for us you are nearer or you have got a more effective organisation <e> <s> do it for us <e> <s> leaving out the public <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that it is a reserve power but then he said that he could not ask that parliament shall waste its time on all the applications <e> <s> therefore there is a possibility that there may be a number of applications not merely just a reserve power <e> <s> i can recall the arguments at committee stage about the difference between negative and affirmative resolution procedures by noble lords with far greater experience than i who came down in favour of using the affirmative resolution procedure in a case like this <e> <s> i have looked through the bill and there are numerous examples of where the affirmative resolution procedure is being proposed by the government and i should have thought that this is one which is of great importance <e> <s> it affects the repeal or amendment of legislation <e> <s> the minister has made his position quite clear <e> <s> therefore i will not withdraw but i will ask this amendment to be negatived and will not call for a division <e>", "<cs> my lords if may say one word on that i think it would be helpful <e> <s> all i am saying in amendment no <e> <s> a is that if there is to be an order which is going to change the basis of the expenditure items then there should be consultation with the local authority associations and representatives of passenger transport operators <e> <s> i know that the noble lord has said to me and to the house on a number of occasions why should we have statutory provision for such consultations <e> <s> all i would say on that is that there are quite a lot of occasions in this bill where provisions for consultation are written in <e> <s> why not do it on this occasion <e> <s> because it would be absolutely important in my view that if there are to be changes in the items of expenditure for tsg the associations of local authorities ought to be brought into consultation as should the passenger transport operators <e>", "<cs> my lords i naturally accept the statements made by lord bellwin <e> <s> the problem is that the government may take a slightly different view eventually from that expressed by the noble lord here tonight <e> <s> our fears are that in any attempt at cutting down this may be one item the government see the possibility of cutting by abolishing tsg merging it in some form of block grant and we may find that a handicap to our <e>", "<cs> my lords may i follow up the question that has been raised on speed restrictions <e> <s> looking at the amendment moved by the noble lord lord airedale i see where no speed restriction is in force <e> <s> there is a speed restriction of miles an hour on motorways <e> <s> many roads have a miles an hour speed limit many roads miles an hour some miles an hour with signs up <e> <s> therefore the amendment is almost inoperatve because it does not say a miles an hour speed limit which i think the noble lord lord airedale has in mind and there are speed restrictions on practically every road <e>", "<cs> i should like my lords to ask for some information <e> <s> i am certain that if i show my ignorance the noble lord the minister will put me right in his usual very charming way <e> <s> looking through the various sections of the bill dealing with planning i am always puzzled by the fact that on some occasions we refer to the district planning authority and to the county planning authority and then suddenly we find a reference to the local planning authority <e> <s> in this case we refer to the local planning authority which i presume in view of the context refers to the county planning authority <e>", "<cs> then it makes it all the more important to define it <e> <s> i notice that in the amendment we have just carried on clause reference is made to the local planning authority but in section it is said that these powers can be exercised only by the district planning authority <e> <s> the fact that the phrase is used in some cases and not in others leads to some confusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply and for the assurance he has given but i am certain that he will understand that i should like to read carefully what he has said in the <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not short-sighted to leave this matter solely to the needs of industry as the minister suggested <e> <s> in view of the repeated talk of the need to prepare for recovery should not the government take the lead in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is it sufficient that after the advertisement in the local newspaper the local authority itself is left to consider the objections to something it wants to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the two replies that the minister has given would the government consider it desirable to set in motion an inquiry as to the desirability or practicability of having approved standards for equipment and accessories in connection with cars particularly in view of the attention that everybody gives to safety standards <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> is it appreciated that the serpell committee which reported on the ordnance survey contained in its recommendations no reference to any proposal for hiving off <e> <s> do the government accept the view of that committee that

<e> <s> further will not <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl able to give an assurance that if there are to be any proposals for change these will be brought before parliament before implementation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i echo briefly the concern expressed by the noble viscount lord simon <e> <s> it will be recalled that at the committee stage i inquired about the passage of this bill assuming that your lordships decided to pass the bill with amendments because while it is not an epoch-making bill we thought that it would be useful for this bill to pass <e> <s> i asked if the bill were amended whether there would still be opportunities for it to pass through the other place or whether that would make the situation very difficult <e> <s> i also asked whether if it were passed without amendment we would have assurances from the government that the regulations would be satisfactory and the consultations satis <e>", "<cs> my lords there is not the slightest doubt that quite a number of noble lords went through the division lobbies against the amendment because of the statements made about the possible passage of the bill in the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords apart from the fact that assurances were given when we discussed this matter on the previous occasion surely this particular amendment is not satisfactory in its wording <e> <s> your lordships will recall that i withdrew an amendment at committee stage which provided that local authority associations should be consulted <e> <s> the wording of this amendment is <e>", "<cs> my lords i should find it very difficult to resist this amendment in fact i should find it impossible to resist it for the very reason that the noble viscount lord simon has outlined <e> <s> there have been so many matters proposed in amendments or amendments which finally were not moved where there were differences of opinion and where your lordships have accepted quite readily the assurances given by the minister that these matters will be fully covered by regulations <e> <s> therefore the regulations are going to deal with quite a number of issues on which differences of opinion have been expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble noble lord sits down since <e>", "<cs> my lords on report i referred to clause dealing with the disposal of the land by public bodies and i referred to the fact that the secretary of state must be satisfied that the land can be disposed of without serious detriment to the performance of their functions or the carrying on of their undertakings <e> <s> however when i look at schedule which lists the public bodies concerned i find that the new towns commission is included as is the corporation of a new town <e> <s> why therefore are qualifications laid down as to conditions which the minister must take into consideration under part x dealing with the disposal of public land yet the government resist laying down a condition in this clause relating to new towns themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to intervene in this debate but there have been so many remarks about tyrannical behaviour the necessity to take away immunity from the law the comments about developing proper behaviour and so on that i feel compelled to say a few words <e> <s> if i thought that industrial relations could be solved by means of these codes of conduct i would give them complete and per cent <e> <s> support <e> <s> i echo the sentiments expressed by my noble friend lord shinwell <e> <s> i am certain that no one in your lordships house can support violence

to deal with the serious problem of drink and driving <e> <s> when it is appreciated that persons are killed and tens of thousands of others seriously injured each year as a result of drink being

be <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not deny that <e> <s> this may be an issue which can be dealt with on thursday although unfortunately because i have had to be discriminating i shall be unable to take part in that debate <e> <s> we now have the problem that most british rail regions are having to look at the possibility of cutting services along with the increase in fares to which i have referred and that can only bring further problems <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say whether or not it is correct that consideration is being given to closing the rehabilitation centres which are at present training some disabled persons <e> <s> if it is correct will the noble lord appreciate that this is a move that will be deplored <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord the minister himself referred to a number of quangos which are now being abolished without referring to one in particular can he tell the house whether it is correct that all new town corporations and the new town commission are to be abolished <e> <s> if so what will be the effect of this on the work of new towns and will it be debated in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl and to say how much i appreciate his reply which means that action is being taken in the interests of road safety <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to both thank and congratulate the noble lord lord nugent on bringing forward this bill and therefore again enabling your lordships to debate this important issue <e> <s> on the previous occasions when this matter has been debated by your lordships the issue has been very finely balanced albeit that on one occasion as the house has been reminded the

it is clear that opinion on both sides on this issue is held with great sincerity <e> <s> that is clear from the two opening speeches we have heard in this debate this afternoon <e> <s> nevertheless i hope that at the end of the day your lordships will decide to support the bill and give it a second reading <e> <s> it is a view which i express on behalf of this front bench but i wish to make it absolutely clear that this is a non-political issue on which so far as these benches are concerned there will be an entirely free vote it is a personal issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i never mentioned the year i referred to <e> <s> i did not say that the memorandum should not be taken seriously <e> <s> i simply said that this was a view-point which the rac says in its memorandum was

margadale on his birthday and we wish him well <e> <s> i should also like to pay my tribute to the two notable and excellent maiden speeches that we have heard this afternoon in this debate <e> <s> the noble earl lord halifax said that he understood that your lordships spoke in this house only when they had expert knowledge <e> <s> i am sorry to disappoint him because on this subject and as regards a great deal of this bill i have no expert knowledge <e> <s> i speak as one of those millions of whom my noble friend lord melchett spoke who love and appreciate our varied and wonderful

different categories of workers both those concerned with traffic movement and other members of the staff of british rail <e> <s> also is it correct to say that there must be some relationship of performance to investment and that the investment in british rail is the lowest in any european country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that noble lords will be most grateful to the noble viscount lord sidmouth for placing this motion on the order paper and also for the lucid arguments that he has put forward for the case for an investment policy for our transport system <e> <s> i am grateful to him for his kind remarks about the withdrawal of my own motion which was to do with british rail <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not been listening to speeches from me for years <e> <s> i am explaining the policy of the labour party <e> <s> there are reasons why certain things have not been achieved but i hope that this will not be a party political issue <e> <s> we are concerned with the needs of the nation for a transport policy and we must all try to ensure that such a policy is worked out <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> when he gives an assurance that it will be debated in parliament will that include a debate in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords although i appreciate that the whole question of the subsidiaries will be debated when we have the transport bill in this house does the criticism about operating commercially apply to sealink which according to the last published report in had a surplus which was per cent <e> <s> on capital and the rail property board which according to the last report of had an operating surplus of per cent <e> <s> on capital <e> <s> is this the reason for the transfer to privatisation shocking word <e> <s>

on behalf of the noble lord lord boston of faversham who should have been speaking on this bill from the dispatch box but he has intimated that unfortunately he has been detained elsewhere <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran not only for putting forward this bill but for explaining it so lucidly and so effectively putting forward the democratic principle that is involved <e> <s> concern has been expressed by large numbers of people for a long time that it is possible for a person to be included on electoral registers for more than one constituency where-ever that person has a residential qualification <e> <s> we know there are instances where some persons have a london flat a residence outside london and also as the noble lord has said an additional holiday home which is used for occasional visits and for holidays <e> <s> there may be other persons who have a number of residences in various parts of the country <e> <s> i emphasise quite clearly that legally these persons have a complete right at present to be registered in more than one constituency where they can claim to have a residence <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to interrupt for one moment <e> <s> it is quite true that under the present law i would do so because the law is there <e> <s> but that does not make the law right it ought to be abolished <e>", "<cs> my lords i am positive that there is no noble lord on this side of the house who regards public ownership as the panacea for all our problems <e> <s> in any event public ownership would need to be linked to appropriate economic and fiscal policies <e> <s> they would have to go hand in hand <e> <s> public ownership opens up the possibility of effective economic planning greater accountability and planned

these sites will be given some protection <e> <s> after having designated the limited areas of land the secretary of state has the decision admittedly after consultation with the ncc as to whether or

"<cs> my lords that may be acceptable but it was not criticised or opposed by the noble lords right honourable friend during the second reading debate <e>", "<cs> may i briefly say a few words on this amendment <e> <s> what troubles many noble lords and many people outside this house is whether or not the government accept that damage is being done to our countryside <e> <s> i emphasise our countryside because it is not the property of any small minority <e> <s> millions of us have inherited this great heritage <e> <s> we have enjoyed it <e> <s> we want to be satisfied that we will be able to pass it on to those who follow <e> <s> if we miss the opportunity provided by this bill further destruction will go on and those who follow will not have this countryside to enjoy <e> <s> the other thing that troubles me and many others is whether the government accept the facts given to them by their own statutory bodies the countryside commission and the nature conservancy council who have expressed their concern about this matter <e> <s> if the government do not accept this information why do they have these statutory bodies <e> <s> and if they do not accept this information from where do they get the information and advice on which to act <e>", "<cs> i would refer the noble lord to what i have already said <e> <s> a very noble statesman of colleagues on the right said <e>",

minority we are worried about not the others <e>", "<cs> i am not talking about areas of scientific interest <e> <s> i am talking about areas of beauty which millions in this country want to enjoy <e>

<e> <s> he is speaking on behalf of the government <e> <s> the reply is absolutely unsatisfactory <e> <s> it shows that the government have no policy to deal with this minority <e> <s> i can only ask leave to withdraw <e> <s> the committee will note the disappointing reply <e>", "<cs> is what the minister saying cancelled out by the provisions of clause which lays down three particular points in paragraphs <e>", "<cs> in the interests of time may i make just two very brief points because the noble lord the minister has stressed the local contact in this matter <e> <s> one notices in schedule that the government recognise that this goes beyond the locality in so far as the notices have to be given to the <e>", "<cs> i readily give way to what the noble lord has said on his knowledge of agriculture but i do not think it affects the merits of this amendment <e> <s> i will not go over what the noble lord lord avebury said but he referred to the fact that three-quarters of the counties in england and wales have bylaws which would accord with the principle of this amendment <e> <s> i wonder whether the government have consulted county council opinion because many county councils have large rural farming areas <e> <s> yet they have felt it was necessary to have this amendment and have not suggested repealing it therefore we need to know the view of the county councils on this matter <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to lord avebury for his comments about missing the opportunity <e> <s> in the light of the noble earls comments and a nod is as good as a wink and that we may find his honourable friends will be putting something forward in another place i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in the light of the assurance given by the noble earl i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> so much could be said on this amendment which i am pleased the noble lord has moved but i will content myself with two or three points <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton mentioned figures relating to the loss of hedges <e> <s> i understand that the nature conservancy council has said that per cent <e> <s> of hedges have been lost in east anglia <e> <s> therefore there is a problem <e> <s> i will not weary the committee by going into details but they have been mentioned in previous debates <e> <s> my mind goes back to the debates on not only clause but also clause where i had to complain that we had no anwser to the position of farmers who either are not interested in conservation of this kind or do not make management agreements <e> <s> therefore we are referring to a minority and it may well be that we are referring to a minority here but unless the minority is dealt with we can find some of these most delightful aspects of our countryside disappearing <e> <s> i must say on this amendment as we have said on many others that we must not miss the opportunity provided by this bill which after all is a countryside bill concerned not only with the protection of the beauty of the countryside but in this case with the hedges that provide very valuable habitats <e> <s> therefore we have to look at two aspects <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to thank the noble lord lord bellwin for explaining the bill so clearly and succinctly <e> <s> he said that it is a non-controversial bill and i think in general it is although there will be some pertinent remarks that i wish to make and i hope i may make them as simply and as clearly as the noble lord the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the number of speakers to follow and in deference to your lordships i will refrain from dealing with the national issues for three reasons first because one cannot deal with them adequately in only a few moments secondly because my noble friend lord jacques expressed much better than i could the views which i hold and thirdly because i wish to put some figures on record <e> <s> i recognise that behind every figure are human beings as other noble lords have said <e> <s> in that connection when we talk about a shake-out we must realise that that involves human beings <e> <s> it means privation impoverishment disillusionment and bitterness <e> <s> we must always bear that in mind and i recognise it when i say i wish to put some figures on record <e>", "<cs> it is not for me on behalf of these benches necessarily to help the government with the passage of this bill although as was made quite clear on second reading we shall not oppose it because the principle of the bill and it is

was said on that occasion will have been read in the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl agree that the statement he made in reply to my noble friend lord shinwell will be read with very great interest in relation to the justification for disposing of shares in what everybody recognises is an efficient and profitable concern <e> <s> in the light of the decision that the government will retain a majority shareholding will the noble earl speak to his right honourable friend the minister of transport and suggest that the same thing might be done in regard to the sale of british rail subsidiaries <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that reply may i ask whether he is aware that before the local government act was introduced into this house there were statements in the london press suggesting that the secretary of state had in mind a possible development in the green belt area and that expressions of concern were raised by myself and other noble lords during the discussions on the local government bill <e> <s> is he further aware that there is now great concern throughout not only the area affected but also in the essex county council planning committee <e> <s> would the minister agree that the impression is given that the secretary of state intended to have some development in the green belt and that that has been the policy which he has been pursuing <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the latter reply from the minister but it does not alter the concern <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister will agree that the request for modification should not even have been made <e> <s> we hope that the secretary of state will consider the protests from quite a large number of organisations not only in the area affected but also in the built-up areas near this area <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be for your lordships convenience if i also speak at this stage to amendment no <e> <s> fa <e> <s> both these amendments deal with the question of capital grants under section of the agriculture act <e> <s> both deal with circumstances where such operations could adversely affect the flora fauna and other features of the countryside and both can take in any land because the amendment moved by the noble lord lord sandford refers to national parks and other areas <e> <s> the difference is that in his amendment the noble lord lord sandford has proposed that if an application is refused then a management agreement can be sought with of course appropriate financial considerations <e> <s> this brings in the long discussion which we had earlier this afternoon which i am certain noble lords would not wish to reopen as to what happens if a management agreement is refused full stop <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord kilmarnock and i do so for two reasons first for the same reason as was mentioned by the noble lord that there is an amendment later which does suggest the appointment of wardens to assist the users of paths <e> <s> the proposed amendment would be complementary to that <e> <s> the two would fit in together extremely well <e> <s> my second reason is that it would be of benefit not only to the users of the paths <e> <s> it would be of great value to farmers and landowners because how often does one find oneself walking along a path and coming to a junction or to a place where the path becomes indistinct particularly after heavy rainfall and not quite knowing which way to go <e> <s> those who have had the pleasure of walking the fells in the lake district will know how valuable in fact sometimes almost indispensable if one has only been there once before if ever are the cairns of stones which mark the main route <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i ought to indicate that this is an amendment to section which refers to signposts <e> <s> it is a question of adding waymarks <e>", "<cs> at the second reading of this bill i expressed concern as to the indebtedness of the board and also the amount of interest charges that have to be paid by the board <e> <s> the figures that i have and i think they are correct from their accounts was an indebtedness of million <e> <s> that may seem very small but in relation to the net income from the boards own activities of only million it is a substantial amount <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that as soon as money is available the government would naturally do what they could to look at the points raised by the chairman of the board <e> <s> do i have his assurance that the urgently needed safety measures will be able to be tackled by the present annual grant that is the important point without any deterioration of the position <e>", "<cs> i have already expressed my thanks to the noble lord for the letter that he sent me and on this issue he gave me the full facts concerning the north-west water authority <e> <s> however the point i was endeavouring to make is that the government in the other place were so adamant that it seemed to us that it was not just the north-west water authority about which they were worried but the general principle so much so that the debate went on for many hours and took up many columns <e>", "<cs> the explanation from the noble lord far from satisfying me gives the view of the government quite clearly and it is one which frankly we could not accept <e> <s> the very fact that there are english authorities with charges higher than those in operation in wales justifies what i said in moving the amendment that we are not just concerned with the position in wales <e> <s> with regard to the statement that the act does not work surely nothing can be more equal than to say that there should be some balancing where i am reading from the act <e>", "<cs> it would appear from the last interchange of views that i shall certainly have to look to see whether the noble lord lord winstanley is correct <e> <s> there obviously seems to be a slight difference about the matter <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for giving me information about the statutory instrument <e> <s> that shows how much i must improve my own personal research services <e> <s> i am grateful to him <e> <s> however it does not get over the problem to which i have referred namely the problem about people who are not in receipt of supplementary benefits <e> <s> those are the people about whom we are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord kindly give way <e> <s> the important question is not whether there is access to a car in the towns but the dependence upon it <e> <s> whereas in the towns there is usually alternative transport in rural areas there is not <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first offer an apology to the noble lord lord renton to my noble friend lord mccarthy and to the noble lord lord rochester

course read in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read many consultation documents in which one could see quite clearly which way the government were leaning but we may hear more about that <e> <s> it may be of course that the real purpose of the paper is to cover over differences that there may be between the doves and the hawks among the present ministers <e> <s> i certainly hope that its purpose was not to soften up the public in a beguiling way to prepare them for the introduction of further drastic legal measures into our trade union law <e> <s> i cannot understand why once again so soon after the act we have sections dealing with secondary action secret ballots picketing the closed shop and union membership <e> <s> it was not my intention to refer to those at all because they were so fully debated during our long sessions on the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i may be given leave to be out of order as well <e>", "<cs> because i should not like this bill to go away without saying one or two words upon it <e> <s> first i shall not reiterate what my noble friend lady white has said but i am glad that she has had the opportunity to say it in view of her experience <e> <s> it was my intention to comment that when we discussed this bill in committee so few noble lords were present because it was during the supper break that it would be good to have these points made with a larger attendance because the british waterways board is very important to us but maybe i was being over-optimistic <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise to the noble earl lord gowrie for the fact that i was not in my place for his speech <e> <s> as the house knows i am engaged in a long-running select committee which is now in its th day <e> <s> i have no doubt that the noble earl has painted with his usual progressive <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a possibility in the same way as i shall mention later of the development of prestel by the present british telecommunications without requiring any bill of this kind <e> <s> there are also powers in the bill given to the secretary of state to determine the financial objectives of british telecommunications <e> <s> i was pleased to note that the noble earl lord de la warr referred to the power in the bill whereby the secretary of state may interfere with the charging if he so desires in certain circumstances <e> <s> yet we are told that it is the aim of the bill that british telecom and its subsidiaries shall act in a commercial manner <e> <s> when a competitor seeks to provide a value-added service using british telecom circuits will the charge to that concern take into consideration the very heavy cost that telecom will have to meet in order to provide the national network which is so essential to the whole apparatus <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that your lordships will wish me in the first instance to thank the noble lord the minister for the very clear and concise way in which he has explained the many <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord orr-ewing is concentrating upon the position of the huge monopoly of bt as against small firms <e> <s> but there is also the other angle it would be the position of some of the big private competitors <e> <s> these are the people who might quite easily run the loss leader process <e> <s> it has been argued that this can be continued by a company only for a short period <e> <s> i am not a great company expert but we all know the history of by-products where the major process has been run at a loss in order to get the continued profits from by-products <e> <s> we must ensure that when people talk about fair trading it must be two-way <e>", "<cs> the comments that we have just had from the noble lord lord morris indicate the <e>", "<cs> i appreciate what the minister has said about the references in the amendment to services beyond the first instruments but i am also worried as to whether there is not a serious defect in this amendment in so far as the noble lord lord morris quoted the noble lord lord byers saying that we are not talking about the exclusive monopoly of the national network <e> <s> but this amendment no <e> <s> would take away the reference to the exclusive privilege of the licensing and running of the systems throughout the british islands <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt again but in his speech the noble lord lord morris made no reference to the point which i made <e> <s> when the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran replies it might be helpful if the noble earl lord gowrie could be asked whether my criticism was a valid one or not <e>", "<cs> references have been made both in this debate and in the debate on the previous amendment to the report of professor beesley <e> <s> i should like to add a few comments to those which have been made particularly in the light of the remarks that i made during second reading <e> <s> i believe that there are some who support the governments proposals on the competitive supply of terminals who are concerned about professor beesleys recommendations on the opening up i prefer that phrase of domestic and international value added network services or the development of private transmission services <e>", "<cs> that may be but we are discussing a very important report with very far-reaching consequences and i am certain that on other issues noble lords would wish to see a far more detailed report with far more detailed investigations than have been made in this particular case <e> <s> i am not criticising professor beesley i am criticising the government which sought to ask for this report to be produced at such short notice and therefore the study had to be carried out in this particular way <e>", "<cs> this is a crucial amendment which would not be necessary if both the government and the treasury would adopt a logical attitude and not have a fixation to a policy which is not relevant to the needs of british telecom <e> <s> as has been emphasised by other noble lords the bt investment is one of the largest investment programmes in the united kingdom and when one realises that the bulk of this has to be financed from revenue one must

said there was <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord appreciate that there are many noble lords in the house who realise the logic and common sense of his replies and how dangerous it is to make quick assumptions in a question and answer session <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister said that half the rate increase was due to the demands of the precepting authorities is he able to tell the house what the other half is for bearing in mind that this borough council does not have quite the severe inner city problems that other borough councils have and also can he tell the house what representations the borough council has made to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that noble lords will be grateful to the minister for the clarity with which he has explained this bill in the manner in which we have come to expect from him <e> <s> although this is a money bill i should like to raise a number of points <e> <s> first the noble lord has stressed the urgency of the situation which we on this side of your lordships house clearly recognise <e> <s> he has explained that it is due to the problem of overmanning and also to loss of trade <e> <s> as he said far too few workers have opted for severance pay and this must be allied to the problem of these men finding alternative employment in those particular areas <e> <s> it would be foolish to disregard that fact <e>", "<cs> my lords while there will be universal agreement with the condemnation of the so-called football supporters may i ask the minister if any steps are being taken to have firm consultations with the football association about the matter <e>", "<cs> i will not go further with the protests which have been made supported so ably by my noble friend lord mishcon and also by the noble lord lord donaldson <e> <s> i believe we have made our view emphatic on this <e> <s> the points raised by the noble viscount lord simon are issues which as the minister says can be dealt with on other amendments and i would hope that we may get the noble viscounts support when those amendments are considered <e> <s> i will readily send the minister a copy of the letter from the finance houses <e> <s> this is an important amendment but i believe the position of the government is now thoroughly made clear <e> <s> we will not withdraw the amendment but we will not press it to a division <e>", "<cs> the amendment will be withdrawn but i should like to put to the committee that when a power is in the bill and we have said this time and again it is in the bill and no matter what a present secretary of state may say it can be used at any future opportunity <e> <s> that is why we wish to have this provision taken out <e> <s> in the light of what the noble lord has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that would be very nice for the noble lord lord mottistone but the noble lord lord bellwin has said that we are juggling with words <e> <s> he used the word dominate <e> <s> the word dominate has a different meaning from the word control and we are talking about relinquishing control not about relinquishing domination <e> <s> we are talking about a company in which british rail will have less than half the shares and even though all the others will be made up in small portions british rail will still be the majority shareholder <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord will find that i am correct <e> <s> he said that we are juggling with <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to have received those categorical assurances from the minister but in my political life it has always been emphasised to me that it is not what ministers say in their speeches but what is contained in the bill that matters <e> <s> after all what one secretary of state may feel inclined to do another may have different views about <e> <s> i therefore urge the minister to re-read in the <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the minister a question before he sits down <e> <s> he said that the present intention is to keep sealink in one company <e> <s> does that apply only to sealink shipping or are all sealink shipping and harbour interests to be kept together <e>", "<cs> obviously the government have their view on this matter <e> <s> we think that it is a wrong view but we shall not press the amendment to a division <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> needless to say the arguments made by the noble lord lord bellwin in putting the governments case did not satisfy me in terms of the information which i gave to your lordships <e> <s> the noble lord argues that this is a decision taken freely by the railways board <e> <s> it has been suggested that such decisions will not be entirely free decisions and that in any case there will be a certain amount of arm-twisting because of the external financing limits position which affects the whole position of british rail <e> <s> while immediate cash may be helpful we are looking at the long-term business view that on retaining profitable property british rail itself can obtain the benefit of appreciating values as the years go by and this seems to be a sensible business attitude to adopt <e> <s> i cannot imagine that british rail too would not have seen it that way <e> <s> the noble lord lord bellwin also said it was a question of what british rail does with the money <e> <s> are the government implying that british rail has wasted the money that has been transferred from property dealings <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says no <e> <s> i am pleased to hear it because of course british rail is using the money to cover the deficit on its general rail operations <e> <s> we know why british rail has a deficit on its general rail operations it is because investment is badly needed <e> <s> investment in development is badly needed but i will not go into that at this stage <e> <s> the statement made by sir robert lawrence from which i quoted suggests that if british rail could have held on to the property in question it would have much preferred to do so and would have much preferred to hold on to the land as well <e> <s> i was a little concerned when the noble lord commented that operational property is not involved but only some operational property which incorporates such facilities as offices <e> <s> this is just the sort of property i should like to see br hold on to because these are the profitable parts of property <e> <s> but the government are adamant and i will not weary the committee with another division <e> <s> our view has been made quite clear in debate and i still believe that our attitude is right <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is strange how the government change their argument when confronted with a particular argument <e> <s> i can recall the statement by the noble lord lord bellwin on second reading a rather humorous statement about the other four subsidiaries having nothing to do with british rail <e> <s> why then should they run the hotels and why handle shipping <e> <s> here we are proving conclusively that the other subsidiaries are closely linked with british rail <e> <s> when we come to the next amendment we prove that british rail needs the subsidiary <e> <s> one cannot follow an argument which changes according to the particular words in a particular amendment <e> <s> i agree with the noble viscount lord simon that at the end of the day all these are linked with what may happen under clause <e> <s> when we get to that perhaps we may have a detailed discussion on the powers of the secretary of state <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bellwin referred to the monopoly supply <e> <s> when one keeps in mind the figures i mentioned million obtained from outside suppliers is a big figure <e> <s> he also referred to british rail being able to get the best buy <e> <s> presumably that is what british rail do now <e> <s> in their placing of million with outside suppliers they are obviously looking for the best buy <e> <s> there is clearly a difference in outlook in this issue between the government and those on these benches <e> <s>

setting up a separate harbours company as suggested in this clause <e> <s> if the ships and harbours are still to be kept together under sealink why have a separate harbours company <e> <s> it seems to me a totally unnecessary piece of bureaucratic machinery which the government are always accusing those on this side of the house of trying to encourage <e>", "<cs> that statement by the minister would satisfy me at this present stage <e> <s> if the minister undertakes to take a careful look at this that will satisfy me at the moment because i am not saying <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene after

not satisfied with the position which the government are taking <e> <s> the view has been expressed by the noble lord lord bellwin that the fact that per cent <e> <s> is held by the government would develop confidence in the workforce and in investors <e> <s> i should have thought that that confidence would be more firmly expressed if it were written into the bill and if everybody could see it

prefer to read in the <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord bellwin for his explanation <e> <s> i shall consider what he has said and i will do a little more homework on reading the harbour acts <e> <s> what the noble lord has said seems to have clarified the position but i will read what he has said in the <e>", "<cs> i am sure noble lords will be very grateful to the noble viscount lord rochdale for his intervention <e> <s> he has great experience of the ports industry <e> <s> as the noble lord lord bellwin has said many of the rochdale committees recommendations have been carried out <e> <s> i would never set myself up as knowing more about the docks industry than the noble viscount <e> <s> however it is generally admitted that today there are problems in the ports

can leave the problems to the industry itself when there is general agreement that a two-thirds surplus capacity exists <e>", "<cs> i am very disappointed with the ministers reply charming though was his turning down of the amendment <e> <s> to suggest that the government do not accept a monopoly situation is surely not accepting the position that was agreed by the under-secretary of state for transport in another place where he as good as agreed that this situation is now growing <e> <s> it is not a question of asking the government to interfere in charging policy we are not asking for that <e> <s> what the amendment says is that if a port user believes that charges other than those for ships passengers and goods stevedoring and other charges are excessive he ought to have a fair opportunity of appeal <e> <s> that is all we are asking for not interfering with or laying down of charging policy <e>", "<cs> the amendment provides that there can be an appeal by any person <e> <s>

position of the heavy goods vehicle driver <e> <s> would the noble and learned lord agree that exceptional hardship might be held to cover the position of a heavy goods vehicle driver who not only has his licence taken away and therefore his hgv licence as well but will have very great difficulty in having it restored at the end of the period of disqualification because the licensing authorities are usually very strict on restoration <e>", "<cs> it is in my hands but i cannot pledge what the noble lord lord lucas wishes to do <e> <s> if he is satisfied with the attitude the minister is taking

driving and the steps to be taken i am certain that many noble lords will share my concern over the last five words <e>", "<cs> so many points have been made by noble lords who have spoken to the amendment that it is clear that this is a subject which requires far greater discussion than we have had tonight <e> <s> my first reaction is to say we should divide on the principle involved but i feel that at this hour that would be unfair to noble lords on both sides of the committee who hold strong views on the matter <e> <s> i hope the demonstration offered by the noble lord lord skelmersdale will be arranged <e> <s> it is a question of the public acceptance of a new procedure <e> <s> it is certainly not just a question of the time that may be taken up in the courts it is a question of the individual who is eventually convicted being satisfied that he had a full crack of the whip before he was convicted <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for drawing my attention in particular to that <e> <s> i am grateful to him <e> <s> i will study this and in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am certain that the committee will be grateful to the three noble lords who have forsaken the opportunity to move their own amendments so that the committee may concentrate on the main principle in the debate <e> <s> i think your lordships will also appreciate the concise way in which the noble lord lord nugent of guildford put forward the case which i support <e> <s> i think one should also pass comment on the speech made by the noble lord the minister for lord bellwin has been very fair in putting the two cases and i think everyone will appreciate that he has been prepared to state forthrightly his own personal view on this issue as well as putting forward the impartial case for and against <e> <s> i should like to echo what he has said on the government side and as i said at second reading on all these safety issues a free vote is the position with regard to these benches <e>", "<cs> i was inclined to support the amendment moved by the noble baroness lady macleod of borve but having heard some of the criticisms made by experienced motor-cyclists i think it might be advisable for the minister to be prepared to look at this again to see whether or not some adjustment could be made and perhaps he could table an amendment <e> <s> when the minister said they would look at this for new machines i was a little heartened but then i was disheartened when he said there would be no compulsion <e> <s> i do not want it to be thought that i am a member of the compulsion lobby but for the minister and his advisers to look at this matter and then to say that we shall have these two lights on the machine but there will be no compulsion to use them seems to be rather a nonsense <e>", "<cs> i have great sympathy with the amendment just moved <e> <s> i also have great sympathy with the amendment that would have been moved by the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> before the minister replies there are one or two points i should like to make on the new clause which the minister moved which i think is a great improvement on the original clause and i fully support the principle behind the new clause <e>", "<cs> may i say briefly without going into the disputes which undoubtedly have led to this situation in swansea that i am in agreement with the <e>", "<cs> i am all in favour of the minister and the department carrying out the utmost consultations possible but i wonder whether this amendment is necessary because in the schedule there have to be regulations put forward by the secretary of state which will cover the whole question of humps their size placing type and everything else <e> <s> it would appear to me that before that is done the minister could make all the inquiries he wants <e> <s> i recall that when the question of road humps was considered in standing committee in another place reference was made to the experiments which had been conducted and a number of members of parliament not confined to one particular party voiced the complaint that had been made by certain residents when those humps had to be taken away since they were only there for the purpose of a temporary experiment <e> <s> so if it is true that there are clever drivers who find they can negotiate these humps in such a way as not to lose speed then that is something the secretary of state and the department can take into consideration when drawing up regulations <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord the minister sits down will he confirm that i am correct in believing that under paragraph b of schedule even where the secretary of state himself wishes to construct a road hump whether on a mph limit road or elsewhere he has to obtain the consent of the highways authority or in the case of greater london that of the greater london council <e> <s> if that is so that provision would go some way to meeting the point which the government have put forward <e>", "<cs> i must make it clear in the light of what the noble earl lord avon has said that when we discussed the previous road hump bill i did not move an amendment to this effect i had one down on the marshalled list but i withdrew it for certain reasons of which the noble earl is only too aware <e> <s> therefore it has not been tested before your lordships <e> <s> this is one of these cases where a statutory responsibility <e>", "<cs> i must apologise for the omission of the word associations and the inclusion of the word association <e> <s> i meant it to be associations <e> <s> we must put that down to the fact that we on this side of the committee have to do our own typing of amendments <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene for a moment <e> <s> for my own benefit would the minister tell me where the question of the negative resolution is referred to <e> <s> there is reference to regulations <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will try to clarify it <e> <s> if his point is correct naturally i shall not press the amendment further later <e> <s> but in the present circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it may be that i should say a few words on this to indicate that i did not withdraw my own amendment because i did not support the proposition so ably moved by the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> it is clear that i was wise to leave it to lord mottistone to move the amendment because of his close interest in this matter and frankly of his coming so closely in touch with it in his everyday commercial contacts <e> <s> then it might be asked why did i trouble to put down an amendment in the first place <e> <s> i have no commercial interests <e> <s> my interest is that of equity and that was the interest of my honourable friends in the other place who put down a similar amendment at both committee stage and report stage <e> <s> it is on the grounds of equity that i hope the government will listen to the case which has been so ably put by the noble lord lord mottistone <e>", "<cs> i should like to make just a few points on what the noble lord lord bellwin has said <e> <s> first i must make it absolutely clear that the amendment is not saying that there should not be the exercise of due economy it is not saying that there should be no attention given to the saving of finance <e> <s> that has nothing at all to do with what i have said <e> <s> it is not even saying that there should not be an increase in licence fees <e> <s> obviously with the pitifully low fee that is charged in the areas operating under the act there is need for something to be done <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for that explanation and naturally if the government are going to give attention to this whole question and maybe even improve upon my amendment i welcome it and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the advice given by the minister <e> <s> what i shall have to consider with my noble friends is whether or not to put down a similar amendment and also extend the title of the bill as we have already done on one occasion tonight in so far as we have brought in the railways and compensation in connection with the burning of crops which had nothing to do with this original bill but the title is going to be extended <e> <s> this is such a commonsense transport <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the government share in the decision in the final document of the special assembly <e> <s> have not the government also declared their support for the world disarmament campaign which is a multilateral campaign <e> <s> what positive steps are the government taking to try to work out something rather than just give airy answers <e>", "<cs> my lords with due respect to the noble lord lord mottistone i wonder whether he has got it completely right <e> <s> we are not talking about cosseting british telecom <e> <s> i do not like the word but we are talking about cosseting the consumer this is the important thing <e> <s> no reference has been made so far as i can gather to the question of maintenance <e> <s> the noble lord lord mottistone says that in canada it is done much cheaper <e> <s> nothing can be much cheaper than nothing <e> <s> british telecom carries out maintenance as part of its normal rental charge <e> <s> what will be the position in the rural areas <e> <s> if as my noble friend lord glenamara has pointed out and it cannot be denied profitable services are to be taken away by licence from british telecom obviously british telecom has to make a very important decision does it carry on in difficult rural areas <e> <s> many noble lords come from rural areas they know that telecom engineers go out in all weathers at almost all hours to deal with problems of maintenance and that is included in the telephone rental charge <e> <s> nothing can be cheaper than that <e> <s> british telecom will have to take an important decision <e> <s> if it is going to be denied other important revenues it has got to decide whether it carries on maintenance at its present cost <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no intention of going through the criticisms that i made in committee about the details of beesley but i should like to ask one or two questions <e> <s> was the governments attitude based on beesley <e> <s> if so surely the account which has been given by my noble friend about the inadequate survey and the limited time must be important factors despite any views that may be expressed by the noble lord lord morris or any other noble lord <e> <s> if the governments view was based on beesley then i must again ask is it not strange that this report if it was <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that no noble lord wishes to make this debate into a party dogfight <e> <s> however i must refer to the justification that the noble earl has put forward for the entire principles of the bill according to conservative doctrine for which he says there is a mandate <e> <s> incidentally i become very perturbed about mandates because sometimes there might be only three words hidden in an election manifesto and it is then claimed that one has a mandate <e> <s> during the division i went to my case and took out a copy of the conservative manifesto <e> <s> i cannot see anything in the manifesto about british telecom i cannot see anything in it about the post office i cannot see anything in it about following the principle that beesley has put forward and the government have accepted not a word <e>", "<cs> there is nothing in what i have read out that justifies the hear hears from the government benches since in the bill there is clear interference with the whole of telecom and when we come to deal with another amendment we shall see what is happening to the question of financial discipline <e> <s> as my noble friend has pointed out and as has been mentioned in the letter from the plessey management the question of funding is linked very closely with the question of british telecom development <e>", "<cs> my lords what disappoints me about the noble earls reply is something i have <e>", "<cs> i was not aware that i was making any political points my lords <e> <s> i thought i was putting forward a sensible and logical argument free of party politics <e> <s> i must draw attention to some earlier comments of the noble earl in a similar context <e> <s> the only reason i am on my feet now is that unfortunately this issue came up at about at night in committee and it is coming up again late tonight yet this is the most crucial issue facing the development of british telecom <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to prolong the argument but the noble earl asked me to give way to him and i should in turn like to ask what might have been the position of rolls-royce <e> <s> an undertaking which was in a more difficult position than the one that we are now considering <e> <s> i do not think that the argument we are now hearing about obtained then <e>", "<cs> my lords although there is general acceptance of the principle of enterprise zones will the minister give an assurance that the development of the zones will be carefully monitored in order to ensure that there is no adverse effect on businesses just outside the area of the zone and also that there will not be any abuse by businesses who leave premises outside the zone and come in <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble earl agree that the advantages of such a project would affect not only international transport but also british industry and would assist with the unemployment problem <e> <s> would not the same constructive advantages be obtained whether the investment was private or public or a combination of both <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for repeating that statement a brief one but one with very wide implications <e> <s> during our debates on the transport act we on this side strongly condemned the sale of the national freight corporation to private interests <e> <s> during the passage of that measure i and other noble lords stated that there was general agreement that it was a well-managed business was very strong on professional standards had forward-looking ideas and had an imaginative management <e> <s> it was also recognised that the corporation played a pace-setting role in the road haulage industry <e> <s> it was emphasised that road haulage was a fragmented industry and that while the national freight corporation handled per cent <e> <s> of the industrys business and was still the largest unit in road haulage it was therefore not in any way in a monopoly situation <e> <s> we on these benches believe that a substantial unit of the kind the corporation is is necessary to the industry and therefore in any sale we hope there will be no question whatever of the freight corporation and its subsidiaries being broken up <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join other noble lords in congratulating the noble lord lord mountevans on his maiden speech which showed that he is well informed on transport matters <e> <s> i am sure that he is well informed on other subjects too and i look forward to hearing him speak in future debates on transport and other matters <e> <s> i also wish to congratulate both the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton who has brought forward the bill in your lordships house and the honourable member for devon north who introduced it in the other place <e> <s> the bill gives an opportunity for an intelligent worthwhile flexible approach to railway lines or stations that are closed <e> <s> i was pleased to note in the other place the government amendment providing for the opening of stations which are closed on lines that are still in service <e> <s> it is clear that without this small bill british rail would be very seriously inhibited in conducting experiments <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord appreciate that the measures to which he has referred are in the main endeavours to deal with the situation but not to deal with the real problem and although he says that the government fully subscribe to the recommendation referred to in this question does he not accept that the unemployment problem is mainly due to the fiscal and economic policies of the present government <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating that statement <e> <s> the statement is very disappointing and very depressing <e> <s> the final report of the joint study on main-line electrification undertaken by the department of transport and the british railways board was published earlier this year <e> <s> this was the result of a three-year study <e> <s> therefore the minister already has all possible information <e> <s> is this study and the conclusions now rejected by the government <e> <s> does the minister also recall a debate in this house earlier this year when from all sides of the house there was general pressure for a bold scheme of railway electrification <e> <s> have the government rejected commitment to a specific programme <e> <s> have the government rejected a planned rolling programme <e> <s> on page paragraph of the report it is stated that a programme of electrification would require commitments from the supply industry and the workforce as well as railway management which the <e>", "<cs> my lords after the very detailed information given by the noble lord lord ferrier and his two noble friends it is questionable whether i should intervene at all but it is felt that this matter comes under transport responsibilities plus the fact that for the best part of the last years i have spent all my holidays in the north-west highlands and on a number of visits there i have travelled through edinburgh by car so that i know something of the problems <e> <s> in many other visits to the city by train and by air i was taken around by car and i know the problems when i wanted to get to preston pans and tranent to keep engagements <e> <s> people want to visit the city but if you are going to the north-west highlands there is no time to spend in admiring the sights of the city <e> <s> you want to get through and haulage traffic wants to get through <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not one of the many issues relating to seat belts on which the government will have serious discussions with manufacturers in the event of the transport bill which includes this clause becoming law <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that this bill has been introduced with the best of motives but in my view it is a hastily contrived and a hastily drafted bill and one that we cannot look at solely from the aspect of northern ireland <e> <s> i believe it is a bad bill on three grounds <e> <s> i do not believe it will improve the situation in northern ireland it is also a bad bill because it introduces very far-reaching constitutional change it is a bad bill because i believe it is unwise to deal with important changes of electoral law in this way <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> the government could quite easily have restored the position to what it was prior to without going any further with this bill <e> <s> they could have brought in a bill to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords it may not have gone unnoticed that this is an occasion on which my front bench seem not to be in full agreement wth the stand i have taken in supporting the select committees recommendations <e> <s> that is not to say that i have not a great deal of sympathy with some of the views expressed by my noble friend lady birk <e> <s> i expressed some of those concerns in my own speeches on second reading and in committee <e> <s> what one must consider today is that we are considering the report of a committee which heard detailed evidence lasting some days <e> <s> although the conclusions and recommendations are unanimous and each member of the committee would have arrived at his views for different reasons nevertheless they were unanimous <e> <s> it must not be assumed that they were arrived at without misgivings and without serious consideration <e> <s> the transcripts will give evidence to that <e> <s> we have before us a report of only pages a little over words <e> <s> the noble lord the chairman of committees has just said that the transcripts are of pages and million words <e> <s> that is what we members of the committee are basing our conclusions and recommendations on listening to million words <e> <s> and what is more every committee member posed many questions <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that there have been instances particularly in local government of candidates with the same surnames and christian names <e> <s> is it not also a fact that the matter <e>", "<cs> may i first accept what the noble lord said about the drafting of the amendment <e> <s> all i can say in excuse for myself is that this raises the very point which my noble friend raised that these amendments had to be put in at such short notice and this one was put in in handwriting at nine oclock at night <e> <s> i accept the corrections that the noble lord has made <e>", "<cs> it is correct that we are asking the returning officer to adjudicate on a matter of fact <e> <s> therefore so could the returning officer be asked to adjudicate on every other matter of fact dealing with every other type of person who could be disqualified <e> <s> i shall not go into that now but on second reading the minister detailed all the categories of persons who are now disqualified from sitting or voting in the house of commons <e> <s> one could place all those responsibilities on the returning officer as matter of fact <e> <s> but we are not doing that <e> <s> we are picking out just one and we are extending that power <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for his detailed reply but it does not help me at all perhaps it is because i am dense <e> <s> it is suggested that we must avoid any ambiguity but frankly any ambiguity must be in existence when one says that a board must adhere to the duties and powers placed upon it by an act but then goes on to say that the minister can give powers notwithstanding those obligations <e> <s> that seems to me to create ambiguity itself and that is what the bill is doing <e> <s> the question of the reserve power is completely irrelevant at this stage <e> <s> as the noble viscount lord simon said that is something that we can discuss when we come to other amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord mishcon did say it might be difficult to have an inquiry but he did not say it would be wrong to try to have an inquiry <e> <s> we do not avoid things that are difficult if they are desirable and necessary <e> <s> in moving the amendment i did so because i thought it was desirable <e> <s> i am inclined to agree with the noble viscount lord simon that we can dispose of this possibly far better by dealing with the whole of the provision clause <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i make it absolutely clear that there is nothing in this amendment to challenge the main principle of this part of the bill otherwise i would have tabled quite a number of amendments to deal with the question of subsidiaries <e> <s> those issues were dealt with in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry that the minister has disposed of the report so simply <e> <s> when we discussed this at committee stage i did not refer to the report <e> <s> at that stage frankly i had not re-read it i re-read it after the committee stage and it is very illuminating <e> <s> can this be left solely to the industry <e> <s> the national ports council in this report of which was a report to the secretary of state at that time made it quite clear that proposals they had been trying to make had been thwarted by influential elements within the industry <e> <s> how then can we propose that the industry itself should tackle these matters <e> <s> i will not weary the house but i have a list here of about ten reviews some royal commissions on the docks industry over the last years <e> <s> it has always required an outside body to deal with the situation <e> <s> the government are obviously adamant about this <e> <s> i do not feel disposed <e>", "<cs> my lords this was intentionally a probing amendment and i am grateful to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the minister that i clearly recognise the difference between the normal dues and the dock charges about which we are talking <e> <s> the noble lord said no evidence had been produced since committee <e> <s> i presume that he and his department receive the same pressures from the commercial operators and i am talking about commercial operators on british waterways freight carriers as we receive <e> <s> they are very concerned with what they describe as a developing monopolistic situation particularly in relation to sheffield and south yorkshire navigation they are very worried about associated british ports being taken over from the british transport docks board in the area and they argue that a monopoly situation is developing <e> <s> the commercial private operators have raised the matter <e> <s> as we have the evidence i assume the department has it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the last remarks of the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> he said that one should not set aside lightly the general view of justices on these offences but neither should we set aside lightly the effect on the individual <e> <s> justice must apply not only to the person who is to be brought before the court but to the individual who may be suffering from a very serious accident and whose life may be completely ruined <e> <s> if a person takes a vehicle on the road without insurance that is almost as serious as drinking and driving <e> <s> that is something with which i think your lordships will agree <e> <s> in view of the encouraging remarks of the noble and learned lord i will press this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate what my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby has said <e> <s> i can understand the case he puts forward but i supported the view expressed on this amendment at second reading and at the committee stage and i have no reason to change my support now <e> <s> i do not happen to have a halo around my head because only once have i been caught for speeding <e> <s> it was turned midnight on a road with no traffic anywhere near me <e>", "<cs> my lords i readily accept the assurance of the noble lord as regards the preparations that the department and the government are making <e> <s> it still does not deal with the important question of the first time novice <e> <s> i hope we may have serious consideration from the government on this issue and that these consultations will include the experiment in scotland particularly in lothian <e> <s> these figures are so illuminating and i am sure they are correct and they show the necessity for something more to be done on the first time novice <e> <s> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much appreciate the consideration which the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has given to the discussions at the committee stage and from the three amendments which we have tabled it is fairly clear that the consideration has been very detailed <e> <s> i am still very concerned about a point that was emphasised at the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for giving way <e> <s> frankly i would have been only too happy to accept the amendment of the noble lord lord monson to put that right <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the concern that there is on the question of communications have the government any reason to justify the proposed cuts in the external services of the bbc <e> <s> will there be an opportunity for this matter to be discussed in this house in view of the considerable concern in all sections of it <e>", "<cs> my lords although i appreciate the readiness of the government to give some assistance is the minister aware that the annual report of the british waterways board states that the arrears of maintenance work now amount to million and that this amount is growing each year <e> <s> is this not therefore false economy <e> <s> and has not the board said that because of the per cent <e> <s> cut in its grant it could not carry out essential work during the last months which included the work on the blisworth tunnel <e> <s> may i therefore ask the minister whether or not the question is one of urgent work on some of the tunnels which are years old <e>", "<cs> it was not my intention to intervene in the debate until i heard the speeches of the noble baroness lady trumpington and the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson of ewell <e> <s> the former accused my noble friend lord mishcon of emotionalism <e> <s> i hope this matter will not be decided on emotion but emotionalism is not necessarily wrong in this case <e> <s> i shall determine it on what i believe to be right and what effect it will have on the apprehensions of a minority of people

<e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make three very brief points <e> <s> in an earlier debate we talked about driving a coach and horses through legislation <e> <s> this surely we should do if we passed this amendment <e> <s> i am certain that it is not the wish of your lordships that today we should overturn a clear decision which was taken during the committee stage <e> <s> on the other point suggested by the noble lord lord monson that drivers wearing seat belts drive less well i am certain that the motoring organisations would not accept it <e> <s> even the rac which does not support the compulsory wearing of seat belts as distinct from the aa believe in the value of wearing seat belts <e> <s> therefore that point has got to be emphasised <e> <s> i am certain they would not say that they do not believe in the value of seat belts for all occupants of a car <e> <s> my only other point is that there are cases of severe injury when drivers who are not wearing seat belts hit the steering column very forcibly <e> <s> i believe that the wearing of a seat belt can assist in preventing that happening <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord intimates what he wants to do on this can i ask the minister this question <e> <s> when he is looking at this would he look both at this clause and then refer to clause and look at that as well <e> <s> both of them are possibly identical both of them provide for exceptions both in or out of both <e>", "<cs> i should like to suggest to the house that there are some difficulties here <e> <s> first of all how does one prove what is laid down in this amendment <e> <s> one might think of one or two examples where one could prove it but how do you get proof that if a person had been wearing a seat belt this would have happened <e> <s> it could be held to be an encouragement to certain people deliberately to refuse to obey the law if it became law to wear a seat belt <e> <s> and deliberately refusing to do this because they believe they could then prove that failure to wear a seat belt had led to saving someones life <e>", "<cs> you are on the wrong track <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact that basically on these amendments to clause i have had rather a self-denying ordinance does not mean that i am uninterested in what is being discussed <e> <s> but i have accepted the statement made during the committee stage by the minister that all these matters will be the subject of the closest consultation not only with manufacturers but also with safety organisations the various motoring organisations and the commercial vehicle organisations <e> <s> i believe that that will be done <e> <s> if there is any fear that the manufacturers will drag their feet on this i hope that the motoring organisations will not because it is in their interests that something should be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel i should comment on the matter if only in view of the remarks of the noble lord lord balfour about representation on this side of the house <e> <s> the attention of noble lords must be drawn to the fact that in the next clause there is a fine of in relation to childrens seat belts and i cannot see any amendment having been tabled to deal with that although it represents almost the same offence <e> <s> it makes one wonder whether that is tied up with the fight against the general principle of the wearing of seat belts <e> <s> like the noble lord lord nugent i am prepared to be guided by the minister on this <e> <s> a penalty must be sufficient to deter and when it is suggested that a fine of might be the last straw for someone on a low income who is running a car there is one obvious answer observe the law <e> <s> it is as simple as that and one would think that all those who believe in law and order on the benches opposite would rapidly support that principle <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of the very few speakers completely in favour of the seat belt clause may i say that i support the principle of this <e> <s> all the way through i have taken the view that the more consultations there are with all the bodies concerned and so long as there is the affirmative procedure for the regulations i believe a lot of the criticism can be allayed <e> <s> therefore if the government can see their way clear if not to accept this amendment at least to accept the spirit of it i think it would help towards that <e>", "<cs> my lords am grateful to the noble earl for the various assurances that he has given <e> <s> it is always interesting that when i look at the actual wording of the bill i find in schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully agree that it is desirable to debate my amendment no <e> <s> along with government amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> as has been pointed out the minister undertook to take a look at the clause and to ensure that excessive fees should not be charged by a local authority and i am grateful that we have this amendment before us <e> <s> but i notice that the wording of the amendment except for four words at the end is exactly the same wording as appears in section of the local government miscellaneous provisions act <e> <s> it is that wording which is causing difficulty with the taxi trade and about which they have been complaining <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the question refer to all citizens living abroad and is it not open to some question whether it would be democratic that persons who choose to live abroad for most of their lives particularly those who may be tax exiles should vote in elections in this country <e> <s> if there are to be any announcements by the noble lords right honourable friend can we have some assurance that these important changes will be the subject of a speakers conference <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister accept that there are a number of noble lords who take the view that it is not a question of competing for investment in the roads waterways or railways but a question of what is best for the nation what will help in our recovery and what will be of assistance in dealing with unemployment <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to have the reassurance from the minister <e> <s> everything that has been said justifies why the amendment should be in the bill <e> <s> he has agreed that it is desirable and commercially wise to do so <e> <s> therefore it would seem that this ought to be something written into the bill <e> <s> it is not an issue on which one would seek to divide the house but there is a principle involved <e> <s> i shall not withdraw this amendment but ask the house to make a decision without a division <e> <s> if only the minister would accept that what he wants is what we want and that all his arguments go to that length as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am dealing with and not with <e> <s> not only myself but other noble lords not of my party at the committee and report stages expressed great concern at what they called the arbitrary wide-ranging powers given to the secretary of state <e> <s> i made it clear in moving the amendment this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely disappointed with the ministers reply <e> <s> it will be recalled of course that i spoke in support at committee stage of the downplating of lorries under this same clause in support of the noble lord lord mottistone on the basis of equity and fairness <e> <s> if there are other categories which ought also to be considered that is a matter which could be adjusted when lords amendments go to another place <e> <s> it should not affect this particular amendment which is trying to deal with the question of justice <e> <s> to suggest that this is to be looked at from the aspect of loss of revenue appears a farfetched argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to have that assurance <e> <s> on that basis i readily withdraw the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord said estate cars <e> <s> will he look at the hatch-back as well <e> <s> they are both in the same position <e> <s> with that assurance i readily beg leave to withdraw and hope that something may happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in some difficulty because i have not spoken at all on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i confined myself entirely to amendment no <e> <s> because i thought there were two different principles involved <e> <s> therefore before i sit down perhaps i may be permitted to say a few words on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot imagine a consultation in connection with the act dealing with the taxi trade not covering the very point i have in mind <e> <s> therefore while it does not fully satisfy me we can come back later to this question of equity <e> <s> but i would urge that if the government propose to amend the provisions we must have something which dealt with the whole of the country together and if the governments proposals are not adequate we can fight it on the basis of the whole country whereas at the moment it deals only with some of the district councils and nobody can possibly justify that <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say one or two further words i recall that under the local government act the government are insisting on a supply of information for example on direct works departments <e> <s> the government say that they want the information and they will then decide what to do about certain things <e> <s> these licence-holders want the information so that they can decide <e> <s> i hope that this may be included in the consultation document on the provisions because it is part of them <e> <s> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should point out that all the words in the amendment after the word report on the third line of the proposed subsection are actual words taken from the subsection in question <e> <s> i am disappointed with the reply because i think it would be helpful if we knew how the carrying out of those things was working out in practice <e> <s> but in the light of what the noble lord has said he can rest assured that i shall have discussions with my honourable friends in another place and i am certain that they will follow up the suggestions he has made <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might put just two or three points <e> <s> in the first place what the amendment is saying is that where the port authority is the only employer and where there is no reasonable opportunity for the port user to go anywhere else there should be the right of appeal <e> <s> therefore it is not a question of whether at this stage there is such a port but it could be in the near future <e> <s> the national waterways transport association have expressed real concern about this and they represent the independent private freight operators on our waterways and a number of freight operators have expressed concern about it <e> <s> under the bill the british transport docks board will go out of existence and associated british ports will come in as a private company controlling those particular harbours and docks in the humber estuary and the trent <e> <s> therefore there could be conditions of monopoly on both the points raised in this amendment <e> <s> i wonder whether that is fully appreciated <e> <s> i know it is no good asking the government to take it back because there is no opportunity to take it back either we do not proceed with the amendment or alternatively the government are prepared to accept it and then possibly if they wish to improve it in the other place they could do so <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of the issues on which we feel very strongly but in view of the governments refusal to reconsider i do not think we will press it to a division <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the support of the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth but i note also his plea for me not to press this matter to a division <e> <s> i recognise that the basic issue was debated and went to a division at the report stage although as i have emphasised i think that there is a complete change in what is being proposed in this amendment <e> <s> before i decide which step i shall take we must consider that despite the machines having advanced since blennerhassett it was the principle that blennerhassett was advancing for the very reasons that i have advanced the principle and the fact that we need to get this so freely accepted <e> <s> one way in which to get it freely accepted i am certain would be to provide the machinery which is suggested in the amendment <e> <s> i am certain that the motoring organisations are not asking for the optional blood test because they believe that there will be tens of thousands who will rush in and demand it <e> <s> i do not believe that the motoring associations would be so foolish as to ask for that <e> <s> they themselves want to encourage the general acceptance of the new procedure and the machines <e> <s> i am in some difficulty in so far as we had a vote on this issue last time and i do not want to waste the time of the house or to intrude upon the general kindness of the house in letting me bring forward this matter again <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the noble lord lord bellwin for the way in which he has piloted the bill through this house <e> <s> i suppose one can say that it is always a pleasure to do business with him <e> <s> sometimes his manner is so disarming that he gets away with things that he should not but he is always helpful in giving full and detailed explanations <e> <s> he was also greatly helped by his team of ministers to whom i am certain the house is grateful <e> <s> i have been appreciative of the various letters which have been sent by the noble lord and by his noble friends on various matters which have arisen <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord the minister as he said this refers to the qualification in subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord what regard the government pay to reports from consumer bodies <e> <s> also what is the attitude of the government to the report from the consumers committee for the gas industry which strongly criticised the closing down of the gas showrooms <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not correct that at the time of the original statement reference was made to the possible necessity of inspecting other ceilings <e> <s> if that is correct have such inspections been carried out and what are the results <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he is aware that a simple phone call to the national bus company revealed two hours ago that there are no vacancies whatever for conductors in the three subsidiaries that is cumberland ribble and crosville merseyside area of the national bus company <e> <s> what few vacancies there are for drivers are not being filled partly because of promotion possibilities for conductors and partly because they want to avoid the possibility of redundancies due to drop in services <e> <s> if there are vacancies in other undertakings in the north-west would the minister agree that there seems to be a basis for considering why the national bus company has no vacancies whereas other undertakings may <e> <s> may it have something to do with unsocial broken hours <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the house will agree with me that although this has been a long debate it has been much needed and well worth while <e> <s> we have had the opportunity of listening to many noble lords with a close relationship with and some with a very good expertise in broadcasting and others with close knowledge of the countries affected by these cuts <e> <s> it is notable that with only one or two exceptions all of them were critical of the governments proposals <e> <s> i can almost say that it is a non-party view or an all-party view that has been expressed today <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl whether the government have any plans to compile similar information on unused and under-used land in private hands which may be sat on in the hope that there may be increased land values <e>", "<cs> my lords there are three very good reasons why i as a non-scot from metropolitan essex intervene in this debate <e> <s> the first reason is that any act that is passed is passed with the approval of the whole of this house and not just by scots <e> <s> secondly there is a great principle involved and thirdly what is happening here could be transferred to england and wales <e> <s> there is a great principle which my noble friend lord ross of marnock has outlined the possibility and almost the certainty of our present conciliating and negotiating machinery being set on one side by the whim of a secretary of state <e> <s> admittedly he has to bring an order which can be dealt with by annulment but we all know how difficult it is to handle something by negative procedure <e> <s> therefore there is a great principle at stake the question of the powers to be put on one side the machinery for conciliation on conditions of service <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he has read todays main editorial in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in no way intending to reopen the debate that we had prior to the dinner break <e> <s> one point needs clarification <e> <s> it may well be that some noble lords after hearing the noble lord lord sandford have the impression that there is no difference at all in the use of the word shall in what is known as the sandford amendment and the new clause which is before us <e> <s> for the record i should like the minister to say whether there is any difference between what is in the sandford clause shall seek to enter into a management agreement and what is in the new clause shall offer to enter <e> <s> in one case it is to try to get a management agreement and the other way is to offer <e> <s> i should like the minister to confirm that that is the position <e>", "<cs> my lords may i support the amendment moved by my noble friend <e> <s> i recognise that public paths may have to be ploughed up of necessity but many of us walk in areas where we have not walked before and as i have had in recent weeks experienced situations where a path has gone across a field which has been ploughed up <e> <s> where does one go in order to pick up the path on the other side <e> <s> it is becoming a problem <e> <s> one can have a situation where one takes a path around a field which has been ploughed up <e> <s> it may be argued that one can easily find where to pick up the other side <e> <s> but that is not so where the field next door has always been ploughed <e> <s> therefore there are real difficulties <e> <s> while accepting the position of the farming community in carrying out their operations the path should be restored as quickly as possible and one week seems to be reasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to confirm that the guidelines to which he referred were drawn up by a home office working party on which i understand there were no members of local authority police committees and has that led to protests from local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords although these are apparently only drafting amendments can the noble lord say whether they have been made available for noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the first occasion on which i have entered into a debate on an eec report and in this capacity today i may possibly describe myself as putting forward the viewpoint of the common man if such a person exists <e> <s> i should also like to express appreciation of the excellent manner in which the noble lord lord wolfenden introduced this report <e> <s> anyone who may not have read the report will have had a very good summary from that introduction <e> <s> also i should like to express appreciation to the committee because the range of evidence and the questioning of the members of the committee were extremely useful and the report is valuable for that reason alone <e> <s> by and large i accept the conclusions arrived at by the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i must make clear first of all that from these benches we share concern at extremist activities in all aspects of our industrial political and social life <e> <s> having said that there are a few issues which arise from the actual words of the question tabled by the noble lord lord gridley <e> <s> first of all what is extremism <e> <s> what is a threat to authority <e> <s> and how in a democracy are we going to deal with these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to refer to the national front because this body frequently distributes scurrilous racist literature at schools and also endeavours to get at the youth at football grounds <e> <s> it is to the credit of the football clubs that they took action to resist this and i think credit should be given to the football clubs <e> <s> the british movement one of the four bodies which has grown up from the national front break up has also been stepping up activities and recruiting at schools and also endeavouring to do the same among football crowds <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble earl will appreciate that everyone in your lordships house welcomes the widest possible use of genuine disablement badges <e> <s> the noble earl mentioned that disablement organisations have been consulted about the proposals <e> <s> who has been consulted on behalf of those who will have to carry out the duty of preventing abuse <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to deal with three proposals in the gracious speech and first i should like to follow the noble baroness and my noble friend lord mishcon in dealing with the proposals regarding local government <e> <s> i am certain that noble lords will have been deeply impressed by the excellent contributions of the noble baroness and my noble friend on this issue based as they were in each case on very long periods of service in local government <e> <s> the gracious speech referred to legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that the supplementary questions and answers on this matter show how seriously this should be one of the items to be considered by the government in any proposals to be put before the second united nations special assembly on disarmament next year and have the government any plans to put such proposals forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to the noble earl lord avon how much i appreciate his reply but will he not agree that the advertisement which <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether it is not correct that it has been reported that a substantial number of employers do not pay the present rate set out by some of the wages councils and if that is correct what is the proportion and what will the government do about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that all noble lords will be grateful to the noble lord lord evans of claughton not only for placing this subject on the order paper but for the very constructive way in which he has introduced it <e> <s> i have very little difference with the noble lord in regard to the first part of his speech <e> <s> my party for which i speak has always stressed the vital necessity of partnership between central and local government <e> <s> i am sure that all noble lords will agree that a lively and independent local government is absolutely vital to our system of democratic government <e> <s> together with the parliamentary system local government forms the twin pillars which sustain our political democracy <e> <s> therefore <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord will recall that this was a clear point in the labour party manifesto which led to that decision <e> <s> it was clearly put to the electors as a vital principle of education <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that there is considerable disappointment among noble lords that this house has not been able to debate the armitage report <e> <s> does he also recall that in the debate on the gracious speech i asked whether it was the intention of the government to do anything in the present legislative session regarding the armitage report and at this moment i am still awaiting a reply <e> <s> can he confirm what is the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped that my noble friend lord ross of marnock would have been able to find it possible to take part in this debate on the <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble earl referred to irresponsible wage increases will he say whether or not in his view less tax on top of a low wage award is an irresponsible increase <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord ross of marnock has indicated i wish to deal in particular with the position of taxis and hire cars under the bill <e> <s> i do so because there are important changes from the report of the working party to which reference has been made and indeed from the consultation paper issued in july <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that there are many occasions on which declarations and communiqus on international gatherings seem not to have a great deal of relevance to any settlement <e> <s> can he really say that there is any objection to a declaration of this kind being adopted by the united nations <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl why in the previous written answer to which reference is made in my noble friends question it was stated that the sponsors receive a lower percentage because it was desired that they should show a genuine commitment <e> <s> why should that be asked of organisations in northern ireland when it does not apply to organisations in the rest of the united kingdom <e> <s> does it imply a feeling that the organisations in northern ireland do not have the same sincerity as those in other parts of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will be extremely grateful for the statement repeated by the noble lord today <e> <s> reference is made in the statement to the fact that two debates took place in the other place <e> <s> i must remind your lordships that we have had no debate whatever in this house on the armitage report <e> <s> we also on this side of the house give full praise and thanks to sir richard armitage and his assessors for the valuable contribution made to this subject by their report <e> <s> there are some excellent recommendations but there are some questions left in doubt <e> <s> i must draw attention to the fact that there are recommendations in all pages of the report that no fewer than organisations sent written evidence and members of the public also gave evidence <e> <s> but your lordships have had no opportunity whatever to debate this important report prior to the statement being made today <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the house my lords but it will be appreciated that we have not debated armitage and that the statement really arises from armitage <e> <s> however in deference to the government chief whip i will draw my remarks to a close <e> <s> how many of the proposals in the armitage report will be implemented <e> <s> when is it proposed that the new limits will come into effect <e> <s> do the government accept in particular recommendation no <e> <s> by which additional powers and finance are proposed for local authorities in lorry action areas <e> <s> if so how much will be covered by that <e> <s> finally as we have not had a chance to debate the armitage report on which the statement is based will there be opportunity for the house to debate the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord sandys for explaining the purpose of this order so clearly <e> <s> nevertheless although he has explained it clearly there are a number of points on the proposals i should like to put to him <e> <s> first may i make it quite clear on behalf of the labour party that we have been in full support of placing the responsibility for transport policies and programmes on the county councils and of the procedure for the transport supplementary grant to be paid through counties for all transport purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down could he deal with the question of the review in spring <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that in addition to the serious loss of revenue there was also a serious loss of goodwill and good relationships which are so important and what steps are the government taking to rectify that <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said in the course of an earlier reply that one of the problems is the large-scale cut-down in capital development by local authorities <e> <s> he said that this could be dealt with if the authorities would deal with the decrease in their current expenditure <e> <s> can he tell me what the problem is likely to be if there are capital development schemes which leave the local authority because it is cutting down current expenditure in a position that it cannot run them or have the staff to look after them <e>", "<cs> when the minister replies i wonder whether he could give some indication of his view on the point which i raised on second reading <e> <s> i referred to the fact that there were taxi licences in glasgow and taxi-driving licences in glasgow <e> <s> are we to have some guidance as to whether that will be covered by sub-paragraph or could the local licensing authority find itself advertising not only applications but renewals of applications <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl recall the debate on this matter during the committee stage of the transport bill only this year when his noble friend lord bellwin said he believed that the metropolitan police consider that this would be a very useful means of dealing with illegal parking <e> <s> is there any possibility of this matter being dealt with in time for inclusion in the forthcoming transport bill <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend lord ross particularly as he said the amendment covered taxis <e>", "<cs> that is precisely what i was about to say i was about to assure the noble earl that it was not my intention now to deal with taxis <e> <s> however i thought that as he might say i was being quiet on this amendment i should rise to explain that it was not my intention to rehearse my arguments on taxis now <e> <s> if this amendment were carried it would of course include taxis and all the activities for which licences are given <e> <s> i hope it will be carried <e> <s> not only as my noble friend said was it in the consultation document but it is after all permissive <e> <s> a licensing authority could decide whether or not to do it and i should have thought it represented a principle with which the committee could agree <e>", "<cs> may i just deal with a few points raised by the minister <e> <s> it was not i who said that the taxi trade was unique <e> <s> it is unique under this bill but it was the minister himself at the second reading who said that he recognised that because of <e>", "<cs> of course it would be for money <e> <s> when a person transfers his taxi business that is bound to be the case <e> <s> suppose a person has borrowed money to acquire a business <e> <s> he has had to pay a premium for that business including a taxi licence <e> <s> suppose he falls ill and must dispose of it <e> <s> he still owes money <e> <s> he wants the opportunity to transfer the licence and the business to someone else <e> <s> if he does not have that right he will be in some difficulty <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for repeating his intention to consult the convention on this matter as well <e> <s> i should like to feel in the light of the points that have been made that he will also consult the taxi trade <e> <s> he has put forward some points on which their view as well as that of cosla should he considered by the government <e> <s> on the basis of the ministers agreement to have consultations i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend on this amendment <e> <s> i know that when one is dealing with a scottish bill it is always dangerous to <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there have been reports of at least one undertaking which has moved into an enterprise zone with all its advantages and then subsequently has closed down its undertaking outside the enterprise zone <e> <s> if such reports are correct what action do the government propose to take <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to put the record straight is it not a fact that the tower hamlets borough council in the area of which the isle of dogs is situated themselves accepted the principle of enterprise zones and have put in an alternative bid and if the docklands corporation had not been set up that would have been there for consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for repeating the statement made by his friend in the other place <e> <s> the statement is grossly inadequate to meet the problems of transport not only in london but elsewhere which have been thrown up by the law lords judgment <e> <s> naturally it is not appropriate for this statement to discuss that judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no desire to detain the house unduly but the noble lord has not replied to the question i asked about who will determine the criteria and how they will be determined for the rate of subsidy <e> <s> the noble lord made two statements in reply to questions and i paraphrase what he said <e> <s> he said that the main issue is how to determine the balance between transport costs and the burden to be borne by the ratepayers <e> <s> then in reply to another question he asked what is a reasonable level of subsidy <e> <s> that is the very question that i asked because the law lords judgment did not say what is a reasonable level <e> <s> when does million become a reasonable level of subsidy and when does million become an unreasonable level of subsidy <e> <s> therefore this question of criteria is very important <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain your lordships will be grateful to the noble lord lord kings norton for asking this question for explaining the work of your lordships committee and the conclusions arrived at and for putting them forward if i may say so with humility in such a clear way that even a person such as myself can understand fully what is involved in the proposals <e> <s> it would seem to me that the objectives of the commission are admirable but as the noble lord has pointed out at the moment even in the community as a whole only per cent <e> <s> of all inland freight transport uses combined transport and even the commissions own aim is only that it might achieve per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for that answer <e> <s> would he be surprised to learn that motorists have been seen using a hand microphone driving with one hand even on motorways and would he not agree that that is a very dangerous practice <e> <s> i am sure the noble earl would agree that it is desirable to avoid offences rather than have to take action <e> <s> are any conditions to this effect included in the cb licence and could arrangements be made in agreement with retailers for printed advice on this and other relevant matters to be given when these sets are sold <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join in the thanks and congratulations to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for opening the debate on this massive and important report <e> <s> i hope that he feels gratified by the large number of very informative speeches that have been made by noble lords <e> <s> it is my intention to concentrate mainly on the proposal for the no-fault road scheme <e> <s> i must say that i was concerned and other noble lords may be concerned that the commission was inhibited by the terms of reference that were given to it <e> <s> the commission made clear in the opening paragraph of the introduction that it was confined to consider the position of five categories only and in respect of the million injuries resulting in death or four or more days incapacity each year some million or per cent <e> <s> of all those injured at the moment most get no compensation <e> <s> about million of these cases are outside the terms of reference <e> <s> that is a very important figure which i hope we shall keep in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords if we are dealing with the effects then of course we would be looking at a comprehensive scheme and that is what i am talking about <e> <s> despite the intention of the commission to place the whole cost of such a scheme on motorists we find in chapter and also very helpfully set out in detail in annex details of a number of non-contributory benefits which have been introduced in the last decade <e> <s> the noble lord lord campbell of croy outlined some of those and therefore i shall not repeat them <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down i know he has given a very detailed reply to the various points already is he able to comment on <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble earl give the figures for the number of new services run by the national bus company out of the figures he has given <e> <s> if they are a substantial number would he not agree that the revenues from those express services in no way make up for the losses being sustained by many sections of the national bus company and are putting in peril some of their difficult rural routes <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment <e> <s> i hope the minister will not take the view that this is not the way to deal with amendments to the representation of the people act <e> <s> generally i am one of those who does not like almost <e>", "<cs> may i say to the noble lord lord renton that in the last two years at least one bill to amend the representation of the people act started in this house <e> <s> there would appear to be no reason why an amendment of this kind should not start in this house <e>", "<cs> this clause provides as made clear in subsection that the secretary of state may designate additional activities for licensing <e> <s> i would wish to raise with the minister the question which has been urged by the scottish consumer council <e> <s> the noble earl will no doubt be aware that the consumer council has sent to a number of noble lords of which i am one a copy of a letter sent to him towards the end of december <e> <s> undoubtedly the noble earl would not have had this letter until around christmas time and therefore possibly had no opportunity to consider possible amendment to the bill <e>", "<cs> i think it would be helpful to the committee if we could have the ministers comments on the points that have been raised by my noble friend lord ross of marnock <e> <s> i was about to raise precisely the same points as he raised <e> <s> if we want to decide whether or not to go further at another stage it would be helpful to have the ministers comments upon them <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to detain the committee at this hour but there is a very important point which should be raised <e> <s> incidentally the clause as it stands at the moment is a great improvement on that in the consultation paper because subsection was not in the consultation document <e> <s> can the noble lord tell me it may be due to my lack of understanding of grammar as regards the last line whether local event stands on its own or does <e>", "<cs> does the minister think that there is any validity in the point that i have raised <e> <s> surely we do not wish to exclude the voluntary organisations which may run sports events discos and all sorts of other events and which want to advertise them on a vehicle which as i said before i have done many times in my life by attaching a poster to the wheel the side or the rear of my car in order to advertise a <e>", "<cs> my lords as the management of the new corporation will be precisely the same as the management of the national freight corporation may i ask the noble earl to say what is to be gained by the transfer except possibly to carry out the doctrinaire policy of the government <e> <s> what will be the net result to the treasury after making allowance for the payment of british rail pensions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that the whole house will be grateful to the noble lord lord balfour of inchrye for opening this debate and for giving us an opportunity to discuss this important matter as well as for the practical way in which he has put forward some valuable suggestions <e> <s> i only hope that my suggestions will be equally valuable <e> <s> i am pleased also that we are going to have the advantage of a maiden speech by the noble lord lord plummer of st marylebone whose vast experience as a previous leader of the greater london council will be very helpful to us in this debate <e> <s> i recall that a former prime minister is alleged to have telephoned the noble lord in tokyo and told him to clear parliament square <e> <s> perhaps we may know tonight what proposals the noble lord made <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies would the noble lord the minister agree that there are a number of benefits which are now payable and which are not on the insurance principle <e> <s> we have discussed in this house the question of disablement benefits <e> <s> if one accepted the ministers logic then all of us should contribute towards a disablement fund but we do not <e> <s> the redundancy payment was introduced in order to cushion the effects of possible long-term unemployment <e> <s> i see no reason whatever why we should try to adopt logic in this case when the principle has been agreed in respect of quite a number of other deserving cases <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister confirm that in addition to the legal manual to which my noble friend referred or the legal advice <e>", "<cs> my lords will not the minister agree that in addition to the comments made by my noble friend the appropriate schedule to the highways act provides that the minister may dispense with an inquiry if he is satisfied that the circumstances are such that it is unnecessary <e> <s> would the minister therefore not agree that the impression he has given is that the minister has made up his mind in this case and has done nothing to allay public concern <e> <s> surely that is a consideration not merely that the minister is satisfied himself but that he must satisfy the public that the thing is correct <e>", "<cs> i am in full agreement with the terms in which my noble friend lord ross has moved this amendment but i should like to put one question both to my noble friend and to the noble earl lord mansfield <e> <s> in the event of this amendment being agreed and we can understand that we do not make agreements with political parties for the purposes which my noble friend has in mind would that debar an agreement with a political party which hired any local authority property for the purpose of a social event or a political meeting <e> <s> if so the amendment would need to be reconsidered so as to ensure that any political party which was hiring for an event was not allowed to display advertisements inside or outside the property for that event <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies the point i was making was about hiring council property <e> <s> having listened to the noble earl i am a little concerned about his reply because in the terms of this clause we are not dealing specifically with an agreement for anyone to have a commercial position such as advertising on the back of a bus <e> <s> there have been elections when a political party has displayed posters on all the roads going into a township the posters being displayed on trees which are owned by the local authority <e> <s> if a local authority so wished this would mean that it could agree to a political party displaying posters on those trees not in return for a commercial payment but simply by agreement with that local authority <e> <s> we are concerned that no local authority should be able to make an agreement with a political party without there being a proper basis for it <e> <s> this clause does not specify such a basis <e>", "<cs> my lords until a few days ago it was my intention only to sit and listen to this very important debate but i am pleased that i am taking part if only to congratulate and thank my noble friend lord beswick for initiating this debate for opening it in such a constructive way and if i may say so for reminding us of the basic philosophy with which many of us joined the labour party <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe is not here but it was a socialist philosophy which enables us to keep in the labour party in order to work out policies which are relevant for the particular time <e>", "<cs> my lords will the clarification which the minister says is likely include determination of the criteria for determining the amount which is legal and the amount which is not legal <e> <s> the noble lord will recall that in a statement which was made in this house three weeks ago he was unable to give me an answer to that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for so clearly explaining the provisions of the bill <e> <s> the minister said that he would not be detaining the house long but this bill involves questions of financing policy and as we have so little opportunity to discuss these matters i may be a little longer in dealing with it <e>", "<cs> my lords first i apologise to the noble lord lord bellwin for the fact that owing to a number of other engagements i shall not be able to be present for his concluding speech <e> <s> i echo other noble lords who welcome this bill as being helpful <e> <s> but may i say that when i first saw clause of part ii relating to the licensing of sex establishments my immediate reaction was that this would give a cloak of respectability to both sex cinemas and sex shops a cloak of respectability to carry on the activities described in paragraphs and of schedule <e> <s> it seemed to give approval to a system of licensing which i thought would be highly undesirable <e> <s> however when i read carefully the various paragraphs of schedule i appreciated that that schedule does set out the possibility of considerable control and what is more the laying down of conditions by the local authority and these are set out in paragraph of the schedule <e> <s> therefore i have concluded that any provision that assists in control of these establishments or assists in laying down conditions as a piece of legislation is well worth while <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the corporate plan submitted by british rail with i think the approval of the unions proposes substantial reductions of manpower in the next five years <e> <s> have there not been reductions of jobs during and another in and have not the transport ministers in thois huse and in the other place complimented british rail on the way that it is tackling the problem <e> <s> in view of the fact that this matter is now the subject of very important negotiations as the noble earl has said would it not be best to leave it there <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister appreciate that many local authorities which have very large waiting lists believe that the sale of council houses presents a bitter problem for them particularly in the light of the fact that the housing starts in were the lowest since the war <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that my noble friend has made a very effective case to which the government really must give answers <e> <s> i want to avoid repeating what my noble friend has said on a number of points but it is clear that his reference to alternative routes is very important <e> <s> i understand that a copy of the preliminary report which was issued by the department in february made clear that the public consultation was very limited in so far as it requested views on only one route which it described as the western route <e> <s> the departments document stated that overall that is the best solution <e> <s> that must imply that other solutions were considered in other words other alternative routes <e> <s> that is reinforced by the departments statement going on to say that the western route is also the least damaging agriculturally <e> <s> a proposal cannot be the least damaging unless other alternatives have been considered <e> <s> therefore that would appear to justify what my noble friend has said about alternative routes <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my pleasant duty first of all to thank and congratulate the noble earl lord shrewsbury upon his maiden speech <e> <s> for someone to speak with such pride of this town of which many noble lords will be aware in a non-controversial manner on this type of bill is a great accomplishment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that any noble lord has wished to discuss part iii of the bill but obviously one must make reference to it in the light of lord foots comments <e> <s> what we are concerned with and what my noble friend was concerned with is part ii of the bill <e> <s> every speaker who has supported lord stanley of alderleys motion has concentrated his remarks on part ii it is part ii of the bill to which the instruction refers <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my point is still valid because these are the sort of matters that one would want to see considered very carefully when the instruction which i hope will be approved by this house is carried through <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble minister will reconsider this <e> <s> he said that of the authorities did not license taxis and presumably hire cars as well <e> <s> he argued that this should only apply in urban areas <e>", "<cs> my lords that assists my argument as much as the original reply <e> <s> this would appear to be a case where frankly the argument in favour of my noble friends amendment is a question of the safeguarding of the public <e> <s> we are not looking at the immediate position but at something for the future <e> <s> the whole provisions are now to be changed because my noble friends amendment to delete schedule has been withdrawn and the new provisions for licensing are all laid down in schedule <e> <s> this would appear to have been an opportunity to have a careful look at the licensing of taxis and hire cars <e> <s> in fact though this may be irrelevant there may well be a case throughout the whole of the united kingdom to have completely separate provisions for hire cars and taxis and not in a bill of this kind because it is such an important provision and deals with the safety of the public <e> <s> it is not something that is being argued for the sake of the taxi operator or the driver <e> <s> it would ensure the proper condition of the vehicle and also of the driver because he would have to be licensed as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friends amendment which is in line with the principles of an amendment which i proposed at committee stage <e> <s> at committee stage the minister said that he would consult the convention of scottish local authorities and the consumer council in scotland and we await with great interest the results of those consultations <e> <s> it has been said to me that the ministers attitude is that of an agnostic awaiting conversion and i hope it may be possible to achieve that conversion tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we on this side of the house support this bill in so far as it puts the greater london council in precisely the same position as local authorities outside london <e> <s> i need hardly say that concessionary fares for the elderly and disabled are vital for the people of london <e> <s> for every three passenger journeys by normal fare-paying passengers there is one concessionary passenger journey <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask whether he can possibly give some information about the criteria <e> <s> this must be about the twelfth time that i have asked <e> <s> when does a figure become lawful and at what level does it become unlawful <e> <s> there must be an answer to this because otherwise we are in an impossible position <e>", "<cs> in support of my noble friend in his amendment i would emphasise one point that he made and that is his reference to traditional may day marches <e> <s> it seems incredible to me that the traditional may day march should be subject to this form of application <e> <s> these are traditional events whatever may be the propaganda associated with them <e> <s> they are held in quite a large number of scottish towns <e> <s> while as a person who has been an election agent i would not encourage marching processions at elections i have taken part in a by-election procession in glasgow <e>", "<cs> my lords am i not correct in saying that the noble earl is referring to his amendment which deals with numbers whereas that of the noble lady lady saltoun is dealing with street names <e> <s> could not the minister agree to bring in another amendment at the next stage to deal with names in the same way as with the numbers <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that if the minister thought that my wording of the amendment was not correct he might suggest alternative wording <e> <s> i see the point which my noble friend lord howie has raised that if one has an election meeting in a public hall one wants to be able to put a poster outside saying that there is going to be an election meeting <e> <s> that point could surely be covered quite simply by something being added to the wording of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to clarify the meaning of the transport london act by empowering the greater london council to make grants towards the current expenses of the london transport executive where such grants appear to the council to be required to provide or secure the provision of such public passenger transport services as best meet the needs for the time being of greater london to provide that such grants shall be treated as revenue of the executive and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords we thank the minister for explaining the order so clearly <e> <s> as he said that its terms had met with the agreement of the local authorities and political parties which had been consulted i need not delay the house for long in giving it support <e> <s> there are however two matters i would raise with the minister <e> <s> first would it be possible in future instead of having such figures as p and p to round off the increases either to whole or half pence and adjust the flat sum accordingly <e> <s> it may be said it is easy to multiply by or but it would be simpler to use round figures and increase the flat rate accordingly and that could be done without affecting the figure we desire to achieve to meet inflation <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few brief words as i did refer to this in my speech at second reading <e> <s> first every noble lord who has spoken has referred to sex shops but the amendment deals with sex establishments and that includes sex cinemas <e> <s> one has to link that up with what is described as these activities both the sex shops and the sex cinema in the terms of schedule <e> <s> it is the activities listed there to which many noble lords including myself take great exception <e> <s> it is not a question of freedom of the individual <e> <s> it is a question whether there is freedom of the individual to interfere with other people and to affect other people and other peoples lives and to affect childrens lives by affecting their outlook <e> <s> i think that is very important <e>", "<cs> in view of the noble lords remarks which to a great extent deal with the second amendment which i have not spoken on <e> <s> i should like to read very carefully what he has said <e> <s> i know that there is anxiety that the report stage should be completed fairly quickly because of the desire to get the bill passed by the end of the month and we wish to assist <e> <s> as i have already said i should like to read what the minister has told us regarding the first amendment and then we can decide what to do at the report <e>", "<cs> i hope your lordships will put on one side the general position of the fares policy of the glc that is not what we are discussing today in this amendment <e> <s> it has been said that to do this would mean applying this condition to greater london only <e> <s> we had considered the possibility of amendments to the bill but we are constrained because the bill is drawn up to provide only for greater london and only to deal with concessions for the disabled and elderly <e> <s> it should not be assumed that other local authorities are not perturbed <e> <s> your lordships will be aware that there has already been a merseyside case on their general fares scheme <e> <s> that was only a decision in the first instance as my noble friend lord mishcon said the original decision in greater london in the first instance was in favour of the greater london council <e> <s> i am certain the noble lord lord bellwin would agree that other local authorities are concerned about the operation of the whole question of fares grants as a result of the judgment <e>", "<cs> this is a matter i am certain we can deal with at a subsequent stage <e> <s> i think we should get the view of the committee on what is the vital principle at stake in this amendment <e>", "<cs> one could open up the whole question of the litter problem which as the noble lord lord evans of claughton said is a disgraceful one in this country <e> <s> but this gives an opportunity of trying to do something <e> <s> while i can appreciate what the minister said about picking on one set of establishments everyone must agree that the development of these take-away food shops has added to the problem and created a very severe problem in areas where there are a number of these places <e> <s> all noble lords will have experience of this <e>", "<cs> as one who was a member of the national fire service for five years i know only too well what happens with a false alarm turnout <e> <s> generally i would support the new clause moved by the noble viscount but there is one question that i should like to raise <e> <s> i am very pleased that on a previous issue i supported the right of an appeal even though it was on a subject about which i had a very emotional disagreement and i thought that it might come back if i did not <e>", "<cs> at second reading i urged that the provisions of this part of the bill should be made mandatory and not permissive as is proposed <e> <s> the point i then made was that many provisions in this bill relate to nuisances and the way to effectively control nuisances <e> <s> in those cases the provisions are permissive <e> <s> but i suggest that in this particular part of the bill dealing with acupuncture ear-piercing and tattooing these are not nuisances <e> <s> they are in effect a health hazard and i should appreciate the comments of persons who are much more learned in this on the medical side <e>", "<cs> if as the noble earl says this is the number of authorities it is extremely limited which means that there is more force then in the point i raised on clause stand part <e> <s> either this should be made mandatory or there must be a determined effort to advise authorities to proceed in this way <e> <s> authorities will not know where the establishments are unless there is some compulsory power to make them register and i doubt whether the department will know precisely how many such establishments there are throughout the country <e> <s> if the only ones who have adopted it are those listed here it suggests we have a very long way to go to avoid the possibility of another outbreak as there was in birmingham in <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that a substantial number of taxi drivers are in the transport and general workers union bus section and that they are very interested in a new design of seat <e> <s> does it surprise the noble lord to hear that up to a few weeks ago when the noble earl first tabled the question the bus section of the t gwu had not been consulted about the matter <e> <s> will he bring his influence to bear to ensure that not only the federation of taxicab operators is consulted but also the t gwu <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that there is a considerable difference between on the one hand an allegation of lack of impartiality and lack of integrity and on the other drawing attention to the unclear position that has been left by a judgment which even the ministers are unable to clarify in so far as they just cannot tell us what figure is reasonable and what is not reasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl sounds persuasive <e> <s> let us look at the arguments he put forward <e> <s> first of all the question of control of fly-posting during an election is not under the representation of the people act it is under the town and country planning regulations <e> <s> it has nothing to do with the electoral register law at all <e> <s> he referred to section <e> <s> to bring in section of the representation of the people act has nothing to do with this <e> <s> we are not suggesting in our amendment that any local authority is going to put up posters for councillor bloggs without the permission of that candidate or his agent <e> <s> with respect to bring forward that argument is ridiculous <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to thank my noble friend lord glenamara for opening this debate with such a compelling speech backed up as it was with so much factual information <e> <s> the fact that he was able to give that information avoids the necessity for me to go over the same ground <e>", "<cs> i am suggesting that the government should publish the actual figures so that we can see them <e> <s> we could check these figures against the estimate of the manpower services commission and against those figures produced by the institute for fiscal studies which i do not believe is a marxist organisation <e>", "<cs> yes i would and that is why i wish to stress this point <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures here show something much more substantial than the figure of to which the noble lord lord cockfield referred <e> <s> i am not prepared to bandy figures about in detail <e> <s> my noble friend says that we should stick to the treasury figures <e> <s> we do know that unemployment costs a considerable amount of money whether it is caused by loss of taxes by loss of vat or because of the unemployment benefits which have to be paid <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my regret that because of other pressing engagements i was unable to hear the opening five speeches in this important debate <e> <s> i speak as one who is proud that my party in government in set the pace in panting independence and self-determination to so many parts of the commonwealth <e> <s> therefore my immediate reaction is to support patriation <e> <s> my immediate reaction is that britains authority over canadas constitution must be ended <e> <s> my noble friend lord brockway referred to outstanding legal cases <e> <s> i believe that we must have information from the government on what will be the position should any of those legal cases be upheld <e> <s> what will be the constitutional and legal position of the bill which is now before us <e> <s> i believe that is a very important point <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of those occasions when i think one can say that one is grateful to the noble lord the minister for his interpretation of this order <e> <s> i only wish that the explanatory note had said some of the things which he has told us about for it says nothing at all about cheap imports or about safety precautions <e> <s> i spent quite a long while going through the whole of schedule to the act to <e>", "<cs> my lords in taking the house to a more placid atmosphere i wish to say only a few words about the bill and indeed i do not think your <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble earl said in his original reply that the government thought that the measures they were taking were the quickest way to deal with this matter does not that show that there is some urgency and why did not the government go further <e>", "<cs> to a number of noble lords particularly myself this debate shows the difficulty which we are in <e> <s> one recognises that there are anomalies that the law is in disrepute and that therefore one needs to change it <e> <s> but the more i hear some of the speeches the more i come to the conclusion that if we can see anomalies in my noble friends amendment the position had better be left as it is <e>", "<cs> before the noble viscount replies i raised this very matter on the civic government scotland bill because there was no item on this matter included in that bill <e> <s> i was told that the matter was receiving consideration by the department of trade in connection with this english bill <e> <s> i hope that the noble lords reply means that the department of trade have considered the matter and decided not to take any action because for all the reasons advanced by the noble viscount one has to protect the innocent people and they are the people who are deluded by these one-day traders <e> <s> if the government consider that the amendment as drafted could be unfair to the honest trader i hope they will take the amendment back and bring forward their own amendment which will tackle the unscrupulous person at the same time as protecting the honest trader <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord referred to the isle of dogs enterprise zone is he able to comment upon recent press reports that there have been some unfortunate delays and disappointments in connection with the launching of this by the london docklands corporation <e> <s> could he comment on those reports <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed with the ministers reply <e> <s> i must clear up one point because in his opening remarks the noble lord said that we must think of the consumers <e> <s> in case that implies that i am speaking on behalf of the taxi trade let me make it absolutely clear that on this occasion i have had no contact at all with the taxi drivers association <e> <s> i have not been asked by them to raise the matter and i have not checked it <e> <s> i was asked to raise this matter by one of the local authorities concerned who are very troubled about the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the purpose of the bill is to restore the position of the greater london council and the london transport executive to that which it was held generally to be prior to the judgment of the noble and learned lords of appeal <e> <s> the importance of londons passenger transport can hardly be overstressed million trips are made each day some per cent <e> <s> of which are in connection with work <e> <s> central london alone provides employment for million persons per cent <e> <s> of whom commute by london transport and british rail <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i am not suggesting that people will buy cars especially to travel into town <e> <s> they already have a car and because they have one they will be tempted to use it and pay instead of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that at this hour after a very interesting debate your lordships will not expect me to speak at any length but i should like to thank all of your lordships who have taken part <e> <s> i noticed that among those taking part were three former chairmen and a former leader of the glc and i should like to thank them for their contributions <e> <s> i also wish to thank the noble lord lord tordoff for his supporting words <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes a point with which i shall deal in some of the following <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that what my noble friend has said will be followed by the point that even if we were able to improve all the main highways with by-passes there still would be the problem of lorries coming off motorways and on to other roads into conurbations warehouses factories and distribution points <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords thesis is correct if one accepts the fourth power law which apparently even armitage has questioned and i am <e>", "<cs> my lords first i must apologise for the fact that i did not hear the noble earls introductory speech <e> <s> that was because i was engaged upstairs in one of your lordships select committees <e> <s> it is generally agreed and this has been emphasised by ministers too that both bnoc and british gas are highly efficient industries and that both have served the country very well <e> <s> therefore right at the outset one must ask why is there talk of introducing competition to achieve efficiency <e> <s> mr nigel lawson the secretary of state for energy speaking during the second reading debate in the other place on th january said when referring to bnoc and i give a brief quotation from column of the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say what a pleasure it is to follow the last noble lords very thoughtful and <e>", "<cs> i agree my lords <e> <s> also we shall shortly be debating in this house another transport bill <e> <s> i will not weary your lordships with all my points but here are just two of them <e> <s> first the testing of heavy goods vehicles and passenger service vehicles will be taken out of the ministry sector and transferred to the private sector when every single body among the operators both private and public opposes this proposal <e> <s> secondly we find that the government having made the position of express coach services successful under their act are now going to propose that the express coach services of the national bus company shall be taken away again lessening the ability of the national bus company to carry out its other services <e>", "<cs> well we can have a debate on that at another time but at the moment i am dealing with the governments policies although i thought i should mention that point in the light of what was said by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e>", "<cs> other countries do this much better than we do particularly countries in the eec <e> <s> they seem to be proud of their public industries <e> <s> why can we not adopt the same attitude <e> <s> i will ask a question <e> <s> why is it that no one has suggested that we should interfere in the bank of england which is a publicly-owned institution <e> <s> why is it that most of the eec countries have the bulk of their banking either in state municipal or co-operative hands <e> <s> we have only per cent <e> <s> of our banking in public hands in any form <e>", "<cs> when replying to my noble friend would the minister also explain how he arrives at the figure of million as the cost to the state when there should be no cost to the state <e>", "<cs> the figure that the noble lord has just given surely proves the point which has already been made that there is no cost to the state <e> <s> i think that a figure in the region of million has been mentioned there is absolutely no cost <e> <s> therefore the reply given <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give an assurance that the ministry will keep in mind the position of many of these individuals in eec states who may have been there for a very long period of years and have very little desire to come back to this country fairly soon <e>", "<cs> for the reasons given by the last two speakers i support the amendment moved by my noble friend <e> <s> reference has been made to the governments retaining of per cent <e> <s> of the shares <e> <s> the clause as drafted makes clear that the government would have power to dispose of per cent <e> <s> of the shareholding <e> <s> admittedly the secretary of state has stated that there is no intention at present of going beyond per cent <e> <s> but the power is there to dispose of the complete per cent <e> <s> shareholding and as we have said so often in this house what is important is not what is said about a bill but what is written in the bill <e> <s> the power is there <e>", "<cs> although we are dealing with clause reference must be made to clause which provides that wherever there is provision for an order under the bill it shall be by negative procedure that is for all the powers given to the secretary of state <e> <s> and the same clause makes clear that where the secretary of state gives a direction to both the oil and gas corporations those directions must be carried out no dubiety about it <e> <s> undoubtedly we shall be told by the noble earl that ministers will of course act reasonably <e> <s> but as we have said on other bills no matter how we might trust the present secretary of state the power is there for any secretary of state to give directions <e> <s> if power for disposal is taken under clause which carries out the provision of clause and the bnoc decides on a scheme for disposal and the secretary of <e>", "<cs> in order to clairfy the matter when i referred to clause i was not saying that it applied to clause <e> <s> i quoted clause as stating quite clearly that wherever an order is to be made under the bill it shall be by the negative procedure <e> <s> that is what i was emphasising <e> <s> then i went on to say that the minister had made it quite clear that a negative order did not apply to clause <e> <s> it was that about which i was protesting first that all orders under the bill are by negative procedure which i thought was wrong i thought that there should be a <e>", "<cs> the minister explained that clause deals with the transfer of the shares from bnoc to the secretary of state <e> <s> that may be covered by later clauses but i should be greatly obliged if the noble earl would point out to me the actual words in clause which deal with what he says <e> <s> subsection makes it quite clear that <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord bishopston and the noble lord lord tanlaw have said to a great extent additional importance has been laid on this amendment because of the experience of amersham international <e> <s> i link with it the experience of cable and wireless and british aerospace <e> <s> reference has been made to the desire for widespread ownership but there has been so much public concern particularly in the financial columns of the newspapers about the report of the public accounts committee in the other place that it is worthwhile recounting some of the details which have been brought out and the behaviour of some of the small shareholders <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for giving way <e> <s> he infers although he says it very nicely that i was critical of ownership by the large institutions <e> <s> let me assure him that i was not <e> <s> the purpose of my comment was because both the noble earl and others had referred to the desire to have the widest spread of shareholders <e> <s> i was pointing out that within a very short space of time the bulk of the small holders of shares had disposed of their shares and we found the bulk of them in the hands of the major institutions <e> <s> of course i am not opposed to pension funds because i have an idea that part of my superannuation comes from the same source <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth for opening this debate <e> <s> he has opened it in a very comprehensive manner and i am certain that he will understand if through lack of time i do not follow him on many of the points that he has raised <e> <s> as he has said the subject is very wide <e> <s> a number of the issues were dealt with in debates over the past months <e> <s> we have debated the transport policy congestion in greater london and the armitage report <e> <s> the points that the noble lord raises do to a great extent open up the whole question of transport policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble earl could give the house an indication of when decisions will be taken bearing in mind the fact that the chairman of the british railways board has made it quite clear that the investment rate for last year could not be used due to the efl and to the fact that there is a badly needed programme of track and rolling stock renewals <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i ask him one question <e> <s> i appreciate that he has endeavoured to deal with many points but there was one very important question concerning <e>", "<cs> there are two brief points that i should like to make on this amendment <e> <s> i agree with practically every criticism that has been made on the amendment put forward by the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> but in considering the whole question of the difficulties of commercial and industrial ratepayers one other matter has been overlooked <e> <s> the lack or absence of adequate services and facilities provided locally can itself have an effect upon the position of employment in particular areas <e> <s> that must be taken into consideration <e> <s> the criticism that i would make of the noble lord lord bellwin is that he continually refers to extravagance in local government <e> <s> we know that there must be some tightening up and there will be subsequent clauses which deal with this <e> <s> but we must not get away from the fact that local government has cut its real spending by <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister check whether the publicity that is usually given in newspapers and by tv shots particularly prior to a general election about the facilities for postal voting includes the fact that medical practitioners should not charge for this and if it does not include it will he ensure that it does so in future <e>", "<cs> it is good to listen to the fresh air from the noble lord lord miles which indicates that this is not a party political amendment <e> <s> if noble lords will look at it the amendment refers to the necessity not to dispose of any subsidiary of british gas if it will imperil the position of the consumer or imperil supplies or imperil safety <e>", "<cs> i am very disappointed with the ministers reply because in effect he has given no reply to the two major points i raised when moving this amendment <e> <s> my first point was what will be the position where there may be no gas standards branch office in the area <e> <s> nobody has any idea of the number of persons who may have to be appointed <e> <s> we know at present in respect of supplies by the corporation that there will always be a person employed by the corporation near at hand but that may not be the situation with supplies to outlying areas <e> <s> that point has not been dealt with <e>", "<cs> my second point concerned private supplies to domestic consumers in outlying areas <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that the noble lord the minister is doing his best to reply to the points raised <e> <s> but really when the committee is told that the members of gas standards branch are at a desk job how does that fit in with the statement made quite clearly that these will be the authorised officers given power under the proposals of the government in this clause to have entry <e> <s> theirs cannot be a desk job if they have powers of entry <e> <s> if it be a desk job we are in a very serious situation and our amendment becomes even more important <e> <s> the minister says that the position of private suppliers may be a rare occurrence i have quoted from the ministers own statement in the other place in committee where he said these may be only peripheral <e> <s> if it is only one private consumer who could be in danger surely we must have adequate safety regulations <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that the work will be carried out by a person appointed by the private supplier <e> <s> can he explain not only to myself but to other noble lords where that is in the bill or will it be covered by regulations <e> <s> it has not been referred to previously <e> <s> in the other place the minister said that the personnel would be members of the gas standards branch <e> <s> if these people are to be employed and paid by the private suppliers surely that ought to be written into the bill <e> <s> if it is in the bill then i must apologise and hope that the noble lord will explain it to me <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord davies to whom we are grateful for initiating the debate and others have provided a number of statistics on population and the degree of poverty in the world <e> <s> as a result i need not with the exception of a few additional points go deeply into those matters <e> <s> we must never lose sight of the fact that one-fifth of the worlds population is today under-nourished and very hungry <e> <s> we must also keep in mind that the estimated increase in population over the next years is as great as was the whole population of the world in the early part of this century <e> <s> that shows the degree of the population increase <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord replies i wonder if he could explain whether or not a town hall or an assembly hall would come under this because in some of these cases these are taken over by professional hirers and that would not be desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to raise an issue here <e> <s> i must apologise to the minister since <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend concludes his speech i wonder whether he would press the minister for an answer to the point he raised about the scottish bill why something which is good for scotland is not good enough for england <e> <s> could my noble friend press the minister to introduce something along the lines of the scottish proposal into this bill at third reading <e>", "<cs> we are opposed to the whole principle of this clause the clause which gives the secretary of state very strong powers to give directions on a number of points to the corporation for others to have rights to use the pipe-lines which belong to the corporation <e> <s> i do not want to go over all the arguments which have come up on a number of the points but i believe that it is necessary to go through the clause to see precisely what are the powers that are being given to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i referred to interruptible supplies to the industrial consumer <e>", "<cs> may i reply to two or three points which have been made <e> <s> having listened to his excellent points one could imagine that the noble earl lord lauderdale had almost drafted clause for the government <e> <s> he said that if there are any differences of opinion clause makes it clear that the final decision is to be left with the secretary of state <e> <s> the noble earl however did not refer to one matter nor did the minister <e> <s> the question of private supplies affects depletion policy <e> <s> this is one reason why we dislike the bill <e> <s> the matter seems to have been ignored and it must be taken into consideration <e>", "<cs> i am very disappointed with the reply <e> <s> on the ministers last point on drafting one could have got over the question of drafting at this late hour by the minister saying we will take the amendment back and redraft a better one <e> <s> we have heard about poor scotsmen i am a poor little ex-londoner and therefore your lordships will have to excuse my wording <e> <s> that would be a very simple matter to dispose of <e> <s> therefore i dismiss the argument about drafting because it is unimportant <e> <s> the government could draft that matter quite satisfactorily if they agreed with the principle <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the ministers comment that the figures which he gave are for england only would he not agree that that is a rather unusual procedure <e> <s> is there any reason why the figures are confined to england <e> <s> has the noble lord the figures for the united kingdom as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that it is fairly simple to close down works and leave towns like corby and consett completely derelict but more important is that there should be measures to provide work in those areas and apparently that that must be done by some form of public enterprise <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the very detailed reply which the minister has given <e> <s> regarding leeds my understanding is that the vacuum which was created there was filled by private hire cars <e> <s> however the problem is that although the council there license these private hire cars they do not control the fares <e> <s> therefore there is a vacuum which is filled in an undesirable way <e> <s> the minister wants it both ways <e> <s> last time his noble friend criticised that amendment on the grounds that i was placing restrictions upon small businesses <e> <s> now it is suggested that i am giving an advantage to operators by trying to allocate different areas to them <e> <s> it seems therefore that according to one amendment i have one argument and that according to another amendment i have a different argument <e>", "<cs> my lords the only other point i would make is that all the criticisms which the minister has made and which the noble lord lord belstead made at the committee stage could have been made at the time when a local authority decided to keep zoning which it was permitted to do under the act <e> <s> yet the law allowed it to do that <e> <s> therefore the law allowed a council to do something which the minister now says is completely undesirable and against the interests of consumers <e> <s> that is one of the important points i am making <e> <s> if the law allowed it then surely it should be possible with all the local knowledge for a council to go back if it wished to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord chitnis for opening this very important matter even though it may be at this late hour <e> <s> as one who was privileged to be a member of the parliamentary delegation which observed the zimbabwe election in i recognise only too well the task of the two government observers of the el salvador election <e> <s> as the noble lord has said their terms of reference were rather confined <e> <s> they were stated by the lord privy seal in the other place on nd march <e> <s> it is clear that the terms of reference were confined to the actual election process and the election campaign and there is no doubt and their own spokesman has said that that excluded consideration of human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree with the comments by the ctcc and confirmed in british rails own annual report that part of the problem is due to the financial targets and the fact that british rail has therefore had to spend million less on investment as a consequence of trying to reach the financial targets <e> <s> has the noble earl seen the report that appeared in the press only this week that british rail has had to throw out its timetables for the excellent london-birmingham route because of the backlog of work required on the track and that consequently there are speed restrictions between london and rugby <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make a brief intervention in support of my noble friend because <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain all noble lords are very grateful to the noble baroness for putting this motion before the house and for the very thoughtful and constructive way in which she opened the subject <e> <s> as she said the action programme arose out of the special conference held in march last year <e> <s> i did not attend the conference but the action programme caused me to re-read the proceedings of the conference and as the noble baroness said it was full of practical proposals and it was one of the successful events in the international year for disabled people <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend <e> <s> so far the remarks that have been made have emphasised the safety aspect <e> <s> in fact the noble earls comments were mainly on the safety aspect <e> <s> therefore perhaps for a moment i can keep to that <e> <s> however there are two other points to which i want to return <e> <s> we added at the committee stage the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support my noble friend in her amendment for the reasons i gave previously but i must remind the house of those reasons <e> <s> i should like to pay my tribute to the keen interest and conscientious way in which the noble baroness lady macleod looks at these important questions of safety <e> <s> she has tried to deal with safety in her own amendment <e> <s> as i said in the debate on amendment no <e> <s> the question goes far beyond safety <e> <s> we must not look only at the necessary safeguards purely from the aspect of safety <e> <s> there are also other aspects <e> <s> the noble earl in his reply dealt adequately with the other points <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that it is unwise to make a very important electoral change of this kind just for one series of elections that this matter would affect the representation of the people act and that it ought to he considered by a speakers conference and not just for one election <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been mentioned and as your lordships will see from the marshalled list amendments nos <e> <s> and which follow the amendment of the noble baroness all stand in my name and that of my noble friends <e> <s> i am only too happy to support the noble baroness in her amendment and i hope that it may be possible for the minister to accept her amendment in preference to mine <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that while there is an anomaly with the present position if one made the deposit too high one could be hitting at democratic representation and that that would literally upset at least one section of the alliance in the light of the number of deposits which they lost at the last election <e> <s> but is this not far too serious a matter to be discussing in this sort of way and have the government any inclination either to call a speakers conference to deal with this and many other very important matters or to recall the electoral advisory committee <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear members say hear hear but it is a very strange statement from the secretary of state for employment whose duty it is to get the best possible industrial relations with trade unions and with employers <e> <s> the secretary of state is not here but i would put a question to him <e> <s> surely he must have read the reports of the trades union congress from time to time <e> <s> surely he must have read the reports of various unions <e> <s> surely it is recognised that unions do not just exist for strikes that these reports will show the vast amount of constructive activity which is carried out by trade unions <e> <s> i should like to see that reflected in the statement of the secretary of state but i regret to say that it is not there <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the intervention by the noble earl but if one looks at all the statements made by the secretary of state one finds that they always have this bent towards anti-trade unionism <e> <s> that is the point that i am trying to make <e> <s> almost the last words of the last paragraph of the speech which the secretary of state made at third reading are <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the first debate associated with foreign affairs or disarmament that i have addressed in your lordships house and i do so because i have played a small part in the work of the world disarmament campaign being the chairman of a sub-committee which had certain arrangements in connection with the organisation of a petition which secured the magnificent total of million signatures <e> <s> i should like to express my thanks to my noble friend lord brockway not only for initiating this important debate but for the work he has done for the world disarmament campaign and the inspiration he has been to that campaign and for his work for so many years for the things in which he believes <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will be grateful once again to the noble lord lord bellwin for the very clear way in which he has put forward the clauses and purposes of this bill <e> <s> it is as he said the third transport bill in the life of this parliament and the third time that he and i have faced each other across the dispatch box to deal with the matter <e> <s> as before <e> <s> it deals with very important road traffic law matters and also with measures of privatisation <e> <s> i only wish as i said on previous bills that there had been separate bills because parts iii and iv are entirely non-political and cover matters which we should deal with purely on the basis of common sense in approaching road traffic matters <e> <s> they are free of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for asking that question because when i said that i supported my noble friend lady denington in moving an amendment in favour of wheel clamps when the last bill was introduced i should have made it quite clear that i am still in support of the proposal <e> <s> but as i have also emphasised i want it to be carried through as an experiment <e> <s> i believe it will be successful <e> <s> the government want it to be an experiment <e> <s> what we must ensure in the bill is that it is laid down to be an experiment and that it will not continue without affirmative resolution from both houses <e> <s> the point i was making about removal is that there is a clause in the bill which provides that whereas many wheel clamps will be put on the car where it is stationary they can move it to another place and put the clamp on there <e> <s> that appeared to me to be a little foolish <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that the whole question of congestion was dealt with very effectively on a non-party discussion basis in this house in a debate on the problems of congestion in greater london <e> <s> would he acknowledge that the transportation department of the glc has given considerable attention to the problem <e> <s> in addition to the points the minister mentioned is it not a fact that an important question in addition to enforcement is the need to ensure that the clearways are left open and there is adequate and efficient public transport <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl the minister confirm that i am correct in assuming that his reply to the noble lord lord lucas means that the government are still in full support of the proposal for road humps as contained in the bill <e> <s> secondly could he say whether any discussions at all have taken place with the organisations which the minister is required to consult about the contents of these regulations <e> <s> have any consultations taken place yet <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> can he give some assurance that the report might be available before discussion of the employment bill is concluded <e> <s> is it not a fact that the work was commissioned by the department of employment at some cost to the taxpayer and therefore is it not of vital importance to have the information in the report available for the discussions on the employment bill <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl also aware that in addition to this noble lord raising the <e>", "<cs> my lords will not the government keep in mind that it is essential that as many as possible of the local services shall be kept in the hands of elected representatives for local decision and that that should apply in the case of london transport as in regard to any other body <e> <s> to follow up the supplementary question of my noble friend lord plant will the government keep in mind that no matter what authority is in charge of london transport unless the financial aid is up to the same level as that provided in practically every other capital city in europe we shall not have an effective transport service for london <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put another supplementary question arising from that of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> would not the situation which the noble lord puts forward be helped if the county councils which are in a position to give grants to london transport from their transport supplementary grant <e> <s> did so which my own county of essex with a conservative majority does not <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for repeating the statement and from this side of the house i should like to express and share concern about the effect of the industrial action on the travelling public and on industry <e> <s> we also appreciate only too well the possible effects of the action on our railway system <e> <s> bearing that point in mind does the minister appreciate that men do not lightly take action such as this <e> <s> is that not sufficient reason why the minister should act and should not content himself with issuing strictures and homilies <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble earl for repeating the statement <e> <s> let me make it quite clear that we welcome the decisions taken democratically by the nur conference this week <e> <s> from these benches also we would deplore any new industrial action which could have a disabling effect on industry and the travelling public and imperil the future of the great railway industry <e> <s> but is it sufficiently appreciated that the attitude of the aslef executive is dictated by the democratic decision of its own conference on the question of rostering arrangements <e> <s> does it not now appear that aslef is prepared to move <e> <s> i regret the one-sided nature of the statement when what is required is the exercise of common sense and statesmanship to help aslef to make that move and that type of attitude i regret to say is missing from the statement <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry that the noble lord the minister has not replied to the question of my noble friend lord mishcon about the per cent <e> <s> obviously that is a point which is worrying the noble lord lord teviot <e> <s> this is a very important question and we shall be dealing with it in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this question will have considerable effect on what the minister speaking on behalf of the government referred to as the great opportunity that we might miss if we do not agree with the governments proposals to transfer national express from the national bus company <e> <s> the minister referred to the act but our most important questions regarding the act were about the possible effect on stage carriage services <e> <s> whatever else has happened following the act and deregulation to help national express coaches certainly there has been no improvement in terms of the great mass of private operators wishing to go into the stage carriage services <e> <s> that simply has not happened <e> <s> the minister has not answered the quite clear statements that were made about the integrated nature of nbc including the national express coach services <e> <s> i was pleased that the noble lord lord teviot from his practical experience was able to join in the discussion on this question because the flexible use of coaches and crews is a vital part of the integrated nature of the national bus company <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord teviot put some very pertinent points which are the most important points for supporting the amendment before the committee <e> <s> although the minister as usual was very persuasive in his argument frankly he in effect admitted the case <e> <s> there is no answer to the point made by the noble lord lord teviot once you say that the whole control of any subsidiary will pass <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord the minister for agreeing to take a look at this in the light of our debate <e> <s> similarly we on this side will take a careful look at the debate to see whether we should bring forward a differently worded amendment if the government themselves do not bring forward an amendment <e> <s> may i deal with one other point because the minister agreed that there could be exceptional circumstances but in such a case there would be consultation with the minister <e> <s> but again we are dealing with the words in the bill <e> <s> not necessarily this government but another government could be even more determined than the present government to smash all question of public ownership <e>", "<cs> they could be and therefore we may be in a position of facing exceptional circumstances and yet no consent of the secretary of state is required <e> <s> that is what concerns us <e> <s> if there is consent by the secretary of state for the sale of any part of the shares then we believe there ought to be consent of the secretary of state for disposal elsewhere although we accept the point that it is not wanted for the disposal of an odd bus here and there <e> <s> since the minister is going to take a look at this as we are i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry the minister has taken that view on behalf of the government <e> <s> he did say that to accept this amendment would leave the way open to possible technical challenges to frustrate the will of parliament <e> <s> that is not the intention of the amendment <e> <s> i am sure it must be the will of parliament that all the points set out in this amendment shall be observed by the secretary of state before he gives consent to any disposal <e> <s> i am sure everybody agrees that this is what should be done and surely what we ought to do is to put those safeguards in the bill <e> <s> that is all the amendment is seeking to do <e>", "<cs> the minister has said that if this was carried it would have implications of massive scale <e> <s> i would ask the committee to let us have the implications of such a massive scale <e> <s> surely the logic which my noble friend lord mishcon has just put forward to the committee cannot be answered <e> <s> the minister has confirmed that this is only a reserve power <e> <s> he said that he hoped there would be sweet reasonableness and hoped there would be an agreed solution but then as my noble friend lord mischon says there could be an argument <e> <s> the minister then says i dont care what you the national bus company say or what the county council concerned say <e> <s> i am now instructing you <e>", "<cs> the minister has said that the amendment would give authority to the national bus company to refuse a direction <e> <s> i readily admit that that might be an error in the drafting clearly that is not what is intended <e> <s> what we wish to lay down is that the minister shall not give a direction if it is against the duties placed on the bus company under the act <e> <s> the noble lord said that the duties not powers i must not use that word laid down in the act would not be affected by the proposals for disposal in the bill <e>", "<cs> we are very grateful for the ministers statement <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that assurance and we shall read very carefully what he has said <e> <s> it should be borne in mind that we are not opposed to the development of proper schemes <e> <s> in fact i believe a press notice was issued only recently a few days ago which said that the bus company had entered into an agreement with its own pension fund for the development of a particular property without requiring any instructions at all either from parliament or from the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister just a few points on this <e> <s> clause is the one which deals with the provision of services for related companies whereby the bus company can i understand enter into any commercial agreement with a related company that is one to which it has disposed of property to provide maintenance services and so on to the related company <e> <s> may i ask if the services are to be permitted to a related company could there not also be powers to the national bus company to give similar services on a commercial basis to any other body provided of course it is not a competitor of the national bus company which they would not wish to do <e>", "<cs> i am certain that the committee is grateful for the comments of the minister as well as for the points made by the noble lord lord byers which i assure him we will take into very serious consideration <e> <s> what one must have regard to and this deals with the point of the noble lord lord mottistone is that we are not dealing with persons who are made redundant because of economic problems or with men who by choice have decided to go somewhere else <e> <s> we are dealing with employees who are affected by a decision of parliament which has said that a certain property or subsidiary may be disposed of <e> <s> the workers have to follow a decision about disposal because their subsidiary has been transferred to the private sector <e> <s> that is the problem which we have to consider <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his explanation <e> <s> as the other points which he has made were covered in the debate which we had on amendment no <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it was my intention to deal with the matter in the way that i have in order not to confine myself to the narrow path of the amendment but to deal with the whole question of whether clause shall stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am delighted that the minister has emphasised the safety consideration because that is what the operators organisations have been concerned about throughout the whole of their discussions on this particular issue <e>", "<cs> i shall be happy to beg leave to withdraw and i am grateful to the minister for drawing attention to that <e> <s> as he proposes to look at the wording and we shall do the same that will be satisfactory and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> there are one or two points on clause <e> <s> can the minister give some assurance that whatever may be the final decision on the testing authority or authorities there will be a uniformity of charges throughout the country <e> <s> at committee stage in the other place the minister said that no doubt cross-subsidisation will continue even if there were a number of separate chains <e> <s> i wonder whether that is still confirmed <e> <s> although the government are looking at the possibility of a single agency or single <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> clause agreed to <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for explaining the situation clearly though it still leaves the position confounded because it links up with the debate we had on pensions for the national bus company staff <e> <s> while their present entitlements will be safeguarded by the schemes to which the minister referred their expectation on which at present they rely bearing in mind that they are being transferred from the civil service possibly without any desire to be transferred is different and those individuals are in rather a predicament <e> <s> we understand from the quotation i gave from the under-secretarys remarks that one of the purposes of the scheme is not purely one of safety but to save civil service posts <e> <s> that was an unfortunate statement to have made <e> <s> in consequence those persons may find that their future pensions are not what they thought they would be had they stayed with the civil service <e> <s> this is an issue we shall have to link with the consideration being given to the nbcs pensions position <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> i am grateful and i am certain that my noble friend is also grateful to the minister for giving an assurance that he will look at the particular phrase with which we are concerned <e> <s> i do not want to detain the committee unduly but before we depart i should like to mention one question which interests me in particular <e> <s> why do we have this provision in the bill <e> <s> there is provision for interim companies in the transport bill now the transport act <e> <s> there is a provision there for disposal of british rail subsidiaries <e> <s> if my memory serves me correctly and i apologise if i am wrong i do not think that the transport act contains provision such as we have here for loans to an interim company <e> <s> therefore i query why in this case it is thought necessary to have provision regarding loans made to an interim company in which the secretary of state has a controlling interest <e>", "<cs> i have one question to ask the minister on this clause <e> <s> subsection says <e>", "<cs> i had better explain the procedural difficulty in which the noble lord lord lucas and i find ourselves <e> <s> i am certain other noble lords in the committee are also in this difficulty <e> <s> it will be noticed that this first amendment which is a paving one is in the names of the noble lord lord lucas and myself <e> <s> we had intended to deal with two different sets of consequential and subsequent amendments <e> <s> the noble lord lord lucas has explained that the purpose of his paving amendment is primarily to introduce amendment no <e> <s> which will take out subsection whereas i wanted to introduce paving amendment no <e> <s> in order to introduce amendment no <e> <s> which deals with some of the points contained in subsection <e>", "<cs> the noble earl implied that by this amendment i was endeavouring to introduce a new two-tier system <e> <s> i said that what the amendment was seeking to do was to put into the bill what is the present law in the road traffic regulation act section <e> <s> i said i would not read it but perhaps i had better read it because that will let noble lords know exactly what i am endeavouring to do <e>", "<cs> i have only two or three brief points to make <e> <s> i am in full sympathy with the aim behind the amendment moved by the noble lord lord teviot which is to endeavour to remove obstructions in particular from clearways and urban highways so that traffic can flow smoothly <e> <s> all of us are in complete agreement that this is what we are aiming for but when i look at the new clause proposed by lord teviots amendment no <e> <s> which is the important amendment in the list of amendments which he has moved it appears to me that the same criticism could be made as was made of the amendment which i moved <e> <s> it appears that if the fixed penalty is paid within the proper period that finishes the matter but if it is not paid there can be discretionary disqualification <e> <s> this is going much further than what even suggested <e> <s> it appears to me to be one anomaly <e> <s> further while the obstruction of clearways experimental traffic routes and so on is something to be avoided ought it to carry the possibility of disqualification <e> <s> if it is serious enough for disqualification i believe that the committee ought to look at the list of offences which are in the act <e> <s> we may find there much lighter penalties for offences which are just as serious <e> <s> the two points i have made are critical of the amendment even though i agree with its general aims and objectives <e>", "<cs> the noble earl referred to the question i posed to him <e> <s> i accepted his answer in the spirit in which it was given <e> <s> but if at that time i had read the committee stage in another place and had known that extracts of the report had been referred to i would have pressed the noble earl much further <e>", "<cs> i hope that we shall not have the same position as we had as regards the previous amendment where we started debating the principle of the clause as in a clause stand part debate instead of discussing the actual terms of the amendment <e> <s> it does not matter whether noble lords agree with the principle laid down in clause or whether they disagree with it we can still consider the amendment on its merits and that is what i hope the government will do <e>", "<cs> my lords i seem to recall on a previous occasion when this matter came before the house that i asked a question about other ceilings within the house itself <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble earl can tell us whether a survey has been conducted and if so the results <e>", "<cs> i shall look forward to hearing what my front bench have to say on this and i also look forward to hearing the comments of the noble viscount the minister <e> <s> i have considerable sympathy with the points raised by the noble earl lord halsbury and by the noble lord lord howie <e> <s> however there are one or two problems involved <e> <s> first i take the point of the noble lord lord howie that the last thing i want to do as a person with no professional qualifications at all is to draw any distinction between people in professional organisations and those whom we term outside the professions as the ordinary working-class <e> <s> i think that would be a fatal thing to do <e>", "<cs> assuming a man is dismissed from his employment as a result of a ballot on a closed shop as he goes to the tribunal and it all depends on the voting percentage what does the industrial tribunal do <e> <s> does it say go to the high court or deal with it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with some considerable diffidence that i follow a former prime minister of northern ireland in the remarks i have to make <e> <s> i also appreciate that there are other noble lords in our house today with considerable experience of northern ireland direct personal and almost daily involvement in northern ireland <e> <s> but i think it is also important particularly in view of what the noble earl lord gowrie said about the responsibilities placed upon the rest of the people of the united kingdom and the burdens which the rest of the people in the united kingdom have to bear that others than those directly connected with northern ireland should say something on this important matter <e> <s> i speak also to support my noble friend

will recall that when we last met on this bill the noble lord lord lucas proposed an amendment which was to delete subsection i consider this not only an acceptable amendment but one which is highly desirable <e>", "<cs> may i first ask a technical question <e> <s> reference is made in the amendment to the road traffic regulation act and section <e> <s> looking at the particular act i am wondering whether there should be reference also to section dealing with speed limits on special roads <e> <s> i put that point first in case the noble earl has not got an answer and might get advice before the debate on this amendment closes <e> <s> i would give general support to the principle behind the amendment which the noble lord lord lucas has moved but there are some points involved <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his reply <e> <s> i shall certainly look very carefully at what he has said <e> <s> it appears to me that this comes down to a question on a later amendment as to the guidance which chief officers may give to their police constables <e> <s> in the circumstances therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will not take too much to heart the last point made by the noble earl the minister <e> <s> so far as i am concerned it would not matter if there were only cases <e> <s> we made it quite clear on second reading that while we wished to see the system improve so that we can take many of these offences away from the courts there must be no question of injustice <e> <s> neither must there be any question of there being persons who ought to be dealt with differently getting through the net merely to make things easier for the court procedures <e> <s> having said that i will take careful note of what the noble earl has said <e> <s> the fact that an offence is non-endorsable does not necessarily mean that there are not many occasions when it could be very serious <e> <s> the problem arises of the option the police constable has to choose when he is not the constable who actually waved down the motorist but is the constable further along the road <e> <s> yet he is in the position of having to make a decision on the option <e> <s> there are points either way <e> <s> i will read very carefully what the minister has said and now beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> can the minister give any information about the reason why there is no amendment in the same place as my amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> having heard the ministers explanation i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if i may follow up the point made by the noble baroness i can see some problems <e> <s> all being well i shall be spending a holiday again in the north-west highlands <e> <s> god forbid that i should come up on any fixed penalty procedure <e> <s> if i should and i am not allowed to present my licence at a police station in scotland and i have still quite a long period of my holiday left what do i do make a long joruney down to england and then a journey back again <e> <s> i do not expect the noble earl to answer now because he may not have the information but i want to put that on record so that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate can see it and give the answer at our next stage <e>", "<cs> i wish to thank those noble lords and the noble baroness who have supported the general principle of the amendment <e> <s> i also wish to thank the minister for his sympathetic approach to what we are seeking <e> <s> the noble earl mentioned that in the light of the figures i should consider where i ought to live <e> <s> i have been considering very briefly where members of my family live and i think that there is something in what the noble earl has said <e> <s> i see a great advantage in one regard but not in another <e>", "<cs> these are two pages of amendments here <e> <s> i am grateful for the explanation but the noble earl will appreciate that when we read the explanation and have a careful look at the amendments we may or may not want to come back on report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in the unfortunate position of being a most inadequate shadow for my noble friends lord mccarthy and lord wedderburn but i am very grateful to the noble lord the minister in particular for two things <e> <s> the first is the very courteous way in which yesterday evening he agreed to withdraw these orders for hours following the request which i made <e> <s> it is a very complicated business and i am certain that many noble lords will still feel it is as complicated now even though we are most grateful for the very detailed explanation by the noble lord lord glenarthur has given to the various points raised by my noble friends <e> <s> i am certainly very grateful for the information he has given and i am also grateful to my noble friends for the astute investigations which they made at the very last moment in order to raise these points and to get the explanations we have had <e> <s> i believe that this is part of the essential parliamentary scrutiny of legislation and orders which come before this house <e>", "<cs> when one hears some of the speeches in your lordships committee one feels that one has been here before because the same arguments seem to occur on almost every clause of the bill the rights and wrongs of trade unionism <e> <s> i was not going to speak to this clause but when one listens to speeches one wants to hear sympathy for the trade unionst <e> <s> i want to see sympathy for well-organised trade unions with large memberships but when one reads the committee stage in another place one has a feeling that <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord lord campbell of alloway will allow me to intervene i was saying that it is nonsense to suggest that the whole purpose of this clause is to deal with the position of local authorities <e> <s> one has to consider speeches made in the other place by ministers in particular dealing with district auditors <e>", "<cs> i was disappointed with the argument put forward by the noble lord lord glenarthur but in another way i was pleased that he put it forward in such a stark way because it showed the real position that the government wish to adopt on this matter <e> <s> i am wondering where the government have got their advice <e> <s> why is it that very few employers have used this discretion which is there already to join a trade union or other person <e> <s> why have they not used that discretion <e> <s> i wonder where the government have got their advice now to allow this joinder to be made by an employee <e> <s> surely there is going to be a lot of diflerence in the exercise of this discretion between an employer who has all the responsibilities and a dismissed employee who will not have the same sense of responsibility or sense of discretion when it comes to deciding what to do <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend in his challenge to clause stand part and also to follow up the point made by the noble lord lord rochester because he and i raised this point on second reading <e> <s> the noble earl lord ferrers replied <e> <s> i will not weary the committee by going through what he actually said but he referred to the fact that it is necessary for an employer to dismiss all those on strike which is what we knew already but he made no reference to this part on re-engagement and one has to look very carefully to compare what he said with what the notes on clauses say <e> <s> the notes on clauses say referring to subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that this type of question in the middle of what could be a disastrous industrial dispute is hardly helpful to achieving settlement <e> <s> can the minister not agree that over the last years the trade unions in the railway industry have a great record of improved productivity <e> <s> can the minister indicate how much has already been saved by the productivity measures how much will be saved by flexible rostering on the locomotives only and how much has already been lost by this disastrous strike <e> <s> would it not be better if the minister not this minister but the secretary of state instead of making threatening speeches did something about trying to settle the strike which could have been done on an agreement which was reached on experimentation with alternative flexible rostering <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked the noble lord whether he could indicate how much would be saved per year by adopting flexible rostering for the locomotive men <e> <s> if the minister does not have the answer perhaps he could write to me because aslef have claimed that the saving would be only million a year <e>", "<cs> in supporting the objection to this new clause i should also like to take into consideration some of the points which might have been made last night on clause stand part if there had been time because they are somewhat inter-related <e> <s> i could hardly believe my ears when the reasons for this new clause were given by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> it may be that some of us are wrong but it hits at the very principles and beliefs for which some of us have strived for over half a century and have tried to do it with a sense of moderation believing that our way was the right way to achieve them <e>", "<cs> may i say that what the noble baroness has just said is what i want because i do believe that public contracts should not go to firms which do not observe trade union conditions and which oppose trade union agreements <e> <s> i am certain that the social democratic party will find itself in very great trouble if that proves not to be the policy of the social democratic party <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to intervene on a matter in which the legal luminaries are involved but i think it necessary for a plain person to look at the matter <e> <s> i said to some of my colleagues that although we would be up all night we would be wasting our time because it seemed the government were determined not to agree to change even a comma in the bill <e> <s> on this series of amendments although my noble friends are strongly opposed to the whole clause we are trying to make it sensible in relation to union rule books <e> <s> some of the points made by my noble friend lord wedderburn show conclusively that the government are not helping to make matters clear in that context <e> <s> take the very point we are discussing <e> <s> as an ordinary individual has come to the knowledge does not seem even to me to be a well-defined phrase <e> <s> the provision says <e>", "<cs> the bill does not refer to a deputy <e> <s> i should have thought it would be sensible for the noble and learned lord to say that at least a few of the points which we have made are worthy of consideration and that while he may not accept them now he will study them <e> <s> it seems that the government have dug their heels in and no matter what may be said not a dot or comma will be changed <e> <s> we are not debating an enormous issue but it is one the government should re-examine to avoid possible legal cases becoming protracted in the courts simply because the matter is not clear in the bill <e> <s> whatever else noble lords opposite may think of my noble friends lord mccarthy and lord wedderburn i think it will be agreed that they know more about union rule books and have seen more of them for different unions than anybody in this committee <e>", "<cs> there are others <e>", "<cs> i rise to say just a few words in order to indicate quite clearly that everything my noble friend has said is i think i can say fully supported by all the members on these benches <e> <s> members opposite smile but we are really serious on this issue <e> <s> i should like the minister who is to reply to justify why in this clause the government are taking steps to remove the possibility of international solidarity <e> <s> i should have thought that this was one thing upon which the whole committee would be united whether it be to avoid cheap labour whether it be to avoid action possibly being taken on the blacking of supplies to dictator countries like el salvador where supplies may be used against progressive forces or whether it be in order to prevent non-union activities in certain countries <e> <s> it seems to me that this is international solidarity where one ought to give support <e>", "<cs> there are one or two points which my noble friend lord mishcon wishes to raise on the legal aspect but may i ask the noble and learned lord the lord advocate whether we can be assured that although there are differences in scottish law the treatment for fixed penalty offences does not vary in scotland compared with the rest of england and wales <e> <s> if it does naturally we should like to see what can be done about it <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for repeating the statement <e> <s> if allowed to continue of course this would be a national disaster not only the effect on the travelling public on industry and the future of british rail but also the wellbeing of all workers of all unions employed by british rail <e> <s> it is a tragedy that it should happen especially as months ago the british rail board and the unions were working in close harmony on the development plan for the years to <e>", "<cs> may i briefly support the general tenor of lord lucass remarks and not necessarily support the deletion of schedule which is one of his later amendments because that would bring complications <e> <s> i appreciate the points that are made about scots law being different <e> <s> the last thing i would wish to do is to cause cross-border difficulties <e> <s> but an issue might be satisfactory if it is something that is being dealt with for the scots alone but this will not be for the scots alone <e> <s> it will be for the people of england and wales who may be visiting scotland <e> <s> therefore it affects people other than scots <e> <s> even though it may not be possible to deal with it in this bill at this time i should like to ask the noble and learned lord the lord advocate whether it is not possible for ministers to get together for those responsible for that report to get together so that on these issues of traffic law and regulations we can at least have some common treatment <e>", "<cs> i too wish briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> i supported the principle of it last year and i also spoke on it on the second day of the committee stage in relation to another amendment of the noble lord lord lucas <e> <s> so obviously i do not intend to change my attitude within a short period <e> <s> it is not so much a question of waiting to see how the points system works <e> <s> rather it is a question of whether or not all speeding offences deserve three points <e> <s> we know that there are a number of types of speeding offence that are very serious but there are other types that are purely technical <e> <s> i do not suppose that there is a noble lord in the chamber who does not share that view <e> <s> a motorist might build up four or five sets of points yet each set might arise from a mere technical offence that has caused no danger at all to anyone <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord lucas has said the purpose of his amendment is to leave out three conditions which a licensing authority may attach to an operators licence <e> <s> we ought to look again at what the three conditions are and i shall paraphrase them the number type and size of vehicles or trailers which may at any one time be at an operating centre the parking arrangements provided at or in the vicinity of the operating centre and the hours at which operations may be carried out <e> <s> i regard these as absolutely essential conditions <e> <s> without them any talk of environmental control appears to make nonsense <e> <s> i shall not weary the committee by quoting from the foster committees report on haulage operators licensing or the armitage committees report on lorries people and the environment <e> <s> but both of those reports recognise that environmental difficulties are associated mainly with places from which vehicles are operated <e> <s> that view was confirmed by the under-secretary of state when this matter was dealt with in committee in the other place <e>", "<cs> it was not my intention to speak on this amendment because i thought that i had said what i had to say on the other amendment <e> <s> i thought <e>", "<cs> i think the answer is that the bill is now giving the licensing authorities power to deal with licensing on environmental grounds which they have not had up to now <e> <s> that is the point <e> <s> i do not think that there is a great deal of argument between us <e> <s> the difference is that if we try to write in all the safeguards that are wanted then frankly the aims of the foster committee the aims of the armitage committee the aims of the government and i believe the aims of many noble lords in this committee will be completely and utterly frustrated <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether we can have guidance on this <e> <s> the department has given me a form in which the amendments should be grouped and it seems sensible <e> <s> to take them all together would seem to me to be an unwise procedure and i would much prefer if the noble lord agrees to take them in the form that the department has agreed on <e>", "<cs> was not going to be the main group <e> <s> it is a government amendment plus and <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the reference to dragooning came in <e> <s> i could go through the list here and tell you what each amendment is going to do and the reasons why they should be as they are <e>", "<cs> on second reading i too voiced criticism of this provision but the noble baroness lady gardner converted me with the view she has repeated tonight and i accept her argument immediately <e>", "<cs> this is one of the occasions when the noble lord lord lucas and i come together again and i think that the principle that he is advancing is the right one <e> <s> i shall support clause when we come to the question of whether the clause shall stand part though of course there might be differences among us on how certain decisions should be taken <e> <s> one of the arguments for the scheme is based on the element of persistence <e> <s> the constable will have authority to decide and i believe that a <e>", "<cs> the notes on clauses explain in regard to subsection of the clause that work that can be done by another person authorised by a police constable includes immobilisation release and the collection of charges <e> <s> surely it will be necessary to put into the bill something different from another person <e> <s> another person could be anyone <e> <s> while the police may decide what they are going to do surely there ought to be some guidance given as to who another person should be particularly if he is going to have authority to collect charges <e>", "<cs> speaking for myself i welcome the offer of the noble earl and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i believe he said that any areas would be involved by affirmative resolution procedure <e> <s> i think that that is what i heard <e> <s> we are providing for that in our subsequent amendments which we have not reached <e> <s> but subsection says <e>", "<cs> i am very pleased that the noble earl has emphasised the experimental nature of the proposals <e> <s> when introducing the new clause in the other place the secretary of state said <e>", "<cs> i wish to express general approval with the line the noble lord lord lucas is taking although the wording of the amendment may need some adjustment <e> <s> for instance i am a little concerned with the words <e>", "<cs> we have had such an airing of this that i need be only very brief <e> <s> i can understand all the problems <e> <s> that is why it is that among other noble lords i have been so insistent that we should treat this as of an experimental nature and that should remain quite clear right through the piece <e> <s> the noble lord lord lucas said that there has been a bankruptcy of ideas but i know and the noble baroness lady denington will be able to confirm what i am saying that the glc through its transportation department has been considering this is completely non-political there are no politics in this the problem of londons congestion <e> <s> over a period of years it has been considering all sorts of ways to tackle it <e> <s> i have been told that cars were towed away in one year <e>", "<cs> i am pleased that the noble lord lord tanlaw has tabled this amendment <e> <s> it may be that the criticism of the word bikeways is valid but i can see what the noble lord is trying to achieve he is trying to go beyond what we used to call cycle paths <e> <s> i can no longer declare an interest i could have done many years ago when i was a cycle club captain <e> <s> in those days i cycled miles each way to west-minister <e> <s> frankly i would think twice about doing it today not because of my age but because there are now to million cars on the roads compared with about million when i used to cycle <e> <s> unless there is some provision of special bikeways it is dangerous for people to journey by cycle <e>", "<cs> what the noble lord has said about the drafting of the amendment would appear to be forceful <e> <s> i shall certainly take that into account <e> <s> but the other arguments put forward against it frankly seem to me not to have any logic at all <e> <s> before i pass on to that on the question of regulations there surely must be some provision for parliament to be able to say to a government you have this power <e> <s> we want you to use it and not just rely upon when a government feel that they will introduce a regulation <e> <s> i shall therefore to have look at that aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am mainly disappointed with the ministers reply but encouraged in one direction that the transport and road research laboratory are conducting an investigation and with with the noble earl lord kinnoull i hope that it will be fairly quick in reporting <e> <s> i am grateful to those noble lords who have supported the amendment <e> <s> i believe that of the six speakers who joined in the debate four supported the amendment <e> <s> it is said that there is no conclusive evidence <e> <s> why have british car manufacturers installed laminated windscreens to the tune of at least per cent <e> <s> surely they have done that based on their research and the british car industry has done quite detailed research <e> <s> why do practically all models of one british car manufacturer have laminated glass windscreens <e> <s> they must be satisfied that it is a great improvement and a development which ought to be encouraged <e>", "<cs> i do not think the committee would wish me to re-open the debate <e> <s> i am just trying to deal with the points which have arisen <e> <s> both the minister and i referred to personal accidents and i believe that his was the same as mine <e> <s> mine was not as a result of impact it was as a result of splinters on the road <e> <s> if there is impact the small pieces fly towards you and that is why there are so many cases of very serious eye injuries <e> <s> another factor is the inconvenience of driving through rain without a windscreen and trying to have a new one fitted on a sunday <e> <s> that can be very difficult <e> <s> there is also the fact that small pieces of glass may get into the heating apparatus of the car and do considerable damage <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth for raising this point <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has almost concluded my speech for me <e> <s> i will just draw attention to the last few lines in these notes on the clauses where it says <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for putting his position clearly <e> <s> i am grateful to all noble lords who have given support to this proposal and as my noble friend lord mishcon said to have the expert confirmation from the noble lord lord mottistone of what the radar electronic experts said in the case to which i have referred <e> <s> the minister said that judge pitchford was dealing mainly with the method of use <e> <s> i do not want to weary the committee but i have three places marked where the judge referred to the equipment itself and not its use <e> <s> he referred to the way it was used as well but he referred to possible defects in the equipment <e>", "<cs> i should be ungenerous and unwise not to accept that offer <e> <s> i will consult those advising me and i may as a precaution have to table a suitable amendment on report in case the minister finds he cannot do anything <e> <s> i wish to make it clear that i want the minister to come forward with a proposal but i give notice that we shall probably table a precautionary amendment at report in case he decides not to move <e> <s> i hope his attitude tonight means that he will <e>", "<cs> if it were a bsi certificate approved by the secretary of state we might possibly approve that but i want something in the bill to the effect that the secretary of state approves the equipment be it bsi equipment or otherwise <e> <s> i think the minister understands my view on this and that of noble lords who have supported me <e> <s> we hope there will be movement but as i say we may have to table an amendment for report as a precautionary measure <e> <s> having said that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i must bow to the greater knowledge of the minister in answering that <e> <s> the amendment refers to those who are liable to imprisonment and a child would not normally be so liable <e> <s> as to the age limit of those liable to be affected perhaps the minister could give the committee some guidance <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for the explanation <e> <s> of course there are some offences for which there is laid down a minimum period of imprisonment and if we were to refer to various acts we should find that clearly stated <e> <s> naturally i shall have tomorrow to read very carefully in <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister just two questions arising on this government amendment <e> <s> first in subsection of the proposed new clause it says that the person so nominated which is of course the notional defendant <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the minister for giving the assurance that he has and welcome it <e> <s> i very much appreciate his decision on this matter on behalf of the government and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for the information he has given <e> <s> i am also encouraged by what he has said about the development of the scheme <e> <s> we shall have to wait for a review presumably there will be a review presented to parliament in due course as to whether this has proved successful <e> <s> i hope that any suggestion of making schemes self-financing will not make it difficult for some organisations to carry this through because we must get the young motor-cyclists trained as quickly as possible <e> <s> i still should have liked to see a one-year scheme because although the two-year scheme will enable people to take the test more than once if they fail the first time it is the six to -month first-riders that we want to catch and the present scheme may not catch them <e> <s> in begging leave to withdraw my amendment i hope that the government will keep that in mind and if they find that the present scheme is not really affecting the six- to twelve-month new riders that i hope they will reconsider the matter of the one-year scheme <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am certain that there will be general satisfaction that the government are introducing this clause to provide for exemptions under certain circumstances <e> <s> i should declare an interest as a retirement pensioner but one who i hope will not have to apply for medical exemption <e> <s> retirement pensioners are included in the list of persons who are exempted from payment for medical prescriptions <e> <s> it might be argued that if a retirement pensioner can afford to drive a car he can afford to pay for medical exemption but there will be pensioners who wish to travel as passengers who may want to apply for medical exemption <e> <s> it should also apply to those pensioners who wish to drive themselves <e> <s> if they want to apply for medical exemption on real medical grounds is a lot of money for a retirement pensioner with no other source of income <e> <s> i wonder whether the government can tell me if there is a special reason why retirement pensioners are not included in this list of exemptions <e>", "<cs> i do not want to make a big issue out of this particular question but i hope that the secretary of state will keep in mind that any consultations of this kind must be meaningful consultations <e> <s> without going into details i understand that there have been two cases in recent weeks where only two weeks were given for consultation <e> <s> when one considers that the consultation involves the need to examine very carefully what the regulation is and perhaps the need for some organisations to have their own consultations before replying two weeks is not sufficient <e> <s> i hope that this matter will be kept in mind in any future consultations <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that this question indicates the lack of adequate publicity for both sides of the dispute <e> <s> is it not a fact that this is one of three proposals which arose out of the original acas discussions <e> <s> is it not a fact that these three proposals have been referred to the national tribunal for discussion without any preconceived ideas on both sides <e> <s> moreover is it not a fact that the nur have said that trains can run on this route with the extra additional man while the discussions take place <e>", "<cs> my lords the three proposals which arose out of the acas discussions were the open manning of stations which would relieve men for other duties and save money the single manning of passenger trains and the new train concept of customer service on trains with assistance also to the driver with rather reduced safety provisions <e>", "<cs> is it not also a fact that there are separate commissions for northern ireland wales scotland and england and the custom and practice is for all the commissions to be presented to parliament at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl not agree that although the figures that he has given in reply to the original question are encouraging there is a lot of leeway to be made up <e> <s> will he take account of the fact that the british road federation stated soon after the budget in april this year that the expenditure on motorways and trunk roads at prices was only per cent <e> <s> of what it was in and that the expenditure on all roads local roads included was only one-third of the expenditure of <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a privilege to follow the noble lord lord rootes in his maiden speech a speech which i am certain all noble lords will agree has given the house information based on sound knowledge of our important motor industry and associated industries <e> <s> i am certain noble lords would agree that it is our loss that the noble lord has not spoken for years and we hope it will not be years maybe not even days before the noble lord addresses us again not only on this subject on which he has great information and expertise but on other matters as well <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord referred in answer to one supplementary to whether another noble lord had read the debate on unemployment held last monday may i ask him whether he has re-read that debate and whether he recalls that from all sections of the house there was pressure for constructive capital expenditure including from the cbi and that he did not reply to those points <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble earl frankly has done his best with a bad case <e> <s> the reference he makes to the fact that discrimination on grounds of sex and race are included in other acts does not alter the matter if we want to be logical where is the deterrent <e> <s> i do not want to be unfair but at the committee stage i see that in column the noble earl said <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that we may receive some firm explanation as to why these special categories are deserving of this special consideration <e> <s> a tribunal decision can inform a person that he has been unfairly dismissed and he can be offered his job back <e> <s> but he knows very well that if he goes back people will make merry hell for him <e> <s> at the moment he only comes under the very low level he does not come under special awards at all <e> <s> surely there is a justification there as well <e> <s> for some strange reason certain people are being put on a pedestal which is something that we have said throughout our consideration of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened very carefully to what the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has said and there are two points which <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the argument which the noble viscount has put forward particularly as it could be read into his amendment as being only one reason why there should be disposal of any part of the national bus company <e> <s> my interpretation of the amendment would mean that the bus company has power to dispose provided that it is for this purpose and this purpose only <e> <s> that would appear to be the completely wrong reason <e> <s> the last thing that we on this side of the house would want would be that we dispose of any part of the national bus company merely because that would help to reduce the capital debt of the company <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add one or two words to what my noble friend lord mishcon has said <e> <s> the noble lord lord bellwin said that the national bus company would have to decide whether or not any particular item or items were surplus to their requirements <e> <s> my noble friend explained that the amendment says quite clearly operational needs of the company <e> <s> on previous occasions the noble lord lord bellwin has stressed that we can leave matters of this kind to the good sense and the commercial sense of the national bus company <e> <s> surely the commercial sense and the good sense of the national bus company is not going to make them get rid of something which is not surplus to their requirements <e> <s> the two things do not hang together <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very disappointed at the ministers reply to the arguments in this case <e> <s> of course there are differences of philosophy between the opposition and the government on the merits and demerits of private sector passenger transport and public passenger transport but that is not the issue in this amendment <e> <s> i should have thought that far from being an argument civet philosophy the amendment was a constructive transport policy and a logical transport policy which is what is proposed in the bill <e> <s> i am certain the minister would not wish it to go on record that the government are opposed to an integrated policy on transport but that is what his argument has led to <e> <s> as has been pointed out by the noble lord lord tanlaw and the noble lord lord taylor whose support i very much appreciate integration is a commonsense thing which is essential and it is a complementary system we are after <e>", "<cs> my lords as both noble lords started by saying before the noble lord sits down i beg leave to speak again <e> <s> i appreciate the points the two noble lords have made <e> <s> although the importance of this amendment is such that we would have liked to insist upon it there are other matters ahead <e> <s> in view of the pressure and the importance of this matter i think we should not wait for third reading as i suggested but ask the house to decide upon it now <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to make way for the noble lord lord bellwin because i thought that he might wish to accept the amendment but perhaps i had better speak just in case i am wrong <e> <s> i should like to support the noble viscount in this amendment for the particular reasons that he has stressed <e> <s> first in clause there is the provision that before the secretary of state gives a direction to the bus company he must consult the county council in which the national bus company may have services which will be affected by the decision <e> <s> that is already in the bill <e> <s> therefore it would seem to me to be absolutely logical that where under clause there is any suggestion of the national bus company itself disposing of property or any of its equipment or assets there should be again the opportunity of consultation with the county council which may be affected by the services <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always trying to insist that we should put things into bills to be certain so there is no dubiety whatever <e> <s> everthing that the noble lord lord bellwin has said justifies to the hilt why the previous amendment should have been carried and accepted that is the need for consultation on these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i need not add much following those remarks by my noble friend lord mishcon <e> <s> the government have said time and again that these are reserve powers <e> <s> i remind the house again that they are in the bill not as reserve powers they are there to enable any secretary of state to give directions as he thinks fit <e> <s> that is the important principle and we have throughout these debates spoken of the wide-ranging powers given to the secretary of state by the clause <e> <s> in view of the adamant attitude of the minister however the best thing we can do is to look at the issue again bearing in mind that there will be one final opportunity to raise it <e> <s> we must be concerned with this exceptional case the irreconcilable care to which the minister referred <e> <s> perhaps having <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister said that he was surprised by the wording of our amendment <e> <s> well i would point out that it <e>", "<cs> my lords i can understand the arguments being put forward by the minister but what it boils down to is that on a disposal everything of a commercial nature can be taken into account when considering whether the transfer is satisfactory but not the interests of the workers being transferred <e> <s> even if the wording of our amendment is not right even if certain powers do not reside in the minister in these days when we are talking about improved industrial relations that seems to me a nonsense <e> <s> it should be possible in discussing terms for a possible disposal for the secretary of state to ask is it possible for your company to come to a decent arrangement in relation to a pension scheme <e> <s> we ought to be able to do that and that i suggest is good industrial relations <e>", "<cs> my lords if the house will permit me to do so before i indicate what attitude i wish to take on this amendment may i ask the minister as he rejects the position as i think he does of the nonprofit-making organisation as in amendment no <e> <s> what his view is regarding amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we agreed they should be taken together <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has been very helpful in his last observations that he has been given legal advice that amendment no <e> <s> will not achieve what i want it to achieve <e> <s> what we wanted in the amendment was to have a single organisation which is what the operators want either a single company or group of companies <e> <s> as the noble lord lord bellwin said that his legal advice is that it would not achieve that i must bear that in mind and take a careful look at it <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to say a few words in support of the amendment of the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth for two reasons <e> <s> first as i mentioned on the previous amendment the minister made quite clear at the committee stage that the government are not contemplating the authorisation of any organisation with commercial interests <e> <s> that is what the noble lords amendment wishes to make absolutely clear <e> <s> therefore this amendment is perfectly in line with what the minister said at the committee stage of which i reminded your lordships when we discussed the previous amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for explaining the purpose of these various government amendments and the fact that the paragraph dealing with further functions is now to be <e>", "<cs> my lords at last we are approaching the final stage of this protracted effort to secure legislation for the compulsory wearing of seat belts <e> <s> as the noble lord the minister has said parliament has clearly decided on the principle <e> <s> your lordships house approved by to votes the new clause introduced by the noble lord lord nugent which made this provision <e> <s> i should make it clear that although there was a free vote i was not neutral and i was pleased to have the opportunity of supporting the noble lord lord nugent in his effort <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl whether any arrangements are to be made with the transport and road research laboratory to further the investigation into the exhaust filter to which the noble earl lord kinnoull referred and also to promote a similar inquiry among motor manufacturers because the important thing is that if the exhaust filter works then there will be no adjustment to car engines <e> <s> this is an important point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that all noble lords will be pleased to have the assurances of the noble and learned lord the lord advocate regarding the provisions of clause in so far as they affect working conditions <e> <s> however i think that the noble and learned lord will agree with me that if he refers to our debate on this clause in committee the emphasis was on trade union membership it was on trade union recognition and it was on trade union negotiation <e> <s> it is important that employers know what they can do and that the assurances which the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has mentioned are actually written into the bill <e> <s> that seems to me to be essential <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord campbell of alloway says that this is merely restoring contracting in merely <e> <s> i hope your lordships understand what that really means <e> <s> what was a travesty of justice in will still be a travesty of justice in <e> <s> therefore it is necessary to paint the picture completely <e> <s> one must bring into this the position of the labour party and the trade unions <e> <s> we are unique in this country unique in that a political party was founded by a decision of the trades union congress in which led to the first inaugural <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that one is in danger of covering some of the ground which was covered in the previous debate but when one is talking about something being unworkable or a misuse of the bill the governments own clause is a misuse of what they want to do <e> <s> if they want to attack trade unionism let them say so <e> <s> do not try to cover it with the arguments which we have had repeated this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think one need argue the case too much because the noble earl lord avon not only said that he would go back to counsel but also said at committee stage that a police officer would have to do what the amendment would require him to do and therefore the amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> therefore the argument is really accepted by the government and i do hope that the noble earl has been able to get back to the legal advisers and will support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it has become clear from the debate that it would have been wise for the amendment to have concentrated on specifying the police station in scotland <e> <s> i said in my opening remarks that we had no desire to interfere with the procedure of the procurator fiscal in scotland and i appreciate that the amendment might have that result <e> <s> the fact that only a few motorists may be affected is no reason to allow any possibility of injustice a point we have stressed time and again <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister can help me when he replies to the two amendments <e> <s> my information is that the position in northern ireland is that the matter is dealt with by a form of orders and not by legislation <e> <s> i think that that might be the answer in this particular case <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously there is no more that i need add to the helpful contribution made by my noble friend <e> <s> i am grateful for his comments and to the noble earl for explaining the problem <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment and in the meantime to study what the noble earl has said and also the comments of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i mentioned wales <e>", "<cs> i have the various tables but i shall not weary the house by reading them <e> <s> i shall see the noble lord privately <e> <s> i have the figures for wales and three of the four welsh police forces also issued no fixed penalty notices except for parking <e>", "<cs> my lords any criticism of reference to guidelines frankly cannot be substantiated in the light of the fact that the governments legislation has referred many times in the last two or three years to giving guidelines to local authorities and in one case giving guidelines to authorities including police forces <e> <s> i will not weary your lordships with the details but this is something the government have done and we from this side have supported the issue of guidelines <e> <s> there is a substantial difference between the words guidance and guidelines <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no objection whatever to this amendment <e> <s> far be it from me ungrammatical man as i am to query the grammar but is the use of the word and at the end of paragraph <e>", "<cs> therefore it is badly worded is it not <e>", "<cs> my lords i also hope the house will reject this amendment to delete this clause <e> <s> of course we must take heed of what the magistrates association says but that does not necessarily mean that we have to accept it <e> <s> many of us quote the views of various other associations but these are just as a test of opinion <e> <s> the noble earl lord fortescue said that this is a saving of court time but this surely must not be a saving of court time at the risk of some unfairness coming into the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords anyone who knows me will know that i am not denigrating the magistrates association <e> <s> it is absolutely ridiculous to suggest it <e> <s> i shall take offence at any such suggestion <e> <s> i am saying that even though we take heed of what the magistrates say we who have to make the law should not automatically accept their views otherwise we might as well not be here at all <e> <s> we could just ask the magistrates what they think and that would be the end of it <e> <s> we are making laws here and we must ensure that what the magistrates association asks us to do is correct <e> <s> i believe that we have been given sufficient evidence to show that on this occasion they are not correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for his explanation and i readily accept his invitation <e>", "<cs> my lords needless to say i am most grateful for the very helpful and courteous comment made by the noble earl and we shall look forward to third reading to see whether we can have something which amplifies the governments amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very sensible division <e> <s> i am grateful to the government for doing it <e> <s> at this stage may i say how grateful i am and i am certain other noble lords are for the kind and courteous attention that the noble earl has given to all the points raised on clause at the committee stage <e> <s> as we go through we shall find that although some of us still have some amendments to make basically the noble earl has endeavoured to carry out the wishes of the house that were expressed in debates <e> <s> i am grateful to him for that <e> <s> i am also grateful to him for so kindly writing to me giving me some indication of the governments intentions <e> <s> i wanted to make that statement at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for agreeing to have a look at this and i will readily withdraw <e> <s> if there were a problem about getting a correct definition maybe the government could decide that they would ensure that there would be guidance given to whichever authorities have to administer this whether it is going to be a narrow group or one extended later after an experimental period on who another person should be <e> <s> something needs to be done either in the bill or through clear guidance given <e> <s> as the noble earl says that he will look at this matter i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as the house will recognise i was hesitant about certain points in the amendment although i believe it has been a valid matter to raise and i am grateful to the noble earl for saying he will draw the attention of the police to it <e> <s> frankly there is not much point the metropolitan police saying we are after the persistent offender that is the justification for the clause which i support and then find that we cannot get at the persistent offender <e> <s> the last thing we would want is to deal with the casual motorist perhaps someone from the provinces who is visiting london who suddenly finds his vehicle is clamped or it might be a foreign tourist <e> <s> it is one thing to deal with someone who is in this country on business for eight on nine months with his car from abroad but none of us would like to find a wheel <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to look very carefully at what the noble earl has said and consider the matter with a view possibly to returning to it on third reading if i am not satisfied <e> <s> it seems to me that we need to have something more here <e> <s> we need to have a regulation of some kind that can be approved or annulled as the case may be <e> <s> i hope that there will be consultations <e> <s> if i heard correctly it seemed that the noble earl implied that there might not be consultations on the matter <e> <s> surely there need to be the widest possible consultations before the device to be used is approved <e> <s> however i shall look at what the noble earl has said and in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> q <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already intimated i welcome this new clause but i should like to say a few words on subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for listening to the points made on amendment no <e>

said on w and q certainly on amendment no <e> <s> v i accept the assurance he has given that these are the areas to which the first order will be extended <e> <s> i withdraw v without any hesitation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw amendments nos <e> <s> w and q on the understanding that i will read carefully what the noble earl has said to see whether it satisfies my noble friends and myself <e> <s> i readily withdraw amendment no <e> <s> x on the understanding that the noble earl will look at this <e> <s> there are many items of legislation which your lordships have passed which contain the words if the secretary of state is satisfied <e> <s> therefore we have added these words many times to make the point quite clear for the secretary of states benefit as will as for other people <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is pleasing to know that there is yet another noble lord who appreciates the consideration given by the government to his original amendment <e> <s> i want only to raise a point on subsection which reads <e>", "<cs> my lords when the question that the clause stand part was before your lordships at committee stage a number of noble lords expressed concern about clause to which the noble lord proposes this amendment <e> <s> i would like to express sympathy with the amendment which has been put forward by lord lucas <e> <s> i am certain that none of us want derestriction <e>", "<cs> my lords may i in dealing with the government amendment also speak to my own amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord elton for the attention he has given to this matter since our last discussion at the committee stage <e> <s> having said that i have looked carefully at what i said at various stages in the discussion on this matter in an amendment i moved at the committee stage and i am still prepared to say that what the government are proposing is not fully what i wanted <e> <s> perhaps i can elaborate upon that <e> <s> the important thing is the approval of a standard <e> <s> in all the references i made in our last debate i asked whether it would be a certificate of the british standards institution or in any event a proper british standard <e> <s> it was that which i wanted to have approved by the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> the fact that two local authorities already have this provision and that another local authority is possibly considering seeking this provision does indicate that there is some concern about it <e> <s> even though the noble earl says there is not sufficient evidence of widespread demand at least certain local authorities feel the problem is sufficient to justify seeking these powers <e> <s> maybe the noble earl will keep in mind that at the appropriate time the local authority associations should be consulted about this as to whether the town and country planning powers to which he referred are sufficient <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl and i readily accept my lords that there are powers to ensure that such roadworks are properly signed lit and guarded <e> <s> however the main point of the amendment concerns the giving of information and as to who is the contractor where he can be contacted and so on <e> <s> that is essential information in an emergency <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for agreeing to check whether that information is actually required at the moment <e> <s> that is the important point that there should be information readily available <e>

<s> on the ministers assurance which i readily accept that he will check that point i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be churlish of me if i did not thank the noble earl once again for bringing forward an amendment in line with the undertaking he gave at the committee stage <e> <s> i am delighted to see the amendment and the only point is when it is liable to come into effect because it is left entirely to the secretary of state as to when he may make the regulations <e> <s> otherwise i welcome this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for what the noble earl said about clause and that will be helpful <e> <s> i agree with him in desiring the minimum number of exemptions and as he rightly said i am heartily in favour of the compulsory wearing of seat belts <e> <s> at the same time i want to be fair to those who need exemption <e> <s> it is rather far-fetched i should have thought to imagine that all retirement pensioners will claim exemption <e> <s> while it sounds impressive to throw large figures into an argument i think the noble earl will agree that the number who will wish to have medical exemption will be very limited <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that i was going to refer to amendments nos <e> <s> q and r but i said nothing about them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am unstinting in my gratitude to the minister for these amendments <e> <s> in fact listening to him i could almost hear the kind of speeches which my noble friend lord ross and i made in this house <e> <s> much as i appreciate the common sense one usually gets from your lordships on this occasion i am grateful that the other place decided to make this amendment and i am pleased the government decided to accept it particularly as this change is wanted by the convention and the taxi trade <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether it is not a fact that the armitage report of which i hold a copy in my hand expressed uncertainty as to how axles actually damage roads and expressed the view that there was insufficient knowledge on certain aspects for instance the effect of lorries on bridges on underground pipes and on pavements and also the vibration effect on buildings <e> <s> it expressed the view that there should be more research into these matters <e> <s> can we have an assurance that before heavier weights for lorries are introduced this research will be completed <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend has supplemented quite effectively the points i made when i moved this amendment <e> <s> it is not the sort of issue upon which we would want to divide the house <e> <s> there is commonsense in the amendment and if the inclusion of one or two words makes it unacceptable as we are discussing a clause put in by the government therefore it becomes a lords amendment i believe there is still time and opportunity for the government to take a look at this when the lords amendments go to the other place <e> <s> i would hope they will take a careful look at what has been said by my noble friend and see whether they cannot put in this commonsense addition when the amendment goes to the other place <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say how grateful we are to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords other noble lords and i have stated that the minister has gone a long way from his original stance on this matter and that is very much appreciated <e> <s> i am grateful to other noble lords who have supported the spirit of the amendment <e> <s> on the point raised by the noble lord lord lucas i have seen regulations on constuction and use as regards motor-cars which believe me are very complicated <e> <s> yet these are available for the procedure of annulment <e> <s> therefore i have no doubt that if members of this house and of the other place can cope with that they could cope with a regulation of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has given some cogent reasons why this particular amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to echo the noble lord lord bellwin and say how much on this side of the house we have appreciated the able effective and very courteous way in which the team of ministers have handled the bill in all its stages <e> <s> as the noble lord lord bellwin has said this is the third occasion on which he and i i was going to say during the short period of office of the government have handled transport bills <e> <s> we understand that another one is threatened for next year so presumably we shall go through this kind of procedure again <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that your lordships will wish to thank the minister for so clearly explaining the points in this order <e> <s> anything that will assist safety standards should be encouraged <e> <s> i am almost tempted to join in the discussion in the light of what the noble lord said that national states will be free to determine how the testing shall be done and by whom but that will be trespassing on your lordships time <e> <s> however in view of the governments decision in the recent bill to transfer the testing from our very efficient arrangements i am tempted to do so <e> <s> as the minister said in effect the order makes no change to the arrangements this country already has for heavy goods and public service vehicles <e> <s> it extends them to other classes and this will add in general to safety conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords as noble lords will observe this is a set of rather complex regulations and we are very grateful to the noble lord lord bellwin for explaining them so clearly to us <e> <s> any regulations which have as their objective easing the movement of people and assisting them to work and take up residence are to he encouraged <e> <s> but we must ask ourselves is this particular harmonisation necessary and desirable and if it is is it adequate <e> <s> does it in any way militate against britains safety standards <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend said that i might deal with a few angles from the standpoint of the representation of the people act <e> <s> i will endeavour to do so <e> <s> a number of noble lords have stressed the anomalies which the governments proposal leaves and i will not reiterate those <e> <s> i would remind your lordships that as far back as a speakers conference recommended that there should be no difference between patients in mental hospitals and those in psychiatric wards of general hospitals <e> <s> the governments proposal does not meet that recommendation of the speakers conference <e> <s> that speakers conference also recommended that an inter-departmental working party should be set up and that was set up between the home office the dhss and other organisations <e> <s> they identified a number of problems six particular ones <e> <s> back in the government announced that they accepted the speakers conference recommendation in principle but subject to these points which the working party indentified being resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords in following the last speaker i would say that i hope the government will take serious note of what the noble countess said about their plans for british telecom <e> <s> i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord gormley on what i thought was a notable speech which brought a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for mentioning that because i shall come to that in a moment <e> <s> but is it i wonder that the government have realised something not as the labour opposition said but as the economic correspondent of <e>", "<cs> my lords let us see what the view of the ama is on that because the ama has first of all stressed that few projects could be completed by st march as the secretary of state has requested also that very few capital projects do not also involve revenue expenditure <e> <s> most capital projects says the ama affect staffing maintenance and similar items for the future <e> <s> we must bear in mind too that there is the government squeeze on non-capital expenditure by local councils <e> <s> therefore this has to be kept in mind when we are talking about what local councils are not doing <e>", "<cs> my lords could the minister indicate whether the british railways board has been consulted <e> <s> if so what were their views on the subject <e> <s> would the noble earl confirm that this inquiry in no way means that there will be any preconceived ideas about the closing of any other rail routes <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl three questions <e> <s> first would he not agree that there is as much concern for efficiency among those who are operating public transport as in any other section of our community <e> <s> secondly did not the monopolies and mergers commission report very favourably on the west midlands pte and have not both the tyne and wear and the west yorkshire councils themselves made arrangements for consultants to review their particular transport undertakings <e> <s> thirdly would he not agree also that efficiency involves not only the quality of service but as the noble lord rightly said the frequency of routes and the maximum number of routes which depend on both capital and revenue support <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain the house will be appreciative of the explanation given by the noble earl of the background to the convention and the provisions of the bill <e> <s> as he rightly says it is non-controversial and non-political so there is no need for me to make what would be a normal second reading speech <e> <s> there are however a few technical points about which i should like some explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord tanlaw said the motion has provided an opportunity for noble lords to question the government and various noble lords have taken advantage of that opportunity <e> <s> i want to comment on just one contribution that of the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth because i must reject what he said that moving this motion was opposition to all lorries at any price <e> <s> i thought i had made that position absolutely clear in the opening words of my speech but i wish to stress that what many noble lords and myself seek to ensure is that the lorry is made more acceptable and a number of speakers emphasised that point as well <e> <s> there was general agreement as i expected to the proposals in the regulations which lead to safety improvement and to environmental improvement <e> <s> but as many noble lords have said there is a long way to go yet particularly in dealing with improvements in the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords does the governments reply imply that the public industries have no real effect on the course of industry in this country <e> <s> secondly is it not an anomaly that private firms will have the advantage of this reduction and yet under the governments recent legislation they can be using the facilities of the nationalised industries <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has not satisfactorily answered the question that i put to him <e> <s> are we now to learn from the governments reply that they no longer believe in the efficiency of a mixed economy as we do on this side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the two trrl reports to which the noble earl lord avon has referred indicate quite clearly that the ratio of fatal accidents involving articulated lorries and rigid lorries is higher in the case of articulated lorries by <e> <s> does that not indicate therefore the seriousness of the situation <e> <s> is it not also the case that these reports deal only with the number of fatal accidents for the year <e> <s> are any further reports available and what are the figures for all the accidents not just fatal accidents <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl confirm that freight transport by waterways is both economic in actual costs and energy efficiency <e> <s> would he also confirm that the freight that can be carried on of the proposed new tonne lorries could be carried by one modern barge on our waterways <e> <s> in addition to the press notice issued by the department of transport on th december what other steps will be taken to publicise these facilities <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the noble earl for his kind personal references and express the regret i have at dealing with northern ireland matters in addition to transport responsibilities because i am certain your lordships will share my appreciation of the work of my noble friend lord blease over so many years <e> <s> his work on behalf of northern ireland is very much appreciated <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may revert from this important discussion on steel to the northern ireland appropriation order i should like to thank the noble earl lord gowrie for his very detailed explanation of the order and also express my own grateful thanks for the helpful information given in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the whole house will join with the expressions of the noble earl regarding the ballykelly outrage and will share the expression of sympathy to the relatives and to those who are still suffering grievous injury it is impossible <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for explaining the order <e> <s> may i say on behalf of the opposition that we fully endorse it <e> <s> the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether there are not three important considerations that must be kept in mind <e> <s> first the proposal in the question of the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for absent voting extends facilities for persons overseas far beyond those given to british citizens overseas for parliamentary elections <e> <s> secondly if there is to be no national list system would not the question of allocation to a parliamentary constituency be a very important matter in registration <e> <s> thirdly if there was to be registration in a constituency should there be a maximum period for overseas residents beyond which they would not qualify <e> <s> otherwise persons who had been away for or years could qualify in a european constituency in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord trefgarne for repeating the statement <e> <s> although it is a short statement it involves very serious consequences <e> <s> i want to deal with the statement primarily from the point of view of what the opposition regard as unfortunate policy and economic judgment <e> <s> i appreciate that because of his personal financial involvement with charter consolidated the secretary of state who i am delighted to see is in his seat passed consideration of the commissions report to the minister for trade <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord accept from these benches that we fully support the congratulations extended to him on his promotion <e> <s> would he not also agree that if a change in the administration of greater london was to be considered it would be appalling if this were dealt with on the basis of emotion and political prejudice without the substance of a detailed full and comprehensive inquiry <e> <s> would he not also agree that the administration of transport in greater london would require an overall body accountable to local government and not members appointed by the secretary of state as is made in one proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for repeating this statement and certainly we appreciate that time has been far too limited to assimilate all the details of this lengthy report and the substantial supplementary volume which accompanies the report <e> <s> the statement mentions the terms of reference and the report itself says that the review has been concerned with railway finances and not transport policy <e> <s> we do not believe that decisions can be made on the railway system in isolation from a comprehensive transport policy <e> <s> railway finances cannot be divorced from the aims and objectives desired for rail in transport policies <e> <s> we are pleased that the statement that has been read says that it would be foolish to come to any conclusions on any question in isolation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also congratulate the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth upon his promotion to the government front bench <e> <s> we wish him well but not too well <e> <s> may i say also that we welcome the research being carried out by the road research laboratory but urge that it should not research only into the conspicuity of motor bicycles by the use of headlights but should also examine the possibilities of fluorescent harnesses and the important question of learner plates which are of absolute importance to the novice untrained motor cyclist <e> <s> will the noble lord accept that these points are not being urged from any persecution of motor cyclists but because despite what the noble lord has said about there being a slight diminution in the number of accidents the figures are so serious that action is needed in the interests of motor cyclists as well as in the interests of other road users <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition to the point covered by the original question will arrangements be made if at all possible to ensure that the monitoring also gives information as to whether or not injuries were avoided or lessened because of the wearing of seat belts <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to assume from what the minister has said that the number of cases where a transfer is refused is

taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for explaining this order and in general we give it our support and approval <e> <s> i believe the noble earl said that the agricultural loans fund was to be phased out <e> <s> i must confess that i had not ascertained that from the order <e> <s> perhaps he would explain where it is mentioned in the order <e> <s> the provisons for agriculture harbours health and personnel purposes are welcomed as is that for the housing executive <e> <s> may i ask the noble earl whether the increase which i gather from him will carry through requirements

figures which i saw the other day i understand that in the construction industry in northern ireland there are as many unemployed as there are in employment and there are many problems to be relieved <e>", "<cs> my lords i too must thank my noble friend lady ewart-biggs and congratulate her for raising this question which has aroused a very interesting debate <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate my noble friend on the excellent and comprehensive way in which she opened this debate <e> <s> as my noble friend has said there is increasingly public concern on this issue and the pressure for speedier action leading to lead-free petrol has secured widespread public support my noble friend indicated the figures in a recently published opinion poll <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the information given by my noble friend will the minister undertake to look into this particular case and see why it was that this information was given to the court <e> <s> as i think the noble lord the minister will agree this could be very distressing to relatives and other people who have read the report particularly in the light of the fact that the person concerned was a passenger <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord the minister for as usual the excellent way in which he has explained the features of this bill <e> <s> however i am certain that before the second reading debate is finished noble lords will appreciate that this is an attack on local democracy <e> <s> in fact most of the criticisms that the noble lord lord bellwin has made could be used as an argument for full control by national government of local government services <e>", "<cs> my lords my reference to what it had to do with government was made by a conservative member of the standing committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord campbell of croy for drawing our attention to this very important series of regulations <e> <s> i would say at the outset that i agree with almost everything that the noble lord has said and the fact that i do not follow him in making contributions of a general nature does not mean any lack of interest <e> <s> as one who i suppose is relatively able-bodied i can appreciate the importance of these regulations to those of our fellows who unfortunately are disabled <e>", "<cs> my lords what i was really asking was that when the notice is sent to an applicant refusing a badge if there is a leaflet to be obtained that should automatically be sent with that notice <e>", "<cs> my lords will not the minister agree that any extension of the present position would involve very serious matters which should not be rushed <e> <s> if there was to be an extension as suggested could not a very substantial number of persons be involved who have no constituency qualifications whatever <e> <s> could this not also involve the question of whether or not there is any intention to return to this country and the question of those who work abroad for tax reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the number of organisations referred to in the original answer and the list of organisations given in a written answer in another place on nd december may i ask the minister whether he would agree that there has been a proliferation of bodies applying for this special status <e> <s> as it is usual for applications to pass through <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not follow the noble lord lord harris in discussing the position of westminster elections and the question of proportional representation for those elections because that is not the issue before the house this afternoon <e> <s> i am certain that all noble lords are united in their view that everything possible must be done to develop local <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness wants to draw me i will speak <e> <s> i have deliberately not gone on to parliamentary elections and the pr system there <e> <s> while the noble baroness might be able to draw some criticisms in certain areas i believe that the points that we have put forward are major ones which <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister agree that it is not solely a football problem but a social problem <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether he is aware that as one who has for nearly half a century supported one of the friendliest teams in the football league where there is very little trouble i believe that it is important that not only the chairman of football clubs but also the managers should be involved in this matter because the conduct of players on the field is very important as well <e> <s> in addition supporters clubs attached to football clubs ought also to be called into consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that the de-licensing which was provided for in the transport act has proved a complete and utter failure as regards improving the bus services in rural areas <e> <s> would he not also agree that considerable concern is at present being voiced over the bus revenue support as a proportion of the accepted expenditure for the transport supplementary grant which has fallen from in the year to next year <e> <s> is he further aware that there has been particular concern especially in the shire counties and in the national bus company as to whether the authorities will be able to keep up their revenue support for the essential bus services <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that when consultation papers are issued it is quite a democratic procedure for a local authority to wish to consult people in its area and if it believes that any threatened legislation will be injurious to the people in the area to endeavour to do something about it maybe by campaign activities <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> there are a number of references in the bill to transport services and facilities <e> <s> the noble lord lord tanlaw wants to ensure that facilities includes measures taken in connection with cyclists <e> <s> a number of cities and towns are endeavouring to make arrangements to separate cyclists from other road users <e> <s> the noble baroness said that cyclists can be a danger to pedestrians but the facilities which could be provided would endeavour to provide the very safety about which she speaks <e>", "<cs> one point must be made at the outset to correct the noble baroness <e> <s> we are talking about the services provided in the area of a public transport executive <e> <s> we are not talking about travelling throughout the united kingdom <e> <s> we are referring to travelling within the area for which the pte and the ptas are responsible <e>", "<cs> there are two points to which i should like to refer because in his reply the minister said first that section will be repealed after st april <e> <s> that is assuming that the committee agrees with that clause <e> <s> we have not reached it yet and there are amendments to deal with it <e> <s> he also said that after the determination of grants in the first year no other grant can be paid <e> <s> we have not reached that part of the bill yet either and there are amendments to deal with that <e> <s> therefore it is no good quoting to the committee proposals which may be overturned in this house <e> <s> that is the purpose of the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> we want to put these things straight <e>", "<cs> i did not <e>", "<cs> a mutilation of what i said <e>", "<cs> before your lordships committee decides what action to take on the amendment <e> <s> i should like to put a couple of questions to the minister but first i must comment on the observations of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter as i think he would expect me to do <e> <s> of course we dislike the bill but i challenge the noble lord to show that any amendment that i have moved is a wrecking amendment <e>", "<cs> the amendments that we have tried to put forward are intended to remove some of the worst features of the bill <e> <s> at second reading speaking from the front bench on behalf of the opposition i said that in the committee stage we would try to remove the most objectionable features of the bill particularly in view of the fact that after clause clauses and were not discussed in the other place except cursorily <e> <s> therefore i say that here we shall have to give the utmost attention to the bill in order to remove its worst features <e> <s> the amendments are seeking to do that and to ensure that the best features of public transport are adhered to and that the secretary of state will not be given power to damage them <e> <s> that is what we have attempted to do <e>", "<cs> the closing remarks of my noble friend lord sefton have provided the right note for my reply <e> <s> it is necessary to find out precisely what the document means and the attitude to it of the ptes and also the attitude of the secretary of state to the replies received from the ptes <e> <s> it is also necessary to look carefully at the words which the minister used <e> <s> it may be that the use of the word include instead of the word means in our amendment would have satisfied the minister <e> <s> it is obvious that many members of the committee feel strongly that the benefits mentioned in the amendment are essential <e> <s> whether the government accept that point of view is not certain <e> <s> a close investigation of the document may reveal the answer <e> <s> rather than divide the committee at this stage i should prefer to look at what the minister has said <e> <s> i should also like to look more carefully at the document which i hope the minister will also look at and see what was the reaction of the ptes <e> <s> then we can come back to the matter at report <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am certain that the noble lord the minister would not say that that is what matters if he was back in his position on the leeds city council <e> <s> in his previous remarks the minister again referred to the question of the revenue grants <e> <s> i want to assure every noble lord in the committee that at the moment we are not discussing any alteration of the proposals in the bill for determining revenue grants <e> <s> i make it quite clear all we are dealing with is the position of the executive <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bellwin is always persuasive but not always convincing <e> <s> he says there is a planning process and that we should not disturb what is intended to be a stable and rational basis <e> <s> but it must be rational not to have to use borrowing for unforeseen circumstances <e> <s> the noble lord repeated what was said on second reading and it means compelling a local authority to go for borrowing in such circumstances <e> <s> indeed as i listened to him i thought of another eventuality there might be a disastrous fire resulting in the destruction of a great many vehicles <e> <s> action would need to be taken quickly <e> <s> surely it would be better for a grant to be made than go to borrowing <e> <s> i do not know what noble lords with experience think of such matters in terms of business management <e> <s> i should have said that rather than encourage loose management the amendment would prevent that in view of the fact that a loose decision on borrowing could result in loose management <e> <s> what is suggested in the amendment could be more economic <e> <s> however i shall as the minister suggests look carefully at what he said <e> <s> it may be that the amendment is badly drafted and we shall take that into consideration in considering whether to return to the matter on report <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in supporting my noble friend in his amendment i should like to take up a point that the minister commented upon in his reply when he said that there is no need for the amendment because the points are covered by section of the act and the appropriate section of the act <e> <s> i wonder whether that means that the minister will be prepared to accept a later amendment which proposes that those duties laid down in the and acts shall be taken into consideration <e> <s> that is what the minister is implying <e> <s> if the minister says that these points are covered surely we ought to ensure that the executive in preparing the plan which according to the clause it has to do ought to take into consideration the duties laid upon it by the provision of the two earlier acts that have been mentioned <e>", "<cs> the minister really has said two important things the first is that to add these points would be to include matters which are outside the control of the executive <e> <s> that is one of our complaints about the secretary of state dealing with the executive <e> <s> he also said that he would take certain things into account as far as the executive may do so or words to that effect <e> <s> again that was one of the complaints in the previous group of amendments that it is the executive that is being asked to supply these various items <e>", "<cs> first i have an apology to make to the committee because in moving the first amendment i then detailed all the other items which were to be left out by other amendments but i did not give the numbers of those amendments <e> <s> for the sake of the record i had better give the numbers <e> <s> in addition to moving amendment no <e> <s> i have spoken to amendments nos <e> <s> and and i believe that other noble lords have spoken to those amendments in making their observations <e>", "<cs> i must make one or two points in support of this amendment <e> <s> i do not want to detract from the amendment by bringing in the ama <e> <s> the minister said if the ama had had consultations <e> <s> as he knows i am the president of the ama <e> <s> i was reading certain documents only last night <e> <s> there was a meeting with the secretary of state and there was also one meeting at which the under-secretary of the department attended at the start of the meeting <e> <s> i shall endeavour to turn up the dates and give them to the noble lord in case he thinks i am not giving him the correct facts <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the minister adheres to his original remarks because his reference to the columns in the commons <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry that the minister will not move on this <e> <s> as my noble friend lord mcintosh inferred i think he actually said this shows a lack of confidence in the authority <e> <s> i must emphasise that it is the authority that is elected it is the authority that has to approve the plan and it is the authority which the minister says has the last word <e> <s> he told us this time and time again <e> <s> therefore why not use the words that we are suggesting <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the noble lord the minister has to tempt me to get back to the amendment because no one can complain that i have given a second reading speech in the course of dealing with any of the amendments i have moved <e> <s> the hours debate that we have had has been very valuable not just on these amendments but in showing a difference of outlook between those of us who believe in transport for the community and those who have other outlooks on it and also frankly despite all the words that have been used for the outlook upon confidence in local bodies to take local decisions <e> <s> running <e>", "<cs> if i have misquoted the noble lord i shall apologise <e> <s> he said that if the authorities were doing their job there would be no need for the bill <e> <s> that was in the plural and not the singular <e> <s> i accept what he has said about not knowing about the other areas <e> <s> the only trouble is that this bill does concern other areas <e> <s> it concerns tyne and wear west yorkshire south yorkshire west midlands merseyside and greater manchester <e> <s> these are vast areas <e> <s> frankly if we are not going to take them into consideration then we ought to have had a separate bill dealing only with london and leaving the other areas alone <e> <s> otherwise frankly and i am not going to tempt lord boyd-carpenter again one should be very careful about coming to any amendment to this bill without the prefacing words i am talking only about greater london <e> <s> otherwise noble lords will get a false impression of what members are saying <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has referred again to the ama <e> <s> he should not say that the ama did not want consultation <e> <s> they were not given a chance to consult on the white paper <e> <s> it was published on the same day as the bill <e> <s> they were not asked to support the framework of the bill or to criticise it and put forward alternative suggestions <e> <s> i was at the offices of the ama when we collected copies of the bill and the white paper <e> <s> they had no chance to consult <e> <s> until the bill is passed why should they discuss how it is going to be implemented <e> <s> they were prepared to discuss the framework of the bill and they had one meeting with the secretary of state <e> <s> i believe the noble lord referred to that meeting earlier this afternoon <e> <s> therefore they were prepared to meet him <e> <s> and there was another meeting at which the under-secretary of state at the department was present <e>", "<cs> the minister has had much experience of local government legislation in this house <e> <s> may i ask him whether the house has passed legislation on matters where datelines of this kind have been inserted <e> <s> surely it is not wrong to have a statutory date because then the government know how they have to act and the local authorities know <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the points which the minister has made <e> <s> i appreciate what he said in his opening speech <e> <s> if the amendment can be read two ways obviously we must look at it again because we must not leave a situation where it can be read two ways <e> <s> however what comes out from what the minister said is that we cannot tie down the secretary of state and one can understand the arguments that he put forward <e> <s> but the local authority the pta when it works out its plan will cover three years <e> <s> i know nothing about the actual detailed workings that the executive will have to carry through but i suggest that it cannot do this on a year by year basis <e> <s> it has to plan services and the whole of its resources <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies will the minister take into consideration that the procedure by which the guidance grant is eventually reached is a long protracted procedure <e> <s> he will agree that it is very detailed <e> <s> the whole possible timetable over a long period was set out by a member of the standing committee and the minister who was handling the bill in another place did not comment on or criticise the timetable which had been advanced a very long procedure <e> <s> therefore it means that at the start of the procedure factors will not be dreamed of when the government are considering the guidance at the various levels <e> <s> we have this situation where as we saw from the previous debate on the other amendment we must not put the secretary of state into an inflexible position but now the authority will be put into that inflexible position <e>", "<cs> i am certain that your lordships committee would like this debate to be drawn to a conclusion <e> <s> the discussion has revealed some very interesting points <e> <s> the minister said that he and i had been associated with four transport bills <e> <s> he said that we had done transport bills but in fact we have done public transport in bill after bill <e> <s> knowing the ministers affection for local government frankly i was very surprised by some of the things that he said about certain local authorities and local government <e> <s> i wonder whether when he reads <e>", "<cs> it has been said that there is something of a similarity <e> <s> the only similarity is that we are attempting to remove certain penalties which could be placed against a pta <e> <s> as my noble friend lord mcintosh of haringey has said this amendment is attempting to improve the bill <e> <s> also on all these different matters we want to learn the governments view for the simple reason that these points were not fully debated in another place <e> <s> therefore it is essential that we hear the governments view on all these different variations because that will enable us to shape our view for the next stage <e> <s> i am very pleased that the minister takes that view and does not take the view that we are wasting time we are ventilating important issues <e>", "<cs> i am wondering whether we should speak on this question before adjourning the committee <e> <s> we were intending to speak and divide on the question whether clause shall stand part <e> <s> in the face of the comment made by the noble lord we must ensure that the committee fully discusses the whole of clause <e>", "<cs> just before we adjourned our consideration of this bill i said that it was our wish to speak on the question whether the clause shall stand part and to obtain the opinion of our lordships committee <e> <s> i shall not go through all the arguments that have been put forward in our various amendments i think that the position is known quite clearly <e> <s> clause is the kernel of the bill and judging from earlier debates it is quite clear that many members of your lordships committee take very serious objection to the bill on a number of grounds including what it will do to local government the question of the general constitutional relationship the view that it does not give proper attention to transport needs and benefits and so on <e> <s> i shall not rehearse what was said in all the earlier speeches but we consider the clause so objectionable that we feel that we ought to have our views on it recorded <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister drew attention to the last part of the amendment <e> <s> when my noble friend moved the amendment i am certain that <e>", "<cs> can i assist the chair and say that i shall not be moving amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> of course we accept that an executive and an authority must keep in mind their financial duty <e> <s> i am certain that the minister does not intend to imply that the executive or authority will not do that although we have a feeling that there is a suspicion throughout this bill as to what an authority might do <e> <s> the minister also said that once fixed the grant cannot be increased <e> <s> that again is one of the problems we have endeavoured to show up in various other amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord marsh not only for bringing this subject before us but also for the amiable and informative way in which he introduced it <e> <s> so much so that although he and i have not always seen eye to eye on some issues in your lordships house i find myself so much in agreement with the noble lord that i would readily issue him with a card to come back to us <e> <s> the debate has also attracted two maiden speakers <e> <s> i am certain we shall hear from the noble lord lord ezra points on what industry needs from the standpoint of freight carriage <e> <s> i also look forward to hearing my noble friend lord prys-davies and i shall be surprised if he does not refer to some of the options as they affect the principality <e>", "<cs> i can understand and appreciate the sympathetic reply from the minister but i still cannot understand why the government cannot accept these <e>", "<cs> i can understand the ministers position but we have other stages in this bill <e> <s> i do not want to embarrass the minister i do not want to take the time of the committee <e> <s> but we cannot have a situation in which over a period say of months before another transport bill there could be a number of substituted bus services closed without any appeal of any kind <e> <s> that would be absolutely wrong <e> <s> we can understand that the minister cannot do anything about the serpell position but if he will only undertake to have a careful look at what has been said and give some undertaking before the report stage as to when this matter can be dealt with then frankly i would go along with him and not press the amendment <e> <s> however there is much feeling about this and we are not asking for a great deal <e> <s> we are asking for a simple consultative machinery in order to avoid any one bus service which has already been substituted being closed down before we have another transport bill <e> <s> that is what we are asking for <e> <s> if the minister can just say something to appease the troops behind me who want action then i shall readily go along with him <e>", "<cs> i am putting a lot of faith in the ministers statement because i know he will try to do his best <e> <s> in the light of the fact that he will take a look at this i beg leave to withdraw the amendment but make two points <e> <s> i should like the minister to communicate with me before the last opportunity to put down amendments at report stage as to what may be his conclusions <e> <s> if there is no satisfactory answer either this amendment or an improved amendment will be put before the house at report stage <e> <s> this is such a simple matter that we should not be spending too much time on it and it ought to be possible for the minister to come along at least part of the way on this amendment <e> <s> on those conditions i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister has brought in some points on amendment no <e> <s> which we were considering as a separate matter <e> <s> in the light of what the minister has said it might be in the interests of the committee if we spoke also to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that seems to be the ministers view in the light of his comments in which case that will be done and my noble friend lord mishcon will address himself to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> the more one listens to government arguments about aspects of this bill the more one is mystified and i am certain the more supporters of the government on the back-benches must be absolutely mystified also <e> <s> subsection does not talk about a report to the secretary of state <e> <s> it says that the authority shall inform the executive of its conclusions about the review <e> <s> that is where it finishes <e> <s> the minister in reply to my comments about the reviews which have been undertaken said that he welcomed those reviews and that they covered the matters that the government have in mind <e> <s> is that so <e> <s> they went far beyond the narrow point that the government had in mind <e> <s> they dealt with the whole running of their transport system with the whole management of their transport executive <e> <s> if one looks at the words of the proposed amendment no <e> <s> one sees that we want a review into <e>", "<cs> i think the committee will be very grateful for that in view of the pressure from all parts of the committee <e> <s> it is a completely non-political issue <e> <s> i am delighted that the noble lord has said that <e>", "<cs> i continue to be disappointed with the ministers stand on this as on other issues <e> <s> reference was made to taking clause as a whole and we may have an opportunity later to do so <e> <s> for the moment we are dealing with subsection <e> <s> i have already stated in my opening remarks that there are some authorities who already invite tenders for certain of their operations <e> <s> but it is no good the minister just talking about cleaning and similar items when i am reading from the governments own notes on clauses <e> <s> perhaps i should quote from them again <e>", "<cs> the first point is that the minister said that the subsection and paragraph of the transport act to which i referred is repeated in the bill to reinforce the requirement <e> <s> i think i have it correct <e> <s> that is absolutely contrary to statement after statement made by the ministers on the opposite side of the house when we have attempted to put safeguard provisions into other bills <e> <s> it will obviously have to be thought about in future <e> <s> when we have tried to insert something to clarify it to make certain that there is no misapprehension we have been told do not worry <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that because in the light of the points that have been made it would seem completely unreasonable not at least to have a look at it <e> <s> i ask him also to consider what was said previously that to use his own words this would reinforce a requirement <e> <s> it seems a most sensible thing to do and i am grateful that he is going to look at the matter <e> <s> i am prepared to accept what he said about amendment no <e> <s> namely that if there are existing contractual arrangements in law which would safeguard the situation then that amendment is not required <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> while the minister considers the matter <e>", "<cs> time and time again it has seemed as if noble lords wished to discuss the whole spirit of clause and in my view the committee should have that opportunity especially as in the other place they never had such an opportunity <e> <s> therefore we have a chance here to take a look at the whole clause <e> <s> frankly it is a clause that we feel should not be in the bill for various reasons some of which have already been advanced <e> <s> in case the minister should say but you will be taking out subsection which gives london transport the same powers as other bodies already have under the act i give a firm undertaking that if the committee does not support clause staying in the bill i shall bring forward an amendment at the report stage to put back subsection <e> <s> i cannot make a fairer statement than that because i want to see the requirements now being given to other authorities being given to london also under the act <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister said that what an executive can do under section of the act it can do under clause of the bill now before us <e> <s> but is that so <e> <s> let us look to see what clause states <e> <s> it deals with the power of an authority to approve the plan which will be submitted to it by the executive <e> <s> subsection states <e>", "<cs> i do not want to inflict another speech on your lordships but there are a few points that must be made <e> <s> we have again had it repeated by the minister that the authorities have not been prepared to consult with the minister <e> <s> it happens that i have in my hand a copy of a letter sent by one executive the chief executive of south yorkshire which has been strongly criticised this evening <e> <s> it is a letter to the department dated as recently as th february in which the chief executive takes up the point that they had been criticised because they had not been prepared to discuss matters <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed with the ministers reply <e> <s> frankly there is no encouragement here for business efficiency or business acumen <e> <s> one would think that it would be regarded as good business if an undertaking created a surplus which it kept in reserve to buy equipment <e> <s> but there is no encouragement here <e> <s> the minister has as good as told us that if there is a surplus then that will be taken into account in connection with the revenue grant for the following year <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for the offer made by the noble lord lord bellwin <e> <s> in reply to the noble viscount lord massereene and ferrard who referred to the unemployed travelling in cars to my knowledge only one section of the unemployed community travel in rolls-royces and they are those who live on unearned income <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in welcoming that decision in so far as it answers the question on the order paper does the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth not agree that as this is an experimental matter it is desirable that the widest possible publicity should be given to it <e> <s> is it proposed that there will be adequate publicity in order to get the right relationship between the public and the authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords while appreciating that the select committee is looking into this matter may i ask whether the minister would not agree that any change would be almost impossible to monitor and enforce <e> <s> apart from the questions raised by the noble lord lord avebury and from the matter of relationships between this country and southern ireland would it not endanger good relationships between the communities in this country as well as in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank the noble lord lord elton for the able way in which he has introduced this important order <e> <s> secondly i should like to make it quite clear that noble lords are in some difficulty when we discuss a matter of this kind because we are not the elected chamber <e> <s> but we are all affected by parliamentary redistributions and what i propose to do in my remarks is to deal with major principles and not with individual constituencies <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord elton that the boundary commissions all of them have a very unenviable task and one that necessarily is of vital importance to us <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i do appreciate his kind remarks to myself can i ask him to read the speech of dr edmund marshall from the labour front bench in the commons when this order was debated and perhaps he will tell me at some time privately where dr marshall differs from me because i cannot find many discrepancies <e>", "<cs> my lords apart from the savings can the noble baroness say how much money has had to be expended by government departments in carrying out work which used to be done by civil servants <e> <s> for example i am thinking of the transfer of the engineering consultancy for road development and organisations of that kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i too hope that the noble lord lord nugent will not press his amendment for two reasons first because of the time factor to which my noble friend lord ponsonby referred and secondly because i have been misquoted as to what i said at the end of the debate on the amendment which i moved during the committee stage of the transport bill <e> <s> i will read what i said on rd march at cols <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down may i correct the position <e> <s> i made quite clear in my remarks that section of the act which this bill proposes to amend applies only to journeys within the area of the local authority giving the concessions or adjacent areas <e> <s> if a county decided to give the concession it would be in the area of that county <e> <s> if a pte decided to give assistance it would be in the area of the pte or adjoining areas <e> <s> the

decided by the local <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that the house will be grateful to the noble earl lord gowrie for his comprehensive introduction to this appropriation order and also for the information given in the various documents <e> <s> it was a very comprehensive introduction and i can choose only a few handy items on which to comment and to seek information <e>", "<cs> my lords in welcoming the explanation given by the noble earl may i ask one question <e> <s> there is to be a saving as a result of this single billing <e> <s> can the noble earl indicate whether this will lead to redundancies and tell us the number of jobs likely to be affected <e> <s> what will be the net effect of the saving in view of the heavy unemployment position in northern ireland and the net loss that will be encountered by paying out unemployment benefit and losing tax revenue <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bethell has explained the purpose and intention of this bill in terms which everyone can understand <e> <s> he has also referred to your lordships select committees report on the question of a uniform procedure for elections to the european assembly <e> <s> as a member of the select committee which made that recommendation i am naturally in accord with the recommendation made <e> <s> but as to whether this matter can best be dealt with by a private members bill that is open to question and would certainly be dependent upon the suggestion which the noble lord threw out that the government should take over and give assistance in drafting the bill <e> <s> unless that is done many important issues may not be dealt with <e> <s> i hope that the government will pay attention to the important issues which are not referred to at all in the bill as the noble lord lord bethell freely admits <e> <s> therefore although i have sympathy with the aim i think there are points which must be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords the question posed by the noble lord lord hylton is what steps are the government taking to limit and if possible end the spiral of violence <e> <s> i am certain that most noble lords will agree that this is not a question that can be answered solely on steps to suppress terrorism <e> <s> i am pleased that the noble lord lord hylton in his speech for which we all thank him went along those lines as well <e> <s> with the tragedies of ballykelly regents park and hyde park still in our minds the situation must appear awesome <e> <s> i want to make it clear that so long as there is one sectarian killing or one bombing the tragedy remains with us <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that the house will appreciate the speech which we have just heard from the noble baroness lady platt speaking as she does as a member of the essex county council while my noble friend lord irving supporting a <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a very useful and interesting debate and our thanks are due to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for opening it during the debate i noted in particular the contributions of my noble friends lord houghton and lord gormley who have brought to our house experience based on their long service as trade union general secretaries <e> <s> they know the situation from within <e> <s> incidentally my noble friend lord gormley has asked me to apologise to the noble earl he forgot to do so himself because he has a long-standing engagement and could not stay <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord for outlining the provisions of these regulations and as they have been the subject of consultation with the political parties and with the bodies concerned with the registration officers <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will have noticed the degree of support there is in your lordships house for these two amendments <e> <s> although i am sure we all agree that we must keep to procedure i am delighted that the noble lord the minister was able to make his third intervention because we now know the attitude of the government on this question of the hard and harsh look <e>", "<cs> noble lords may say no my lords but it is up to each authority to decide whether or not to give concessionary fares <e> <s> it will be up to local authorities to decide whether to give concessionary fares for children <e>", "<cs> of course my lords increased efficiency but we will come back to that at another stage <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can deal with the last point first <e> <s> the minister says that if i can show him any benefit to which the executive or the authority cannot refer he will have a careful look at the matter <e> <s> when we come to the debate on social benefits i shall show the noble lord such a case <e> <s> this was referred to in our debates last time <e> <s> there is a clear instruction as to what will not be considered <e> <s> it is said that the use of the word includes narrows the interpretation <e> <s> i am not an english scholar but i should have thought that if one says benefits includes it would not be restrictive <e> <s> the word includes makes certain that these matters will be taken into consideration <e>", "<cs> no my lords not withdrawn <e>", "<cs> my lords the principle is there <e> <s> we are not asking for a division <e> <s> but on the first voice we want to make it quite clear that we support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords once again we are disappointed with the governments attitude on an amendment <e> <s> there has been considerable reference to the use of reserves <e> <s> that is always assuming that there are reserves <e> <s> there may not be reserves <e> <s> one does not know what might be the emergencies which are beyond the control of the executive or the authority <e> <s> all sorts of things can be imagined <e> <s> quite a number of instances were mentioned during the committee stage <e> <s> one would have thought that it was good practice that if you have a three-year plan a deficit should be enabled to be cleared within that three years and not the immediate accounting period afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords the intervention of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter may seem very logical <e> <s> but we do not like these matters going to the courts if we can avoid it and that is what this house too ought to try to do <e> <s> we must make certain that the bill is correct and that we are not working on the basis of the flexibility of a future secretary of state <e> <s> we should write into the bill exactly what we want to happen <e> <s> then we can avoid court actions of various kinds <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall consider very carefully what the minister has said <e> <s> i should like to read out part of subsection of clause <e>", "<cs> my lords there seems to be little point in trying to persuade the government to accept what the department have said in these documents <e> <s> we seem to be offering a number of challenges one way or the other <e> <s> my noble friend lord sefton asked do they support them or do they not <e> <s> i must remind your lordships of what the documents say <e> <s> the first is dated december <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear that we approach public transport in different ways <e> <s> we want cost benefits but we also want social benefits to be taken into consideration whereas the government concentrate on cost benefits only <e> <s> the document i have with me <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bellwin said that he did not want to give a second reading speech <e> <s> he proceeded to give his introduction and then said he would not go further <e> <s> well i have not given any second reading speeches at all but i would just like to say that if one looks at the overall rate of grant towards local spending as a whole it will be seen that it has fallen from over per cent <e> <s> in to under per cent <e> <s> in and whereas local spending between and would have risen by per cent <e> <s> central government spending would have risen by per cent <e> <s> if we exclude social security payments central government expenditure will still have risen by per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i support my noble friend in his amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord bellwin has said that we cannot treat each area as being the same <e> <s> i would like him to point out anything in this amendment which would suggest that we are not going to take account of the different characteristics and circumstances of each of the metropolitan areas <e> <s> we have been making the point right the way through that it is the minister the secretary of state who cannot try to treat things as a matter of methodology each one has to be treated differently <e> <s> in any case the amendment is saying that there should be a method of determining benefits in accordance with principles to be equally applied <e> <s> it is the principles that we want to he the same <e> <s> the principles determining what should be done in one area should be the same as regards another area <e>", "<cs> my lords i continue to be disappointed and for the record when one looks at amendments nos <e> <s> and we are not really asking for anything revolutionary there <e> <s> all we are proposing is to take out the words have particular regard and to insert wording so that the authority must be satisfied that they and the executive <e>", "<cs> the minister always sounds plausible my lords but we have still not received an answer to the question why if in relation to block grant in the process of block grant far larger amounts are involved the whole question of the financing of a local authority is involved in the block grant whereas we are concerned here with just one part of the financing it was good enough and there was no possibility of delay it should not be appropriate here <e> <s> apart therefore from the fact that such a provision is in the act one would have thought that here was an issue which was so plain and simple that our views would be taken into account <e> <s> this is not a question of simply pacifying the opposition in your lordships house but a way of showing that there is concern for the situation of local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i have one difference with the minister about what the ultimate effect is on the secretary of state when he gives his guidance <e> <s> in the amendment we are saying that instead of having particular regard only to the three items mentioned there are other matters to which particular regard should be paid <e> <s> the minister says that there is nothing to prevent an authority from having regard to other matters <e> <s> before third reading we shall consider whether or not to move an amendment which refers to having particular regard to these three points notwithstanding other points to which particular regard can be paid <e> <s> we want to be assured that when regard is given by the authority or executive to other matters neither this nor a future secretary of state will be able to say that these are not matters to which particular regard can be paid and that he is going to knock them out of the plan <e> <s> the minister may say that although they cannot be knocked out of the plan the secretary of state will advise the authority or the executive to knock them out and that if they do not it will affect his decision on guidance <e>", "<cs> my lords once again we meet a brick wall <e> <s> the amendments which we are putting forward have been considered by the representative body of the bodies which are affected by the bill <e> <s> they are troubled by the provisions in the bill and want assurances <e> <s> many of the amendments are directed towards that end but once again the minister speaking on behalf of the government is definite in resisting this amendment <e> <s> again therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies may i say that it so happens that just before my noble friend lord sefton spoke i had written down exactly the same words on my pad <e> <s> i took note of what the minister said that there is no definition of circumstances of an emergency nature and i immediately wrote say we inserted subject to the approval of the secretary of state <e> <s> that suggests that there are at least two people thinking on sensible lines and i think that there are others as well <e> <s> i will dispense with the rest of the notes i have here because i believe that is the cardinal point which has been put to the minister <e> <s> he can cut out a lot of the other parts of the amendment but if we could have written in <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies may i make just two or three points <e> <s> i have been looking very carefully at all the second reading speeches which were made on this subsection in the committee stage but i certainly do not want to repeat any second reading speeches <e> <s> but time and time again the ministers opposite say that the final decision rests with the authority which is free so we are told to make up its own mind about the amount of revenue grants to be paid <e> <s> as my noble friends have emphasised quite strongly the freedom is there but with an iron glove behind it <e> <s> so long as the local authority does what the secretary of state says in his guidance it is free to do what it likes <e> <s> but if it does not accept the secretary of states guidance there is almost an encouragement we mentioned this at second reading in the white paper for people to go to court <e> <s> therefore there is no freedom of the authority when one comes to the last analysis <e> <s> the freedom is there so long as it accepts the advice and guidance of the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister said in his first statement this was partly a probing amendment because we wanted a ministerial statement about why for various reasons such was not forthcoming in the other place <e> <s> but the point which my noble friend lord sefton of garston makes is one to which i hope the government will give some attention <e> <s> the minister just used the words if challenged <e> <s> we want to avoid anybody being challenged and to avoid the necessity of local authorities having to go to court or being taken to court <e> <s> this is not in any way attempting to sidetrack the bill <e> <s> i think that the minister agrees <e> <s> we are not arguing about the governments or the secretary of states power to fix the guidance level <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that <e> <s> so long as with all due respect it is a legal interpretation that holds water because we must bear in mind that the london transport executive and the glc both had a legal interpretation but that did not avoid a court case <e> <s> therefore if a few words in the bill will <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that those who use hyde park corner and have used it over a long period of years have long thought that something was needed to control the traffic problems problems caused mainly by the selfish and impatient driver and therefore that some control was necessary <e> <s> would he also agree that as this is a matter for the glc as the highway authority and for the metropolitan police questions like this could be raised in respect of places all over the country and this is not the place to deal with them <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter i hope that he will support my amendment <e> <s> there is nothing in it to suggest that the matter will be settled in the courts <e> <s> it could possibly lead to the courts as anything else in the bill could possibly lead there but if the matter were to be settled by parliament should the occasion arise the fact that the word reasonably was inserted would greatly assist parliament to wrap the knuckles of the secretary of state <e> <s> therefore i shall look forward to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter supporting me on this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first correct the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth as i have before me a copy of <e>", "<cs> my lords i admit that it is a defect and if i insert the word reasonably perhaps the noble lord will support me at third reading that is the second opportunity he has had to support us <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that once again the minister cannot accept what is a reasonable amendment <e> <s> while the debate was going on i looked very carefully at section there is nothing in section which provides for information to be given <e> <s> subsection provides that the bus company and the london board and the bus company and the railways board shall exchange information <e> <s> but subsection to which the minister referred provides for co-operation with one another in the reorganisation of bus services within the area nothing to do with supplying information for the purpose of this plan because a three-year plan was not even thought of at the time <e> <s> he says they are expected to co-operate with information in order to prepare the tpp each year <e> <s> what we are trying to do in this amendment is not simply to expect them to co-operate but to lay down that it shall be done in the same way that the bill instead of just relying on the commonsense of the executive and the secretary of state to secure the appropriate information for the secretary of state lays down a legal requirement that the executive must provide the information to the secretary of state <e> <s> all we are asking is that we should put in the bill an obligation on the national bus company to supply this information <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord lucas for confirming what i said on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is good to have that matter clarified <e> <s> once again i emphasise as did my noble friend lord mishcon in his remarks that we are not attempting to take out of this subsection the two particular items mentioned there <e> <s> the only basic argument that the minister has put forward is that any other matters are not specified <e> <s> between now and the third reading we shall give some thought to that <e> <s> maybe we can specify items at the same time as making these two points ones to which particular regard shall be given <e> <s> if we can do that that will improve the subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have a great deal to add to what my noble friend lord mishcon has said <e> <s> i would draw the attention of the minister to the fact that this provision is for reviews for particular purposes not just general reviews to check the organisation to see how things are going <e> <s> it is for special purposes which i read out <e> <s> i can only say that it is all very well having sympathy <e> <s> noble lords were awaiting the word but and once again we were not disappointed <e> <s> every sympathy but is what we are told on amendment after amendment <e> <s> everything that the noble lord lord lucas has said confirms that there is no reason why these words should not be put into the bill <e> <s> there is no intention of the minister to conduct unnecessary reviews we would not require unnecessary upheaval certainly the requirement would have to be met not more than once in every three years <e> <s> that is what the amendment says <e>", "<cs> my lords one thing has been overlooked by the minister in his replies and that is subsection <e> <s> the report that has to be presented under the terms of the and acts as detailed in subsection has to contain a statement showing the steps which have been taken by the executive to comply with subsections and of this clause <e> <s> the minister is bound to ask what have you done <e> <s> they include in the report what they have done and whether they have not accepted any tender <e> <s> the next question is why have you not accepted a tender <e> <s> surely if these words are put in they safeguard the transport executive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am absolutely amazed that on this amendment your lordships should be treated to a political talk about the budget <e> <s> i am absolutely amazed that arguments of that kind have to be introduced in an endeavour to turn down this type of amendment <e> <s> the noble lord says that there is a difference of views on priorities <e> <s> there is <e> <s> there is a difference of view as to whether something can be done to assist unemployed persons who despite what the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes said are unemployed through no fault of their own <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord the minister has said anything which suggests that this amendment is not necessary <e> <s> incidentally he referred to the british rail liverpool street station bill and broad street and worship street stations <e> <s> i understand that that matter will be debated on third reading on wednesday and some noble lords will undoubtedly be taking part <e>", "<cs> my lords one is always diffident about speaking on the third reading of a private bill that has gone through one of your lordships committees but the matters on which i wish to speak are really consequential upon consideration by a select committee <e> <s> anyone who knows liverpool street station and the area around it will readily recognise that redevelopment is very long overdue not only because of the number of trains and passengers which use the station but also because of the narrow bottle-neck after one leaves bethnal green <e> <s> this is a plan for the redevelopment of not only the whole of the station but also of the whole of the area around it <e> <s> i emphasise that because i have no wish to hold up the work of redevelopment <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords will be grateful to the noble earl for repeating this statement and generally we welcome consideration that is given to any new initiatives which can help to reconstruct industry in northern ireland <e> <s> noble lords will recall that during our recent appropriation debate concern was expressed by many noble lords at the manufacturing position in northern ireland at the fact that there are more unemployed than at work in the manufacturing industries and at the fact that in certain parts of northern ireland male unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has repeated many of the arguments which we had at the committee and report stages but the house will notice that the minister agreed that there is a change in this amendment that the three-year period would apply by providing for it in the three-year plan <e> <s> the minister has said that this will circumvent the whole idea of financial control but how could this be as the minister has agreed that it is a provision to be put in the three-year plan <e> <s> therefore at the end of that three-year period the position has to be corrected and the deficit has to be cleared by then <e> <s> his argument on that point falls completely to the ground <e> <s> it surely is business common sense as i am certain many noble lords would agree that where there is an unavoidable deficit it is better to spread it over a period where you can plan ahead than having to adjust things quickly for the following year which is what the bill at present provides <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that if one made reference to all the subsections to which the noble lord has referred one would find that it is not as simple as it seems <e> <s> we can trace this on various previous amendments <e> <s> the danger in leaving the bill as it is is that it leaves in quite clearly the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to accept the statement made by the minister <e> <s> however i should have thought that since he has said that there has been a misunderstanding the opportunity could have been taken here to remove the misunderstanding by making quite clear what is meant <e> <s> the very fact that there is a misunderstanding seems to suggest that the text of the clause could be improved <e> <s> however i am delighted to have the assurance of the minister <e> <s> i only hope that the courts too will accept the assurance of the minister <e> <s> what is important is what the courts will decide on the wording of the bill not i say with all due respect on what any minister may say <e> <s> having had the ministers assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if your lordships look carefully at amendment no <e> <s> you will find that there is nothing in there which refers to a change in the guidance level <e> <s> there is nothing in there which refers to a change in the protected level of expenditure <e> <s> the minister said that this would be putting back section into the bill <e> <s> i have already admitted that that is what it intends to do <e> <s> but we have not referred to section of the act we have referred to what we want to do <e> <s> i have already said that the wording of this amendment is precisely the wording taken from section of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords as discussion of the bill continues i grow more and more amazed <e> <s> we are now told that this amendment would interfere with the determination of the grant by the authority <e> <s> the authority can determine nothing <e> <s> it can say what it thinks the grant should be but when the minister can say no i shall give you different guidance and if you dare to vary it somebody can go to the courts that is not determination by the authority <e> <s> with all respect to the minister it is nonsensical to put forward that argument <e>", "<cs> except my lords that i am saying that it is a substantial change to give the authority to the secretary of state <e> <s> this was not proposed in any previous amendment <e> <s> noble lords will see the point that i am trying to make <e> <s> emphasis is placed on the number of courses which are available <e> <s> my noble friends lord sefton and lord mcintosh of haringey have dealt at length with the business arguments against the courses which have been set out <e> <s> to say that if there is an unforeseen emergency one should increase fares in an area where there is to per cent <e> <s> unemployment might result in employers in the area saying what the devil do you think you are doing by increasing fares <e> <s> think of the effect it might have on employers and their employees <e> <s> recourse to borrowing and recourse to increased fares might be unsuitable <e> <s> we are therefore saying that an authority should not be allowed to take this decision they should put their case to the minister <e> <s> if the secretary of state says that he does not regard it as an emergency in which the government can act in this way and asks whether there are other ways of dealing with it then he can say i will not agree <e> <s> but if he considers that a case has been put up the secretary of state will decide <e> <s> that is what this amendment says <e>", "<cs> my lords i am almost tempted to take up the point that the noble lord made about the ama because i am aware of the reply to which he referred <e> <s> the reason why the ama hitherto has not sent various pieces of information is that co-operation was required from the ama on how to carry out a bill to which they were opposed <e> <s> they were not brought into consultation about the provisions of the bill <e> <s> as i shall explain later the white paper and the bill both <e>", "<cs> my lords i should explain that i am withdrawing the amendment having already moved it <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house <e> <s> i seem to have spoken so much that i was forgetting <e> <s> i was dealing with arguments put forward on report and not with arguments put forward at this stage <e> <s> may i formally move the amendment so that the minister can get his reply on record <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that i was able to adjust what i had said previously so as to get the ministers reply on record <e> <s> it was not exactly in the words which the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth has now put forward <e> <s> clause is not a general review of the organisation and operation of the activities of an executive <e> <s> it says it shall determine <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mottistone said that there was no point in the amendment and that it is not an amendment suitable for third reading <e> <s> i should like to follow up what my noble friend lord sefton of garston said and draw <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has given the reasons why the amendment cannot be accepted <e> <s> the reference in subsection to such period refers to the invitation to tender <e> <s> it may well be that when the tenders are received although they may seem satisfactory and the cost would be economically advantageous for some reason or other the executive may wish by agreement with the tenderer to extend the period or it may wish to have a more limited period <e> <s> the minister said that that is what the provision really means <e> <s> this is one of those cases where the addition of a few simple words might avoid a devil of a lot of correspondence interviews and meetings in order to try to settle the issue and at the end of the day might avoid even possible court arguments <e> <s> yet the government are adamant that they will not accept this simple commonsense proposal which would provide a very valuable safeguard <e> <s> the government have resisted the amendment and so i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister says that this may take only a few days after royal assent <e> <s> for the benefit of the noble lord lord teviot i should like to explain why we consider the amendments necessary <e> <s> under the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that i have an opportunity to reply on this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords i thought that the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth had the last word <e>", "<cs> my lords after this debate i will be extremely brief in reply <e> <s> i do not intend to follow the noble lord lord lucas in going through all the amendments to show where they could have been beneficial to the bill and to the house <e> <s> in moving this amendment i did refer to a number of points of disagreement philosophic if you like but also points where this bill could have been improved without interfering one jot with the principle that the government wants <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether the press notice to which he referred a definitive press notice was decided upon before or after the recent medical and scientific report which came out in favour of lead-free petrol <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that prior to this experiment most sensible motorists wished to avoid hyde park corner <e> <s> has not the department stated that the matter is to be monitored <e> <s> would it not therefore be better to wait until the monitoring is completed <e> <s> should not the metropolitan police and the greater london council be congratulated for trying to deal with trouble spots <e> <s> is it not the case that only time will tell <e>", "<cs> that is the point <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i draw attention to the fact that amendment no <e> <s> which we shall be debating shortly does not say that the guidelines will be laid before parliament for approval before being issued it says <e>", "<cs> i am glad that my intervention has clarified the position but not about the way in which it has been clarified because it really means that we are giving parliamentary backing by a document being laid on the table without any discussion about it <e> <s> yet i am certain that when the noble lord lord sandford accepted with gratitude what the government said on his previous amendment he was under the impression that that meant there would be parliamentary discussion on it <e> <s> obviously there will not be in the light of the ministers reply for which i am grateful unless somebody tables a subsequent question or resolution and that is not what the noble lord lord drumalbyn wants <e> <s> i hope that the government will take another look at this because it seems to be the general view that we should have a parliamentary discussion of some kind on the guidelines before they are actually issued <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth for explaining what he calls a simple bill <e> <s> from these benches we give the bill a general welcome in so far as it is essential for the wellbeing of the pla and the mersey docks <e> <s> but this is the fifth occasion in the past four years on which there has been legislation dealing with these docks and the docks position in general <e> <s> the noble lord referred to the ports financial assistance act and to the transport finance act but we also had the port of london finance assistance act which provided for grants to the maximum of million and which was repealed by the act because the figure had to be raised to million within a period of months or so <e> <s> then we had the transport act which was passed by your lordships house just before the easter recess section of which provides for million <e>", "<cs> my lords accepting that any increase in house building is to be desired will the noble lord give the figures for the year before that which he quoted which i believe were the lowest on record for quite a number of years <e>", "<cs> my lords i was asking the noble lord whether he will compare those figures with the figures for the previous year because the general comment on house building figures is that they were the lowest for some or years <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the noble earl lord gowrie for explaining this order but i am certain that he will appreciate that a number of points arise both as clarification and as comment on the various articles <e> <s> we recognise right at the outset that there are special circumstances in northern ireland in this matter but that does not mean that we should automatically let orders go through without seeking views and clarification on a number of points <e> <s> it is recognised as the minister has said that the problem of stray dogs in northern ireland is more serious than that in great britain <e> <s> but the problem still exists in great britain it is a serious problem here also <e> <s> it is also recognised that the northern ireland legislation need not always be the same as that for the rest of the united kingdom but any differences must be justified and there are a few points on which i believe there is a need for justification <e> <s> i shall elaborate on these in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister not agree that it is highly desirable that it be stressed that these particular observations are abhorred and repudiated as much by supporters and members of the labour party as by any other section of the community <e> <s> may i say how much i appreciate the remarks of the minister that the pro-ira resolution was overwhelmingly rejected in a democratic way by the hundreds of delegates present with only a handful supporting it <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that a subsequent resolution was carried deploring and repudiating the actions of the ira and other terrorist organisations as being of little use to the people of northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government accept the view of the royal commission that so long as there is a demand for leaded petrol there is no reason at all why it should not be supplied <e> <s> will the government in their various consultations be having talks with the motoring organisations on this <e>", "<cs> i wish to support my noble friend lord ponsonby of shulbrede in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> there is no intention of debating the whole question of the regulatory machinery <e> <s> we are dealing only with the narrow issue of the appointment of the director general <e> <s> we can deal with the wider issue at a later stage <e> <s> while appreciating the points made by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran supported by my noble friend lord molloy a separate principle is involved <e> <s> we would prefer to keep the two issues separate <e> <s> we might support one but not support the other <e> <s> we shall support both but there might be a difference of view <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble earl for explaining the purpose of the order and say briefly that we welcome it for four reasons first as the noble earl said it was brought before the assembly we are pleased to note that and they gave it approval secondly there were consultations with the professional bodies concerned thirdly i understand it will bring the northern ireland law on this matter into line with that appertaining in england and wales and fourthly possibly as important as any it will bring a cheaper and simpler system of revesting property <e> <s> for those four reasons we welcome the order <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i thank the noble earl for explaining the order <e> <s> i note that this again was one of the recommendations from the assembly when they considered the whole question of industrial development incentives <e> <s> when the noble earl lord ferrers repeated a statement in your lordships house i said that there was need to consider whether the proposals for de-rating and corporation tax were the right ones <e> <s> what there is general agreement upon is that there is a pressing need and i recall that on that occasion i drew the attention of your lordships to the fact that there are more persons unemployed in northern ireland than there are at present engaged in manufacturing industry <e> <s> since then i have noted in a written answer to a question in another place that male unemployment has reached per cent <e> <s> and of course we know that in some areas it is about per cent <e> <s> therefore undoubtedly something needs to be done <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i can add one further reason to that put forward by my noble friend in reply to the question raised by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> this is a new body <e> <s> i know we have other regulatory bodies but this is a regulatory body of a type we have not already had with its dimensions and extensions <e> <s> it is a non-ministerial body not directly accountable to parliament <e> <s> this will be an opportunity for accountability an opportunity for parliamentary quizzing because if the million were exceeded and they had to come to both houses of parliament for affirmative approval that would give an opportunity for both houses to question <e>", "<cs> we are discussing on clause stand part the regulatory machinery and the director general <e> <s> we are not discussing the tempo of change as suggested by the noble lord lord morris <e> <s> we shall come to that when we deal with clause <e> <s> there will undoubtedly be much to be said about it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> he has given us some further information as regards the facts when we come to deal with clause which is what we are really talking about <e> <s> there is another side of the argument that will have to be heard <e> <s> nobody challenges and i am not going to do so as regards clause the success competence and efficiency of bt and its research and development capabilities <e> <s> i have quoted the reason why the government say that we have got to have regulatory machinery with the change to the private sector the company has to be stopped from making excessive profits or operating inefficiently <e> <s> if you had never interfered and brought forward clause you would not need to have this and that point will be made when we come to clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne for explaining the bill <e> <s> when one had the bill this morning for the first time it was difficult to understand exactly what were the provisions because it inserts bits and pieces in other legislation <e> <s> but from the explanation of the noble lord one can now see quite clearly the purpose of it and i am grateful to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i always find it useful to follow the noble earl because in general i find that his approach to these serious problems is one which is in line with the views of myself and my colleagues <e> <s> i join him in his tribute to the effectiveness of our security forces <e> <s> naturally we regret that continued violence and terrorism necessitates renewal of the emergency provisions order <e> <s> although it is generally accepted that the basic cause is men of and violence nevertheless the serious economic and social conditions which we have debated on a number of occasions in your lordships house are also contributory causes <e> <s> that is one reason apart from others why we supported the recently debated move towards industrial incentives <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first say how much i appreciated a great many of the remarks of the noble lord lord hooson particularly his apprehensions about the type of society into which the present government may lead this country <e> <s> with less finesse than the noble lord i would say there is a danger of building still further the im all right jack society <e> <s> it is not my intention to roam over all the subjects covered by this debate and i want to concentrate on just a few <e> <s> but there are a number of details of the proposals in the gracious speech of which we heard nothing and i am assuming that it was the time factor alone which prevented the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor from departing from his post-election analysis to give us details of some of the governments proposed legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister not agree that it is not a question of whether or not individual votes would have any effect on a general election but rather that every member of this house is free to take part in voting in this house including the lords spiritual and we welcome the fact that they do take part and therefore we should all be in the same position when it comes to voting in parliamentary elections <e> <s> is not that the important issue <e> <s> do the government recognise that and if they do recognise it will they do something <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i welcome the fact that the unions are being consulted which i hope other sections of society will follow very carefully particularly in view of the debate to follow can the minister say whether there have been any problems or difficulties which have arisen in these negotiations with lloyds register because it is now nearly months since discussions started <e> <s> if there are hindrances from a body which does not seem to be over-enthusiastic about taking over these responsibilities would it not have been best to leave the testing where it is as is desired by all operators haulage and public service in both the private sector and the public sector <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that one has to take account of the wishes of the electors in a particular area and that they should not be insulted for wanting certain decisions made on behalf of their area <e> <s> is the minister aware that some of the projected legislation is being strongly criticised by the local authority associations <e> <s> will the government have discussions with the associations not about how to introduce legislation but whether it is desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble earl for repeating that statement but i think noble lords will agree that it is somewhat of a non-event <e> <s> we seem to have been here before <e> <s> it is a repetition of points made in our recent debate in this house on the gracious speech and points that we actually expected <e> <s> of course we all want the widest participation of members in any organisation <e> <s> in passing one would question the position of the conservative party as regards the participation of its members as regards the election of its own leader who becomes the prime minister at certain times and also as regards the election of its own chairman who i think is appointed by the leader without the participation of a single member of the conservative party <e> <s> of course we all know that in many companies the decisions are taken by a few big institutions <e> <s> therefore there are lessons in democracy and participation to be learned on the other side as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am replying on the government statement and i do not think that this is an occasion for me to give way <e> <s> if the government are to proceed on these lines would they be prepared to give consideration to the position of commercial donations to political parties decisions about which are taken in the main by a few institutions <e> <s> should not the workpeople be aware of political donations and should not consumers be aware of political donations when they purchase objects at the shops <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble earl for the information that he has given regarding this draft order <e> <s> i should certainly like to welcome the noble earl in his new capacity <e> <s> as minister of state he has responsibilities in connection with all the northern ireland problems and i am certain that the house will echo what he has said about the importance of agriculture to northern ireland <e> <s> i gather that he is dealing in particular with northern ireland agricultural matters <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble viscount will kindly give way my intention was not to criticise the extra cost but to point out the benefits of public spending which i should like to see in the rest of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has said that the wheel clamping of diplomatic cars has been suspended <e> <s> does this mean also that it is not within the province of the metropolitan police to remove a diplomatic car when it is impeding the flow of traffic and is in a dangerous position <e> <s> if so i think that most people will regard that as being something that should be looked into very seriously <e> <s> as one of those of us who supported the experimental period for wheel clamps may i ask whether the noble lord is satisfied that sufficient publicity is being continually given to the experiment in order that the experiment should act as a deterrent <e> <s> some of us regard the experiment as one which would be successful on the deterrent principle rather than in just getting convictions <e>", "<cs> my lords i first wish to thank the noble viscount for his comprehensive review of the contents of this order which we generally welcome because as he has explained it provides in the main that three aspects of criminal law in northern ireland shall be brought into line with those pertaining in england and wales <e> <s> i think it will be generally agreed that it would be highly undesirable for an important order of this kind to be introduced into parliament unless it was based on the existing law in england and wales because there would be so many important principles at stake which could be dealt with only by acceptance or rejection and not at all by amendment <e> <s> it is because these proposals are based primarily on the act for england and wales that we welcome them <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that unless there is something special about st jamess street it is not only motor-cyclists who are discourteous there is such an element in all road users whether they are in private cars or pedestrians many of whom do not know how to use the crossings properly and that this can only be cured by the enforcement to which the minister referred and also by education <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that it is not only consideration of any possible change in the electoral system that is so important to us but whether or not such a change would interfere with our political system <e> <s> would he also agree that the political system is just as important as any electoral reform <e>", "<cs> my lords as the criterion for by-passes has been towns of at least population can the minister say how many will not have been by-passed by the end of the s <e> <s> can he also say whether any of the projected plans are likely to be affected by the proposed public expenditure cuts <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl the minister two questions <e> <s> first will he confirm that he has seen the recently published report of the manpower services commission particularly paragraph which states that as a result of these special measures some persons have been taken off the list of unemployed <e> <s> will that factor be taken into consideration when the government are referring to unemployment figures <e> <s> secondly there have been allegations that some of the training schemes have been used for cheap labour <e> <s> is this being monitored and what action will the government take <e>", "<cs> my lords i need not detain the house long on this bill <e> <s> any measure which as explained in part i endeavours to carry through the provisions of the health and safety at work etc <e> <s> act is to be welcomed <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for explaining the terms <e> <s> he said that part i of the bill is simple to understand <e> <s> no matter what is in the memorandum in the front of the bill or in clause which deals with the improvement notices frankly it is almost impossible to understand to what it refers <e> <s> it refers to relevant statutory provisions but the interpretation clause refers to the provisions of schedule which in turn refers to the provisions of no fewer than acts either wholly or in part <e> <s> one needed the ministers explanation to gather exactly what clause is about <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain the whole house will be grateful to my noble friend lord plant for tabling this question on the use of our waterways <e> <s> we are also grateful for the very detailed information which he gave in his comprehensive speech <e> <s> i hope that other noble lords have the same feeling as i do that those who have been taking part in this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords absolutely <e> <s> i was coming to that later when i referred to the outstanding debts <e> <s> it is a factor that has to be considered <e> <s> nobody charges road hauliers the interest charges or costs of maintaining the roads <e> <s> therefore in that respect there is not equality of treatment between road and waterway freight <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> the same problem of from where to where <e> <s> can arise with a -tonne lorry <e> <s> some of their loads will have to be transhipped as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords before these instructions were issued was there any consultation with the motoring organisations and with the glc <e> <s> in the light of some reports of unfortunate incidents which would appear to have been better treated by fixed penalty notices can there be some interim discussions with those organisations without waiting for the final report <e> <s> does the minister appreciate how disappointed the house was when his noble friend replied to a supplementary question last week concerning diplomats and their cars <e> <s> the question which i put and which was not answered was if it is not permissible to put wheel clamps on diplomatic cars does that mean that such cars cannot be moved even if they are in a very dangerous position <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the lord for repeating this statement <e> <s> naturally i have not seen the white paper to which the statement refers <e> <s> there will be a general desire to have the best possible system of public transport for london but i must remind the house that the transport systems of most capitals in europe have far greater revenue support than does transport in greater london <e> <s> the transport bill on which your lordships spent a considerable time made provision for financing transport in greater london and the metropolitan counties and provision for annual reports spread over periods of three years <e> <s> it seems as if your lordships wasted a considerable amount of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for explaining the provisions of this draft order <e> <s> in effect it seems to me that the order is an enabling provision in so far as it needs to be considered with the proposed regulations <e> <s> the regulations comprise a massive document of nine parts regulations and four schedules and your lordships will be pleased to know that i do not propose to cover them except to say that the explanatory note about the proposed regulations is rather limited <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for explaining the order <e> <s> once again i must comment that we have here a massive order which if it was not for the peculiar position of northern ireland legislation would be the subject of a bill in so far as it covers articles and schedules which cannot be amended and can only be accepted or rejected <e> <s> i note that this has been considered by the northern ireland committee of the other place and that a number of criticisms were made <e> <s> again i would comment as i did on the previous order that there was a most useful discussion at the assembly which issued an excellent report on this order <e> <s> that again testifies to the value of the assembly in regard to the social problems of northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the minister for repeating this statement and first from these benches to join in his expression of sympathy to the family of the prison officer who was killed and to the other prison officers who sustained injuries <e> <s> we are pleased to have confirmation of the appointment of sir james hennessy to conduct this inquiry into all the circumstances of this escape and to know that he has a man inspectorate team to assist in that inquiry <e> <s> it will be appreciated that there is considerable public disquiet and that there are many important matters <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister for clarification of one question that i put to him with regard to co-operation from other countries <e> <s> is there any suspicion that some of these prisoners still at large <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for repeating this further statement today and also for letting myself and i assume other lords concerned have a copy of the secretary of states letter to the chairman of the board which fills in some of the gaps in the statement <e> <s> i find both the statement and the letter to the chairman of the board disappointing except for the reference to the fact that the government will not be pressing for a programme of major route closures <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house does not want to prolong this discussion but the noble lord kindly answered my question by saying yes a statement had been made in another place that the pso grant for the ensuing year was reduced to million <e> <s> will the noble lord confirm the actual reduction whether that has been discussed with the board and what will he the effect on next years working <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to thank the noble lord lord beloff for opening this debate today <e>", "<cs> i wish to raise one or two questions on the bill and the first relates to clause <e> <s> the question also has some bearing on clauses and <e> <s> i think noble lords will agree that at second reading the minister stated quite clearly that this was very much a technical bill and i am grateful for the notes on clauses which have been prepared by the department a copy of which the minister has supplied to me <e> <s> i have found them very useful <e> <s> i should like to refer to the last sentence of paragraph of the notes on clauses dealing with subsection of the clause <e> <s> i shall read the sentence <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that explanation and i shall read carefully in <e>", "<cs> my understanding of what the minister says is that while we are deleting various references to hovercraft it is nevertheless the case that by the proposed new clause after clause references to hovercraft will still be made but under regulations under the act <e> <s> that being so can the minister say why it is necessary or desirable to remove the reference in the long title to hovercraft <e> <s> the long title refers to statutory provisions relating to the safety of ships and hovercraft and other matters <e> <s> if regulations will still be issued on hovercraft under the new clause to go in after clause it should surely still remain in the long title <e> <s> i gather from what the minister says that although we are deleting certain parts there will still be the health and safety conditions relating to hovercraft which all of us desire <e>", "<cs> we naturally welcome what the minister has said about the provision in this amendment for the representation of a trade union or a trade union representative <e> <s> i should like to ask whether in framing the nature of the amendments the fact that the secretary of state will have the power to select whom he wishes from the panel of trade union representatives is a matter that has been discussed with the trade unions concerned before the amendment was prepared <e>", "<cs> this is the second clause upon which i said that i had questions to ask the minister <e> <s> clause amends legislation by introducing a new definition of limitation tonnage <e> <s> again i found the notes on clauses dealing with part ii extremely helpful they certainly threw some light on what is a very complicated and technical matter <e> <s> however they include an explanation of problems that might arise if there was immediate implementation of the tonnage convention and they set out transitional arrangements <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister where in the bill there is any provision for these transitional arrangements <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> clause as amended agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that when he repeated the statement on british rail last week i and other noble lords complained that there was nothing in the statement about investment and nothing about electrification <e> <s> will he also agree that by and large his reply on those points was not reassuring <e> <s> does the noble lord also recall that when the statement was made in the other place the secretary of state in reply to supplementaries implied criticism of the board in that only per cent <e> <s> of the investment was taken up in <e> <s> in that connection is the minister aware that the board has been complaining for the last few years that it has not been able to reach its investment ceiling because of the pressures of the external financing limits so that in this meant that the investment could not reach the ceiling by million and in by million <e> <s> what will be the secretary of states response to investment proposals in the corporate plan for the next five years <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister when the completion of the m from the theydon garnon interchange with the m to waltham abbey is likely to he completed <e> <s> is the minister aware of the considerable concern in the epping forest district about the position that will arise when the interchange the slipway on the m at honey lane takes effect <e> <s> this is because there is no north-facing slipway from the debden entrance on to the m and there is likely to be considerable traffic going through local roads the roads bisecting epping forest and narrow lanes in epping forest by traffic which wishes to get on to the m to link up with the m <e> <s> is the minister aware of that <e> <s> if he is not will he make inquiries and see <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that despite certain press comments to the contrary there is no problem whatever either to the car manufacturing industry or to the petroleum industry in producing and running cars on lead-free petrol <e> <s> there have been comments to the contrary <e> <s> is it not possible to speed up the negotiations with the eec countries so that we can have this operating before <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the ministers reply may i ask him this <e> <s> will he confirm that the information and figures which are given in the document on policy for roads relate in the main to trunk roads whereas the civic trusts report relates not only to trunk roads but to the primary routes which are referred to by the department as those previously extensively used by lorries <e> <s> does he accept therefore that the number of villages and towns without any plans for by-passes by the end of greatly exceeds the figures given in the document on policy for roads <e> <s> is this not very important in view of the fact that the government were able to recommend the heavy lorries scheme on the promise that all villages and towns would be by-passed <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of what the noble lord lord mottistone has said i await the ministers comments with great interest <e> <s> as a layman looking at the amendment and the wording of the bill i see a considerable difference between a notice prohibiting departure and a notice causing delay <e> <s> the delay may not be due to the actual notice <e> <s> it may be caused perhaps unnecessarily by the authorities handling the ship <e> <s> if however there is to be discussion between the general council of british shipping and the minister in order to provide a more suitable amendment we await it with interest <e>", "<cs> my lords we have just concluded a very long debate and have some other important business yet to come <e> <s> nevertheless some important points arise on this bill the second reading of which the noble lord lord bethell had just moved including of course a point on the date of its inception <e> <s> no matter what may be ones sympathetic attitude to the principle of this bill the points i wish to raise are rather important <e> <s> we cannot treat this as just another bill to be allowed to go through without our considering some important points <e> <s> we are dealing <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister remember a number of occasions when i and other members on this side of the house made it quite clear that we believe in a mixed economy <e> <s> will the minister say whether the government believe in a mixed economy and where they draw the limits of their polemical attack upon public ownership <e>", "<cs> you are better off than i am <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that my noble friend lord molloy has again brought this proposal forward <e> <s> as the noble lord lord tordoff said we have had this before your lordships on three occasions <e> <s> when i proposed amendments dealing with this principle at the committee and report stages of the transport bill emphasis was laid on the fact that the transport bill was not the correct vehicle for such a proposal even though we went on to discuss certain aspects of it <e> <s> my noble friends bill for the same purpose was not thrown out on principle in march this year <e> <s> the amendment that it be read six months hence was carried if i remember correctly by a majority of votes on a friday afternoon <e> <s> i hope that we may have a different result today and i am delighted to learn from the noble lord lord tordoff that he and his colleagues will give the bill their support <e>", "<cs> my lords is that figure based on assuming that all the unemployed travel at the moment and therefore pay fares when with a concessionary scheme they would not be paying fares or is it merely a hunch <e> <s> because many of the unemployed do not travel at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister has stated that in his view assets should be in the hands of the private sector could he explain to the house why the government propose to nationalise london transport <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that the house is grateful to the minister for repeating this very important statement <e> <s> i and my noble friends will support any steps necessary for the safety of the bridge and to ensure the flow of traffic which is so essential for the economic wellbeing of south wales and of wales in general <e> <s> but in the light of the statement that we have just heard without narking on the issue i must express on behalf of my noble friends deep regret that action was not taken earlier on the first report in march <e>", "<cs> my lords may i revert to the order which the minister moved about an hour ago <e> <s> i join the minister in expressing appreciation of the work of the traffic commissioners as well as of their staffs in the various area offices <e> <s> the minister said that the government were reluctant to change a system that has worked well and i noted when the order was discussed in the other place that the minister of state said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to delay the noble lord but i have a point concerning the traffic commissioners centres <e> <s> he will correct me if i am wrong but if it is a case of making representations in person will not the traffic commissioners be based at one particular centre <e> <s> where there are two traffic area officers surely they will not move themselves around from one area office to another or am i incorrect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that the whole house will have been pleased to hear the maiden speech of my noble friend lord fitt and will be pleased that he is with us in this house <e> <s> i am certain that he will bring to the house added sincerity and conviction on the issues of northern ireland <e> <s> i am sure that the whole house will pay tribute to his courage and to his conviction <e> <s> knowing his views on political and social matters i feel certain that the house will wish to hear my noble friend not only on northern ireland issues but on other matters as well <e> <s> we thank him for his contribution this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating this statement <e> <s> it is a tragic commentary that consideration of an order dealing with the recreation and ordinary life of people in northern ireland has to be interrupted by a statement of this tragic nature <e> <s> first from these benches we join in expressing sympathy to the families of all those persons who have been killed and to those who are suffering injury <e> <s> we join also in the expression in the statement of horror at this indescriminate and insensate act <e> <s> i note in particular in the statement the emphasis of the universal condemnation which is being given by all sections in the united kingdom and also in the republic of ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the noble lord lord kings norton for his excellent summary of the report for the comprehensive nature of the report and also for enabling me to take part in the work of sub-committee f on this transport issue <e> <s> at present community permits cover only a very small part of the united kingdom haulage to the continent most is on bilateral agreements <e> <s> in fact only some per cent <e> <s> of the total international haulage throughout the community is by community directives <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> the reference which i made was to paragraph of the memorandum of the road haulage association and the noble lord the minister may refer to that after the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister indicate briefly what monitoring arrangements are made to check on oil spillage <e> <s> are the government satisfied that everything possible is being done in that monitoring <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord understand that a considerable number of motorists the majority of motorists recognise that these markings are for their own safety <e> <s> if there is any difficulty could the department consider using radio or television spots from time to time to draw attention to these and possibly other important points <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord has mistaken what i asked <e> <s> there seems to be confusion about or a tendency to ignore these markings which are valuable to us <e> <s> i was asking whether publicity on the correct use of them by motorists could be given on radio and television <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure and a privilege to follow the noble viscount lord rochdale <e> <s> any noble lord who did not already know of the noble viscounts great interest in shipping would have appreciated it from the speech we have just heard <e> <s> it is what one would expect bearing in mind that he was chairman of the committee of inquiry into the shipping industry in the report of which bears his name <e> <s> i also rise with some trepidation because i was not a member of the sub-committee which presented this report and there are a number of other noble lords to speak who have associations with the shipping industry <e> <s> i congratulate the noble viscount on his excellent summary of the whole report and his views on the future of the shipping industry and on this report itself <e> <s> i found it as he said a useful report a fascinating report although not one that i recommend to re-read as i did for bedtime reading <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor recall <e>", "<cs> my lords though obviously i would wish to assist any voters to record their vote is it not a fact that extension of postal voting for these categories would possibly entail a change in the timetable for the election <e> <s> is it not also the fact that since no postal votes have ever been allowed to any person living overseas <e> <s> can the minister say whether this is a single issue that is being considered or is it in a general package of amendments to the representation of the people acts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for explaining the bill in detail <e> <s> this certainly gives those such as myself a much better understanding than hitherto of what is intended by the bill <e> <s> although it is a few years since i was in the spalding area and travelled over the bridge i recognise the importance of its replacement <e> <s> the minister has made clear that in recent years there has been really no commercial traffic at all <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that although the tyne and wear metro is a great success it is merely part of the countys integrated transport system <e> <s> taking into account the whole of the county transport system would not the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister appreciate how gratified many noble lords will be for his answers since the matter was raised in your lordships house on th july <e> <s> on that occasion the minister said that where a diplomatic car is causing an obstruction it can be towed away <e> <s> can the noble lord intimate how many such cars have been towed away since the matter was raised on th july <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will recognise the general consternation at the vast figure that he mentioned some cases <e> <s> presumably when the new classifications were determined some estimate was made as to what would be the likely reduction in the number of offences <e> <s> can he give such an estimate and can he say whether the home office is in touch with the foreign and commonwealth office about whether our diplomats abroad are responsible for similar offences <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord the minister for repeating this statement made in the other place by the secretary of state for transport <e> <s> i must make it clear on behalf of the opposition that whatever may be the future structure of british airways we wish british airways and its staff well in its position as one of the major airlines in the world <e> <s> the statement pays tribute to the chairman to the board and staff for the improvements achieved <e> <s> there must be the obvious question why then interfere with it <e> <s> why not leave it in the hands of the present management and staff <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the minister for his excellent review of this order and for getting through so much information in such a short time <e> <s> i must stress that although on this side of the house we readily agreed to discuss these three orders during the interval in the previous bill we shall insist that the three orders be fully discussed in fairness not only to the people of northern ireland but to those of us in this house who have responsibility for various matters <e> <s> although the debate is limited to a very few points in this particular order there are a number of issues on which i should like to raise points and questions to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords for brevity but not because i do not realise the seriousness of the order we are considering i can say that i agree with practically everything which the noble earl said about the seriousness of the position <e> <s> apart from the stress and the emotion for all the people in northern ireland the actual figures of the dead and injured and the suffering since are horrific <e>", "<cs> my lords in effect we are considering primary legislation in the form of an order which cannot be amended a comment i have made in connection with a number of recent northern ireland orders <e> <s> i agree with what the noble earl has said about the deliberations of the assembly and the helpful report which was produced <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he is aware of the deteriorating condition of the library services in northern ireland <e> <s> is he aware that the library committee of the area board of belfast has a dilemma either to leave the local libraries in being with greatly reduced services or to cut by half the number of those local libraries mainly in the central areas <e> <s> would it not be a tragedy if those areas which were suffering from the present conditions had that kind of cut particularly as one-third of the book issues are to young people <e> <s> could the government possibly help by taking over the cost of the reference library which acts as a regional service and has users a day <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister two questions <e> <s> first in view of the fact that one of the original reasons given by the metropolitan police for wheel clamping and i supported the experiment was to deal with persistent offenders can the minister say what method the police use to deal with that problem and what percentage of the cars clamped belonged to persistent offenders <e> <s> in view of the fact that during the past year million vehicles have remained untaxed and there have been only prosecutions because of the limited resources of the police does the minister believe that wheel clamping can be used to look at the possible number of untaxed vehicles <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lords answer to the first supplementary question indicate that the government have not at all thought out this matter but having made a political decision are now trying to find arguments to justify it <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the ministers comment on northern ireland will the minister review the position of the northern ireland economic councils report which stated that the level of public spending reflects the degree of economic activity <e> <s> if there had not been public spending in northern <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister seemed to dismiss my noble friends question as to whether he is aware that the general attitude of this report is also reflected by the three local authority associations <e> <s> as there was a white paper seemingly for consultation what notice have the government taken of the wholesale rejection of the governments white paper by the three local authority associations <e>", "<cs> my lords while we obviously all welcome the encouraging figures for the first eight months may i ask the minister whether the government will take every opportunity to ensure that publicity is given not only to the reduced numbers of deaths and accidents but also to the per cent <e> <s> wearing rate in order that there will he no diminution in seat-belt wearing because of complacency <e> <s> have the government considered report no <e> <s> of the transport and road research laboratory on the effects of front seat passengers being involved in direct impact with passengers occupying rear seats <e>", "<cs> three and a half hours <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to the armitage report which said at that time that it was not certain whether there was a serious threat of accidents arising as a result of spray <e> <s> do i take it that the reference to the british standards institution means that the department has now accepted that there is a serious accident problem caused by spray <e> <s> also will he say whether this will apply to <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble viscount for repeating this very important statement on a most unhappy affair <e> <s> there have been three inquiries already including that of the ruc conducted by sir george terry to which the noble viscount and the statement refer which failed to deal adequately with the matter to satisfy general public concern <e> <s> the northern ireland assembly expressed the public concern and as the statement says it is vitally important to ensure that the procedures and administration of residential care for children and young people are such that to a great extent at least any possible repetition of these incidents is avoided <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister did not deal with the question i asked <e> <s> i was not asking what consultations there had been after the terms of reference had been known but what consultations had taken place in preparing the terms of reference because they are most vital <e> <s> while i agree that we must not rush this inquiry those who are responsible for the administration will be waiting anxiously for the decision of the inquiry <e> <s> that is why i asked whether some indication could be given of the date when the government would like to have the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to thank my noble friend lord cledwyn of penrhos for opening this debate <e> <s> i am certain that he must be very satisfied with the constructive nature of all the speeches and the facts and information that have been given <e> <s> it has been a very wide-ranging debate <e> <s> in talking of the infrastructure speakers could have ranged even wider than the subjects with which they dealt tonight because the infrastructure in effect concerns the whole course of our economy our environment and our living <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that in our excellent debate on shipping competition it was made clear and the government department concerned agreed that the beneficial owners of about per cent <e> <s> of united kingdom registered shipping are foreign companies <e> <s> are the figures that he has given net figures or do they allow for any of those receipts which are transferred out of this country <e> <s> also does he not agree that crosstrading is imperilled by flags of convenience and discriminatory action by other countries <e> <s> may i ask what the government propose to do to avoid that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press the minister further <e> <s> he answered the second part of my question on the governments action on crosstrading and discrimination but not the first part which was that it is generally agreed that the beneficial owners of per cent <e> <s> of the united kingdom registered shipping fleet are foreign companies <e> <s> therefore are the figures that he has given to the noble lord lord gridley net after allowing for money transferred out of this country from those receipts or are they gross figures <e>", "<cs> my lords first perhaps i may congratulate and thank the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne for his maiden speech <e> <s> as other noble lords have said it sounded a cautionary note which was welcome although i did not agree with its general tenor <e> <s> all noble lords who have taken part in the debate are with perhaps the exception of the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne of one view <e> <s> help is needed for the launching of the airbus <e> <s> i also thank the noble earl lord kimberley for opening the debate with a well-informed speech based upon his experience and knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble earl for repeating what is a most serious statement <e> <s> though the secretary of state commends the report i think it unwise to comment in detail until there has been opportunity to read it and study it thoroughly <e> <s> however from the points made in the statement it is clear that the report is comprehensive thorough and frank and thanks will be due to sir james hennessy and the team who worked with him for carrying out the review and for the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the minister for outlining these regulations <e> <s> i was going to ask about consultation with the political parties because i had noticed the reference by the under-secretary of state when the other place discussed the regulations last week <e> <s> the minister has said that there has been consultation with political parties local authority associations <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down can he deal with the question i raised on the boundary commissions and their reports <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there would be general agreement over the seriousness of the figures which the minister has just given <e> <s> in the light of the fact that in the general classification of motor cycle casualties over half of them are teenagers can the minister say whether that figure also applies to moped riders or is the figure greater <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply which i do not think has given us the full facts <e> <s> may i ask whether it is not the case that the transport supplementary grant has been reduced by per cent <e> <s> overall and that the rate of grant above the threshold has been reduced from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> has not this led to a substantial switch of grant from the glc and the metropolitan areas where the needs of transportation are the greater and as the government have accepted a higher rate of <e>", "<cs> my lords that reply does not deal with the point that the government have themselves accepted a per cent <e> <s> increase in expenditure on transport by the local authorities <e> <s> the government have accepted a higher expenditure and yet at the same time in the ministers own words it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am asking the question <e> <s> i am asking the minister is it not a fact that at the same time that the government have done that in the ministers own words they have reduced the grant by per cent <e> <s> to meet a higher accepted rate of expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the last report of london transport emphasised that in october the government had approved a proposal for light railway in docklands to be financed jointly by the london docklands development corporation and the glc <e> <s> is that not an excellent example of public enterprise <e> <s> moreover as it is to link up with the ordinary underground system is not the matter best left there <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for repeating this important statement <e> <s> at the outset i must comment that i am pleased that the statement emphasises in a number of places the importance of the severn crossing to the economy of severnside and south wales <e> <s> in general we on these benches welcome the three decisions which are somewhat in line with the points made when the earlier statement was made on th november last <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for explaining the regulations <e> <s> although i do not wish to take up undue time because there is important business to follow i welcome as i am sure the whole house welcomes regulations whose intention is to provide for safety <e> <s> in this case i have two particular interests first because so many young people use bicycles and we know of the accident rate among young persons who use bicycles secondly for many years i was a cycling club captain <e> <s> it was almost as many years ago as i care to forget but i still have those recollections <e>", "<cs> perhaps with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord will have read the british airways response <e> <s> did he note that in the response they made it quite clear that the question of privatisation is completely irrelevant to the question of competition and the development of the airline industry <e> <s> in the light of this will the government reconsider their plans <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to roadside tests <e> <s> can he say whether any arrangements are being made for the compulsory annual testing of heavy goods lorries to include the testing of noise from engines and exhausts <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to my earlier supplementary question the minister said that because of the complicated nature of the machinery it was not <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount appreciate that except for debates on northern ireland orders and statements which are tragically all too frequent there is no opportunity for your lordships to debate the general question of northern ireland <e> <s> will the government therefore give an undertaking whatever the report of the new ireland forum may be that there will be a debate in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to understand from the ministers reply that the government do accept there is a need for a standardised release fitting for seat belts <e> <s> if they do not is there any reason why <e> <s> if they do what discussions are taking place with manufacturers <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for explaining the regulations <e> <s> as the noble earl has said in the main they cover similar ground to the regulations which we discussed just a fortnight ago dealing with the rest of the united kingdom <e> <s> there may be a temptation by some noble lords to argue about why there should be a different voting system <e> <s> i have never accepted that the single transferable vote is proportional representation <e> <s> but the fact is that it was introduced in northern ireland in and as the <e>", "<cs> my lords i again thank the noble earl for his helpful explanation of the order <e> <s> it is clear from what the noble earl has said that this is an essential provision a new provision and one which attempts to correct the position of the electoral divisions which have existed now for years <e> <s> as long as the single transferable vote is considered necessary particularly in dealing with the local elections in northern ireland we must have proper machinery to determine district electoral areas <e> <s> i am pleased that the noble earl has stressed that we are not debating the principle of the single transferable vote <e> <s> i use that term and not proportional representation because i have never regarded stv as being pr <e> <s> it may provide for a minority representation but it is not proportional representation <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble baroness for repeating the answer given in another place <e> <s> while appreciating the activity now taking place from the british consulate one must ask why there is this delay <e> <s> the noble baroness will undoubtedly have heard on the radio appalling reports of some lorry drivers having been stranded for eight days without any contact at all from any united kingdom representative <e> <s> i must ask why there is this delay <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble baroness can amplify on the question of assistance because i heard on the radio one lorry driver who complained of shortage of food of the difficulty in getting diesel oil replacements because they need to keep the engines going to keep themselves warm and i must ask what arrangements will be made for possible relief crews and for the security of the vehicles if the crews have to leave them and they are stranded for from six to eight days <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that coopers and lybrand are respected management consultants well experienced in local government matters who have been used by various government departments including the department of the environment <e> <s> the noble lord has seen the first report but has he also seen the final report which was issued last wednesday and which gave the financial implications <e> <s> is not the conclusion of both reports not what the minister has just said but that the facts in the white paper are misleading and that far from there being any savings there could he additional costs <e> <s> does not this make it absolutley essential that the government should do what they have not yet done that is issue their own justification for their claims so that we can set that against the coopers and lybrand report <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that the point in my noble friends question on the continuation of services of the metropolitan councils is linked to the question i raised on the coopers and lybrand report <e> <s> despite what the minister has said does not that financial analysis make absolutely clear that if the present services are continued there cannot be the savings which the government claim there can only he savings if there is a deterioration in the services <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has not replied to the last point i raised on my first supplementary question <e> <s> as there is obviously a difference between the governments reading of this <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister explain why the government now have to look into all these matters and did not consider them before they took their political decision <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the minister for repeating what is a very serious statement and at the outset from these benches we wish to join in sending sympathy to the inspector sir michael giddings and to his wife and family <e> <s> what is described in the statement is appalling and we wholeheartedly join in the condemnation of the activities that have been set out <e> <s> it is disgraceful that anyone performing a public duty of this kind should be subjected to such treatment as is outlined in the statement and that the inquiry procedures should be violated in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords may i clarify the first question that i put to the noble lord <e> <s> i was not asking so much that reports of previous inquiries should be made available <e> <s> my information is that requests at previous inquiries for the very important report of the consultants to be presented to the inquiry were refused <e> <s> i was asking whether consideration could be given to making sure that it is presented at any new inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that this is a submission from some or more official passenger transport users groups in greater london and the metropolitan counties <e> <s> will he also recognise that the submission is highly critical of the proposals in the governments white paper that it is concerned that there may be an erosion of the progress made in passenger transport development since the metropolitan counties were established and that it is concerned that the question of passenger transport will be divorced from other important subjects not least strategic planning <e> <s> as almost every report dealing with <e>", "<cs> my lords i must ask whether the minister has really read the submission <e> <s> i have a copy here and my two extracts are only two of seven submissions all of which are in line with what i said <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for repeating this statement <e> <s> in general from these benches we welcome the various decisions as set out in the statement and join in wishing success to all the projects <e> <s> i shall deal with only two of them <e> <s> when your lordships debated the question of the a airbus on th january there was general support throughout the house for british participation <e> <s> therefore we welcome the support that is proposed for this project <e> <s> but the launch aid of million falls well short of the million which i understand aerospace had requested <e> <s> are the government satisfied that the company will be able to raise the difference and meet any costs that may be involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for explaining the order which is before us tonight <e> <s> as he rightly says it is of a very complex nature and very technical <e> <s> i would not ask the minister to explain to me the actual noise standards which are set out in the seven parts of schedule and schedule but as these are matters of international agreement i am sure that noble lords like myself will accept them as they are presented to us <e> <s> it is an important order <e> <s> the development of aviation makes the question of noise control important and while we all wish to see the further development of air travel as with heavy lorries the development must be what is environmentally acceptable <e> <s> i was very pleased to note the sympathetic approach of the noble lord the minister to that point <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mottistone is to be thanked for bringing forward this bill and for explaining its provisions <e> <s> when i sought to find what the other place said about it to my amazement i found that on th january it went through second reading and all the other stages without any explanation whatever <e> <s> therefore we are grateful for the explanation given to us this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express appreciation to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for this consolidation bill <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord explained a vast number of changes have taken place since we had the last bill <e> <s> this bill will be much appreciated by everyone involved in road traffic regulations <e> <s> we express our appreciation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred to the maximum possible passenger capacity at gatwick <e> <s> can he inform the house whether there is a fixed figure of annual aircraft movements at gatwick <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the noble lord lord lucas for explaining this order <e> <s> while i agree that the tables are perfectly clear the explanatory note to the order does not tell us the present and future limits for different vehicles <e> <s> i found the appendix to the departments press notice issued on th february particularly helpful in this respect because it set out in simple form the present limits and the new limits to which they are changing <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord the minister recall the answer he gave to me recently when i put a supplementary question as to whether the government propose to make a response to the coopers and lybrand report and he said his right honourable friend the secretary of state had issued a press statement <e> <s> on reflection does the minister not consider that a press statement is a woefully inadequate response to a well thought out document and would it not be helpful to everyone if there was a government reply to all the details in this report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to ask the minister again but he said that the answer one gets to these reports depends on what one puts in <e> <s> but surely he is aware that the report was not one compiled by the metropolitan county councils but it was compiled by very noted managerial consultants coopers and lybrand <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for introducing this order i think all noble lords will be pleased to have the good news which he has given of his noble friend lord mansfield and i am certain all noble lords will wish to send the noble earl our best wishes and our deepest sympathy <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that when the house agreed to this experimental scheme it was fully aware of all the problems that there were no party whips anywhere in the house on this issue and that the house was quite prepared to accept it for an experimental period following which we should assess the position <e> <s> is that not the best way in which to leave the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords although i share the general concern of the minister at drink and driving offences may i ask whether he would agree that there must be public confidence in the breath measuring instruments <e> <s> in the light of disclosures in one national newspaper do the government propose to make any statement about them in order to restore public confidence <e> <s> is this not the opportunity to reconsider the governments attitude on the alternative option of blood or urine <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount not agree that any celebration should take place only if it can be used to advance towards reconciliation and understanding <e> <s> unless that is done it can be counter-productive <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that there is a widespread desire to see the regeneration of london docklands <e> <s> however in view of the aircraft noise regulations which this house carried a few days ago i understand that only one type of aircraft could use this airport if it is established is the minister satisfied that such aircraft would come within the aircraft noise regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish first to congratu-late and thank the noble lord lord walston <e> <s> for bringing forward this bill <e> <s> i am certain that many noble lords will be as i am surprised that these provisions did not already exist <e> <s> the bill is obviously much needed to fill a gap <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the principle of the amendment because it is something that ought to be in the bill <e> <s> equally the committee must take regard to what the noble lord lord mottistone emphasised at second reading that any amendment going back to the other place could delay this bill <e> <s> the bill is such a useful bill that it would be sad if we pushed forward an amendment much as we want that amendment in the bill and it delayed or <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for that answer <e> <s> may i ask him whether he agrees that the profits he has just announced reflect considerable credit on this nationalised undertaking and the workers within it <e> <s> will he say whether it is a fact that the secretary of state directed the british railways board to dispose of the sealink ferry fleet and the harbours <e> <s> do i understand from the minister that the ferry fleet and the harbours will be sold as one unit <e> <s> is there any reason why the british railways board is not retaining an interest in this profitable company <e>", "<cs> my lords in considering the bids that may be presented is it the intention of the government to secure from any of those whose bids may be successful an undertaking that they will not dispose of any part of the ferry fleet and harbours once they have acquired them <e> <s> can the noble lord explain what he means by stimulus of capital seeing that in the profits were four-and-a-half times the profits of and that the return on assets is nearly per cent <e> <s> and on turnover is per cent <e> <s> which is most creditable compared with many other companies <e>", "<cs> my lords the question asked by the noble baroness is very important and does the noble lord recall that when we were debating the air navigation noise certification order i referred to the fact that a number of additional domestic routes have been allowed to come into heathrow <e> <s> therefore is it not wise that the matter should be considered now rather than wait until the figure of movements is exceeded <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for so clearly explaining these orders <e> <s> the house will be pleased to know that i have no intention of dealing with individual european constituencies except where it is necessary to refer to a principle <e> <s> there are other reasons too <e> <s> first there is the time factor <e> <s> it is now th april <e> <s> on th june the european assembly elections will be held <e> <s> therefore it is impossible to attempt to seek changes even if that were constitutionally permissible <e> <s> we realise that the time factor is mainly in consequence of legislation that we passed which provided that there should be no review of european constituencies until the united kingdom parliamentary constituencies reports had been accepted <e> <s> at that time we expressed our apprehension <e>", "<cs> my lords do not want to extend this debate but i want to say just two things <e> <s> first i do not regard putting a case for local community ties and putting a case for not interfering with local government boundaries as nibbling away at small points <e> <s> i think they are quite important points which i want to be looked at for the future <e> <s> i am certain that the noble baroness was not accusing me of being a hypocrite <e> <s> i am certain that in her own charming way she was saying that my policies reflected that <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first warmly congratulate my noble friend lord bottomley on his maiden speech <e> <s> while he was doing his valuable council work at walthamstow i was in the neighbouring borough doing voluntary political work <e> <s> i know full well therefore the value of his council work <e> <s> i am sure that his local national and international experience will make a great contribution to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords although i welcome the improvements which the minister has just recounted does he recall the written answer given in the other place on nd february which indicated that after allowing for the cases which were cleared up as a result of prosecutions or payments made out of court there were still cases which could not be satisfactorily settled <e> <s> is it not a fact that the permanent secretary of the department of transport has given evidence that at least cases could not be followed up because of the shortage of staff particu-larly at dvlc <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to rise again but the minister did say that the permanent secretary of the department had given evidence on the lines that i suggested <e> <s> as everyone in this house believes surely in cost-effectiveness is it not in the interests of everyone that there should be adequate staff to follow up the cases which the permanent secretary gave evidence could not be followed up because of shortage of staff <e>", "<cs> let me make it quite clear that i am not replying to the debate that will be done by my noble friend lady birk <e> <s> but naturally i am disappointed with what the minister has said so far and i should like to emphasise to the committee that we are not absolving any particular government from any responsibility as regards not tackling the matter previously <e> <s> we are dealing with the situation facing us <e>", "<cs> may i intervene on this matter <e> <s> whereas there is provision in certain parts of the bill for procedure to be followed either by the affirmative procedure or by annulment the notes on clauses which are what i go by state quite clearly <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the amendment put forward by the noble lord lord evans despite what the minister has said <e> <s> the minister said in dealing with the previous amendment that there will be every opportunity for the local authority concerned to argue <e> <s> but all that we are going to have is the best information available to the minister <e> <s> nothing of what the minister has said in his recent remarks is laid down <e> <s> it is what he believes the minister will give on the best information available to him whereas the amendment which lord evans proposed definitely puts forward some actual points which the minister must take into consideration <e>", "<cs> i am certain that the minister has misinterpreted what i have said <e> <s> we are not asking that the local authority associations should consider a particular authority to be designated <e> <s> what the amendment is seeking is that the principles the principles which the secretary of state is given complete responsibility to determine shall be done in consultation with the local authority associations and other authorities that he may consider desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords although there has been discussion about the possibility of a second runway at gatwick can the minister say whether it is a feasible idea and what is the view of the civil aviation authority about that <e> <s> in addition to the number of passengers is there not the question of air transport movements <e> <s> i appreciate the point which the minister made about larger aircraft but what is the relation at the moment to the air transport movements a year capacity at gatwick <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed with the ministers reply <e> <s> he went beyond his normally generous language when he talked about coming with clean hands <e> <s> i shall put that down to the heat at present <e> <s> the minister says that we are talking about <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to intervene again because i have both the bill and the notes on clauses in front of me <e> <s> i ask the noble lord lord mottistone to look at clause which says <e>", "<cs> i am certain that i have not succeeded in removing any misunderstandings to which the minister referred in an earlier address <e> <s> perhaps that is due to my inability to explain the position <e> <s> the noble lord lord bellwin referred to there being no consultations before designation <e> <s> we are not worried about designation <e> <s> that was dealt with in a previous amendment <e> <s> we are not asking for consultation about designation to go on the selective list <e> <s> we are not asking about consultation as regards the level of expenditure of any particular authority <e> <s> that amendment was not accepted <e> <s> we are talking about the principles on which these decisions will be taken <e> <s> at one moment the minister refers to principles and at the next to criteria <e> <s> they are the same although i believe that one noble lord argued that there was a great difference between them <e> <s> we are trying to ascertain the principles the criteria on which the government will determine the levels of expenditure for the different authorities <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness replies i should say from these benches that we support this amendment <e> <s> has the minister considered that in all the discussion we have had on principles where we have been rejected parliament might wish to know what might have been wrong with the principles which caused the secretary of state to give a greater amount of expenditure <e> <s> surely that is a matter which parliament ought to be able to discuss and arrive at the answer <e> <s> if we left it at the procedure which the minister has outlined that would not be done <e> <s> it is this failure to have proper consultation on principles that makes this amendment really important <e>", "<cs> my lords a very good description of this bill was given by a member not of my political party in the other house when he said that it was ill-timed wrongly conceived and a recipe for muddle meanness and ministerial incompetence to which i would add that it is yet one further step which this government are taking to take away power from local councils and also to remove local accountability <e> <s> we now have ministers talking glibly about nationalising londons transport <e> <s> i must make this comment how cynical that seems from a government who time and time again have done their utmost to damage public industries <e> <s> i find it very difficult to recognise mr nicholas ridley as a convert to public ownership <e>", "<cs> well if it is not true my lords when i sit down i will look at the proposals and when my noble friend lord carmichael deals with it he can deal with whether or not it is true <e> <s> moreover the secretary of state has not denied the possibility of boroughs introducing charges for the issue of permits nor has he denied that in the event of there not being reserve power there could be a position of the boroughs making other variations in conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that some months ago there were questions and supplementary questions on the report of the civic trust dealing with bypasses and the juggernaut and that on that occasion apprehensions were voiced that by the s quite a number of villages and towns would not be in a bypass programme <e> <s> does he agree that the points that have been made this afternoon further justify that concern <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister has given me good reason for seeking leave to withdraw this amendment not that it is defective in principle but so that we may consider what he has said about the actual wording <e> <s> in general there is a great principle involved here <e> <s> the minister says that this legislation is no different from any other that we pass <e> <s> that is the whole point about our criticism of the rates bill that it puts local government at the behest of central government in a way that we have never seen before in this country <e> <s> as the minister has said and as the secretary of state has said that is a major constitutional point <e>", "<cs> they are blooming <e>", "<cs> my lords in replying to the remarks of the noble lord lord lyell i should like to welcome him to his new post <e> <s> i am certain he will understand that my colleagues and i deeply regret the circumstances which have necessitated this change and we wish his noble friend all the best for the future <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his response <e> <s> it will be understood that in these matters i am advised by one of the associations the association of metropolitan authorities <e> <s> i am certain that the information that the noble earl has given will be appreciated <e> <s> the reason why the amendment refers only to the associations is not for them to be consulted as vested interests as bodies of ratepayers but as representatives of the authorities who have got to carry out these consultations <e> <s> therefore it is vital that they should help the minister in drawing up the guidance to be given <e> <s> that is the important point <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his statement that it is up to each government department as to its policy in this matter surprised many noble lords <e> <s> is there no co-ordination in these matters <e> <s> is there no general drive for efficiency in saving in this government <e>", "<cs> the ministers reply is not altogether unexpected in the same way as he thought that i did not expect the government to accept the amendment <e> <s> i agree that i would have been very surprised if they had done so <e> <s> the government have made up their minds on this issue and i hope that the short debate that we have had will indicate the necessity of ensuring that this bill is put into the best possible shape before it leaves this house <e> <s> it is a question of good management <e> <s> it is a question of effective transition from one form to another and that takes time <e> <s> it should be handled carefully and not rushed into <e> <s> the minister said that the whole point of the operation is a change of control at the earliest practicable date <e> <s> it is that which worries many of us <e> <s> what is going to be the effect on transport services in london <e> <s> the more time that we would have had to carry out the planning to ensure that this bill is introduced effectively the more desirable it would have been <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to with-draw the amendment <e>", "<cs> following on the point that the noble lord lord tordoff has made it is important that we should spend some time on this because the set-up and the membership of the lrt will have to guide us and guide the whole organisation in the course that it may be taking <e> <s> i must remind the committee that we are debating two separate amendments one is not dependent upon the other and each stands in its own right <e> <s> as regards the second amendment on representation it must be remembered that under the governments proposals on streamlining the cities it is proposed that there shall be joint area boards which will be the ptas in the six metropolitan counties and that they will comprise representatives of the district authorities within each county <e> <s> london apparently is to be treated separately <e> <s> the ministers justification for that is that london is so important <e> <s> it is so important that the glc is to be abolished so the arguments do not fit in at all <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness lady denington who has had the experience of being chairman of the transport committee in london for further explaining the purposes of these two amendments <e> <s> i was not suggesting that all nationalised industries should be open to the public <e> <s> what we are trying to make clear is the difference in the attitude under this bill to public transport in london from what takes place today <e> <s> they are two completely different set-ups <e> <s> the observations we have had from the government side make this clear <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord tordoff replies can the minister let me know whether or not the wording of subsection of clause affects the position <e> <s> the act refers to transport in greater london <e> <s> it was dealing only with the greater london council and its relations with the london transport executive whereas we find here that it deals with the position of transport in and around greater london <e> <s> surely as london regional transport is to cover an area for which they are responsible beyond the greater london area we ought to consider the position of the nbc and should not be treating the nbc as just another operator <e> <s> it is a public operator for which parliament and the secretary of state has considerable responsibility <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the principle of amendment no <e> <s> in the terms moved by the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> i say the principle because your lordships will notice that i am also speaking to amendment no <e> <s> and taking into consideration amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and both have the expression for the time being as do the government in their own clause <e> <s> we are all using the term for the time being <e> <s> it does not mean that we are having it for evermore without change it means that we will change according to needs and demands <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord give way <e> <s> would he appreciate that there are the words best meets <e> <s> therefore it does not mean that everyones need has to be met one hundred per cent <e> <s> it says best meets the need <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> i said that but i also continued <e>", "<cs> the minister said that there is no clear definition of the word integrated <e> <s> we know what we mean <e> <s> those of us who have been to tyne and wear realise what happened before we had the tyne and wear metro and what we have now and can understand what integration means <e> <s> we cannot put that into the bill <e> <s> therefore what i propose to do is to seek advice on whether we can put something in the bill which conveys exactly what we mean by integration because it is something far more than co-ordination <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for his comment <e> <s> may i say that i recognise the work which the department encourages in connection with the disabled and their travel <e> <s> however the experience is that in many areas it is the local public transport system that has been able to provide this <e> <s> perhaps i may give one example taken from leicester the leicester city transport department have converted three buses so that wheelchairs can be taken on the buses but instead of using these for special services the buses actually run as stage services and persons who are not disabled can use those services as well <e> <s> only a public transport service could have provided those facilities <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down everyone will appreciate what he has just said <e> <s> i hope however that we shall have notice of these clauses well in advance <e> <s> they carry very great implications <e> <s> everyone agrees that action should be taken to prevent fraud <e> <s> the figures issued by london transport over the last months show that a considerable amount has been achieved <e> <s> however one has to be careful when looking at surcharges <e> <s> often on grounds of economy there is no one in the ticket office when i travel from westminster <e> <s> on my arrival at buckhurst hill i have then to prove what journey i have made <e> <s> it is not an easy issue <e> <s> we therefore need to see the text of any amendments very early and not just hours before their publication in the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his explanation particularly since the question raised in the amendments was not discussed in the other place <e> <s> i shall study what the minister has said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> i shall move amendment no <e> <s> and speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord tordoff for his support <e> <s> he expressed our view clearly <e> <s> we are very worried about the tendency to fragmentise elements of lrt <e> <s> the minister said that the system would relieve lrt of the duty of submitting proposals <e> <s> i thought that we had faith in the managerial competence of the board and that it would decide whether it was desirable to form separate companies <e> <s> if so it would then ask permission <e> <s> that is <e>", "<cs> i should like in a couple of minutes to endorse everything that the noble lord lord tordoff has said <e> <s> we are likewise not opposed to outside tenders when this is considered desirable and appropriate <e> <s> however i should like the minister to comment on the point that i raised when i came previously to the dispatch box <e> <s> does this not mean that there is no faith in the managerial competence of the board to be appointed for lrt <e> <s> the board should surely have the freedom to decide whether it wishes to do this <e> <s> there should be no direction <e> <s> otherwise it means that all you are doing is transferring control by what the secretary of state calls the bosses over on the south bank to complete and utter political control by the secretary of state without any faith in the boards managerial competence to determine these issues <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord tordoff responds this would appear to me to be one of those very simple amendments and it would be nice if we could have it accepted by the government <e> <s> so far in six hours debating we have not yet had anything accepted by the government <e> <s> but if the view of the government is such that to use the example the noble earl has given because of the sparse use of a particular service it might be best to provide an alternative which while still a service is less satisfactory would not the minister agree that that is one of the first-class examples where there should be consultation with the local authority in the area to see whether that is satisfactory because it is paying two-thirds of the cost <e>", "<cs> despite the lateness of the hour i should like to indicate from these benches our support for the amendments put forward by the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> this is a very important matter and requires considerable discussion which i am certain we have not time to do tonight <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i thought that i was helping the minister and it seems that i have helped him <e> <s> i am moving amendment no <e> <s> and speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and merely so that the minister can give his views <e> <s> when we come to amendment no <e> <s> i shall formally move it and if he accepts it the committee will be pleased <e> <s> when we come to amendment no <e> <s> i shall move it and if he accepts that too the committee will again be very pleased <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for falling into line with my suggestion and for putting on record the governments views on amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i shall study carefully what the minister has said about amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> his views will be helpful in considering what should be done at the next stage <e> <s> i am particularly grateful for the ministers comments on amendment no <e> <s> and for his undertaking to give further consideration to the <e>", "<cs> what the minister says sounds reasonable <e> <s> however when we reach clause not tonight i hope we shall have to ask a few questions about what some of the words there mean <e> <s> london transport and the ptes in the six metropolitan authorities have to produce a plan each year covering a strategy plan over a period of three years <e> <s> if as the minister says this is to be a major statement which it cannot be expected to produce every year we shall have to keep that in mind when we come to look at amendments on report <e> <s> that may be a justifiable reason for including in the statement some of the things the minister has not accepted shall be included <e> <s> frankly at this late hour one needs to examine what the noble lord has said <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> when we want to put something in the bill it is always an unnecessary inclusion <e> <s> when the government wish to add certain things it is a sensible amendment and they clutter up the bill <e> <s> i should like the minister seriously to consider this <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that we do not want to make a party political issue of this as the last question seemed to imply <e> <s> in that period there was full employment which is rather different from what we have today <e> <s> does the noble earl appreciate while i know that he is a kindly individual that his replies seem somewhat insensitive to the points being raised that it is whole communities that are being destroyed <e> <s> it is not the loss of just the mines but of all the other businesses in the area <e> <s> the government cannot leave this to profit and loss and the market factor <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the national federation of building trade employers has expressed great concern about this matter <e> <s> he says that it is up to the local authorities to make the decision but it is a difficult decision to make with cuts in financial allocations <e>", "<cs> having listened to the ministers last reply i find myself a little confused in regard to the previous replies he has given <e> <s> he said that the order is purely automatic and yet he quite readily accepts that there might be advantage in representations being made by industry and commerce to talk about it <e> <s> that is what we are asking to be done in the case of local authorities <e> <s> i want to see carried the second amendment which states that there shall be consultations with representatives of industry and commerce but it would be wrong to agree to that and yet not agree to the first amendment which seeks consultation also with local authorities <e> <s> the noble lord lord trefgarne said that at first sight these amendments looked reasonable <e> <s> from where i am sitting they still look reasonble and i hope that the committee will give support to them <e>", "<cs> i will not be tempted into going into a second reading debate with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> we have had all these principles brought out <e> <s> he talks about playing politics at county hall <e> <s> that is what the present government are doing in parliament playing politics with londons transport and with a whole set-up of abolition proposals for greater london <e> <s> i think the point that is being made is that if londons transport is so different because it has got national and tourist implications as the noble lord lord tordoff has just said that is a case for supporting my first amendment <e>", "<cs> i think i will read carefully what the minister has said <e> <s> i am dissatisfied with his reply on this <e> <s> no real argument has been put forward but i will not press the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord the minister answer one point <e> <s> at present if there is a surplus of revenue over charges which i understand the <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to labour the point <e> <s> but subsection of clause which we are discussing states <e>", "<cs> i beg your lordships pardon <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is consequential <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for explaining the position in some detail <e> <s> i note what he says about amendment no <e> <s> being misconceived and that my amendment uses the word shall which will make the matter compulsory <e> <s> he also said that it is not breaking any new ground <e> <s> i will look carefully at what he has said on amendment no <e> <s> and see whether or not there is any cause for us to come back at report stage <e> <s> on the other amendments the emphasis was laid on the fact that the bill completely removes powers of transport from the glc <e> <s> speaking at this dispatch box immediately following the noble lord the minister it is difficult to think of a case but there is always the exception <e> <s> we are giving in the bill under clause powers to the london boroughs to buy extra services under clause <e>", "<cs> i was not told anything about the latter point <e> <s> on my list it was proposed that amendments nos <e> <s> to inclusive be taken and it was i who drew attention to the fact that i was really replacing clause and not introducing a new clause <e> <s> but if the noble lord lord tordoff was given that information it never reached me <e>", "<cs> my immediate reaction is one of disappointment because the more one hears ministers talking about the effect of transferring london transport to lrt as a nationalised industry the more one has fears about accountability and fears that all the information which people need in order to criticise london transport will not be available <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to say anything more but the noble lord the minister has goaded me to do so <e> <s> there is nothing in these amendments to suggest ideological differences <e> <s> they are to improve the managerial competence of lrt so that it has the information that it ought to have from the bodies specified and in the particular form it will need <e> <s> there is nothing ideological about that unless good management is ideological and we want the same good management as the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord tordoff replies may i say a few words on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> despite what the minister said surely there is an advantage in putting in these words <e> <s> he does not dislike the principle so why not put it in the bill <e> <s> it is what is in the bill that matters <e> <s> time and again all sides of the committee have emphasised that it is the words of a bill that matter not good intentions because good intentions can change <e> <s> in amendment no <e> <s> the noble lord lord tordoff is asking for a statutory requirement that the passengers committee shall be supplied with information that it reasonably considers necessary <e>", "<cs> the noble lord <e> <s> lord tordoff said that he was speaking also to amendment no <e> <s> to which my name is attached <e> <s> the point of the amendment is quite simple <e> <s> clause places the duty on the railways board to consult lrt as to the general level of fares and also the general provision of services on rail journeys in london <e> <s> at present the glc is consulted on these matters <e> <s> it will be appreciated that fare levels and services can affect the level of local authority support that may be required or even the buying of additional services <e> <s> the local authorities represent the persons who use the transport services both residential and business users <e>", "<cs> i am given to understand that amendments nos <e> <s> and are being considered along with amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> if i may follow the noble lord lord tordoff and be as brief as he the purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the discussions with british rail with a view to getting some i use this word integration will not just be drifting from year to year and we are suggesting that we should have the order within a year of the appointed date and its operative date a year from the date that the order is made <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment is really the same as that of the noble lord lord tordoff to ascertain what the governments real intentions are other than talking about them <e>", "<cs> i am both pleased and disappointed with the reply of the minister <e> <s> i am pleased in so far as <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is only incidental that these may be private operators <e> <s> i was not looking at this problem from the standpoint of private or public operators but from the standpoint of a proper efficient and integrated passenger service <e> <s> the noble earl referred to small operators <e> <s> they may not be small operators <e> <s> there is power in the bill for the secretary of state to direct lrt to dispose of certain sections <e> <s> surely there must be an avenue whereby representations concern-ing those bodies can be made particularly if their operations happen to be inefficient or if they conflict with and make almost impossible the operations of lrt or those bodies which are subsidiaries of theirs <e> <s> the noble earl says that they can complain to the commissioners about the services but there ought to be an opportunity to complain to a consumers body <e> <s> i must not become involved in almost quasi-judicial matters but let us assume that a body like amos is given an extended service in london <e> <s> can that not be considered by the passengers committee <e> <s> if their service means that the operations of lrt in certain areas come into conflict with them which will be bad for transport users as a whole surely there ought to be an opportunity for this matter to be considered by the passengers committee <e>", "<cs> if they use the group yes <e> <s> that is where there is an agreement <e> <s> but if the secretary of state decided to give certain services to a particular body against the wishes of lrt the secretary of state has done this in the case of london transport so he may do it in the case of lrt there ought to be an avenue by which matters affecting the operation of that service can be raised with the passengers committee <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister is endeavouring to be extremely nice and kind about these amendments but he has clarified only one point in my mind that what was said on the previous amendment is not the actual position <e> <s> under this particular clause there is no provision that representations made by any of the rating authorities in greater london or outside greater london in the lrt area shall be considered <e> <s> that provision is not there <e> <s> that contradicts what the noble earl said about my earlier amendment that local authorities will be able to make representation to the committee <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may take up one small matter <e> <s> i support amendment no <e> <s> which we have just agreed <e> <s> i am very pleased to note that under subsection this is one occasion when the local authorities affected are to be consulted but it appears to be only when there are new services which lrt or any subsidiary is to provide or any in which they have had agreements <e> <s> can the noble lord tell the committee whether if another operator is to provide a new service there will be similar consultation with local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords motorways and trunk roads have to end in conurbations <e> <s> can the noble lord the minister say what consideration has been given by the government to the campaign launched by the construction industry showing the amount of work to be carried through in the conurbations <e> <s> have the government had discussions and what is the effect on the conurbations road development of the reduction in the transport supplementary grant from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his reply <e> <s> he has explained the governments position quite clearly <e> <s> it shows in one or two facets the difference between the government and those of us who are critical of the formation the establishment of lrt <e>", "<cs> i am very disappointed with the governments answer <e> <s> i know that the noble earl is a compassionate individual otherwise i would say that the government were displaying a hard-hearted attitude <e> <s> that is not however my personal view of the minister <e> <s> the noble earl referred to the possibility of boroughs making changes <e> <s> that is one of the things that we want to avoid <e> <s> we do not want to find that instead of the composite scheme that now affects all london we have bits and pieces of schemes in different parts of london <e> <s> the noble lord lord tordoff has answered his criticism <e> <s> we do not want schemes for all time <e> <s> the glc was considering even extensions of its own scheme <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble earl the minister has not responded to my noble friends appeal <e> <s> but i think he was being genuine when he stated that the government have sympathy <e> <s> but sympathy is not enough <e> <s> sympathy does not pay bills <e> <s> sympathy does not pay fares <e> <s> we want some practical action as well as sympathy <e> <s> i readily agree that the three existing categories are carefully defined <e> <s> the minister asked the question if the unemployed why not others <e> <s> that uses the argument to which i referred in my opening remarks that because we cannot help everybody <e> <s> then we should not move at all <e> <s> everybody recognises that the unemployed have a special case <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies may i ask is it not a fact that if the reserve scheme comes into being without this concession a large number of pensioners in london will be adversely affected <e> <s> surely the government must admit that <e> <s> the minister also referred to the british rail pass <e> <s> i have one to enable me to travel round the country <e> <s> however there are pensioners in london who also want to travel by bus and if a borough should make a charge for the permit as it has every right to do under the governments proposals the pensioners will have to pay not only the to travel by any british rail service but that too <e> <s> perhaps the minister will comment on those two points <e>", "<cs> far from appeasing me the noble earl the minister makes me rather concerned <e> <s> he mentioned the small number of operators <e> <s> one of our complaints about the bill is the obvious encouragement within it for there to be an increased number of independent operators <e> <s> that has been mentioned time and time again <e> <s> we are concerned that in future once this bill becomes law there can be areas where the only person operating on a certain route at a certain time may be an independent operator <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble earl could answer one question for me <e> <s> the secretary of state has said that the bill will take effect as soon as possible after royal assent <e> <s> the appointed day refers to the day when london transport ceases and lrt takes over <e> <s> until there is either a voluntary agreement or the reserve power what will happen to the existing concessionary schemes <e> <s> is there anything in the bill which says that they will continue until something else is done <e> <s> in my view this is a very important question <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the minister for his explanation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that in the other place suggestions were made that the glc should pay <e> <s> i believe i am correct in saying that the original government drafting of the bill was to the effect that the glc should pay and the amendment was made because the government had second thoughts <e> <s> i would ask them to have second thoughts again <e> <s> it is pretty clear from what the minister has said that the government will not shift on this <e> <s> we will have a look at it but it is not the lrt that will be responsible for the changes they will take over a board <e>", "<cs> the three items to which the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth referred totalling some millions of pounds will be covered because i think he replied in answer to the noble lord lord tordoff that these were entered into before the nd december <e> <s> therefore we are not arguing about those <e> <s> i will certainly check up to see what commitments have been entered into since nd december because the inference from the minister is that we could not have a situation where the glc were rushing things through <e> <s> there is no indication that that has happened and as far as british rail is concerned that is suggesting that british rail would have connived at something <e> <s> the minister said that people should have known the intentions when the bill was published and therefore should not have entered into matters with the glc afterwards <e> <s> but my noble friend lord pitt did not say that this was against any parliamentary constitutional law what he said was that it is belittling parliament to make something retrospective on the publication of the bill before the bill has even had its second reading in parliament never mind actually receiving royal assent <e> <s> i will check up very carefully to see what the commitments are <e> <s> but the glc have over a period of years had a very progressive scheme about which very few people know by which they have been meeting the costs of renovations and improvements to british rail stations <e> <s> we learn only about grants to lesbian bodies <e> <s> we do not hear about the grants that are made by the glc for practical and useful purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank and congratulate the noble lord lord henley on introducing this bill into your lordships house and the way in which he presented it <e> <s> i must make it clear that as this is a private members bill i am expressing a personal view but i make it quite clear that i welcome the bill <e> <s> i was very pleased that the noble lord in his introductory remarks stressed the <e>", "<cs> may i raise one question on clause <e> <s> it may be that there are other provisions that cover the point but the bill seems to be silent on enforce <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his explanation but i do not think it meets the point i have in mind <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> which the noble lord moved referred to grave and imminent risk <e> <s> there is a maximum fine of <e> <s> but if there is imminent risk because there is danger and the vessel should really leave the harbour we should remember that going through the court procedure is rather lengthy <e> <s> i wonder if the minister will have a look at this between now and the next stage to see whether or not there ought to be some means of enforcement or at least attempted enforcement by calling the police or other authorities to see that the vessel is removed <e> <s> certainly the fine is a penalty but going to the courts when possibly the harbour is already blocked does not stop it from being blocked in the meantime <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for offering to do that <e> <s> i believe it is necessary <e> <s> we are amateurs in this sort of field <e> <s> it seems that to have the fine or the court action after there has been a blockage of the harbour is the wrong way round <e> <s> i wonder whether if the harbour master takes action there is some way in which he can call the authorities to help him and some provision whereby if the master of the vessel thinks that action should not be taken he can take immediate action to stop it <e> <s> that seems to me to be the way round <e> <s> in the meantime the police and the other authorities whatever they may be should enable the vessel to leave the harbour and i am talking about the case when a vessel should leave rather than cause danger <e> <s> once the accident has happened a fine of is a penalty on an individual but in the meantime the harbour may be closed for a period <e> <s> i hope that the minister will kindly look into the matter <e>", "<cs> again i should like to ask a simple question <e> <s> what happens if in the opinion of the harbour master the vessel that serves the crown presents a grave and imminent danger <e> <s> what happens if that is the opinion of the harbour master <e> <s> does the danger just continue <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that under the terms of the planning consent the emergency runway can be used whenever the main runway is not operational <e> <s> are there any restrictions at all in that regard are there any special procedures that must be gone through or will it be automatic procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give an assurance that before the privatisation of british airways takes place following the conclusion of the review there will be a parliamentary debate on the issue and not just a statement in either house <e>", "<cs> i am a little worried about this amendment <e> <s> as i am sure all noble lords know there is a vast number of footpaths going through forestry land and also over moorlands <e> <s> according to subsection a highway authority cannot make an order if a person who has got a legal interest in the land has not given consent in writing <e> <s> i wonder how far this will start to infringe on the bill dealing with access to the countryside and access to the mountains <e> <s> many moorlands are mountains <e>", "<cs> my reading of the amendment is that it refers to a footpath which crosses any agricultural land forestry or moorland <e> <s> so it will affect moorland if the amendment is carried <e>", "<cs> my lords needless to say <e> <s> i am disappointed with the ministers reply <e> <s> we took the three reasons why the minister could not accept the amendment at the committee stage and incorporated them in an amendment which is no longer technically deficient at least we believe that it is no longer technically deficient <e> <s> the minister has indicated that he believes it is in order <e> <s> having therefore dealt with those points we hoped that the minister would either accept the amendment or make a reasonable suggestion about how to amend it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly my intention to recognise the reality of the situation and to stand firm by this amendment because of that <e> <s> the noble lord says that nothing useful can be achieved by putting this clause into the bill <e> <s> i should like to echo what was said and i am certain it is echoed by my noble friends who have supported the amendment the whole purpose of this amendment is to protect the interest of the travelling public <e> <s> that is what we want an integrated service for we want it not because of a bureaucratic idea but in the interests of the travelling public <e> <s> and it is not sufficient to say that efforts will be made to co-operate with british rail in the new liaison arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords i never look a gift horse in the mouth <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord tordoff and to my noble friend lady denington for their support <e> <s> the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth wonders whether there is any need for a provision of this kind to be included in the bill <e> <s> i would draw the noble lords attention to the relevant subsection <e> <s> it reads <e>", "<cs> my lords we have to keep in mind that the respective subsections of this clause start with the words <e>", "<cs> my lord i am sorry that the minister takes that general view on these amendments but i shall not argue the point <e> <s> i could explain exactly what is meant by integrated level and structure of fares <e> <s> such a simple explanation could easily be put into the bill <e> <s> the only comment i would make before begging leave to withdraw is that when i listened to the minister it occurred to me that the secretary of state will be a very busy man <e> <s> he will take the place of all the authorities he will take over all the consideration given by the greater london council committees and he will be in the hands of the department and of the treasury as to what he is to do <e> <s> i am sorry that the minister takes that view because these are commonsense proposals <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i refrained from rising because having jumped the gun <e> <s> i had already thanked the minister for this amendment <e> <s> but i readily do so again and i think that this is a very helpful amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say from these benches that we support the amendment as being common sense <e> <s> although this is report stage perhaps i may ask the minister a question <e> <s> does he see no difference between the position of a nationalised <e>", "<cs> my lords the only thing that the noble lord <e> <s> lord trefgarne has done is to convince me that it is not much good to try to pursue the matter further <e> <s> with all the hordes outside he would not have heard a single figure that i have quoted and undoubtedly if he quoted them we would not hear his figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the support from the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> i do not know where he lives but he may have the same porblem as i have <e> <s> the noble lord lord trefgarne said that the ratepayers outside will be indirectly assisted by the taxpayer <e> <s> the ratepayers in greater london will have the problems of the taxpayers of helping to pay for the one-third as well as of the ratepayers in helping to pay for the two-thirds so they are being charged both ways <e> <s> i always find that when i try to move anything the talk is about rough justice <e> <s> but when we talk about rough justice we find that that never operates from the government side <e> <s> it is rough justice <e> <s> we should not in a bill of this kind have rough justice <e> <s> there ought to be principle equality commercialism and fairness about the whole principle <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that the government have not changed the reasoning that they put forward at committee stage <e> <s> we on this side of the house are the ones who listened to the reasoning and greatly changed the scope of the amendments we submitted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very disappointed in the noble earls reply <e> <s> as i have already mentioned he did carry out his promise and wrote me a letter which i still do not think meets the arguments put forward in committee <e> <s> i agree that representations can be made as the noble earl rightly said to the commissioners if an application is made for a licence <e> <s> but that is not what we are asking for we are asking that the passengers committee should have the right to consider the operations of any transport services within the lrt area whether they are supplied by <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that when the noble lord lord lucas made that suggestion he realised that it was rather optimistic <e> <s> i will withdraw the amendment because of the lateness of the hour but not for the reasons which the noble lord has advanced <e> <s> i ask your lordships to bear in mind that this is not just the view of the opposition it is the view fully accepted and advanced by the national consumer council which is a very important body acting on behalf of consumers <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with interest to the comments of the noble lord lord somers and the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes <e> <s> i can understand the points they are making but frankly i cannot understand the attitude adopted by the government <e> <s> if the house has decided that we should have as a reserve scheme certain hours it seems not only ridiculous but unfair that should there be a uniform scheme or a scheme by some of the boroughs we shall have different hours from those on which the government will insist being in their own reserve scheme <e> <s> as i said in my opening remarks that frankly is absolutely nonsensical and i cannot understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl always puts his replies in a very persuasive way but when one analyses it the noble earl is not really seeing the points that are being made in this particular amendment <e> <s> if ever there was a case for talking about integration this is it but we must not use the word integration in this house because it is only understood apparently by non-governmental persons <e> <s> of course we should like to see agreement but a bill must provide that failure to agree a desired concession will be taken up and dealt with appropriately <e> <s> the noble earl said that if the <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the point that the noble earl makes about existing legislation <e> <s> before coming to the point about the different schemes may i say to the noble baroness lady gardner that i live outside london but we have london transport service facilities <e> <s> permits for aged persons are issued from the various council offices <e> <s> there is a post office yards from me but people have to get on to a bus and go to the nearest council sub-office to get their passes <e> <s> that seems utterly ridiculous and unfair to pensioners <e> <s> in the case of post offices it is not just the crown post offices which are concerned but also the sub-post offices which is what we suggest in this amendment <e> <s> they are all over the place and most convenient and we think we should use the offices of a public institution when they are available <e> <s> the very arguments which the noble earl used are the sort of arguments that we used against the whole idea of london regional transport taking over from london transport we are going to have multifarious different schemes of some kind where there ought to be one general scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for outlining the provisions of these five amendments which in effect are five new clauses <e> <s> i am also grateful for the issue of notes on clauses which give a better understanding of the important points which are contained in the new clauses <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very disappointed particularly in view of the support given to these amendments that the minister is not moving on this <e> <s> the fact that his brief says resist may mean that somebody decided to resist before even hearing any arguments <e> <s> i hope that the arguments may have made the minister appreciate that there is a case to be met <e> <s> paragraph states <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall briefly give my support to this amendment <e> <s> it will be noted that i have not moved my amendment no <e> <s> which was similar to that which i moved at the committee stage <e> <s> this amendment puts in the words the passing of this act whereas my amendment used the words the appointed day <e> <s> the reference to the passing of the act seems more common sense than one to the appointed day <e> <s> i said at the committee stage in reply to the minister that i would get a list of all the capital schemes which may be affected <e> <s> i am assured by the glc that they have now agreed to fund a large number of british rail schemes which otherwise could have been affected by this provision because they want to ensure their continuity in the short term and that it will be possible for them to fund most other br schemes through alternative powers <e> <s> there is the principle of retrospection to which the house should give attention and for that reason i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord the minister agree that the signposting requirements on the m are completely different to those required on most other motorways in britain <e> <s> would he not agree also that if the full potential of the m as a by-pass relief road for london is to be realised it is essential that there should be adequate signposting to local destinations and places of interest <e> <s> have the government in mind any supplementary signposting on the m <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i am somewhat amazed that the government are not moving at all on this issue <e> <s> the minister has simply repeated that the amendment would direct the committee from its main task <e> <s> but what is its main task <e> <s> surely as the bill lays down the main task is to look after the interests of users of londons transport <e> <s> that cannot be separated into one operator that they can look into and another operator that they cannot look into <e> <s> we are not arguing that the committee should be able to deal with the political issue of whether there should be more public transport or more independent operators <e> <s> that is not the argument it is the argument that the government put forward <e> <s> it is not an argument that i have ever advanced <e> <s> nor do i do so in this amendment <e>", "<cs> if i may my lords <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment is that it would come under any <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to deal first with the last point which the noble earl raised and which referred to the question of outside bodies <e> <s> we are not dealing in this amendment with what charges shall be made <e> <s> we are not dealing with whether or not an authority wants free fares or fares at the childrens rate <e> <s> we are dealing with a minimum standard as regards identical hours <e> <s> that is what the amendment is dealing with <e> <s> it deals with that and with nothing else and i hope that the house will treat it on that basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is correct <e> <s> i referred to the possibility of different borough schemes because the minister said that even if there were a uniform scheme a borough authority must be free to buy in extra time if it wished to do so <e> <s> it may be that an authority will want to buy in the extra travelling period <e> <s> i do not know <e> <s> the travelling period which applies in my outer london district is totally different from that which applies elsewhere <e> <s> i come back to the argument <e> <s> we should insist on minimum standards for a borough scheme in the interests not of lrt but of the travelling public in this case aged persons <e> <s> i hope that the house will agree that having made a decision on the reserve scheme it is common sense that we should make the same decision on a minimum standard and i hope that the house will support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord avon thanked his two noble baronesses for their support but it is clear that there is a difference of opinion on his side of the house <e> <s> the noble earl said that it is not a question of money his two supporters advocated particularly the possible saving of money and said that that was why we should not commit ourselves to the use of post offices <e> <s> it was emphasised that they are in a monopoly situation and could make charges in other words that they could take the boroughs to the cleaners <e> <s> therefore i am surprised that the noble earl is grateful for their support on this and then says that it is not a question of money <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank both the noble and learned lord lord denning and my noble and learned friend lord mccluskey for generous support in principle <e> <s> when as a layman one is dealing with legal matters one needs to have support of that kind <e> <s> i am very grateful to the minister for the general <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord lucas said that there are no new arguments in support of this amendment <e> <s> there are no new arguments in support of the principle but i advanced new arguments to justify bringing the amendment forward again this afternoon <e> <s> the noble lord implied that he could not understand why these points of london transport should be made at this late stage but let us see what the history is <e> <s> the letter which i quoted at report stage was dated th june <e> <s> it was the unanimous view of the board that these restrictions should not be placed on london transport <e> <s> it was the unanimous view of the board that these manufacturing powers should he given to lrt <e> <s> because of the comments made at report stage the solicitor wrote to me again and pointed out exactly what took place during the discussions <e> <s> i read the letter in full so that i could not be accused of paraphrasing it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth for his kind references particularly to my noble friend lord carmichael of kelvingrove who as the minister rightly said has been dealing with a transport bill with me for the first time <e> <s> i am also grateful to my colleagues and noble friends who moved amendments and made contributions during the passage of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed with the ministers reply <e> <s> he puts the question to whom shall the secretary of state be accountable <e>

like to see the financing of political parties on a public basis <e> <s> i say that also as a member of the houghton committee which made recommendations a few years ago <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down does he recognise that there are occasions such as in when there were two general elections within six months <e> <s> therefore it is not a question of propping up extra expenditure but of paying money which will be repaid from the loan in order to run the election fairly which did not occur to the conservative party <e>", "<cs> unless we can argue the case there is no case to look at when we come back at report stage <e> <s> i ask him where a trade union journal is carrying out a campaign in furtherance of the trade <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for agreeing to have a look at the wording of the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how many bilateral agreements permit more than one british carrier on routes in europe <e> <s> can he explain why independent airlines in this country are expressing great concern that the privatisation of british airways might create something like a monopoly which will injure those airlines <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the letter to which the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe referred has not been denied <e> <s> is the minister also aware that a written question was asked of the secretary of state for transport as to whether he had discussed wage levels in the railway industry with the chairman of british rail <e> <s> on th april in a written answer the secretary of state said that wage levels in british rail are for negotiation between the british railways board and the unions <e> <s> yet the letters to which we are referring were on nd april <e> <s> this written answer was on th april <e> <s> has the minister any suggestion of a permitted parliamentary terminological expression to explain that sort of conduct <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord peyton of yeovil with his ministerial experience for initiating this debate on the important subject of civil aviation <e> <s> i think it will be agreed that we have had a frank and challenging speech from the noble lord <e> <s> i was very pleased to see that his motion covers aviation policy and airport policy because both are complementary <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount recall that these matters were dealt with very fully in our recent appropriation debate on st june when his noble friend lord lyell answered a number of these points <e> <s> can the noble viscount confirm that if the certification of airworthiness is granted the production will be centred in northern ireland <e> <s> can the noble viscount say what has happened or will happen to the workforce which has been laid off <e> <s> does this mean that they are eligible for redundancy pay or does it mean that the whole skilled workforce is being dispersed <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall that when the house was discussing the variation of the speed limit orders on th march reference was made to the national speed survey conducted in <e> <s> on that occasion the noble lord himself said that it had been received in the department only two or three weeks before and the matter was being studied <e> <s> do i understand from his answers that the study says that there should be no change or is the matter still under consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i think in general we welcome the spirit in which the noble lord lord lyell has introduced this order <e> <s> we recognise that the continuing circumstances in northern ireland necessitate <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> but will he not agree that in view of the adverse publicity which led to the extended blood option it is essential that public confidence be restored in evidential breath testing <e> <s> will the minister give an assurance that as the six months period is up on th october no action will be taken while parliament is in recess <e> <s> will he also give an assurance that there will be no withdrawal of the blood option until parliament has had the fullest opportunity to consider the final results <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the minister for repeating the statement in answer to a pnq in the other place <e> <s> i am pleased that in the statement it was made absolutely clear that any association that there might be with the current mining dispute is minor it is another matter altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to press the noble lord the minister on the one point that i made <e> <s> it is quite definite that the association of dock employers would like to see an end to the dock labour scheme <e> <s> if at the joint council meeting the question is pressed whether the government have any intention of ending the scheme it might help to bring the dispute to an end if the position were clarified <e> <s> do the government have an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords will not the noble lord the minister look carefully at the question put by my noble friend lord hatch which refers to unemployment and other forms of deprivation <e> <s> if i may follow up the points made by some other noble lords may i ask the noble lord the minister also to look at the personal comments of the chief constable of northern ireland on the same matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the noble lord the minister for repeating this statement made by his right honourable friend in the other house <e> <s> i also wish to thank the government whips for letting me have a copy of the white paper at pm which i have not read because i anticipated that the statement might be read soon after then <e> <s> frankly pages cannot be dealt with in answer to a statement <e> <s> is it correct that the press had a briefing with a copy of the white paper at oclock this morning <e> <s> if so should not that facility also have been made available to members of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may intervene briefly because the minister must explain what he is after <e> <s> if one looks at the proposed amendment one sees that it can refer only to organisations which are already in receipt of grant and the amount will not exceed the grant paid in the previous two years <e> <s> therefore it can hit only at an existing organisation which is receiving grant <e> <s> let the minister come clean <e> <s> which of the organisations receiving grant does he want to stop <e> <s> we might then know where we are <e> <s> we have had innuendoes and i have brought forward facts and figures which have been denied by the minister to show that all the information in marsham street is not always correct <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord the minister for bringing this order from some obscurity into brightness <e> <s> i do not think that any of us had much idea of what the order was about <e> <s> but it is obviously an order of common sense and to the benefit of both the users of bicycles and the traders and we give it a warm welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords this six monthly opportunity to debate the renewal of the emergency provisions act has always been taken to be an opportunity also to review the actual operations of the provisions <e> <s> from these benches we have always stressed that the emergency provisions must not carry on indefinitely and as the noble lord lord lyell has mentioned we now have before us the report of the review conducted by the late sir george baker <e> <s> we would like to join in the expression of regret at his passing and pay tribute to his work <e> <s> all may not agree with the conclusions and recommendations made by sir george in his report but the report indicates a task well done and no one who reads the report can do other than see that it has a very personal style <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred to the debate on th july in the other place <e> <s> i suggest he refers to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for explaining this order <e> <s> as my noble friend lord prys-davies said last night when speaking to the education order once again we have an order of pages articles and four schedules in effect a parliamentary bill which is unamendable and which we have no alternative but to approve <e> <s> naturally we wish to see the best possible schemes of training and retraining and we must always keep in mind that after training there must be jobs <e> <s> at the present moment unemployment in northern ireland is running at the rate of per cent <e> <s> is there any indication that the new authority will be to use the words of the minister when the order was introduced in the other place a dynamic body or is it to be mainly advisory with power resting with the advice it gives to the department <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister and other noble lords will be delighted to know that i will not use this opportunity to discuss in detail the proposal of the three services to which three of the articles relates <e> <s> the proposal for the increase is seen as common sense and acceptable and we are particularly pleased to see that the variable rates of interest are to be brought into line with the position in the united kingdom as regards the local authorities <e> <s> therefore this order is one to which we shall give our support <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will appreciate that the document on these investigations is highly technical <e> <s> as it was sent to a number of interested bodies can he say what responses have been received and also whether there were any adverse comments about the type of investigations carried out <e> <s> it is far too technical for the ordinary layman to ascertain whether the operations to carry out these checks were satisfactory or not <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for repeating the statement which was made by the secretary of state in the other place <e> <s> but ones first reaction is that this is yet a further instalment of the secretary of states declared intention either to dismantle or drastically to interfere with publicly-owned transport in great britain <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister comment on whether or not the sale includes the harbours and also say whether it is true that this is a bermuda-based firm <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord cannot tell us now will he kindly write and let us know what legislation would prevent sea containers from disposing of any single harbour <e> <s> this is not written into the transport act <e> <s> is there any previous legislation which would prevent it <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord would write to us upon the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords can i ask the minister one simple question <e> <s> there is reference in paragraph to discussions yesterday with the local authority associations <e> <s> the noble lord the minister has referred to them in replying to other questions <e> <s> can he say what was the reaction yesterday of the local authority associations <e>", "<cs> my lords the question deals solely with the recent european election <e> <s> therefore would it not be advisable for those who want a change of system to say clearly what change of system they want <e> <s> if they want strictly proportional representation does not that entail a list system with power to the party bureaucracies <e> <s> if they want a single transferable vote does not that mean large constituencies with contact with communities virtually non-existent <e> <s> does it not also mean giving first preference votes to second third or fourth or more preference voters <e> <s> in other words to the least favoured candidates <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that when the system of the single transferable vote was first introduced in northern ireland there was a general understanding that the arguments of the special circumstances of northern ireland would never be used for extending the system to great britain <e> <s> in addition is not the question on the order paper at fault in so far as each of the eight political groupings which contested the three seats in the northern ireland elections to the european parliament put up only one candidate and at the end of the day after the fourth count the three who were elected were the same three as those who would have topped the poll as the first preferences <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that the cbi report while it concentrates on the road programme treats this as only part of the necessary work on the infrastructure in order to achieve the very economic aims with which the noble lord dealt in reply to the previous question <e> <s> does he accept the statement made by the cbi that it is absolutely vital that this work on the infrastructure should be started before the revenues from north sea oil and gas start to run out <e> <s> are these proposals not completely in line with the recent report of the british road federation and also the economic report of the tuc <e> <s> in view of those joint statements should there not be a well-thought-out and considered response <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for outlining the regulations <e> <s> i do not think that we need say much about them except that they are worthwhile and in the interests of road safety <e> <s> i am very pleased that the noble lord emphasised the fact that the tyre manufacturers have given them their full support <e> <s> we know the problems that there are with certain re-treaded tyres <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> as the metropolitan counties have been the authorities mainly criticised for their expenditure on revenue support how is that criticism reconciled with the fact that the very same counties have spent almost up to the maximum of the capital-accepted expenditure under their tsg <e> <s> furthermore how is this circular to the authorities reconciled with the recent statement by the secretary of state for the environment urging a voluntary capital moratorium <e> <s> finally this is an important subject what arrangements will be made to adjust the rate support grant the block grant settlement in order to cope with these new changes in transport supplementary grant bearing in mind in particular that it has been found absolutely impossible up to now to find any grea formula for highways maintenance and revenue support grant <e>", "<cs> my lords as my information is that the consultations with the authorities and associations this morning at least as regards one association did not give the answers to the very points i raised as the whole problem involves almost the destruction of the present plans for transport policies and programmes procedure and as the authorities have been given only one month to reply is this not a sound case for deferring the introduction of the new scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks me to do so <e> <s> one association of which i am the president has not made these complaints <e> <s> it has put to the minister quite clearly its objections to the proposals and also the very questions which i asked the minister this morning <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the noble viscounts first reply i may have misheard him would he confirm that it is a legal requirement that members of a trade union must be consulted in a nation-wide ballot if they wish to start a political fund <e> <s> that does not apply in any way to company shareholders <e> <s> is this not again an argument for taking another look at the houghton committees proposals on state aid to political parties <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble earl lord kinnoull for initiating this debate <e> <s> noble lords who take part in it will want to avoid so far as possible repeating the statements which many of us made during our debate on civil aviation on th june only a month ago <e> <s> it would have been preferable if we could have debated the governments proposals on the authoritys recommendations <e> <s> one wonders also whether it is desirable for the civil aviation authoritys report to be considered in isolation from all the other consultative processes which are still under way and upon which we are awaiting comments and reports <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him one question <e> <s> even if the government find it necessary to make a statement before the house resumes after the recess can we have an assurance that nothing will be put into effect before the house resumes <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recognise that the baying from the benches behind him will not help to settle this dispute <e> <s> what is required is not just hope and statements what is required is statesmanship on the part of the government in getting together with the two parties concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister appreciate the fact that many people will support the governments major proposals as they affect british airways in the interests of british aviation policy the staff of british airways and not least birmingham and manchester airports authorities <e> <s> will he recognise that there is also a strong feeling that the whole sorry business has not been concerned so much with aviation policy as with the governments dogmatic policy of privatisation <e> <s> would it not have been better to leave british airways as a publicly-owned undertaking to carry on efficiently as everyone including ministers says it is doing <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also congratulate the noble lord and welcome him <e> <s> may i also say how much we welcome the approval given to the scheme <e> <s> does he accept that this is the type of infrastructure scheme which is so valuable in providing jobs <e>

<e> <s> are there any other projects still awaiting government approval from the -year plan submitted by british rail in at the secretary of states request <e>", "<cs> my lords may i follow up the question of the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> is it proposed that there will be a separate bill in the form of a representation of the people bill which will outline the whole question of the conduct of the elections will these matters be dealt with in the abolition bill or merely by a clause there referring to sections on the conduct of elections or have the government not considered this aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for introducing this order <e> <s> i regret that i cannot be as brief as the noble lord has been and i must apologise in advance <e> <s> may i first say as i have said on most of the northern ireland orders that although this is said to be mainly a consolidation measure again we have an item of articles and five schedules which we cannot amend we can only endorse <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord teviot not only for having put down this unstarred question which enables us to discuss the white paper and it may be the only chance that we shall have but also for the way in which he has presented it <e> <s> i am certain that he has put forward some very formidable arguments for the minister to deal with <e> <s> frankly the white paper is putting back the clock <e> <s> proposals for deregulation the abandonment of the principle of cross-subsidisation the break up of bus operations of the passenger transport executives and the municipal undertakings and the destruction of the national bus company none of these has anything to do with the provision of effective public transport <e> <s> they have to do with the regrettable adherence of the government to their belief that market forces can solve everything that privatisation can solve everything and they have little regard to actual public needs <e> <s> i was very pleased that the noble lord lord teviot stressed the matter of public needs <e> <s> this is to be followed by changes in the transport supplementary grant administration which have a great effect on public transport <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but does that mean that the system of transport policies and programmes is going to be abolished in future <e> <s> will that be in the bill as well <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house what is the governments total investment in british airways <e> <s> will he give a firm guarantee that the taxpayer will receive all that back on flotation <e> <s> is he telling the house that there is no possibility whatever of any write-off of any of the debts owed by british airways before flotation <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with some trepidation that i speak from the front bench on behalf of the opposition in the light of the experienced and well-informed persons who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> however i too should like to thank the noble baroness lady burton for giving us the opportunity not only to have a preliminary canter around the government white paper but also because this is the third opportunity which we have had in recent months to discuss the policy of civil aviation <e>", "<cs> my lords this afternoon and this evening we have had speakers so far and i feel all noble lords will agree that this has thoroughly justified the decision made by my noble friend lady birk to put this particular motion on our order paper <e> <s> all the speeches have been helpful <e> <s> some have been theoretical on the relationship between central and local government and others have dealt with practicalities as they are or as the government intend that they shall be

have listened very carefully to everything that has been said and will decide accordingly in relation to some of the legislation which is likely to come before us <e>", "<cs> my lords i referred to

journeys criteria must be laid down for the dimensions and equipment of the cab <e> <s> the union is in complete agreement about this <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to say <e> <s> the committee wanted to see the results of research but nobody could produce such results <e> <s> the report points out that the committee asked this question time and time again <e> <s> that is why the committee has recommended that much more research should be carried out <e> <s> the committee would not have made that recommendation if the requisite information had been placed before it <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble viscount the lord president of the council for repeating this very important statement given by his right honourable friend the prime minister in the other house <e> <s> the fact that these talks at the highest possible level took place between the two governments is itself of the utmost importance <e> <s> the general tone of the statement is welcomed as also is the report that the two prime ministers have commented that the talks were full frank and most realistic <e> <s> from these benches we welcome the points of agreement on the attitudes towards violence co-operation on security respect for the identities of both communities and on building confidence of the two communities <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister able to confirm that the figures for observance of the seat-belt wearing law are as high as they were the last time we were given this information which was then most encouraging <e> <s> also are there any figures as to the number of prosecutions for not observing the seat-belt law <e> <s> if so how many of those were by direct action and how many were as a result of motorists being stopped for other offences <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to make a few points on this bill <e> <s> i am advised by the oxford city council that this matter involves a principle for which and a number of other noble lords have indicated our support in recent years <e> <s> when this private bill was deposited it included a clause which was disallowed at the unopposed committee stage <e> <s> that clause it was then clause would have authorised the oxford city council to make arrangements for travel concessions for the unemployed and for those involved in youth training schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very important order and it will have far-reaching effects on public passenger transport particularly in the large conurbations <e> <s> it ought to be clearly understood at the start that for many years the marginal rate of grant above the threshold was per cent <e> <s> but since this government came into office in it has fallen steadily and is now only per cent <e> <s> the secretary of state has already announced that for it will drop to per cent <e> <s> for the year the total transport supplementary grant pool fell from million the previous year to million a drop in that one year of per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but may i ask whether he is saying that allowing for inflation without any doubt there will be no less money under the rate support grant and tsg than there is now for tsg only <e> <s> is he saying that as a definite promise <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister said that this work is sent out to competitive tender does this not prove that all the problems of transport are not going to be solved by competitive tendering which is what the government are proposing in their buses white paper <e> <s> this surely proves that that is not the case <e> <s> would it not be worth having a look to see in what is a question of capital development whether there is need for capital to be put in to bring some of the equipment up to date <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that rather than have these detailed questions raised in the house of lords it would be far better if lrt had been left with the glc so that the matters could be raised through elected representatives <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl agree that the commercial undertakings concerned must keep records for their own accountancy purposes <e> <s> will he therefore give some indication of how much money is being saved in just adding all those together <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the noble lord the minister for explaining the order and for doing so in such concise terms <e> <s> once again we see the problem of the position facing us on legislation affecting northern ireland <e> <s> here we have an order one part of which gives powers to construct railways <e> <s> this is the position with which we have to deal regarding orders under direct rule <e> <s> there is nothing at all in the order to which we take exception <e> <s>

office booklet for has been published only in the last few weeks and that there is very little change whatever <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the very low morale in local government generally and in many local authorities can the noble lord envisage the sort of reply that he might get <e>", "<cs> my lords would the <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl recall that in a recent debate i asked a question similar to this concerning hainault forest where there are two golf courses in three separate local authority areas and a wild forest with a large number of verderers and park keepers <e> <s> is he saying that the cost of all that is to fall on those particular authorities and not on london as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i first wish to thank the noble lord lord lyell for explaining the bill and also for sending myself and i think other noble lords a copy of the notes on clauses which have been extremely helpful <e> <s> it would be sufficient for me to say that we approve the bill and just sit down <e> <s> but as it is rather exceptional for us to welcome a government bill and also as there was a fair amount of criticism in the second reading debate in the other place i think that i should explain why from the opposition we support the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord lyell for introducing this order and for as usual explaining it so simply <e> <s> his remarks together with the supplementary booklet enable us to see exactly what is the picture <e>", "<cs> my lords i want first to congratulate the noble lord lord walston on bringing forward this bill once again and on bringing it forward sufficiently early i hope to avoid what happened when it reached the other place on the last occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give an assurance that if this aircraft receives a certificate and goes into production there will be employment on its production in northern ireland and not elsewhere <e> <s> whatever may be the events concerning lear fan will he not confirm the importance of public investment in northern ireland <e> <s> does he recall what was said last night on the appropriation debate that some per cent <e> <s> of total employment in northern ireland is in public sector employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord the minister to look into his crystal ball because undoubtedly while there will be a number of those persons who will be temporarily abroad for business purposes and who will intend to come back will he hazard a guess at how many of those show their loyalty to this country by being tax exiles with no intention whatever of returning to this country <e> <s> also how many will be persons who have lost all contact with the constituency in which they will be voting up to a period of seven years after leaving <e>", "<cs> my lords as this is the second occasion when we have discussed the details of london regional transport operations would the minister kindly tell me whether we are going to be permitted to discuss details of the operation of what the government call a nationalised industry or are the usual rules to apply <e> <s> have the points that the noble lord has mentioned been discussed with the passengers committee and have they been or will they be discussed with the local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords in the ministers reply to the supplementary he referred to an extension of travel cards <e> <s> i was asking whether or not they had been discussed with the passengers committee which gives advice and also with the local authorities which have to pay when the government ask them for money <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the noble lord for his explanation of these two regulations and say that he has done this and explained them to the satisfaction of your lordships in seven minutes <e>", "<cs> may i say that i have considerable sympathy with the views just expressed by the noble lord lord donaldson <e> <s> many of the points advanced by the noble lord lord monson were in our minds and were expressed during the second reading debate <e> <s> nevertheless on behalf of the opposition i supported the second reading <e> <s> it may be argued that there are other items in northern ireland legislation which are subject to review but these of course are totally different <e> <s> we shall be discussing i think tomorrow the emergency provisions <e> <s> that gives an opportunity and that is the intention apart from the renewal of the provisions for a review of the whole security operation <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the noble lord lord lyell for the general tone of his introductory speech and also for explaining in some detail some of the governments thoughts on the baker review <e> <s> also at the outset i wish to echo what the noble lord the minister has said in paying a tribute to all the security forces <e> <s> i am pleased that he included the prison officers and that he also mentioned the co-operation from the republic <e>", "<cs> my lords my interpretation of alienation in the terms given to me is that a section of the community feel themselves not in tune with the administration of justice in particular in the area in which they are living <e> <s> that is something that must be dispelled <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he give some indication as to whether we are going to have either actual legislation or an indication of the actual legislation the government will propose before we are asked for another renewal of the order <e> <s> i ask this bearing in mind that when the noble lord spoke last july he said that the government were in agreement with most of sir georges conclusions and recommendations and they came to that conclusion within three months <e> <s> he has repeated that again tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for that detailed reply but i am a little disappointed with the information he has given <e> <s> is it not a fact that the glc published a considerable amount of information including that on the quality of service service levels and financial performance as well as proposals for capital projects and their monitoring <e> <s> is it not the case that of those items only the first piece of information is given to the london regional passengers committee and that they are given no information on service levels that is miles run on trains and buses <e> <s> may i ask whether the government will answer questions on detailed service provision in the same way as the glc previously answered for london transport <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether that information is supplied to the london regional passengers committee for their consideration <e> <s> my information is that that is not so <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister for again spelling out the reasons for the bill <e> <s> the last thing your lordships would want is to go through the same speeches we made on second reading <e> <s> on behalf of the opposition i ought to make it thoroughly clear that we are completely in favour of the bill <e> <s> we regret the necessity for the bill but it is absolutely essential if we want to safeguard the integrity of our elections <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a privilege to follow the speech of the noble viscount lord chandos <e> <s> i think he has made a forceful well-informed direct speech and one which frankly despite what the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls may feel basically was free of party politics dealing with the issues of state <e> <s> it is because i appreciate the generosity of the noble viscount and also because usually i find myself in agreement with his noble friends the noble baroness lady seear and the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe that i deeply regret that in their speeches they took the opportunity to deliver a party political broadcast in attacking my own party <e> <s> at the right time my colleagues and i will justify why we remain loyal to the principles with which we came into this party and for which we have worked for well over years <e>", "<cs> as the noble earl lord de la warr made quite clear the worst problem is the problem of the million who have been out of work for more than a year and many who have been out of work for longer than that <e> <s> one and a quarter million is the highest figure ever for those who have been unemployed for more than one year <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what i intended to say <e> <s> you can put that down to the fact that i left school at <e> <s> i repeat it <e> <s> the noble lord said that if we want a <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that there is widespread concern about the point raised by the noble lord lord orr-ewing <e> <s> those of us who use the tube service to heathrow know this only too well <e> <s> would the noble lord not also agree that it was excellent foresight and planning by the airports authority the glc and the former london transport executive in proceeding with the extension of the underground into the fourth terminal so that the tube will be ready when the fourth terminal comes into operation <e> <s> however can he say whether improved arrangements for the handling of luggage will be carried out for the extension of the underground to the fourth terminal <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that information <e> <s> is it not correct that as from nd february london regional transport are proposing to cut or cancel some bus services <e> <s> would he not agree that it is rather foolish for any undertaking not to match their services to demand bearing in mind that paragraph of the annual business plan of london regional transport states that the demand for services in the current year was per cent <e> <s> above the reasons given being the fares policy and the introduction of the travelcard <e> <s> does not paragraph of the same report say that the increase in bus usage was per cent <e> <s> and the increase in underground usage per cent according to london regional transports own figures <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord wallace asked what is demand <e> <s> would the noble lord agree that if a service to a hospital claybury service number is cancelled on a sunday then naturally demand is cancelled because nobody can travel on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the noble lord for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> noble lords will have noticed that in the fourth paragraph the statement says <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not press the matter further but of course the government had a fourth way out <e> <s> they could themselves have made a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly grateful to the noble lord lord belhaven and stenton for putting down this unstarred question <e> <s> i hope that it will not only draw attention to the seriousness of the problem but i hope also that it will give some reassurance as to the steps that are being taken to deal with the situation <e> <s> i was particularly pleased to note the tributes that the noble lord paid to the staff of london transport buses and i think that that will be very much appreciated <e> <s> the question deals with london <e> <s> although the problem exists throughout the country the severity of the assaults and the number of incidents are greater in the london area <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it fully appreciated that the london regional passengers committee is a statutory body set up by the government that the joint users committee covering the six metropolitan counties embraces something around local user groups and that both these bodies were highly critical of the governments proposals in the white paper and called for withdrawal of the legislation <e> <s> does the ministers reply mean that the government have taken no notice at all of these proposals and that the legislation will cover the actual proposals in the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i am somewhat surprised that he replied in the way he did to his noble friends supplementary question <e> <s> i have the two documents here <e> <s> is he aware that to suggest there is any propaganda in these documents is just nonsense <e> <s> these are serious submissions by user bodies <e> <s> i wish the noble lord had made that quite clear in reply to his noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that we are grateful to the noble lord lord lyell for so clearly explaining the provisions of this order <e> <s> the order is related to the wildlife order which is to be debated later this week but i think it is important that the two orders are debated separately because there are important points to be raised on each of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful once again to the noble lord lord lyell for explaining this order and also for the assurance he gave that there will be a review of the sequence of future reviews of the local authority areas the wards and the district electoral areas <e> <s> i need hardly say that the importance of district councils is great even though in northern ireland they are somewhat limited in their powers <e> <s> we all know that the make-up of wards in great britain is of the utmost importance in organising elections but given the electoral system in northern ireland as the noble lord the minister has explained the question of the make-up of the district electoral areas is also of the utmost importance <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that there is an additional original point which he could have mentioned to the noble lord lord hampton <e> <s> when it was accepted that this system of election was right for northern ireland because of its special circumstances there was general agreement that that would never be used as an argument for introducing it elsewhere in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that all noble lords will welcome the opportunity to debate this very important report and will accept the lines on which the debate must be conducted as explained by the noble lord lord trefgarne <e> <s> as the noble lord has said we look forward with great interest to the maiden speech of the noble lord lord chapple <e> <s> the fact that noble lords have been sufficiently interested to want to take part in this debate indicates its importance <e> <s> i echo what the noble lord lord trefgarne has said about the work of mr graham eyre and his assessors even though we do not necessarily accept the conclusions of his report <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the ministers reply does not indicate some degree of complacency over the serious situation which the noble lord lord grimond has outlined in his question <e> <s> may i ask the minister to tell us a little more about this inquiry <e> <s> is it an inter-departmental inquiry <e> <s> alternatively will the national union of seamen and the general council of british shipping be involved in the inquiry <e> <s> is it not a matter that may best be dealt with by a select committee of the other place conducting a detailed inquiry <e> <s> what steps are being taken on an international basis bearing in mind that we are confronted with all types of competition including financial advantages given to our european partners in connection with their shipping <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the minister rather complacent about the figure which he gave <e> <s> i believe that he mentioned schemes <e> <s> is it not a fact that since the passing of the act regarding the freight facilities on waterways only two schemes have been approved <e> <s> does that indicate a lack of publicity <e> <s> is there any scheme of direct marketing in order to encourage firms to move into these freight facilities <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that there are many other factors involved apart from the commercial viability that will be left to private capital <e> <s> is it intended that the government will issue a white paper covering the whole sphere and all the problems involved <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne for putting down <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the caa report was published on th january and that therefore many of us who took part in your lordships debate on the inspectors report on th february took the caa report into full consideration when expressing our views <e> <s> we have no reason now to change the views that we put forward on that occasion <e> <s> is it not the case that the capacity of the four london airports as set out in this document would meet the estimated demand in and with slight adjustments at luton and stansted they could meet demand in with some slight increase in the regional airports <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there can be no difference of opinion as to the desired behaviour of spectators at foreign matches <e> <s> is it not a fact that the government declared their welcome for the decision and they cannot disown their responsibility <e> <s> the ban covers not only famous clubs such as the one my noble friend referred to but also small clubs such as my own leyton orient which has just been dropped into the fourth division <e> <s> it has played abroad with no spectators whatever leaving the country with it and that ban is also applying to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that all noble lords will welcome this opportunity to debate what may be the framework of legislation and regulations dealing with what is and here i agree with the noble lord the minister one of our most important and vital industries civil aviation and our airports <e> <s> together with the noble lord i am certain that we all look forward to the two maiden speeches <e> <s> i should like to say how pleasing it is to see so many speakers on the list on a friday afternoon when we have some sunshine it indicates the importance of this subject <e>", "<cs> absolutely my lords <e> <s> to be fair the government have said that they will ensure that there will be no cross-subsidy particularly as there is now at stansted <e> <s> but why form seven separate companies <e> <s> if the government are satisfied at present with baa with its financial operation and its efficiency why form seven separate companies <e> <s> do we want to see those seven separate companies competing against each other <e> <s> surely that would be an idiotic way to run an airport system <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to intervene i was referring not to the possibility that we might need to meet demand throughout the whole of the country but to the possibility that at some point there might have to be a measure of restriction in the south-east if there was continuous demand <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minster accept that it is a rather pitiful political policy that the only practical suggestion if you can call it practical for dealing with unemployment is that of cutting workers pay <e> <s> is not that a rather pitiful political policy <e>", "<cs> my lords this is intended to be a serious not a facetious question <e> <s> in view of the large bonus paid to the contractors is the noble lord aware of any of the payment being passed on

discussions at recent meetings of the consultative council <e> <s> will the noble lord bear that in mind and also the fact in view of the important point raised by my noble friend lord graham that there is need for this other meeting urgently to discuss the points that he mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to present a petition from the nottinghamshire county council sealed with the seal of the council which prays that your lordships will reject any legislation to implement the proposals of the white paper on buses and the transport bill <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to listen to the noble viscount lord rochdale presenting the report of one of your lordships select committees on european matters <e> <s> he does it with such lucidity and comprehensiveness in a very short time <e> <s> any noble lord who has read the report will appreciate i think the detailed questioning which has given a lot of information on the structure procedures and economics of the airline industry as well as the committees actual recommendations <e> <s> naturally we would all like to go along with the basic objectives of the european memorandum in the interests of passengers for flexibility innovation and co <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government recognise the contribution made towards solving this problem by the greater london councils fares policy which it is generally recognised increased the number of passengers travelling on the bus and underground services and which thus helped to relieve the transport problem <e> <s> also in the light of the problem revealed in the question why are the government so critical of the glcs ban on lorries at certain times <e> <s> i believe this ban was reached after some two years of inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will

conventions and particularly those which deal with the safety of life at sea deserve our serious consideration <e> <s> i noted that the noble lord referred to discussions with the shipping industry

opposition and i feel sure by every other section in your lordships house <e> <s> but at the same time is he not aware that there is a fervent desire for improved relations between the communities in northern ireland <e> <s> is he therefore also aware that we hope that the discussions between the westminster and the dublin governments will proceed with a view to establishing some framework in the interests of both communities in northern ireland and relationships with the south <e>", "<cs> may i just have a brief word on this because i am certain that like myself most noble lords regard this as a human matter <e> <s> we are dealing with the future financial position of or people arising from a decision which parliament will be taking and remember it is a decision which parliament will be taking <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies to the noble lord the minister may i say that my reading of the first part of amendment no <e> <s> is that if an authority asks the traffic commissioner he may determine conditions <e> <s> therefore the question of compulsion does not appear to arise unless there are certain conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has referred on a number of occasions to consultation <e> <s> does he recall that when the house was discussing the local government bill there was pressure from all quarters of the chamber for a proper and full review of local government finance <e> <s> who is conducting the present review <e> <s> would it not be better to have a proper review of local government finance rather than one which is based on a party

your lordships should reject any legislation to implement the proposals of the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain it will be agreed that my noble friend in proposing this amendment set out

again because that act is now law and we have abolition <e> <s> however it will be recalled that under the act we now have the joint transport committees comprising representatives from district councils <e> <s> it was argued that that provision would give direct contact with local communities because representatives from district councils would make up the joint transport board <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord nugent of guildford is endeavouring to say to the house that because we have passed the principle of the bill therefore we should do nothing to ensure that there is a safety net or breakdown anywhere <e> <s> we must challenge the government <e> <s> are the government thoroughly satisfied there will not be a breakdown in any area on any service on any route <e> <s>

not only with the transport interests but also with those who are greatly interested in education and will look at the matter again with a view possibly to bringing this forward at third reading <e>

this question to the debate which took place days after the question was referred to in the question of the noble baroness <e> <s> does the noble earl the minister recall that some very cautionary notes were sounded during the course of that debate particularly on the need to keep in mind the delicate balance between competition and co-operation and the general feeling that the commission

noble viscount on his appointment to the government front bench and i believe on introducing his first item of legislation on behalf of the government <e> <s> from these benches we say that if <e>", "<cs> my lords my first pleasant duty is to congratulate my noble friend lord mellish on his maiden speech <e> <s> i think that we all welcomed the enthusiasm with which he spoke about his work with the docklands corporation <e> <s> he has asked me to apologise to your lordships <e> <s> he has been called away urgently and could not stay <e> <s> i believe that he has conveyed that apology to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that the question of publicity is important but that although the bus and coach council have issued considerable publicity to their operators we still have this problem of excessive speed by quite a number of coach operators <e> <s> what plans have the government to carry out publicity on the whole question of speed <e> <s> secondly can the noble earl tell us a little about enforcement <e> <s> it is not much good having limits when there is no enforcement for individual motorists for a few lorry drivers and also for coach drivers <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he will bear in mind the supplementary question which i put on th october asking that the ministers will keep in mind the need for a proper balance between competition and co-ordination <e> <s> in his reply the minister referred to the question of safety only but the question of co-ordination and competition being balanced is a very important one <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister appreciate that there is general satisfaction and agreement with the regulations that were introduced for standardising exhausts on new machines and also replacement exhausts <e> <s> however as was mentioned when this matter was raised in the house some time ago there is a problem over modification or jazzing up by riders <e> <s> is the minister aware that the motorcycling organisations themselves are very worried about this and also that there are more complaints about motorcycle noise than about almost any other matter connected with motorcycles <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that there has already been political interference by the government in so far as the government refused to consider any amendment to the london regional transport bill to provide for equal competition in wages and other conditions <e> <s> the government also made it quite clear that they would not consider any question of equal wages or social conditions of work in connection with the recent national transport bill <e> <s> is this not a travesty when all the men affected are working under one-man operation and efficiency deals <e> <s> what will happen if this is made a general policy throughout the country <e> <s> do the government have no policy to deal with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back again but i emphasise that all these garages are operating under the one-man operating scheme and <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has now given part of the answer which i wanted at the beginning <e> <s> i referred to garages <e> <s> i have with me the names of all the garages that are affected they are outer london services one-man operated <e> <s> the chairman of london buses has said in so many words and i have his quotations with me that costs must come down <e> <s> if there is already an efficiency deal how else can costs come down except by cutting wages <e> <s> the chairman of london buses has as good as <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thoroughly agree with the point of view that has just been expressed <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that it is very difficult to debate this sort of subject by question and answer <e> <s> as there is to be a full debate next week would it not be best if it were left there so that all aspects of the case may be properly dealt with and the many speakers in the other debate today can proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the ministers reply do not the government agree that it is highly desirable and essential that this house should debate the principle of a direct link as well as the relative nature of possible direct links before the <e>", "<cs> my lords what i am going to give are the figures on this particular issue <e> <s> that is the only one with which we are concerned <e> <s> i am not concerned with decisions taken by devon county council on any other matter whether a month ago or two years ago <e> <s> as i emphasised this is not a party issue <e> <s> my noble friends here have completely free votes <e> <s> the front bench will abstain because of our propriety of not voting against a decision of the other house <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> there is nothing at all in my amendment referring to compensation to the petitioners <e> <s> it is compensation to the national parks authority to which my amendment refers <e>", "<cs> my lords as was the case with the noble lord lord molson it would be wrong of me to make a further speech particularly as i spoke for minutes at the beginning of the debate <e> <s> however it will be noticed that the amendment in my name does not stop the government from getting the bill <e> <s> what it does is express regret at the procedure that has been <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his reply seemed to be thoroughly satisfactory <e> <s> however did i hear the minister say that one of the recommendations is not being implemented <e> <s> if so which is it and is there any particular reason for that <e>", "<cs> my lords following the supplementary question from my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones can the minister say what steps have been taken regarding security at international airports and with whom the discussions are taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords up to the last reply the minister seemed to be making very definitive statements on the cause of this environmental damage <e> <s> on what international basis are those statements made and are there any steps on an international basis worldwide to get scientists together to make a definite statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the importance of part-time firemen in many areas but could the minister say whether the increase in part-time firemen in some areas is due to the financial stringency of some of the fire authorities <e> <s> have any representations been made by fire authorities on the difficulty of keeping up their strength of fire cover <e> <s> have representations been made by the fire brigades union on the same matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked that question because i was a member of the national fire service and i am rather concerned that we should not have an increase in part-time firemen in areas where there ought to be an adequate full-time strength <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord lord alport for putting down his question and highlighting what is not just a northern problem but a problem for the whole of the nation <e> <s> as other noble lords have said if it only gave us the opportunity to hear the maiden speech of the right reverend prelate the bishop of sheffield that alone justified the noble lord putting down his question <e> <s> the right reverend prelate showed not only compassion and deep sincerity but also pride in the people he represents <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that the question does not refer to injuries or fatalities suffered by pedestrians and cyclists who are hit by moving vehicles <e> <s> is there any monitoring of the casualties suffered by pedestrians and cyclists <e> <s> if so what does that monitoring prove <e> <s> is there any evidence that this is due to seat-belt wearing drivers and what are the conclusions on that point <e> <s> and would it not be most unfortunate if question and answer of this nature in this house reduced the confidence that is shown in seat-belts by the to per cent <e> <s> of drivers who believe in wearing them <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble earl for repeating that statement made in the other place <e> <s> but he will he confirm reports in todays press that the issue first arose because the gwent county council and other local authorities objected that they had to meet through tolls the cost of approach roads and also the million cost of strengthening the severn bridge <e> <s> is this not therefore a case where the whole policy of providing for estuarial crossings should be reviewed and not met in this way because the severn bridge is of national importance including of course its importance to south wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin my remarks by thanking the government for agreeing so rapidly through the usual channels to have this debate after i requested it only about one week ago <e> <s> so far as i am concerned i want to make it absolutely clear that i have an open mind on the question of a fixed link <e> <s> personally speaking i want to see the best solution that will ensure the maximum relationship with europe but that will also secure the best possible national well-being <e> <s> the proposal before the house has great implications for our transport system <e> <s> it has great implications for economic development in particular regional employment <e> <s> and it has great implications for the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will recall that i was not pressing for a public inquiry in view of the decision in another place <e> <s> i was asking that the government assure us as to how these other matters will be considered and suggesting that what they were proposing was inadequate <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had made our position thoroughly clear as far as the opposition bench in this house is concerned <e> <s> we accept the decision of another place on the question of the inquiry <e> <s> as my noble friend said we are in favour of a link provided that all national interests are considered <e> <s> that is why we want the noble earl to explain this afternoon exactly where interests of a national nature can put their points of view <e>", "<cs> may i say a few words on this matter <e> <s> i had hoped that after the clarity with which my noble friend lord mishcon had put his case and also following the commonsense approach of the noble baroness lady seear we might have dealt with this amendment fairly speedily but that would have prevented our having heard common sense also from my noble friend lord shinwell who said there will be no unanimity there is no general agreement <e> <s> we have also heard the last two noble lords who have spoken tell us in simple words lets get ahead with this amendment and then clarify the position when we come to the next stage <e>", "<cs> surely the noble lord lord campbell of alloway realises what i am saying <e> <s> if there is agreement on the principle that this should be a local decision then we say we support the amendment and with the governments guidance we can deal with some of the machinery at the report stage <e> <s> the essential principle is should this be a national decision applicable whether local people like it or not or should it be a local decision <e> <s> that is all i am asking for and i am certain that is what many other noble lords require <e>", "<cs> does the minister not recall that the provision of bypasses in the towns and villages on the trunk and primary roads was part of the armitage package dealing with heavy lorries <e> <s> does he not also recall that in both the civic trust and the county council survey showed that about per cent <e> <s> of those towns and villages were not bypassed <e> <s> about half of those will not be by passed until and there are no plans whatever for the other half <e> <s> can the noble earl tell me whether there has been any change since then <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to follow up this point <e> <s> i refer to and beyond <e> <s> if the minister cannot tell me now will he write to me on the possibility of clearing up that outstanding per cent <e> <s> of villages and towns that are not bypassed <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that it is very unfortunate that on yet another occasion we have questions in this house on road traffic schemes before there has been an opportunity for them to be experimented upon and judged <e> <s> we have had that sort of criticism before about schemes which eventually have proved to be highly beneficial to all the people in london <e> <s> is it not a fact that the bus lanes in this case follow strictly the guidelines laid down by the department of transport <e> <s> is it not also the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the chief whips pardon <e> <s> the chief whip should not endeavour to interrupt when noble lords have not quite finished their speeches <e> <s> is it not also the case that the government believe in cost-effectiveness and that previous bus priority schemes have been cost-effective to london regional transport <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that even some of us who oppose the development of stansted to the extent suggested by the government nevertheless consider that a rail link is absolutely essential <e> <s> if finance is the problem should not the government assist in the same way as they would in the production of a road infrastructure <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble earl for repeating this statement and whatever noble lords opinions might be of the desirability of a fixed link or the project selected i think it would be generally agreed that this is an historic statement <e> <s> when we debated the question of a fixed link on th december last i stressed then that there had been inadequate parliamentary discussion and also inadequate national consideration of whether or not there should be a fixed link <e> <s> that still remains the opinion of these benches at this stage particularly in the light of all the other massive schemes that are required schemes such as housing and other problems and we shall be debating housing on another day <e> <s> all these factors we believe have not been adequately considered <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be very simple for me to say that i agree with everything that the noble earl has said in introducing this order and then sit down <e> <s> although it is quite true that i do agree with everything he said i think that it behoves me on behalf of the opposition to say a few words <e> <s> it is good that we are discussing this matter so early in european safety year <e> <s> i am glad that noble lords are discussing the matter on this occasion <e> <s> like the noble earl i should like to pay tribute to the noble lord lord nugent of guildford whose amendment it was to the transport bill which we debated in which brought about this legislation <e> <s> i am certain that we shall make the order a permanent feature of our road safety law this afternoon and it will be a permanent tribute to the noble lords legislative ability in this particular matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that any law that is passed will enable me to live beyond my present age of and i shall not regard that as a dismal piece of legislation <e> <s> obviously the saving to the national health service is important to us and the saving to the community is important to us but they are not the main factors <e> <s> the main factor is the saving of human suffering and that is what this seat belt legislation has secured <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has referred to the stress on competition <e> <s> does he recall that on both the last occasion the st november and the previous occasion on which the noble baroness put this question on th october i think it was i stressed the need for co-ordination as well as competition and the noble earl agreed that that was the proper point <e> <s> does the noble earl recall that <e> <s> was an emphasis laid on co-ordination at this council meeting as well as on competition <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for his clear explanation of the three sets of regulations <e> <s> as he said they are rather technical <e> <s> i am pleased to note that there has been thorough consultation with the political parties which are in agreement with the general provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister appreciate how much i recognise what he has just said that progress apparently has been made <e> <s> does he recall that i have raised this matter on previous <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask just two questions although i have had no opportunity at all to read the green paper <e> <s> dealing with compensation for authorities with different needs does that mean that the present grea machinery with which there is general dissatisfaction throughout local government will still be used to determine the different needs of the various authorities <e> <s> secondly the question of the register has been raised <e> <s> what is the reasoning for a separate register of all adults bearing in mind that the present electoral register is for all people of years and above <e> <s> the home office will agree that the present register is unsatisfactory and there are complaints all over the country that many people are left off it <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it would be useful if right at the outset of my remarks i reiterated what my noble friend lady david said when introducing her speech <e> <s> she said that the labour party fully concurs with all the expressions of opinion and that we in no way support payment for political propaganda out of the rates by the ratepayers <e> <s> let there be no dubiety whatever on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for that <e> <s> i made it absolutely clear as <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl recall the written answer which appeared in <e>", "<cs> my lords on this occasion the noble earl used only the term a liberal market and <e>", "<cs> my lords the question deals with the current issue <e> <s> is the noble lord the minister satisfied that all those who said hear hear in reply to a recent supplementary question have read this publication <e> <s> is he aware that on the occasion of the second reading of the local government bill the position of the opposition was made absolutely clear that it is opposed to the use of ratepayers money for party political propaganda <e> <s> is it not also an important fact that dissemination of information about services which will be available after the abolition of the glc is of vital importance <e> <s> that is what this journal does and should not the glc be congratulated rather than denigrated <e>", "<cs> my lords while the government say that they are considering a new issue of the <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords who have spoken i am grateful to the noble viscount lord hanworth for giving us the opportunity to ventilate views on a number of subjects connected with our democratic institutions <e> <s> we are grateful to the noble viscount for letting us know in advance of the items with which he proposed to deal <e> <s> i do not propose to deal with all the items but shall pick out three or four <e> <s> however in having such a wide-ranging debate we are in danger of making sweeping generalities on a number of the points <e> <s> as the noble viscount said democracy means different things to different people <e> <s> many things we all agree on <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i sat on one of your lordships ec committees which went into this whole question and the views were quite clear on that and on the reason why britain stood out <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to quote other continental countries most of them do not adopt the single transferable vote they adopt the list system <e> <s> that is the system of merely dropping a list in a box and if one receives per cent <e> <s> of the votes one has per cent <e> <s> of the seats <e> <s> that is a system which i do not believe many members of your lordships house would support <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount not agree that this is a matter that should be looked at in the light of representations that may be made by the metropolitan police and also of what success may be achieved in traffic regulation <e> <s> what should not happen i hope the noble viscount will agree is that this matter is determined through any kind of political prejudice against the glc <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble earl will appreciate i am among those who are apprehensive about massive development at stansted <e> <s> is the noble earl also aware that i recognise that if there is to be this develoment a british rail link is essential <e> <s> what will be the effect on british rails external financial limit in the event of this scheme being approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow up my noble friends question <e> <s> most noble lords will agree with the ministers reply that this is a personal responsibility <e> <s> however can radio and television programmes be used not just to issue warnings but to give information concerning the proper use of vehicles in bad weather <e> <s> when warnings of bad weather are broadcast are they broadcast on all programmes or merely on radio and radio <e>", "<cs> i am naturally disappointed with the governments reply <e> <s> i am certain it is not because the government do not have sympathy with the question of race relations <e> <s> i am certain that their views are as strong as those of any other section of your lordships house <e> <s> when i moved the amendment i deliberately used the wording of clause as amended by your lordships decision this afternoon <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord for referring to paragraph <e> <s> i can of course refer to other paragraphs which are much wider <e> <s> i believe there is general sympathy for what we are aiming at in this amendment and naturally we want to carry something on those lines <e> <s> if the minister is not only prepared to have a look at this but agrees to have consultations before the next stage of the bill i would be prepared not to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> the offer that the noble lord lord elton has made is one that i am prepared to accept <e> <s> i think that noble lords will recognise that we wish the government to come forward with something which will assist the local authorities and the community relations councils in carrying out their proper work as laid down in the act <e> <s> we should expect to see something coming forward at report stage <e> <s> therefore in those circumstances i agree to withdraw the amendment but we reserve the right ourselves to come forward if the government do not move satisfactorily <e>", "<cs> i am referring to the <e>", "<cs> i accept the comment of the noble and learned lord lord denning that the amendment which i proposed would still have no effect because of the opening subsection of clause <e> <s> equally i think there is strong validity in the point made by the noble lord lord winstanley as to why on the other hand we have clause b in the bill at all <e> <s> i shall read very carefully what the noble lord lord elton has said but i find it very difficult to find any justification for the government having it in <e>", "<cs> can the noble and learned lord explain exactly how he believes ilea can meet the expenditure from its own resources and why he says that sections and of the act are not relevant and should not apply to ilea <e> <s> i know that he stated that but can he explain it <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies perhaps i may raise one point <e> <s> the amendment refers to the substitution for the words in the bill which are <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that there is a vast field of activity for a minister for sport or whatever we might call him to undertake in working with and encouraging local authorities and other sports organisations to make their facilities which have a limited use available for the general public particularly children <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not remarkable that we have had changes in the statistical recording of figures on this occasion and on previous occasions only since there has been mounting unemployment under this government <e> <s> is that not remarkable to the ordinary person <e> <s> should other statisticians be prepared to argue about the comments made by his own statisticians would the noble lord be prepared to discuss that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords as this is european road safety year and the minister has said that every opportunity will be taken to impress upon motorists the importance of this matter does he recall that last tuesday the noble baroness lady macleod asked a question about driving in winter conditions <e> <s> i asked a question about the use of television and radio <e> <s> is this not an excellent opportunity to use television and to make a series demonstrating to all motorists the proper way of driving <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i ask him to enlighten the committee as to what is the letter to which he has twice referred which he received this morning <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to follow the noble lord the minister on this question of what will happen when the orders are before us <e> <s> we shall deal with that matter at an appropriate stage <e> <s> but i should like to intervene in this debate to put a completely non-legal angle as the ordinary person might see the situation <e> <s> may i say in passing that i am certain the noble lord lord beloff did not mean to say what it sounded as if he said when he referred to the interests of people in local government and journalism and so on <e> <s> we are all concerned with one thing only what is best in the interests of local authorities local government and the people who are represented by local authorities <e>", "<cs> as this is the committee stage i must reply to the points made by the noble lord the minister <e> <s> let us consider what widdicombe says in paragraph <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> it appears to me with respect that the two previous speakers have interpreted the amendment wrongly <e> <s> with the amendment the subsection would read <e>", "<cs> there is only one brief point i wish to raise <e> <s> although as the clause is now amended it is recommended practice for guidance i should refer to subsection and remind noble lords what that says <e>", "<cs> of course not but this gives scope for so many different features <e> <s> in case the noble lord missed what i was saying when he intervened and asked me a question

computations that there could be in having different codes applying to different parts of subsection <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mottistone in moving his amendment did not refer to subsections and of the clause <e> <s> subsection provides <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble lord explained that because i was assuming from his amendment that he was wishing the local authorities to make these details public <e> <s> but there are still points which the noble and learned lord lord denning has brought forward which make this amendment objectionable <e> <s> i have no objection to any organisation making public what its aims are but when we consider the details that are required here they include <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lady david is thoroughly able to defend herself but i wish to comment on the ministers remarks concerning her alleged comments about widdicombe <e> <s> to my knowledge my noble friend was not criticising widdicombe <e> <s> if anything she was criticising the governments interpretation of widdicombe and the fact that they have turned widdicombe completely on its head as so many noble lords observed on second reading <e>", "<cs> i should like very briefly to support what has been said by the noble lord lord elliott of morpeth <e> <s> i am sorry that his noble friend lord nugent cannot be here <e> <s> however i think that all noble lords have respect for what the noble lord lord nugent has said on various occasions on the question of road safety and i hope that we shall give consideration to this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords although i understand the desire of the noble baroness to have the facts correct does not the small throughput and the present small capacity illustrate the problems that will arise when the government proceed with a policy of developing up to million passengers a year with provision for a possible million passengers a year problems with regard to rail development road infrastructure and urban development <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount for explaining this order which is generally welcomed because it increases the maximum election expenses in accordance with inflation <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble viscount a question but before doing so i must make a few introductory remarks though i am certain that the house would not wish me to initiate a debate on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl recall that when we last debated the matter in your lordships house i referred to a statement by his right honourable friend the secretary of state in the other place that in the event of money drying up before the project was completed anything erected by then would be removed <e> <s> can he say whether that is also the view of the french government <e> <s> also what will be the position in regard to expenditure incurred by local authorities by british rail and by other developers of the infrastructure <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i share the concern of the noble earl lord kinnoull regarding international activity <e> <s> can the noble earl assure the house that steps will be taken in the event of other states not carrying out similar inspection of their airlines <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that one of the assessment teams that worked on the channel tunnel proposals was dealing with the possible economic consequences <e> <s> would it not have been helpful if we had had a detailed report from that assessment team in the same way that we have had a detailed environmental appraisal <e>", "<cs> my lords

with the whole of this matter <e> <s> would it not have been helpful if we had had that sort of report to hand <e>", "<cs> my lords am i right in thinking that in reply to my noble friends question the noble lord said that the lead minister with regard the forestry commission is the secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> if that is so will he explain how that applies and how it works out in connection with the large forestry estates in wales and parts of england <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain it will not be the wish of the house that i should deal in detail with all the various

anomaly and it is one which i think it is very valuable to support <e>", "<cs> my lords although the minister said that there was no intention on the part of the secretary of state to have a limit on atms at either heathrow or gatwick but to have one at stansted assuming that he is compelled to have a limit on transport movements would helicopter movements be included or would they be excluded <e>", "<cs> my lords although everyone will be appreciative of the progress made by the national freight corporation does the noble earl agree that these are the same workpeople who were working when they were part of the nationalised industry <e> <s> does this not prove that the national freight corporation was a profitable enterprise when under public <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to take it from

the presentation of political matters in local authority schools <e>", "<cs> the amendment forbids the promotion of partisan political views <e> <s> one cannot put forward a political case on behalf of a political party unless one happens to be partisan <e> <s> we drew up a charter <e> <s> it was signed by the three elements attending that meeting <e> <s> it was sent throughout the country by the hansard society as the way to deal with a balanced presentation of partisan views <e> <s> that can only be done with a balanced programme which must involve and be drawn up by the local education officer <e> <s> if people challenge me on that point they can look through the records of the hansard society <e> <s> they will find the meeting and the charter recorded <e> <s> that is why amendment no <e> <s> a is a better way to handle this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness appreciate that as my noble friend has just referred to another hospital one cannot consider these things on a piecemeal basis <e> <s> does she recall that i had an unstarred question debate on the closure of another hospital also in the epping forest district council and in the west essex district health authority area administered by waltham forest and this would be the fifth hospital in that area to be closed <e> <s> do the government appreciate the inconvenience for people receiving ancillary services and visiting patients when they have to go to these very large hospitals some miles away <e>", "<cs> my lords one hates to be repetitive on this matter but if i do not ask the question the noble earl will think that i have forgotten all about it <e> <s> in the list of matters which he said the secretary of state raised at this meeting he did not refer to the question of keeping essential co-ordination and i am delighted with his last answer on the use of regional airports <e> <s> was that matter also raised in the consultations <e>", "<cs> my lords the information that the minister has given is most encouraging <e> <s> he may recall that when this matter was last raised the question was one of shortage of staff at dvlc which i am pleased to know has been met by the increased improved machinery <e> <s> but is the minister satisfied that in addition to having the machinery for keeping the records there is speedy transmission of those records to those who have to enforce the provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not have helped if the government at the outset had decided to give a free vote to all their own members and then we might have got a sensible compromise and given a lead to the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl the minister aware whether this matter has been raised at all through the london regional passengers committee which would appear to me to be the appropriate body to consider it <e> <s> as the last thing that <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble earl for the courteous way in which he has introduced this bill a bill of controversy and also for the way in which he has clarified the various points involved <e> <s> as noble lords will be aware the question of hybridity has been raised elsewhere <e> <s> this is not the time to do so in your lordships house but as we consider various clauses this question may have to be taken up <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend would agree that he never asked that stansted should be privatised separately but that it should operate independently within the privatised baa <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister give an assurance that this matter is not being held up because of the question of the external financial limit <e> <s> if that is the problem will that be adjusted accordingly to allow this matter to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl not recognise that it is not just the viability of a rail link it is the viability of an airport which is the important consideration <e> <s> does he also remember that there is a rail link to heathrow by london regional transport <e> <s> that was constructed irrespective of the point which he has raised in connection with the rail link to stansted <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that the metropolitan police take appropriate action in such cases <e> <s> can he tell the house how many successful prosecutions there have been in the past months or the past two years <e> <s> although this is a dangerous offence for motor-cyclists are not many car drivers also guilty of the offence <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i have not misunderstood the noble lord <e> <s> did he say in the final part of his previous answer that if an order is made it will not vary from one year to the next <e> <s> surely some consideration will be given to inflation <e> <s> will that at least be included in the order if the government decide to issue one <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl said that it was a matter for the operators concerned <e> <s> surely we are not being asked to believe that the government have no direct discussions with the operators on matters of this kind particularly in respect of the british rail service to gatwick <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount about two matters associated with the original question <e> <s> first do not all traffic management schemes on roads that are designated by the secretary of state have to be vetted by the department and guidance notes issued to the boroughs concerned and have those guidance notes yet been issued <e> <s> secondly as there is no strategic authority for greater london parliament in its wisdom decided not to have one are there any steps for co-ordination of priorities and overall policies for road schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords i too shall not detain the house for long <e> <s> there is one point to add to the useful comments of the noble lord lord henderson <e> <s> as i said at second reading this is a useful bill which clarifies and deals with an omission in the present law and i want to do nothing to impede its progress <e> <s> but if one looks at the bill one finds that the maximum penalty for lighting a fire on or over a highway or discharging any firearm or firework within feet of the centre is on level which i understand is <e>", "<cs> my lords so that the minister may commence her speech at the agreed time i shall have to telescope my remarks or to cut some items out altogether <e> <s> at the outset i should say how impressed all noble lords were i am certain by the sincerity and the human understanding with which my noble friend lord wells-pestell introduced this important debate <e> <s> it is a tragedy that only two non-ministerial speakers from the other side have been attracted to take part in a debate that is really about human personalities in our country <e> <s> of the speakers were my noble friends and with a very impressive speech from the noble lord lord banks in addition they have presented a case dealing with quite a number of important problems covering a number of areas in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords is it sufficient for the minister merely to say that the government welcome the report <e> <s> the report covers pages and has recommendations and there are six working papers covering another pages <e> <s> would it not be advisable for them perhaps to issue a green paper giving full details <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl appreciate that while i expected that answer it is extremely disappointing <e> <s> does the noble earl also appreciate that lrt is a nationalised industry set up by legislation initiated by the government and that the consequences of the transport act and tendering have led to the closure of the loughton bus garage <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make four introductory comments <e> <s> first i share in the good wishes that have been extended to the noble viscount lord rochdale who we are very sorry to know is ill <e> <s> he has done such an excellent job in dealing with shipping matters in your lordships house and undoubtedly must be responsible to a very great extent for this very excellent and clear and concise report <e>", "<cs> my lords on reflection does not the noble lord think that he has been a little hasty in the replies that he has given to my two noble friends because surely their questions related to obtaining value for money in defence procurement <e> <s> the noble lord has not answered their questions <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not appreciate that his last reply is the one that we should have had at the outset <e> <s> it is a question of vandalism <e> <s> one cannot find telephone directories in vandalised telephone boxes when one wants to make a call <e> <s> therefore is not a post office the only sensible place to which to go and is it not an obligation on the post office to pay for this service <e> <s> the noble lord surely ought to get in touch with the director-general of oftel and ensure that he makes arrangements to pay the post office to have a supply of telephone directories <e>", "<cs> my lords as the sprinter services are intended to replace units which are now between and years old and which must be replaced can the noble viscount indicate how many of the new sprinter units have been constructed and when the programme will finish <e> <s> also can he say whether the curtailment of the expenditure limit will either restrict the sprinter services coming into operation or cut down other essential features of british rails investment programme <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord forgotten that on nd may your lordships had a debate on the ec committees report on maritime policy <e> <s> has he forgotten that it was made quite clear that we cannot deal with maritime policy without dealing with shipping shipbuilding and ports <e> <s> yet the whole of his statement today has dealt solely with shipbuilding <e>", "<cs> i am certain that the noble lord lord broxbourne understands full well what is meant <e>", "<cs> i am certain the noble lord knows what is meant and if there is any doubt on the issue then let the government accept these amendments and in an interpretation clause declare exactly what it should mean <e> <s> that is a way out of the issue <e> <s> our interpretation of an independent free-standing company is that it will stand on its own feet within the privatised baa <e> <s> it will not receive cash subsidies from the successor company <e> <s> it will not be given special predatory charging arrangements <e> <s> that is our <e>", "<cs> it may be felt in view of the opposition from the noble lords lord broxbourne and lord boyd-carpenter because they are two very formidable debaters that these amendments should be resisted <e> <s> but that is what they are formidable debaters <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has said that any arrangement for an employee to be on the board should be voluntary it should not be prescriptive <e> <s> i was pleased to note that he did not say that it was a wrong principle to have an employee representative on the board neither did he say that it was unworkable <e> <s> he just thought it was something that should not be mandatory in the bill <e> <s> in that respect i believe he disagreed with his noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e>", "<cs> i ought to learn never to mention the noble lord by name <e> <s> at least we know that we always get a reply and so have some better understanding of where we are <e> <s> the noble earl referred to the high percentage of workers of british telecom who took shares but that is not the position <e> <s> i said i would not refer to the figures that were given at the committee stage in the other place because i thought everybody would have read them <e> <s> however perhaps i had better repeat them <e> <s> of the share value of british telecom per cent <e> <s> are held by the employees in jaguar it is per cent <e> <s> in british associated ports per cent <e> <s> in britoil per cent <e> <s> in amersham international per cent <e> <s> and in cable and wireless per cent <e> <s> it may be accepted that they should stand in the same way as other shareholders to get their representation on the board but on those figures they will have to do a lot of effective lobbying to get an employee representative on the board <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down may we have a definite assurance that a statement of some kind will be made before report stage <e> <s> it would be a great pity if we missed the opportunity to record our view today and then at report stage find that the whole thing is inadequate <e>", "<cs> clause of the bill cancels the liabilities of the baa to the secretary of state <e> <s> it provides that the authoritys outstanding debt be written off once restructuring has taken place <e> <s> we understand that the debts are currently million but by the time of restructuring they could undoubtedly reach million <e> <s> the policy outlined in the clause is somewhat similar to that in relation to public transport under the transport act <e> <s> the public transport companies to be set up under that act must be in operation by october <e> <s> in many of the metropolitan areas those public companies will be operated on a viable basis only by the ptes servicing the debts though the assets to which they relate will be transferred to the companies <e> <s> the ptes will have to service those debts by borrowing naturally with interest to be paid <e> <s> that will affect the limited support that may be available for the public transport network <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord tordoff has said we welcome the statement made by the noble earl <e> <s> it is a step forward from the long deliberations we had on the subject of pensions on other privatisation measures <e> <s> although i have previously said that the secretary of state may change and we should therefore have matters written in to the bill i appreciate the problems of trying to write into a bill something which must be carried out by a public limited company which has its own rights under company law <e> <s> the assurances that the noble earl gave about the discussions held with the chairman of baa on the future for the employees will be most welcome to the employees <e> <s> under those circumstances i shall not press the amendment <e> <s> the statement will be clear in <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i am a little confused first with the argument between liverpool and manchester which has nothing to do with my amendment at all and which may have confused the situation and secondly with the noble earls reply <e> <s> liverpool airport wants to know who actually owns liverpool airport <e> <s> the secretary of state has ordered that it be transferred to the pta <e> <s> admittedly the pta is made up of representatives of the various local authorities <e> <s> could a situation arise whereby if a pta is not classified as a principal authority there could be difficulties regarding some important clauses of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful both to my noble friend lord sefton and to the noble lord lord tordoff for putting the position regarding speke airport in the simple terms that are facing the people in the area <e> <s> as i said at the outset i believe that there has been lengthy correspondence with the appropriate section of the department from the pta on this issue <e> <s> i am not clear i do not think many other noble lords will be clear exactly where we stand at this moment <e> <s> the offer of the noble earl to send a letter is appreciated <e> <s> i hope he will send a copy to every noble lord who has taken part in this debate <e> <s> i think it is important that we should have that <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the noble earl has really answered the point of this amendment <e> <s> clause reads <e>", "<cs> in that case i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for asking me that <e> <s> i can only go on the information provided to me <e> <s> bearing in mind that the amendment refers to <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the support which other noble lords have given to the amendment <e> <s> apart from not understanding what the noble earl really meant by politically dominated local councils because even hung councils are dominated by political parties i cannot understand also the statement which is repeated time and time again by ministers in connection with the bill namely we want the local airports to be at arms length from local councillors <e> <s> have we no faith at all in local government <e> <s> this seems to be a matter which comes up time and time again with this government in one piece of legislation after another <e> <s> they really have no faith in local government <e>", "<cs> if the noble earl prefers i will continue because i have not spoken to those other amendments at all <e> <s> therefore briefly because i shall have a lot more to say it all deals with the process of clause i will now speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> will the noble earl continue to read the rest of the amendment because it is very important <e>", "<cs> the only part of the statement that the noble earl has just made which concerns me is that the government will seek advice from the local authority associations on the type of guidance and advice that will be sent out <e> <s> what will happen if the local authority associations say no you should not do it this way <e> <s> is there any assurance that the government will say right we accept the view of the local authority associations <e> <s> i have a pretty good idea what one local authority association would say if it was asked what guidance and advice should be sent to local authorities <e> <s> it would say what the amendments say <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has referred to clause <e> <s> but that clause deals solely with compensation for loss or diminution of pension rights <e> <s> we come to pensions on a later amendment <e> <s> the amendment that i have moved does not deal solely with pensions as such <e> <s> the secretary of state has to give approval to a transfer scheme <e> <s> i agree with the noble earl that it is not a transfer scheme to private enterprise but a transfer to a plc <e> <s> but while the secretary of state is considering other things why should he not say that he will not approve a scheme unless it provides for those persons at present employed by the local authority to be transferred to the company upon terms that are no less favourable to them <e> <s> that is what the amendment says <e> <s> what is wrong with the secretary of state saying that if the scheme submitted does not provide for that he will not approve it <e> <s> that is all that the amendment says <e>", "<cs> i dealt with that matter sufficiently in my opening remarks <e> <s> at this time of night i do not propose to continue the argument <e> <s> we shall look carefully at what the noble earl has said and take further advice ourselves <e> <s> it seems to me however that this is one of the essential points that the minister should consider <e> <s> if the transfer of undertakings regulations are a factor to which the noble earl is tying himself i cannot even find that in the bill <e> <s> the plc could possibly ignore some of those points particularly in the light of the frailty of the regulations to which i have referred <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord the minister recall the press notice issued on st march no <e> <s> on that very matter <e> <s> it referred not only to those tyres being safe for braking purposes up to miles per hour but also said that that is provided they are used in an emergency for a short distance <e> <s> precisely what is a short distance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to rise again but the noble earl said in one of his replies that those tyres can be used for a short distance until the motorist is able to reach a service station <e> <s> will the noble earl tell me what would by my position assuming i can get <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to have to disagree with the noble lord over his remark that the question put by my noble friend lord prys-davies went far beyond the original question <e> <s> in so far as the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that the house will be grateful to the noble earl for repeating the statement <e> <s> however i think all noble lords will appreciate that this is one further devastating blow for british rail engineering limited and not only for brel but also for the towns concerned bearing in mind that most of them are already suffering from very high unemployment and from lack of manufacturing employment <e> <s> i think this is the third year that we have had an announcement in parliament on cuts in brel <e> <s> i believe we were told in that the announcement made then was expected to be the last on any cuts but now we have this further announcement today <e>", "<cs> my lords although naturally in our questions on the statement we are mainly concerned with the position of brel the question asked by the noble lord lord harris of greenwich is <e>", "<cs> on behalf of the labour opposition may i indicate our support for the amendment moved by the noble earl lord dudley <e> <s> i can be very brief because i think the noble earl has delivered a formidable case which the government should accept and on which they should act accordingly bearing in mind the points that have been emphasised <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend responds to that suggestion perhaps i may ask the noble earl to seek advice also on two further points first the deeming option that was discussed during our consideration of the transport bill secondly the question of the admitted body status to which i shall be referring when we reach clause <e>", "<cs> i just cannot understand the argument put forward by the noble earl <e> <s> at least i can understand what he is saying but i cannot understand why he adopts that point of view <e> <s> he referred to the position in going to tender <e> <s> what about the local authority transport undertaking which under the act is compelled to go to tender <e> <s> yet there is a dispensation which the secretary of state can give in the case of transport <e> <s> frankly it is nonsense for the government to say that what is good under the transport bill which does just the same thing as is suggested under the airports bill with the arms length position and the conflict of interest should be viewed entirely differently in this bill <e> <s> i know that it is thursday and pm but why are the government not prepared to look at this matter again <e> <s> i believe there is a conflict between the two bills and it is a conflict of principle that i cannot understand <e> <s> so <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for his honest account of how he would treat this matter if we were to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> obviously we shall not get any further if we withdraw the amendment <e> <s> bearing in mind that this measure applies equally to unpaid directors people who are serving as a public duty and the government will not even say that they will withdraw this provision <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for the first part of his remarks in which he expressed the view that most local authorities would be prepared to adopt the admitted body status <e> <s> i hope that means that the department will be sending out guidance notes which will put favourably the position on admitted body status and in effect recommend it to the local authorities <e> <s> it would be extremely helpful if that were done <e> <s> i am grateful that the noble earl is nodding his head vigorously <e> <s> i am very pleased to note that that will be in the official record <e>", "<cs> we were quite prepared to accept the general principle in the original clause <e> <s> obviously we would give support to any steps that were required to ensure security at airports <e> <s> i am pleased that the government have brought forward this amendment and am grateful for the explanation that the noble earl has given to justify it <e> <s> frankly this matter is something that the opposition should themselves have noticed and i am pleased for once to commend the noble earl for having made this differentiation between operational activities and commercial activities that are outside the airports control <e>", "<cs> while i appreciate why the noble earl cannot give an assurance at this stage it is not just a matter for the airport authority <e> <s> surely the question of security is a matter for the government <e> <s> the government ought to ensure that this job is carried out effectively and if they are satisfied that the baa inside personnel do the job effectively now working with the local police surely that situation should continue <e> <s> it is not just a matter to be left to the new company to decide whether or not they will engage outside security companies <e> <s> surely it is a government responsibility to ensure that security is adequate and proper safeguarding every possible eventuality <e>", "<cs> the noble earl is making heavy weather of this and i cannot understand why <e> <s> it is common sense that airport operators and airline operators must be consulted when you are dealing with traffic distribution rules or the allocation of air transport movements <e> <s> they are written on the face of the bill <e> <s> my amendment amendment no <e> <s> to clause refers to <e>", "<cs> the noble lord stressed the degree of consultation on london air traffic distribution <e> <s> that surely is one of the difficulties <e> <s> bodies outside the south-east have complained bitterly that the consultation process has been on london air traffic distribution and not on the whole question of air traffic distribution and problems throughout the whole of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> neither i nor my noble friend intervened because we wanted to hear the minister and basically we were satisfied with what the minister said <e>", "<cs> i am very pleased that in the past few minutes reference has been made to surface transport which is included in my amendment <e> <s> for brevitys sake i made no reference to it but it is a very important consideration <e> <s> i am a little astounded that whenever we want to put in extra qualifications the noble earl says that we are overburdening the <e>", "<cs> in trying to assist the committee there is sometimes danger in being very brief in ones introduction of an amendment <e> <s> i am very pleased that everyone who has spoken has praised the work of air traffic controllers and i believe that that sentiment is echoed by all noble lords in the committee <e>", "<cs> at this late hour i would not seek to press them but i still believe that the principle of our amendments is correct <e> <s> i will look carefully at what the noble earl has said and consider whether or not we should bring something similar forward again at a later stage <e> <s> we believe that the provisions in the bill are not adequate at present to meet the purpose we have in mind <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister kindly tell the house what was the survey to which he referred which said that per cent <e> <s> of women in part-time work were satisfied with their employment <e> <s> what was the survey because that could not be a statistical figure but merely the result of a survey <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord bear in mind the importance of the answer he gave to my supplementary question that the survey was last taken five years ago in <e> <s> it therefore takes no account of the huge increase in part-time employment to which he referred earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the lateness of the hour after the all-night vigil undertaken by many members in the past hours it would be wrong for this very useful bill to enter your lordships house without some word or comment from this side <e> <s> we are grateful to the noble earl lord lauderdale not only for bringing it forward in your lordships house but also for the very useful way in which he has explained its provisions <e> <s> i am totally with him also in expressing thanks to mr albert mcquarrie the member for banff and buchan who brought the bill forward in the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount referred to the important meeting to be held i think he said later this month following which the government will decide their own actions <e> <s> can we be assured that a statement will be made on this important issue <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this matter was raised only on monday morning with the president of the ussr mr gromyko by the delegation from the inter-parliamentary union and it was emphasised quite clearly that this could be one of the biggest blunders in connection with world security <e> <s> they hope that the british government will use their initiative with the united states president but emphasised quite clearly that there is no desire whatever for britain to worsen its relations with its own friends in america <e> <s> should not the government move in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely disappointed in the ministers reply because he has not answered the important points that i put forward in moving this amendment <e> <s> i am very grateful to other noble lords some of them barristers who have supported the amendment <e> <s> it has nothing to do with where an airport should be built as the noble lord lord mountevans stated <e> <s> what we all know and no one will deny is that for a period of years stansted has been heavily subsidised <e> <s> at the committee stage i gave figures which my noble friend lord dean of beswick repeated this afternoon as to the huge losses incurred by stansted on relatively small turnovers over a period of years because it has been subsidised <e> <s> it was the intention of the baa to subsidise it <e>", "<cs> my lords the timescale is set out in the new subsection a of amendment no <e> <s> which reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i am encouraged and grateful to the noble earl for confirming what i understood was the position at the joint meeting <e> <s> there is such a thing as bush telegraph <e> <s> however he has not answered one of the points that i made and i do not think that it is within his power to do so <e> <s> i think it is possibly the secretary of state for the environment who should know something about this and it is his position to answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble earl feels that the government can be of no further help to the house because it is not just a question of being of no further help to me or to liverpool <e> <s> this is one of the problems that we said would arise under abolition <e> <s> the government have not fully thought out all the issues that will arise from abolition and as each problem arises they have to find a way to get over it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble earl has advanced any reason why the amendment should be withdrawn <e> <s> admittedly we debated an amendment in committee and the noble lord recognises that it has come back in a different form <e> <s> a couple of paragraphs have been left out <e> <s> i remind noble lords that the division on the amendment last time was defeated by only six votes <e> <s> we have brought forward the amendment in a different form this time because of the principle contained in it <e> <s> it is wrong for the noble earl to repeat yet again that there is a more liberal regime <e> <s> the clause does not provide for the liberality that is given in the transport act <e> <s> all we are asking is for the government to be consistent and to put in the airports bill what they themselves put in the transport act <e> <s> for that reason apart from any other considerations the house should agree to the amendment and i hope that it will <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the impressive speeches that have been made on this subject it would be wrong not to pass some observation from this dispatch box <e> <s> first we had not considered that this aspect would be covered by clause but as noble <e>", "<cs> no my lords amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords we are naturally very encouraged by what the noble earl said about clause when we reach it but i must say that i cannot fully understand the governments reasoning on this amendment <e> <s> there could be circumstances where for reasons of security and international obligations there is a short visit to a small airport by someone for whom security measures must be taken though the local authority may already be burdened with debt in connection with that airport <e> <s> it seems to me that in such a case it is wrong not to give the secretary of state power to make a grant <e> <s> the noble earl says that he has consulted with his advisers <e> <s> we shall have a further look at what he has said but i still believe there is common sense and fairness in our proposal <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the reply of the noble earl has left me almost as dim as the lighting has suddenly become <e> <s> however i am very pleased that he has had the letter from the gatwick airport consultative committee to which i referred <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will also have noted the very important airport consultative committees whose chairmen were at this annual meeting <e> <s> it may be useful if i mention them aberdeen birmingham bristol cardiff wales east midlands edinburgh glasgow leeds bradford liverpool london gatwick london heathrow <e> <s> luton manchester newcastle prestwick southampton stansted and teesside <e> <s> that is a not unimportant list of airport consultative committees <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble earl appreciates that at the end of the day i am almost certain to withdraw these amendments <e> <s> but it is not good enough to say that there are three criteria laid down in clause and four criteria laid down in clause but pose a reason why this criterion should not be included <e> <s> yet the government regard it as <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for so fully explaining the purposes of the governments amendment <e> <s> whether or not it was a slip of the tongue i confess that i did not read section of the act before i came into the chamber <e> <s> however i am going by the governments own notes on clauses which refer to the fact that section of the civil aviation act requires noise abatement measures to be undertaken at aerodromes designated for the purposes and it then goes on <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord monk bretton referred to a previous statement i made about the meeting of the chairmen of the airport consultative committees <e> <s> i want briefly to say that i have received a communication from the consultative committee for stansted airport who themselves have reminded me i do not know about other noble lords that this meeting of the chairmen which was held only on th june decided unanimously to press for this power of direction as explained by the noble lord lord monk bretton <e> <s> i hope the views of the chairmen of all these consultative committees will be taken into consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl appreciate that in view what i have been saying on the airports bill i am the last person to dispose easily of environmental considerations <e> <s> nevertheless i appreciate the value of a speedy link between gatwick and heathrow <e> <s> was it not the case that new routes and higher altitudes were proposed which would have reduced the environmental impact <e> <s> in addition did not the secretary of state say when he made the decision that it might not be possible to maintain a surface route and that he would reconsider the matter if the need arose <e> <s> how then will be the matter be carefully monitored so that the link could be re-established if necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble earl referred to four schemes in all <e> <s> will he write to my noble friend and to others of us who are concerned with this matter giving details of the four schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be wrong if in the debate on a useful bill of this nature a few words were not said from the official opposition <e> <s> the proposal on new metering devices is i believe a useful part of the bill though frankly i do not regard it as the most important part <e> <s> i am reminded of a recent occasion when i went to a tube station in a neighbouring london borough i live just over the london borough border where after a certain number of hours the parking charge is but the meters take only p pieces <e> <s> your lordships can imagine the complete hullabaloo and dislocation that occurs with people rushing around all trying to find p pieces <e> <s> i wonder how many noble lords have in their pockets p pieces with which to meet that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that there is always room for improvement and are not british rail one of the least publicly supported railway networks in western europe particularly in contrast to those of germany and france <e> <s> if the purpose behind the question of the noble lord lord beloff is privatisation is it not also the case that the only undertakings that the government dispose of are those which are a success usually as a result of the work put in by public ownership <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord appreciate that that might be a view expressed by an english peer <e> <s> he said that there will be no extra money <e> <s> will that not place local authority members in a terrible predicament in that they will have either to assist the sport and health facilities of their people or shall we say make a cut in social services <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earls answer ignore the fact that a survey is being undertaken by the secretary of state <e> <s> i have a copy of press notice dated th may which refers to a speech given on the evening of that date by the former secretary of state to the federation of civil engineering contractors in which he said that a survey was being undertaken not merely on the question of widening but also on whether other measures might be introduced <e> <s> is this a survey of only certain sections of the m or the whole of it dealing not only with the possibility of extra lanes but also with all the problems of the heaviness of traffic and when can that report be expected <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl say why the survey is being restricted to certain sections of the m when there are general complaints about various sections <e>", "<cs> my lords will it interest the minister to know that through the kindness of my noble friend lord ponsonby i have been pleasantly surprised on looking through a brochure issued by the british hotels restaurants and caterers association to find the vast number of people who are employed in this industry <e> <s> it is most encouraging <e> <s> following the question of my noble friend lord molloy can he indicate what is the proportion of vacancies and whether any vacancies might be due to inadequate conditions of work particularly hours of work and wages <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble earl will be pleased to know that i am grateful to him for suggesting that it is too early to make a final decision <e> <s> is the noble earl not concerned about some of the reports which have already come forth about the failure of some of the commercial routes that have been taken over under the new process <e> <s> i know that the noble earl is aware of some of them because i sent him four examples from one local authority alone <e> <s> is there not concern about this matter <e> <s> i believe that the last date for tendering for subsidised routes is th october which is some way ahead <e> <s> what will be the situation if because of the unreliability of some of the so-called viable routes councils do not have sufficient money to proceed with the tendering process for the subsidised routes <e> <s> will the government ensure that that matter is given reconsideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it would be wrong not to pass comment on the excellent summary that the noble earl has made <e> <s> he has done extremely well in giving the house a summary of important regulations <e> <s> we naturally welcome them <e> <s> they are all concerned with safety of life at sea <e> <s> in fact some are very reminiscent of the private members bill that was recently introduced by the noble earl lord lauderdale on the question of safety at sea <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for his definite reply to the point raised by the noble lord lord tordoff and i because that will give some encouragement <e> <s> it is rather unfortunate that that was not mentioned in the guidance notes <e> <s> it would have been much more helpful to the authorities concerned if they had been told in the guidance notes that the minister is prepared to consider a scheme if they believed they had a case for exemption <e> <s> it seems that unless somebody tells them or reads <e>", "<cs> my lords that of course is encouraging but it will also set back the timetable <e> <s> if the minister is going to demand that all the schemes are in by the end of november and we are going to have a seminar on monday and presumably it will be something more than just a mechanistic exercise it is really going to be considered before the final advice note is issued then obviously the question of the timetable comes into the consideration <e> <s> but i hope that all local authorities will take the opportunity to bring forward the points which they gave to me to raise today plus many others which are now in the minds of jacola <e>", "<cs> my lords it is notable that when we wish to insert something in the bill it is regarded as unnecessary but when something is already in the bill the government find some reason why it is right for <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend says the noble earl is too persuasive my lords <e> <s> if one considers the points i have made on the question of the caa under clause concerning the economic regulation of airports these are the three points mentioned as being matters which the caa must take into consideration <e> <s> on these benches we are saying that the prescribed expenditure in connection with the local authority airports should also be considered in the light of these three points <e> <s> i am sorry that the government cannot see the sanity common sense and fairness of why that which is good enough for the caa provision should not be in the provision for the local authorities <e>", "<cs> on monday my lords and it will be a very long day if all the points which are to be considered are given due attention <e> <s> i hope that the government will be arranging for an extension because these are the sorts of points which together with the guidance notes i am certain they will want to deal with at this seminar <e> <s> having put these points forward and heard the governments reply i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this appears to us to be a reasonable amendment <e> <s> i noted that the noble earl referred to the baa memorandum but from my reading the provision would apply to all airports <e> <s> the caa can take action following a request from the secretary of state on all airports not just those under the baa <e> <s> so far as i understand the amendment the caa will be limited to the furnishing of information the provision of assistance and the provision of advice <e> <s> it has no power itself to carry out any of the additional facilities that might be required <e> <s> we also note that the caa has the obligation to consult the airport operator before taking any steps <e> <s> that seems to us to be very reasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may briefly make a few comments <e> <s> first of all we have had useful debates and discussions on the bill but frankly it is a bill which in our view is completely unnecessary <e> <s> as we said at second reading we regard the baa as an efficient organisation <e> <s> it has carried out its duties and that has been stated even tonight and there is no indication at all that the local authorities whatever might be their political complexions have fallen down on the job at their airports <e> <s> there has been praise from the government side for developments that have taken place in various aspects of local authority airports <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord appreciate that this matter has many facets <e> <s> therefore perhaps he will forgive a third member of the opposition front bench asking a question <e> <s> my question has transport connections <e> <s> as a review concerning a second severn crossing is under consideration have the two groups been liaising <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had the advantage of hearing views based on great experience not least from my two noble friends who are elder brethren of trinity house <e> <s> i hope that they will not be too disappointed at the comments that i am going to make <e> <s> cannot claim to be experienced in this matter but i have been helped by the governments green paper and also by the report of the transport committee of another place to which no one has referred and the governments response to that report <e> <s> i have also read the two briefs kindly prepared by the british ports association and by trinity house for the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord appreciate what a great amenity this has been for the people of london over decades <e> <s> some of us are young enough to remember how excited we were when that great man george lansbury first had the idea of opening the lido for swimming <e> <s> can the noble lord tell me whether this is a recent event and whether it is a question of a shortage of money <e> <s> the earlier this great amenity is put back into public use the more pleased the people of london will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the answers which the noble lord has given but i do not think he answered part of my supplementary question <e> <s> how recent is it that this problem has come to light and were there any reasons why the problem was not tackled when it first arose because the lido had continued very successfully for quite a few decades <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble earl for repeating the statement which covers three very important points <e> <s> on the question of road haulage i am pleased to note that the transport minister negotiated successfully the continuation of united kingdom derogation for our <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to detain the house further but the noble earl listed the four points which he said will be taken in a package together to achieve liberalisation <e> <s> the one question to which he did not reply was whether or not the secretary of state or the transport minister kept in mind in the discussions the possible effect on the four points in the airports bill to which i referred and which seem to conflict with complete liberalisation <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the letter from the secretary of state to the caa which <e>", "<cs> will the noble earl confirm that there has been this six months delay <e> <s> he has not said whether or not that is the position <e> <s> if it is does he regard it as inefficient and will something be done about it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that he has not properly replied to the point raised by the noble lord lord diamond as to whether he has made a general criticism and condemnation of the management of housing by all local authorities <e> <s> have there been discussions with the local authority associations on that matter and if not will there be <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the consultation to which the noble earl refers i am extremely concerned about the regulations <e> <s> they increase the speed limit of vehicles towing a caravan from mph to mph on dual carriageways and motorways <e> <s> they amend the regulations <e> <s> what has happened to justify the increase in the speed limit especially bearing in mind that the regulations were based on the national speed survey <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down perhaps he could elucidate two points that he made <e> <s> he mentioned that the police say that this is a <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a little different to have a vehicle with a restricted width doing a lower speed than to have the same vehicle doing miles an hour and i cannot see the reasoning for this <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount appreciate what satisfaction his answer will give particularly to the motoring organisations <e> <s> however there are still two points which i should like the noble viscount to answer <e> <s> first why has there been this considerable delay <e> <s> i ask that because although my question refers to the regulations in actual fact the issue has arisen as a result of an amendment to the transport bill <e> <s> i was assured in a letter from the noble lord lord elton early in that the researches would be completed by july of that year <e> <s> in fact there was a home office presentation on the researches in that month <e> <s> subsequently in answer to an oral question from the noble earl lord kinnoull we were assured that the new devices would be approved and the order introduced by the end of <e> <s> why has there been this delay <e> <s> has it been caused by shortage of staff <e>", "<cs> my lords i noted that the noble baroness referred to the fact that the foreign secretary would put forward the british governments view <e> <s> will he also be emphasising the view of the community ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscounts answer is very encouraging indeed <e> <s> however how far is the problem also due to the amount of street parking that there is in particular in inner city areas because there is no room at all for hard standings in front of houses and because there is a complete absence of garages <e> <s> also is there an absence of local policing <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the first answer which the noble viscount gave is he aware that the national road maintenance survey showed that there had been a deterioration in the condition of trunk roads since and that the condition in was significantly worse than in and significantly worse than in when the national surveys first started <e> <s> is it not the case that the standing committee on highway maintenance complained of the shortage of finance for the maintenance of roads over the past five years and that in march two press notices from the department of transport stated that the minister concerned mr peter bottomley had said that the elimination of the problem could not take place until the early s <e> <s> is there not therefore a case for greater expenditure on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount for explaining this order because tracing through the previous order and the two acts the road traffic regulation act and the transport act is complicated <e> <s> i was becoming worried at one stage when the noble viscount was detailing the powers under the new fixed penalty schemes and referring to speeding offences <e> <s> i was glad that he made it clear at the end of his explanation that these do not apply to the duties of wardens and that in fact wardens have no extra duties except that they will now be able to issue fixed penalty notices <e> <s> that will be of great help in law enforcement relating to parking and other offences and will be complementary to the powers of the police <e> <s> therefore i am happy to welcome the order <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i am grateful this time to the noble earl for explaining what he rightly says would otherwise be a complicated order <e> <s> anything that extends noise certification to extra craft is to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords without the explanation that the house has just had from the noble earl this again would have been a very complicated order <e> <s> i am certain that i would not have understood it without that explanation <e> <s> as the standing committee on statutory instruments in the other place met at approved the order and rose at i shall act in the same way on this occasion <e> <s> i welcome the order <e>", "<cs> my lords does the answer of the secretary of state on the availability of land mean that he is ignoring the fact that there are great housing problems in the midlands the north and scotland <e> <s> a vast amount of infrastructure is required <e> <s> is he ignoring that factor <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl tell the house what advice ministers or the department have given to the select committee on this matter bearing in mind that on th april in reply to a question in this house the noble earl said that a rail link was not essential for the development of stansted <e> <s> has consideration been given to a facility for passengers and also to the possible overloading of the m and other roads <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the two points that the noble earl has mentioned as success stories in the report of the national bus company <e> <s> is he also aware that the report showed increased mileage increased productivity improved vehicle maintenance and the introduction of a number of innovations <e> <s> in the light of this most successful report of a progressive enterprise although it is appreciated that the transport act provides for the disposal of the national bus company why are the government insisting that there should be a break-up of the network into separate units including the destruction of some of the regional undertakings <e>", "<cs> my lords reference has been made to the chairmans preface <e> <s> will the noble earl take it that the only bad feature of the report is the preface of the comparatively new chairman which readily accepts the break-up of a successful national network <e> <s> will he also appreciate that i was not asking questions about tendering <e> <s> i was concerned with the break-up of a national network which everyone agrees has been successful into units because the government wish that to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord appreciate that while we are greatly concerned with the number of motorists who may be wrongly arrested we are also concerned with the staggering figure given in the other place in july that one-quarter of all the road fatalities are drink-related <e> <s> the noble lord may recall that during consideration of the transport bill we had considerable discussion on the relative balance between evidential breath testing accuracy and the proper need for enforcement <e> <s> is not the problem that of education publicity and enforcement <e> <s> have steps been taken recently to get together all the organisations concerned to review the position <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount realise that as much as i should like to take this opportunity to criticise some operations of lrt believing that the decision to transfer responsibility to it was wrong i appreciate the problems that exist <e> <s> for instances at liverpool street station the escalators have been out of operation for months because of the reconstruction work there and one has to go out into the open air in order to make a connection <e> <s> having said that since there are so many complaints about escalators breaking down i wonder whether there is any problem with regard to the saving of money shortage of staff or a lack of skilled personnel <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord appreciate that the question that has just been put by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is very important <e> <s> are the government the department and the caa satisfied with the present procedure in regard to the programme of inspection of airplanes generally <e> <s> or does the noble lord consider that there should be some review given to the regular inspections <e> <s> these cracks have come to light as a result of a number of recent incidents and if they had not come to light we might have had very severe difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl recall that what he has said is an echo of the reply that he gave me on th july <e> <s> whether nbc was disposed of wholly or in part would not all subsidised services have to go out to tender in any case under the provisions of the transport act <e> <s> also under the act were there not powers to dispose of nbc and for the secretary of state to direct that and yet until now nothing has happened <e> <s> was the decision deferred because until deregulation the company was so successful as a national entity that until it was broken up other operators would have found themselves unable to take over services <e>", "<cs> my lords were not the discussions on the bill on the disposal of the company generally and not about breaking it into separate pieces <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl appreciate that london regional transport has <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will recognise the need for this statement to be made and will appreciate the fact that the noble earl has given the statement <e> <s> i am sure the whole house will echo the ministers expressions of sympathy to the relatives of those who have died and to the large number who have suffered injury and will wish to give encouragement to those who are still injured and in hospital <e> <s> the seriousness of the figures show the importance of consideration of this item <e> <s> i am also pleased that the statement pays tribute to the work of the emergency services <e> <s> we have come to expect high service from the rescue services rail police and the fire service and it would appear that on this occasion they have come up to all our expectations <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his explanation of these regulations and the order <e> <s> although i have the greatest respect for the noble earl i wonder whether he has really covered all the points that arise <e> <s> i say that first because having attempted to read the four measures and then the four memoranda i feel that it must be agreed that the four memoranda tell us very little about these complex documents <e> <s> it might have been useful if somewhere there had been set out all the existing provisions regarding drivers hours rest periods duty hours breaks and so on what the changes are and what is left <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord but i was not drawing any conclusions whatsoever about it <e> <s> all i say is that some people have suffered injury if not fatality but generally speaking our coach journeys are thoroughly safe <e> <s> all i say is that one ought to look carefully at the report of that accident to see whether or not driver fatigue comes into it <e> <s> most of us have driven on motorways and i confess that it would not be the first time that i have suddenly woken up after being asleep for a second <e> <s> but that second is enough to send one in the wrong direction <e> <s> i think most noble lords will have suffered that experience <e>", "<cs> my lords the important point on flexibility was not to allow the drivers to get home and was not the question of the tour of duty which is hours <e> <s> it was the driving hours involved <e> <s> that is to be considered as well <e> <s> that is why we are prepared now to allow a certain amount of flexibility so long as there is proper enforcement and no abuse <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord the chairman of committees for enabling everyone to be extremely brief in their speeches <e> <s> i intervene from this dispatch box in an individual capacity to support the bill for a number of reasons <e> <s> first noble lords will recall that i was a member of the select committee which led to the formation of the docklands corporation <e> <s> this is part of the development of that work <e> <s> without the light railway the full development of the docklands corporation could not have taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that all four local authority associations and that includes the scottish convention welcomed the recommendations of the home review as a total package taking the rough with the smooth <e> <s> is he aware that by declining to support the recommendation regarding diversionary works and leaving the cost with local authorities he has endangered the joint support for the package proposed in the home review <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister a question relating to my last point <e> <s> will they also discuss again the type of joint body <e> <s> if the utilities group agree with the local authorities as to the type of body that should be set up why should the government throw that on one side <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the final report of the air travel reserve fund agency published as recently as only june this year commented that there were five failures in the previous months involving the large figure of holidaymakers <e> <s> is it also not a fact that the final report of that agency soundly criticised the caa which is the body which monitors these matters <e> <s> are the government thoroughly satisfied with the position and has the air transport users committee been consulted on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords although appreciating the answer which the noble lord the minister has just given and the general spirit of my noble friends supplementary question does the minister recall that yesterday we debated the responsibility of airline operators <e> <s> is it not important that there should now be discussions with the civil aviation authority to ensure that no airline operator cuts corners to reduce costs and perhaps imperils safety <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the decision announced by the noble viscount <e> <s> i note that the department of transports press notice of st october referred to the consultations and stated that some organisations which responded were heartily in favour but others were critical <e> <s> is it proposed to issue a report of the consultations or to place a copy in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords when this matter was raised on a previous occasion the house was assured by the minister that vehicles of diplomatic missions which were in dangerous positions could be towed away and figures were given <e> <s> could the noble baroness assure us that that is still the position <e> <s> further has she any figures available of the numbers towed away in the last months <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be permitted a third intervention from the front bench <e> <s> i intervene not as a member of the front bench but as one of the five members of your lordships house who were members of the select committee which recommended the formation of the london docklands corporation <e> <s> i hope that before this amendment is placed before your lordships the minister will read very carefully as i am sure he will the report of the select committee on the london docklands corporation <e> <s> there were special circumstances in london and the committee expressed the view that it would not lightly recommend a transfer of planning powers for a wide area to the secretary of state from democratically elected councils <e> <s> there were special circumstances in london which i hope will be taken into consideration along with the report of the debate in your lordships house when we discussed the select committee report <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly intervene on two points <e> <s> in its first words my noble friends amendment says <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my congratulations and best wishes to the noble lord on his new appointment <e> <s> i have also to apologise for the fact that my noble friend lord carmichael of kelvingrove who is well aware of the situation in glasgow is not yet present because he has been delayed by fog on a flight from glasgow <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i appreciate the ministers reply on the longer-term position is it not the case that the unions concerned including the officers union have said that the recent dispute in which men were sacked without the slightest notice and without any consultation is a disgraceful situation which we should not be facing today <e> <s> is it not also the case that this dispute has spread into other ports and could spread even further <e> <s> have not the government therefore a duty and responsibility to do something about it <e> <s> does it not confound all the statements that were made when we discussed the act which gave powers of disposal of the sealink operation to private interests <e>", "<cs> my lords it would seem from the ministers reply that the government are relying solely on the successful outcome of negotiations <e> <s> at what stage do the government think it essential to intervene to ensure the immediate future of our ferry services <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord appreciate that i welcome his statement right at the outset that it is rather too early to draw conclusions particularly as after the deregulation date of th october there will be a period of three months when no further registrations will be permitted <e> <s> is he aware <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister agree that the original decision to give launch aid for the first two aeroplanes was welcomed and has been thoroughly justified <e> <s> is it not a fact that the number of orders that have been placed for the a has been almost unparalleled and that therefore we <e>", "<cs> my lords there will undoubtedly be little problem with regard to newly manufactured vehicles but there may be difficulties with regard to older lorries which are still in service <e> <s> will the minister confirm that in the annual testing of heavy goods vehicles this will be one of the items that will be examined by the testing operatives <e> <s> further is he satisfied that there is adequate publicity given to this matter particularly as concerns those vehicles already in operation for which the measure will not come into effect until st october next year <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware of the press release of a speech made by the secretary of state for transport to the european parliament transport committee in which he spoke about the two meetings of the air transport committee to which the noble baroness referred <e> <s> the secretary of state also referred on two occasions in that speech to an informal meeting that he was having with ministers on rd october <e> <s> he intended to concentrate on aviation <e> <s> is it possible to say what happened at that informal meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount recall that when this matter was last raised on th june there was general pressure from all parts of the house that the helicopter service should be reinstated <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not seek to bring this issue down to a matter of party politics but is the noble baroness aware that many of us have had first-hand accounts of hospital wards being completely closed at weekends <e> <s> does she deny that that is the case <e> <s> when such reports are received at the department what action is taken <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount referred to the transport act <e> <s> is he aware that since passing that legislation parliament has passed the local government act <e> <s> section of that act prevents local authorities from publishing any material other than that relating to its own activities or the activities of other local authorities or other public bodies <e> <s> therefore that act supersedes the transport act <e> <s> if my facts are correct what do the government propose to do in order to enable local authorities to carry out the work the government believe they should he doing <e>", "<cs> my lords after all the speeches that have been made all of which are in support of the measure there is very little more to be said <e> <s> i echo the grateful thanks to the right reverend prelate for the excellent way in which he outlined all the details of this measure and its importance to the church <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government appreciate that the public were delighted that the games proceeded <e> <s> they were a good sporting spectacle <e> <s> will it not be harmful to the general atmosphere of the commonwealth if the government do not give some assistance <e>", "<cs> my lords did the minister say that the governments policy would be vindicated by events <e> <s> if so to what was he referring <e> <s> was he referring to the financial loss on the games or what <e> <s> it is the loss on the games and this countrys attitude about which we are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps at the outset i may express my most sincere appreciation for the <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i was not complaining so much about the speed but that there are consultation documents issued there is overwhelming objection and the government just ignores it <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister replied to the noble baroness with the names of the six countries which were in disagreement <e> <s> can he summarise very briefly the reasons for their disagreement <e>", "<cs> my lords would the government be prepared to review the rate of grants for the freight facilities to which the minister referred in his main answer <e> <s> secondly as transport by rail is profitable over miles will the government take a look at the possibility of having transhipment centres outside the main conurbations bearing in mind that at least in paris two have been established which are a great success commercially <e> <s> would that not relieve the situation and enable the speedy transfer of goods from rail to road in the conurbations <e>", "<cs> my lords i first thank the noble lord the minister for so clearly explaining the bill and also the government for issuing the <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am being corrected on that <e> <s> it was critical of certain aspects of the proposed transfer <e> <s> in that debate i also stressed the view of the opposition that it would not necessarily oppose the transfer of pilotage to harbour authorities but would want very carefully to see exactly what would be the proposals in the bill and exactly how matters would work out <e> <s> that still remains our view <e> <s> we have a very sympathetic attitude to the bill but there are certain points to some of which i will refer which can be dealt with fully in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble viscount for repeating the statement <e> <s> we heartily endorse what is said about the skill and bravery of the raf personnel in being able to save the whole crew of the kowloon bridge <e> <s> we all appreciate that <e>", "<cs> my lords this seems to be a very sensible and useful order <e> <s> it is a little unusual in so far as it does not refer to an approved type but to the name of a particular firm and contract <e> <s> there are two questions that i should like to ask the minister <e> <s> first can he give the house any information on the length of the contract with racal-decca marine navigation limited <e> <s> secondly what will be the position if in future there is an approved system <e> <s> would that require a new order <e> <s> what would be the situation then arising <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to understand from the ministers reply that no approaches have yet been made to the soviet authorities <e> <s> if not is it proposed to do this before the new routes commence <e>", "<cs> my lords there is widespread concern on this matter <e> <s> can the minister give the house some indication as to when the committee is to report <e> <s> are we likely to have legislation in this session <e> <s> if not is this not one important item which ought to be dealt with independently <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister surprised to know that we are a little dissatisfied with her answer <e> <s> as one who has had such medication i have been frequently advised by the doctor when making out the prescription and also warned by the dispenser at

chemists <e>", "<cs> my lords although the reply of the minister is encouraging so far as it goes there are as he says recommendations in the report <e> <s> can he inform the house how parliament may be informed of the governments view on all the recommendations <e> <s> would he not agree that it is unfortunate that the trade unions were not part of the working party <e> <s> the report finds <e>", "<cs> my lords the question which has just been asked is one that i was going to ask <e> <s> i note that in the reply to the noble baroness given by the noble viscount lord davidson on th december reference was made to the fact that seven states completely support the views of the government on cheaper fares and that only two are totally opposed <e> <s> surely the noble viscount knew the two countries then and surely the noble lord must know them now <e> <s> what are the two countries <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give an assurance that the various answers that he has given in no way change the governments view on bilateral or international agreements either in the community or elsewhere <e> <s> is there any likelihood of a policy of cheaper fares being included in the prospectus for the sale of british airways <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount not think it strange that in all the comments on the successful flotation celebrations there has been no mention whatever that the reason for this so-called successful flotation is the great success of the publicly-owned industry in the days before it was nationalised <e> <s> why has no comment been made that there was so much interest in the flotation because a successful public industry had already been built up <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble lord to clarify an important matter arising from the question and from his answer <e> <s> although it specifically refers to european air fares it also refers generally to proposals to improve competition <e> <s> will the minister clarify the position <e> <s> does the answer mean that any steps of regulation i use the word regulation in its wider sense dealing with aviation or airports which the united kingdom government may wish to embark upon could be affected by a majority decision <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that one of the latest bbc radio stations to be opened was radio essex <e> <s> is he also interested to know that in support of my noble friends supplementary question i was able to listen to radio essex quite a lot during the recent freeze and snow spell when essex suffered considerably <e> <s> information was given regarding travel conditions opening and closing of schools whether local events were on or off and there were offers of help from generous people who were prepared to help those who were stranded <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has referred to replies from nine of the airlines <e> <s> can he say in which way the british caledonian reply differed <e> <s> when the matter was last raised by the noble baroness on th january he said he would write to her <e> <s> can he tell the house in which way the british caledonian reply differed from the other nine <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recognise that we also welcome the debate that is to take place on wednesday and the opportunity to answer some of the charges that have been made <e> <s> does not the audit commission report refer to certain boroughs <e> <s> therefore is it not amazing that the minister has not been given the information about the two residuary bodies for which my noble friend lady david asked <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that the noble lord lord mayhew will excuse me if i do not follow him along the path of proportional representation <e> <s> we have debated that before and i am prepared to debate it again on the right occasion but frankly not tonight <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and i hope the noble lord will not draw me into it now because he might regret having done so <e> <s> the noble lord lord skelmersdale said that local government is tarnished by a small minority <e> <s> without that qualification frankly he would have been in danger and this debate would have been in danger of giving serious offence to thousands of labour councillors up and down this country who are providing what they think is the best service possible for their communities <e> <s> my noble friend lady david made clear the points on which we dissociate ourselves as an opposition from certain events <e>", "<cs> the noble lord referred to the creeping corruption of the labour party <e> <s> i shall deal with the position of the so-called left of the labour party very shortly <e> <s> what we must be careful about is not to encourage a denigration of local government and the integrity of councillors <e> <s> the noble lord lord bellwin asked us not to belittle local government <e> <s> that is one thing we are in danger of doing in this debate <e> <s> the actions of some local authorities i may disagree with <e> <s> but if one got the whole chapter of their local government work one might get a different picture <e> <s> we might find that in many of their services they are good and progressive <e> <s> indeed they might be better than other areas <e> <s> that has been stressed by a number of speakers <e> <s> at the end of the day the public will decide by the ballot box what they want <e> <s> i am sorry that there should be any member of your lordships house who would imply by his or her speech the denigration of the use of the ballot box <e> <s> i hope we shall never get to the situation where we believe that we can solve these problems by putting in commissioners <e>", "<cs> my lords i am referring to the report of the audit commission <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to criticise the commission for making this comment that is a matter for him <e>", "<cs> my lords provided that the house will give me a few more minutes in which to speak yes i will <e> <s> i am referring to paragraph of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the government have undertaken that they will not increase stansted beyond million passengers per annum up to a possible million without parliamentary action on the matter and that the runway at stansted could regrettably take million passengers per annum <e> <s> before any additional runway capacity is provided in the south-east can the minister assure the house that the widest consultation and consideration will be given to airports elsewhere in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for outlining this order <e> <s> there are only two questions i should like to ask the noble lord <e> <s> any order which carries out international obligations particularly of this kind would naturally receive the support of the opposition <e> <s> reference is made to the reporting of incidents or the threat of possible incidents that might involve pollution <e> <s> to whom will the reporting be made <e> <s> i have particularly in mind countries across the channel and ireland <e> <s> will some arrangement be made whereby both countries will be informed <e>", "<cs> my lords in his replies the noble earl has referred only to the university grants committee and the university of birminghams review <e> <s> do the government intend to lay down their own views on the necessity for this for transportation needs <e>", "<cs> my lords as with others who have taken part in this second reading debate i appreciate the very clear manner in which the noble baroness lady hooper introduced the bill <e> <s> at the risk of being thought chauvinistic may i say that her manner was gentle and disarming <e> <s> and that i believe was vitally necessary when one recalls that in last wednedays debate on the inner cities the noble lord lord skelmersdale referred to outrageous local authorities <e> <s> today we are dealing with an outrageous bill an outrageous piece of legislation brought forward by this government <e> <s> as my noble friend lady david has made perfectly clear echoed by others we recognise the need to clarify the law and to make certain it is as it was thought to be <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to assist the noble lord i believe that he referred to the end of december <e> <s> surely he must have meant october since the second reading debate was th january <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the contribution of the airbus in helping to develop the success of british aerospace will the government give an assurance that any aid that is required for future development of the airbus will continue to be given as it has in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make one or two introductory remarks <e> <s> it will be noted that there are a number of amendments down in my name and in the name of my noble friend lord carmichael of kelvingrove <e> <s> i hope that the house will accept my assurance that these are in no way party political amendments <e> <s> i have been advised on these matters by the pilots organisation who are seeking fair and equitable treatment under the new scheme <e> <s> although the bill is very controversial it is not politically controversial <e> <s> i hope that the house will clearly understand that point because with the number of names which appear on the amendment there may be the impression that these are party political matters <e> <s> party politics does not enter into these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to intervene in this matter only because the grouping is said to be for amendments nos <e> <s> to <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> stands in my name and that of my noble friend and in that amendment we are urging that an authorisation should remain in force for a period of not less than one year <e> <s> this matter was considered at the committee stage and there was a very wide measure of support for it <e> <s> under the bill a pilotage exemption certificate may be granted to a master or a first mate <e> <s> clause provides that such a certificate shall remain in force for one year and may be renewed annually subject to certain conditions in carrying out the pilots duties <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i can see that that is a problem <e> <s> perhaps the minister would be prepared to accept the period of one year <e> <s> i agree that automatic renewal presents certain problems <e> <s> we have said that it should be renewed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister giving a categoric assurance that clause the arbitration clause will cover the question of a minimum period for the first authorisation <e> <s> if that is the case and it will be written into the record i shall be happy <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house in the light of what the minister said and we shall read carefully what he said and of any debate <e>", "<cs> my lords it may help the minister if i tell him that i have amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords unfortunately the minister is correct <e> <s> this shows the difficulty of hasty grouping <e> <s> i would have referred to the position of the pension fund because it is a vital issue affecting the pilots <e> <s> we shall now have to see how we can bring that in at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may also support the principle of the amendment and what the noble lord lord mottistone has said <e> <s> it may well be that in the negotiations locally the question of hours and other matters of work conditions will be discussed but what is important is that the negotiations will be on a local basis between a port authority and the pilots in that area <e> <s> national negotiations are going by the board <e> <s> the pilots have declared their full support for a scheme or reorganisation as the bill proposes <e> <s> having declared their support and having had on at least three or four occasions assurances from ministers and from the prime minister that they will be given fair and equitable treatment if negotiations on earnings are to be left to local negotiations the pilots are frightened that some of them could find themselves in an adverse position <e> <s> that is why they are endeavouring to lay down in the amendment moved by the noble lord lord srathcona some guarantee that their earnings will not be less than is at present provided on a negotiated basis <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will permit me leaving out a refers to a which <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know that the minister has really offered an alternative <e> <s> he has referred to quidelines <e> <s> but is it not a fact that associated british ports have broken away from the british ports association <e> <s> if that is the case then where stands any agreement that may be reached by the bpa <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down if he believes that this is something that ought to be in the guidelines and if he believes that therefore the arbitration machinery to be set up should take cognisance of the guidelines why is there hesitancy to write this into the legislation so that there is not the slightest doubt whatever as to what the government and the country want <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i raise one point <e> <s> when we come to the arbitration clause surely this only takes effect for three years and then it will be out <e> <s> what is going to be the position on the point which the noble lord lord swinfen raised with regard to pilots who will be covered by the particular amendment he has moved after the arbitration clause has ceased to take effect <e> <s> that is the important part of the amendment of the noble lord lord swinfen <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord lord mottistone replies to the points that have been made will he indicate whether he believes that this provision should apply to any person on the committee with shipping interests <e> <s> it seems a little unfair to say that because the clause deals with pilots we will debar pilots in the way suggested by the noble lord <e> <s> there could easily be shipping interests on the committee <e> <s> does he propose on third reading to come forward with an amendment to deal with those <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the explanation that we have just been given is one which <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for agreeing to have a careful look at this matter <e> <s> it may be that i am showing how little i know about some of these matters <e> <s> i was given the impression that when we were discussing a subsection in the bill which has been replaced by subsection of this new clause that there would still be an option as to whether the pilots wished to be employed or self-employed and then the cha would decide accordingly <e> <s> i think that i heard the minister say now that the cha will decide which system it has <e> <s> surely there is the opportunity for the members to say which system they want <e> <s> i hope that the minister will consider this matter and also the point raised under my amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> on that basis i beg to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the point just made by the noble viscount lord simon <e> <s> i had amendments down to other clauses of the bill dealing with the pilots benefit fund which quite rightly were ruled out because those clauses were deleted and i was not able to move the amendments but the principle still stands <e> <s> if i had known that the other clauses were going to be ruled out i should have had an amendment to this particular amendment of the government which i do not think we saw until a few days ago <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord permit me to intervene <e> <s> i did not put down an amendment to that amendment because i had amendments covering this point in other amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support amendment no <e> <s> standing in the name of the noble lord lord strathcona but also to speak to the governments new clause <e>", "<cs> but have they agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords i passed my general remarks on the amendment because i thought we were dealing with the whole grouping <e> <s> but may i make two additional remarks before the minister replies <e> <s> first i am certain that if we had had this new clause at the committee stage there would have been very detailed consideration given to every single subsection <e> <s> most noble lords who were interested in the committee stage will recognise that this question of arbitration of appeals and of machinery for representation is one of the keystones to the whole of the pilotage bill <e> <s> that is why it is so essential that we should get it right <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no intention of asking the house to vote on these amendments <e> <s> as the noble lord has said they were discussed at the committee stage <e> <s> however we felt that they were so important that they should be brought before the full house at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed with the ministers reply <e> <s> i make it quite clear that this amendment has not been prompted by any particular interests except those of the pilots <e> <s> it is the pilots who are urging that there should be consultation with other persons who appear to have a substantial interest <e> <s> it is not any conservation group or other group of that kind it is not any group of local authorities <e> <s> it is the pilots who believe that it is desirable in the general interest that this should be agreed to <e> <s> but in the light of what the minister said and at this late hour i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have supported this amendment if i could have been assured that the notice was to be given in a public manner and had the house agreed to my previous amendment so that when the notice was given in a public manner those bodies with a substantial interest could have done something about it <e> <s> but it is a step in the right direction <e> <s> i regret only that the other provisions which i have mentioned have not been taken up <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down could he say whether the statement made by the noble lord lord swinfen is correct that if a notice is <e>", "<cs> my lords they are the ones to be consulted <e> <s> the subsection refers to the bodies that he shall consult <e> <s> it makes no reference to the bodies which may make representations <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister of course has had excellent advice from his department but some points still need to be made <e> <s> first there was general welcome for amendment no <e> <s> to clause but that related to the provision of pilotage services proposing that they should take account of hazardous cargoes <e> <s> there was pressure in committee <e> <s> here we <e>", "<cs> i asked that question because there was emphasis on costs in the answer of the minister <e> <s> from our standpoint this strengthens the position of authorised pilots <e> <s> it ensures that those granted exemption certificates the master or chief mate shall be in exactly the same position as authorised pilots <e> <s> i am sorry that the minister cannot agree <e> <s> the noble lord lord swinfen accepted that we are dealing here with exemption certificates and not services <e>", "<cs> my lords i must oppose the amendments tabled by the noble lord lord mottistone as i am advised that these amendments will restrict a chas ability to charge pilotage exemption certificate holders so as to recover costs incurred for the winding up of the present pilotage organisation <e> <s> they will not be able to make charges in order to recover some of the costs of an ongoing pilotage operation from which the pilotage exemption certificate holders benefit <e> <s> that is a very important point <e> <s> we shall find that there will be discrimination against those ships using the services of a pilot and in that respect the proper management of a pilotage service will be inhibited <e> <s> i have been advised on these matters and my advice seems to be completely contrary to the views whether advised or otherwise that the noble lord lord mottistone expressed <e> <s> i hope that the minister will agree with my objection <e>", "<cs> my lords i tried to be brief when i moved the amendment <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord swinfen for further explaining it <e> <s> in clause four categories are mentioned where there might be joint arrangements <e> <s> after detailing the four categories the clause states <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say whether or not any schemes put forward by british rail have been rejected and whether or not any schemes are still awaiting approval <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first express thanks to the minister for so briefly outlining the provisions of the bill and say that it is not my intention to deal in detail with the various clauses of the bill <e> <s> first of all they are too many and also too complex but this is a very important debate as the minister has said <e> <s> it has attracted some speakers and three peers who will be making their maiden speeches <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i share the appreciation expressed by the noble lord lord elliott regarding the development of a capital nature which has taken place <e> <s> can the government give an assurance that under the new local authority airport company scheme they will continue to look sympathetically at any requests for capital development which might be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no desire to hinder the progress of the important debate that is taking place but the second paragraph of the statement said that work on parts of the local government bill was running late <e> <s> the reason given was that this was due to the time taken to prepare the local government finance bill <e> <s> is it not a fact that the opposition in the other place had offered full cooperation for the local government finance bill if it was used merely to make the law what everybody thought it was and that the government have got into this mess because they have made the local government finance bill far wider than was the original intention <e>", "<cs> i was going to say the same as my noble friend lord dean <e> <s> i am sorry to have to cross swords with my old antagonist the noble lord lord bellwin <e> <s> he and i cut our teeth on either side of the dispatch box way back in and we have regarded ourselves as bosom friends since then <e>", "<cs> for the benefit of the committee it is best that the noble lord is here rather than staying in leeds <e>", "<cs> if i may raise a small point i believe that the noble baroness referred to something which had already been done <e> <s> however i believe she also said that a local authority could not take advantage of the position because it would be out of time <e> <s> if that is so why is there anything at all in subsection relating to the year beginning and the year beginning when according to the minister no action can now be taken by local authorities irrespective of the act <e>", "<cs> i bow to legal opinion on this <e> <s> however if such a matter is not likely to arise or connot arise in the future why do we have subsection at all <e>", "<cs> therefore does the noble baroness agree that if a court allowed a case to be heard in exceptional circumstances that part of the amendment specifying that the secretary of state should have acted reasonably could take effect and therefore the amendments would be in order <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in contrast to his noble friend lady lane-fox i travel each day through a rate-capped borough where the roads have very bad potholes and shocking surfaces due to the recent cold spell <e> <s> has he any indication that local authorities with these problems have the necessary finance to cope with them <e> <s> simply filling in a pothole is not good enough the pothole will reappear within a few days <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend in her group of amendments <e> <s> in her concluding remarks she said that the amendments propose a practical compromise <e> <s> it may be recalled that on second reading i drew attention in particular to the effect that the procedure in the bill would have on the new joint passenger transport authorities <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord kilmarnock that we shall go in detail into the various formulae on the next batch of amendments <e>", "<cs> i am certain i said that yesterday it decided on its precept <e> <s> i ask the minister what he suggests tyne and wear should now do because it may have acted quickly <e> <s> i do not know whether it sent out the figure last night but it does not matter whether it did <e> <s> it met yesterday and decided on its precept based on the previous information supplied by the government <e>", "<cs> again i am sorry to interrupt the minister <e> <s> of course that can be done but in the meantime somebody has to work on new figures based on the corrections that have been sent out <e> <s> there is a cost involved for the tyne and wear authority and its representatives in so doing <e>", "<cs> i should first like to thank the minister for giving a far better reply than that given in the other place <e> <s> i turned up there before the debate started on similar criticisms of the formulae and frankly the reply was disgraceful in that it hardly referred to any of the points raised <e> <s> there had been a wide debate dealing with particular authorities and also with joint authorities <e>", "<cs> i thought that my hopes might be a bit too high but i still hope that at the end of the debate the minister will see the common sense of the amendments <e> <s> they are designed to provide designated authorities with an alternative factor rv rateable value in each formula in schedule <e>", "<cs> it is rather strange that we hear this word uncertainty again because as i said in my opening remarks in previous years maximum rates have been determined with reference to a penny rate either the authorities own estimates or those of the secretary of state <e> <s> yet the minister has declined to accept this amendment because it would require an estimate <e> <s> i am informed that it is the estimate either of the secretary of state or of the authority which has been used before in fixing maximum rates <e>", "<cs> we have heard some amazing answers from government ministers but to me this is the most incredible <e> <s> i have in front of me the <e>", "<cs> my lords although the information given by the minister is encouraging i wonder whether he recalls that we had a debate on a civic trust report dealing with the armitage package three years ago and at that time some villages and towns had not been bypassed <e> <s> it was said that hundreds would not have a bypass plan by and nor would one-third of the historic towns <e> <s> has the minister figures to show whether there has been a great improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in the cases i referred to there was heavy lorry traffic <e> <s> some of the roads were trunk roads and some were not but there was heavy lorry traffic <e> <s> does he think that the ministry could get some figures and possibly write to me <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for the explanation he gave of this bill and the justification for it <e> <s> i must be among the minority of noble lords who have taken part in this debate who have no direct interest in lyndhurst or the new forest <e> <s> my interest in speaking <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i hope that the government will reconsider their decision to make these amendments <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is designed to accommodate the wishes of the port of london that watermen who may or may not be sufficiently qualified to serve as authorised pilots will be able to navigate vessels <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to be disagreeable and again raise a question on the government amendment but after all the purpose of our debates is to find out why the government are doing certain things and to criticise them <e> <s> on the face of it it would appear that the government are removing a provision that is important in the context of ensuring efficient and cost-effective pilotage services <e> <s> the removal of this subsection could result for example in a master when on a deadline to make the time at the next port preventing the pilot from slowing down the vessel sufficiently for him to disembark or over-carrying the pilot for whatever reason thus losing for that period of time his services to the port for which he is authorised <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down perhaps i may also express appreciation for the arrangements being made with regard to trinity house <e> <s> i ought to say that as a result of the words at the end of amendment no <e> <s> a i shall be looking very carefully at what was said on a previous occasion when we pressed for proper funding of the pilots national pension fund which we want to ensure is properly funded <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like the minister to clarify a view which i hold and which the pilots organisation seems also to hold <e> <s> it appears that there is a very strange suggestion here <e> <s> is the amendment proposing that a pilotage authority instead of vesting its property in a cha or the pilotage commission may retain its own property but pay compensation to the relevant cha or to the commission <e> <s> if that is the position then surely that is like paying for someone not confiscating ones property <e>", "<cs> my lords what the minister has said seems to be satisfactory up to a point <e> <s> however under subsection the pilotage commission is given responsibility for submitting to the secretary of state proposals for schemes for the transfer of property rights and liabilities of pilotage authorities and arrangements also for the transfer of their staff <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister <e> <s> i take it that if i am right we shall have an amendment at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words about this matter because i am rather disappointed that the minister has repeated a statement he made at committee stage <e> <s> the commission is given certain responsibilities it is given responsibility under the clause a to give the secretary of state such advice as he may request and it is given responsibility under clause regarding <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed naturally with the ministers reply although as the noble lord lord strathcona said there is a certain amount of encouragement in his words which we might follow up on further amendments <e> <s> there are amendments later on dealing with the management of the fund and the composition of the management of the fund <e> <s> this should be kept in mind when we reach those amendments as also should the remarks which have just been made <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that he had spoken on this matter in connection with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that was a long time ago <e> <s> i believe we said that where there were long groupings and it came to a particular item it would be possible to say a few words on a specific amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for accepting amendment no <e> <s> a in principle and i look forward to the amendment at the next stage <e> <s> in the light of what the minister has said on the governments own amendment no <e> <s> and my amendment to that i shall look very carefully at what the minister has said <e> <s> it sounds very reasonable if i might put it that way <e> <s> as he has said that he has not had a chance to look carefully at amendment no <e> <s> a although he accepts it in principle similarly i have not had an opportunity to look thoroughly at amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i think we all accept the position and on the basis of the noble lords remarks i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the standing advisory committee on trunk road assessment issued a report last autumn on urban road appraisal which was critical of the cost assessment analysis for determining the grant and also of what was alleged to be a bias against urban areas <e> <s> have the government considered that report and other recommendations and when will they be published <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his original answer was in full accord with the answer given by the noble lord lord beaverbrook on th february <e> <s> is there not some urgency for the government decision <e> <s> they have had this request from british aerospace since october <e> <s> an announcement will soon require to be made to british aerospace in conjuction with its european partners <e> <s> did not the government have the same apprehension perhaps rightly so about the launch aid for the a which has proved to be one of the biggest successes of british aircraft <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may just add a word in support of my noble friend <e> <s> she referred to three letters including one from the tyne and wear fire and civil defence authority <e> <s> i have the original letter here and it will be recalled that i raised the position of that authority when we met in committee on the th february <e> <s> on that occasion the minister referred and has repeatedly referred on other occasions to the need for certainty and to the need to remove uncertainty <e> <s> as my noble friend has revealed we now have evidence which shows that there is even more uncertainty for a number of local authorities <e> <s> although the minister when i raised this matter tended to brush it off as only affectingp in the pound the fact is that it involved members meeting again and giving up time in order to have a further meeting to set the revised precept in tyne and wear <e>", "<cs> my lords i raised today the question of tyne and wear police authority <e>", "<cs> i did last time <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister will feel able to accept this amendment which has been so well explained by the noble lord lord swinfen <e> <s> the amendment does not go as far as we would like it to go but i think that the points he raised are very sound particularly as he is dealing with persons whose authorisation is suspended or revoked under paragraphs c and d <e> <s> it has nothing to do with misconduct or anything of that kind but is purely owing to the numbers being in excess of requirements <e> <s> i hope that the minister will find it possible to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am also grateful to the minister for accepting amendment no <e> <s> because it helps to simplify the position <e> <s> we are now in a situation where even i can understand the position <e> <s> by reading subsection and the governments amendment no <e> <s> which amends subsection i think that we have a clearer understanding of the matter <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for meeting us in that way <e> <s> having listened to his remarks i am certain that when the bill is printed it will assist those in the other house to understand the situation more clearly and i believe that that is one of our primary purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i follow the minister <e> <s> i assume that with the acceptance of amendment no <e> <s> we are tied to the position of subsection which gave the pilots the opportunity to make a decision <e> <s> i assume that the ministers amendment to subsection must be considered with subsection <e> <s> therefore the pilots have the opportunity of deciding the form of employment that they prefer <e> <s> will the minister say whether that is the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall first deal with the remarks of the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> it was at the committee stage that there was general pressure because there was no machinery laid down giving the opportunity for representations to be made by pilots who felt that problems might arise which were not covered within the bill <e> <s> that was the first problem therefore we had the governments amendments at report stage <e> <s> now is the chance for us to amend the governments amendments <e> <s> that is the proper machinery of this house <e> <s> that is why the amendments have been put down <e> <s> much of the responsibility must rest with the government because they knew they wanted the reorganisation <e> <s> they considered the reorganisation and the results of the consultative document but the last thing they thought about was arbitration machinery <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the minister said that the arguments used in the previous stage were rather far-fetched and exaggerated <e> <s> if statements of that kind result in the minister acting in this way we shall all be very happy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy about the research work that the minister has undertaken and i am delighted to have his assurance <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i said at the outset that my amendment might not be worded correctly <e> <s> instead of the cha i should have referred to some other body <e> <s> as i said in my opening remarks the body responsible for issuing deep sea pilotage certificates might decide not to reissue a certificate <e> <s> as the noble lord lord swinfen said an individual would then lose what is a valuable asset <e> <s> i cannot tell the house the difference in income between someone who holds a deep sea pilotage certificate and someone who does not but i should imagine that it is worthwhile having <e> <s> if a man has to surrender the certificate there should be a compensation scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his kind references to me <e> <s> on one point we are unanimous as the minister said the bill leaves this house a better bill than when it first came to us <e> <s> as he rightly said it was thought to be non-controversial but it has proved to be a very controversial bill <e> <s> i have my views on whether it was sensible to send it to a separate committee <e> <s> we have all reported our views about that and perhaps i should say only that i am not too happy about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that the whole house will appreciate that the minister has repeated a statement on a very tragic occurrence which has shocked the entire nation <e> <s> i find it difficult to put into words sympathy for those who have suffered bereavement and for families who do not know what has happened to those who are missing <e> <s> at the same time we wish to place on record our appreciation of many of the reports of courage shown by passengers <e>", "<cs> my lords has not the emphasis in the published reports of the sittings of our select committe been on questions of safety and rabies <e> <s> the select committee has already had expert evidence on rabies <e> <s> is it not also a fact that we can return to these issues when the matter comes before the house in the form of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add a few words in support of my noble friends amendment <e> <s> i hope that when the minister replies he will be able to deal with the three points on which my noble friend asked for definite replies from the minister and <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mackie of benshie started his speech by commiserating with the minister on having to reply to a number of devastating speeches that have been made against the bill <e> <s> it must be agreed that my noble friend lord ross made a devastating speech <e> <s> that was followed by a large number of strongly critical speeches <e> <s> i declare my own interest as a resident and ratepayer of england <e> <s> i do not want to see this bill repeated in england and wales <e> <s> in fact in the interests of the scottish people i should like to see the government abandon it <e> <s> if that cannot be done then the house will at least do the best it can to mitigate the more serious parts of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords as in a previous debate when we were discussing the question of the compilation of registers we obviously cannot let this order pass on the nod <e> <s> i am happy to say that having read both the order and the boundary commission report and having heard what the minister has said i am happy to ask the house to support the order <e> <s> as the minister rightly said all the changes are due to local government action <e> <s> in one case there were two objections from two labour parties which were subsequently withdrawn <e> <s> therefore there remain no objections whatever to the order <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord marshall of leeds and congratulate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the minister recognises that many of us appreciate the review that the government are undertaking <e> <s> however will he also recognise that there is considerable concern at the massive numbers of fatalities and injuries suffered by motor cyclists <e> <s> can he say whether as a result of the two-part test there has been any decrease in fatalities and injuries <e>", "<cs> my lords we appreciate the work that is being carried out by rospa <e> <s> can the minister say whether there has been a reduction in the number of motor cyclists taking the training compared with the old scheme which was run by the royal automobile club <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister seen reports today of a statement by sebastian coe speaking as vice-chairman of the sports council in which he contrasted the poor membership of british sports clubs with that of clubs in the netherlands and germany in particular <e> <s> do the government have any ideas about getting into touch with local authorities where appropriate to ensure that professional football grounds and local authorities work together in the interests of developing sports activities for the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that the house will be grateful to the minister for explaining <e>", "<cs> may i as an english peer intervene <e> <s> far from being a wrecking amendment surely this is trying to be fair to the people of scotland and frankly also to the people of england and wales <e> <s> i do not want to make a second reading speech again but i remind the committee that there is no electoral mandate for this bill <e> <s> it was not in the electoral address for the last election <e> <s> of course if we are promised that should this bill go through and receive the royal assent another government of the same persuasion if that were the outcome of the election intended to introduce a bill for england and wales then we know where we are <e> <s> but at the moment there is no possible mandate at all <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will permit me perhaps he would cast his mind back to a number of occasions when he has claimed that there is an electoral mandate for certain items of legislation which he has supported <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister appreciate that his reply is extremely disconcerting <e> <s> the reports that have been published indicate that it is not just a problem for norwegian shipping the proposal will attract shipping throughout the world <e> <s> the hope is to attract associated shipping services away from london to oslo <e> <s> that could have a very severe effect upon our associated services <e> <s> surely this is a case not merely for discussion with the norwegian government but also with the council of transport ministers all of whose countries will be affected <e> <s> this is a further terrible advance for flags of convenience with lower costs and lower wages for crews <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister seen the report in the <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall as one of the important persons who attended a symposium at greenwich in october under the auspices of the national maritime museum when the noble lord lord chalfont was also present that the <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not the third occasion on which there has been a question in your lordships house when the government have replied that they are still considering the matter <e> <s> on the last occasion did the minister not agree that sales of the a had been unparalleled and that it had been a great success for this country <e> <s> is not time now running out and should not an urgent decision be made by the government in order that we can be a participant in this european venture instead of just being a contractor <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the minister agreed on the last occasion that although we use the term launch aid it is in effect a loan and the moneys will be repayable <e> <s> is it not also a fact that there has been one delay in airbus industrie being able to announce that it is definitely going to launch these two programmes partly because the united kingdoms decision is awaited <e> <s> therefore is it not an urgent matter for airbus industrie as well as for british aerospace and its workers <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord appreciate that we recognise the importance of the answer he has given to the noble lord lord campbell of croy <e> <s> in regard to the legislation he said that it will be brought forward as soon as possible <e> <s> can he give an indication of how soon that will be because in the meantime terrible damage could be done to our fishing fleets <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend lord ross tell us what he proposes to do with his amendment in the light of what the minister has said although it may not be wise for some noble lords i think reference ought to be made to the english newspaper the <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that i understand that the larger fishing vessels are to be included in a new regulation <e> <s> however if that is to be the case the larger pleasure vessels should also be included <e> <s> to my knowledge there has been no statement from the government to that effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his reply because it will be valuable to have his statement on record <e> <s> it would be wrong to abuse your lordships house by giving a detailed response to what he has said but in the light of just one or two points that have been made i think i must make some comments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord has made that quite clear <e> <s> only this morning i had a letter from the deputy master of trinity house giving its answer to certain points put by the general council of british shipping <e> <s> i deliberately cut out of my speech any points which might cause an argument between the general council and trinity house <e> <s> i wished to avoid that because i think most of us appreciate the work that is done by trinity house <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to british rail being in competition with air and coach travel <e> <s> is it not a fact that the commission payable by airline and coach companies is now far more than british rail will be offering <e> <s> does he agree as my noble friend suggested that they have a responsibility to the public that the amount of money generated by british rail through abta agencies is about million that a good proportion of first-class travel is sold and that therefore it is not just a question of helping british rail <e> <s> it is a question of helping the travelling public who by this policy may be denied some of the outlets from which they can purchase tickets <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to some small hospitals as being inefficient <e> <s> perhaps he will reconsider that statement <e> <s> there may be criticism on grounds of cost-effectiveness <e> <s> however some of us who have used small hospitals resent the use of the word inefficient <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble baroness i have no wish to delay the house over this bill but i hope that your lordships will give it their full support <e> <s> noble lords will recall that i too was a little critical about the type of development at stansted but since the development envisages dealing with million passengers per annum a rail link is absolutely essential <e>", "<cs> my lords do we understand from the ministers reply to the supplementary question that one should disregard existing polls and that whenever the general election comes the public will not necessarily reflect them but might favour the labour opposition <e>", "<cs> my lords while the information given by the minister on the number of destinations is most encouraging he does not appear to have replied to the question put by his noble friend lord gainsford <e> <s> the government say they wish to encourage the use of regional airports but that appears to be an attitude of hope <e> <s> what positive policy are the government following in order to encourage the use of regional airports for charter flights and to enter into discussions not only with airport operators but also with the airlines <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for carrying out the undertaking that he gave at an earlier stage <e> <s> would he confirm that amendment no <e> <s> not only provides for written notice but also as i read it for the opportunity for representations to be made <e> <s> this seems rather an important point and when i read the amendment i thought that was the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord swinfen has made a good case <e> <s> i am certain that the minister will take it into consideration when he replies <e> <s> the amendment adds a further category to the joint arrangements <e> <s> i regret that there is still no provision to ensure that information will be sought from all the authorities as we wanted when <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for explaining these amendments <e> <s> frankly when i looked at the record of the other place i found that no debate had taken place <e> <s> there was not even an explanation from the minister <e> <s> the various amendments were moved and that was an end of the matter <e> <s> i am grateful that the minister has given us that explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for explaining the order and i recognise that the government have adhered to their undertaking to have an atm limit at stansted <e> <s> however i question whether the proposed limit of is a proper one to have put forward at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a sensible order which we approve <e> <s> i assume that it has been subject to the usual consultation with the other political parties <e> <s> it might be of interest to your lordships to know that as i notice there is a reference to increased expenses for parliamentary elections it reminded me that early this year i received an appeal to subscribe to the funds of the constituency parties for the conservative partys general election expenses and to join in a campaign to get a capital fund going in order to build up the conservative fighting fund <e> <s> the letter was from an investment trust the chairman and chief executive and it said that no doubt we shared the same views in the same circumstances etc <e> <s> i should like to inform the house that this in no way implies that i failed in my duties as deputy leader of the opposition and i am looking forward on th june to the best possible golden wedding present of a labour victory <e>", "<cs> my lords in following the noble lord lord strathcarron i cannot claim the motor cycling experience that he has <e> <s> in fact in the long distant days when i was young and active my preference was to belong to a pedal cycling club <e> <s> the noble lord lord strathcarron has put forward sound reasons for supporting my noble friend in bringing this bill forward <e> <s> i congratulate and thank my noble friend and also mr robert adley in the other place who sponsored the bill originally <e> <s> my noble friend lady nicol reminded me that there is one aspect of pollution which was not mentioned in the last two-and-a-half hour debate and that was noise pollution which is what this bill seeks to eradicate in one respect <e>", "<cs> my lords if british airways considers that such an offer is commercially good for it because in effect it reduces fares does the minister agree that that is an excellent example for ba to set for reducing fares in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the minister for repeating the statement given in another place <e> <s> i am particularly pleased to note the last few words of the statement where the minister praises <e>", "<cs> my lords everyone will agree that the noble lord lord belstead to whom welcome has been given by a number of speakers and which i echo will have an immense task in replying to the numerous points raised in the speeches in this very long debate <e> <s> he will be involved in a large number of the bills which we understand will be arising as a result of the gracious speech <e> <s> although we welcome him to his new position and know that he will do his best to steer the legislation through we can guarantee that the bills dealing with local government will be fiercely fought on this side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that the whole house regrets that this package has not turned out in the way that all of us would have expected and that we appreciate the efforts that the government are making <e> <s> but will he agree that this may now be something which is beyond the transport ministers and that the foreign secretary might be brought into this discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that the house would consider it remiss if a view was not expressed from the official opposition <e> <s> i agree completely with the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale that my noble friend has performed a useful task in drawing attention to some important factors that i am certain we will consider when we proceed with the bill <e>", "<cs> i very much regret that on this one occasion i cannot see eye to eye with my noble friend lord tordoff <e> <s> i say my noble friend lord tordoff because he and i usually look upon transport matters with somewhat the same view <e> <s> his series of <e>", "<cs> i have a question to ask the minister on the matter of clause stand part <e> <s> there are subsequent clauses in the bill which refer to various works and also to the establishment of a safety authority <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene before the noble lord lord northbourne indicates what he proposes to do <e> <s> in the transport bill the government insisted that local public transport companies should not engage in anything which could be termed to be against competition <e> <s> during the debates on the airports bill there was considerable discussion about predatory pricing in connection with stansted <e> <s> why should the government now take a different view on this point <e> <s> if the government do not like the wording of the amendment they ought to say that they agree <e>", "<cs> i am pleased that the noble lord lord tordoff moved the amendment in the temperate and considerate way that he did <e> <s> my immediate reaction is that it is something for which we should press and support <e> <s> it would be foolish of me to say that i have read every word of our select committees report <e> <s> i have turned over every page <e> <s> when i have wanted to i have read the particular section <e> <s> i am full of praise for the consideration the committee gave to the vast number of petitions and petitioners who came before it <e>", "<cs> i support the general tenor of the amendment in the recognition that amendment no <e> <s> will be moved by my noble friend lord carmichael of kelvingrove <e> <s> as the two amendments are tabled separately i assume that any consideration of amendment no <e> <s> a will not affect our position on amendment no <e> <s> <e>

<e> <s> if the government do not like the wording i ask them to bring forward an amendment which deals with the general spirit of this amendment <e> <s> whatever happens at waterloo whether or not there is any change as we suggest in there is need for consultation and urgent discussions on traffic management plans <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies perhaps i may say that the interventions we are now having stray very much on to our amendment no <e> <s> on which frankly we have not been able to put our viewpoint because we do not think it is relevant to the present amendment <e> <s> i should hate to feel that the discussion on amendment no <e> <s> a was covering in a much lighter fashion the detailed discussion that i hope will take place when we discuss amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am amazed that any member of the committee should read into this that the noble lords lord underhill and lord carmichael are taking one side or the other as to whether vehicles should be segregated from their passengers <e>", "<cs> the amendment suggests that the safety authority should consider whether segregation is the best method <e> <s> that surely is what we want it to <e>", "<cs> i hope i am not wrong but i have assumed that the safety authority will remain in being and that at any time it can consider any aspect <e> <s> that is my interpretation of the safety authority <e> <s> i shall be welcoming perhaps at report stage the ministers comments on the first question that i put on clause can the safety authority now consider the eurotunnel proposals for not segregating <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that reply which i shall read carefully <e> <s> it seems to add effect to the principle of this amendment but nevertheless i shall withdraw it at this stage <e>", "<cs> i should like to say at the outset that i am grateful as i am sure is the whole committee for the ministers detailed reply on this important subject <e> <s> that does not necessarily mean that i agree with what he has said but he has given considerable attention to the issue <e> <s> it is strange that while he applauds the comments made by his noble friends lord morris and lord beloff i cannot see any reference to the case in the governments response to the chairmanship of the safety authority proposal of the select committee in paragraphs and <e> <s> they make no mention of that yet it is put forward today as one of the outstanding reasons why the amendment i have proposed cannot be supported <e>", "<cs> <e> <s> that was an important intervention from the noble lord lord ampthill who was chairman of the select committee <e> <s> despite what the minister has said nothing in subsection would require renegotiation except the question of a single chairman <e> <s> there is provision for there to be a british chairman who would be chairman for one year and a french chairman who would be chairman for another year <e> <s> that is the only change that would need to be made to subsection <e> <s> it could easily be done at report stage if it were the view of the committee to support the amendment <e> <s> there is nothing in subsection that transgresses against what the minister has said because it could be adapted accordingly <e> <s> the select committee felt solidly that it wanted to ensure somewhere in the bill the complete independence of the chairman <e> <s> if we agree on this the government can come back at report stage and can make any amendment they require to deal with the position of the chairman rotating one year french and one year british <e>", "<cs> this is a point in which no one would expect me to get immersed <e> <s> i am concerned with principles <e> <s> the noble lord lord morris is emphatic on this point but why did not the government refer to this in their response to the select committee <e> <s> they made no reference to it and yet this is now being put forward as one of the main considerations against the amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister has given his explanation the chairman of the select committee has given his view on the matter i have given my view and other noble lords have said that this subsection is important <e> <s> we ought to see whether the committee agrees with that principle <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for what he has just said <e> <s> i was reading through the report of the select committee while the noble baroness lady stedman was speaking and i looked again at appendix which is a memorandum on safety submitted by eurotunnel <e> <s> strangely enough i cannot see any reference there to the disabled <e> <s> there is reference to evacuation and there is another section which deals with passenger evacuation <e> <s> i am certain it would be helpful to the committee if the minister could elaborate on what has been said and say definitely whether further arrangements have been made between eurotunnel and the concessionaires for the carriage of disabled people <e> <s> no one would disagree that efforts should be made to make special provision for disabled passengers <e> <s> obviously before any passengers or goods are carried the problem of safe evacuation must be properly considered <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the minister <e> <s> i was not questioning whether the select committee had considered this but on the safety aspect appendix the memorandum by eurotunnel which was submitted to the select committee contained no reference to it <e>", "<cs> it will be recalled that at our second reading debate on this bill the two matters to which considerable attention was given were first safety and secondly rabies <e> <s> frankly i am satisfied <e> <s> the noble lord lord ampthill the chairman of the select committee referred to appendix and speaking for myself having very carefully read the eurotunnel memo which is appendix i am satisfied with all the steps which eurotunnel proposes to take <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i hope that other noble lords will agree with me that this shows the value of putting down amendments <e> <s> we now have a quite definitive statement from the minister of measures which i can acknowledge and support <e>", "<cs> once again i am grateful to the minister for his welcome assurances <e> <s> i note the importance that he gives to the position of the chief fire officer of the county of kent on the safety authority <e> <s> that is one of the points that we emphasised on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> with those assurances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> there is certainly no intention of asking the committee to divide on this issue and i readily accept as the minister says that it may have been unfortunate that we put in detail the five points under subsection <e> <s> i agree that these matters ought to be determined by the chief officer of the kent brigade along with the safety authority <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord harris for that intervention <e> <s> it was extremely helpful and it illustrates how parliament must be particularly careful to ensure that it secures the fullest possible information on safety measures at various stages <e> <s>

should come back with something at the report stage <e> <s> that may be doubtful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down has he or his department any view on this <e> <s> we often hear about a road lobby at the department but i doubt very much whether there is a cycling lobby <e> <s> have the government got any view about encouraging british rail to find a solution <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord the minister one question <e> <s> the clause reads <e>", "<cs> everyone seems to agree on the importance of this matter <e> <s> the house of commons transport committee on the channel tunnel expressed its great concern that unless something like this is done we shall lose out on a lot of trade particularly to northern france <e> <s> we have your <e>", "<cs> that is a question which i repeat to the minister if he would care to answer it and give also the view of customs and excise <e> <s> it might be a question that he would like to

too should like to thank the noble lord lord nelson of stafford not only for initiating this debate but for chairing the select committee <e> <s> i should also like to thank the members of the committee for what i think is a valuable and useful report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that later on the report says that the position has been weakened <e> <s> if i find it i shall write to the minister which is a rather different way of doing things <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not rather surprising that the secretary of state chose not to reply to a question put by the leader of the <e>", "<cs> my lords as the transport ministers council deals with matters besides aviation can the minister tell the house particularly in the light of our debate next wednesday on britains mercantile marine whether there is any intention by the council of ministers to discuss the policies of certain community countries with regard to the help that they give to their merchant navies <e>", "<cs> my

done <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just add one or two words to what my noble friend has said <e> <s> at the outset may i say how grateful i am to the chairman of the select committee the noble lord lord ampthill and to a member of the select committee the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for emphasising the overwhelming and i believe completely unanimous support of the committee on this principle

friend lord mulley repeated these words <e>", "<cs> my lords following the words of the last two speakers noble lords who looked very carefully at the list of amendments may have noticed that my noble

further explanation <e> <s> i should say that this is not amateur draftsmanship <e> <s> a parliamentary draftsman drafted the amendment at my request and detailed certain points that we wished to include in it <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall repeat what i said in relation to previous amendments <e> <s> it is surprising that when the government wish to insert provisions for consultation they list all those bodies with which there should be consultation <e> <s> i have in mind the airports act where the government listed the bodies <e> <s> yet here where we table a common-sense amendment the government resist it <e> <s> apparently they have found a principle for showing why the organisations should not be listed <e> <s> nobody knows what will be the position of the council of the london borough of lambeth when any such review might be desired <e> <s> nobody has made any criticism of the london planning advisory committee or of the fact that the amendment refers to other local planning authorities <e> <s> the excuse is being made that lambeth have not talked so far <e> <s> as i say nobody can say what the position in lambeth will be when there is general agreement that there ought to be such a review <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the information which has been given by the minister <e> <s> the fact is that parliament will be rising for some weeks <e> <s> may we have an assurance from the government that their response to the report will also be published as soon

moreover if the report should indicate that an additional inquiry should be conducted into the superstructure will the government have such an inquiry instituted <e> <s> if the report does not mention that do the government believe that there ought to be an additional inquiry into the superstructures of ferries <e>", "<cs> my lords the one thing that stands out clearly from this debate that has been initiated by my noble friend is that there is no doubt whatever about the tragic decline in the british merchant fleet both in numbers of ships and in the number of seafarers on uk registered

parliamentary period through which this bill has passed <e> <s> i want to make just a few brief comments and in these i am associated with my noble friend lord carmichael who has shared with me responsibility from the opposition front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords i have only a few remarks to make <e> <s> the noble viscount lord craigavon has referred to what he regards as my general support of the project <e> <s> at second reading i made it quite clear that i fully agreed with the description given by the noble lord lord marshall of leeds when he said that this was an imaginative enterprise and an exciting project <e> <s> there is not the slightest doubt that providing the link from the midlands to the south-east has the support of everyone including that of the noble viscount <e> <s> when he first began to speak of the development i thought that he was going to criticise british rail for linking <e>", "<cs> my lords if the petition was not before the committee that places my second point in some difficulty <e> <s> i wished to ensure that adequate consideration was given by the committee to the problem of compensation <e> <s> i have great sympathy with the position of the tenants of the arches <e> <s> we have heard not only from the noble lord lord marshall but also from the noble viscount lord sidmouth as to procedures of the committee <e> <s> if the whole question is really one of procedure whereby certain persons find it difficult to meet the cost of coming before the committee that is another matter entirely <e> <s> that would have to be dealt with elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords when the subject for this debate first appeared on the order paper some of us queried its position in the light of the fact that we <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that although the majority of motor accidents take place on roads which are not motorways those taking place on motorways are more horrendous <e> <s> is any research being undertaken by the department or by the trrl into the cause of accidents whether they are due to human error to the motorways themselves or to wrong use of lanes and so on <e> <s> it seems that such evidence is vital <e>", "<cs> my lords may i raise in this connection a somewhat different matter and the minister will tell me if i am wrong <e> <s> in the event of a liberalisation agreement being reached will this mean increased flights possibly to the united kingdom <e> <s> is the minister aware of a statement made by the chairman of the civil aviation authority as recently as th october that a strict limit on flights throughout britain has been threatened by the caa <e> <s> the chairman went on to say that ultimately the volume will have to be capped <e> <s> he said that there may have to be the use of alternative airports including manchester and birmingham <e> <s> is this likely to be the effect if liberalisation takes place on the scale which is envisaged <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recognise that the question of the noble baroness referred to the desirability of an agreement a total package covering air capacity and market access <e> <s> in view of that and of the question which i put to the minister when the noble baroness put her question on nd october and in the light of the ministers reply do the government propose to have discussions with the chairman of the civil aviation authority as a result of his statement about the necessity to look elsewhere for air space <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may rise to ask a question again <e> <s> if the package involves a diversity of traffic to different airports in this country or increased night flying surely that ought to be discussed in advance <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many members of the public may take the view that the ministers response to this matter has been somewhat complacent <e> <s> there is great public concern and it is insufficient merely to say that the complainant can take the repairer to law <e> <s> does he not agree that all the ministers concerned should look very seriously at this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bethell has given an opportunity for views to be expressed on what might be the monopolies and mergers commissions decision on the proposed merger <e> <s> very definitive stands have been taken against the merger <e> <s> frankly i cannot be so definitive as other noble lords in saying either yes or no to the merger <e> <s> i want to see the mmcs report <e> <s> i want to see the evidence presented to it <e> <s> i want to see the reasons for its recommendation <e> <s> i want to see the ministers decision and i want to see the reasons for it <e> <s> then we shall be able to have i hope a full discussion on it in parliament because this matter just cannot be dealt with by saying we think the merger is good or not for these reasons <e> <s> it involves the whole question of civil aviation policy and of international agreements and the position of ba as our national airline which is a matter we have discussed on other occasions <e> <s> therefore it is not a simple yes or no to the merger <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not consider it a strange attitude towards competition policy for the board to issue as recently as th october a statement to the effect that the fact that brel has not been asked to tender is not disadvantageous to the company as it might become the major subcontractor <e> <s> does he not agree that it could possibly work the other way that one of the other firms could be the main subcontractor to brel if brel were successful in its arguments <e> <s> this procedure seems to be standing competition policy on its head <e> <s> is it not a fact that when brel was reorganised one of the groups was called the new build and repair group <e> <s> does that not imply that it was able to build equipment of that kind <e> <s> is this <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that the question deals with other roads as well as motorways <e> <s> however does the minister recall that on nd october the minister sitting on his left promised to look into whether or not there had been a survey into the cause of accidents on motorways <e> <s> has that survey been put into operation <e> <s> i understand that in january a road traffic law review was set up under dr peter north <e> <s> that was two and a half years ago <e> <s> will the minister tell us how that is progressing and whether it will deal with the question of enforcement as well as other aspects of road traffic law <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will be grateful to the minister for his comprehensive review of this important bill and that our debate today will assist in the important committee stage <e> <s> i hope that the minister will be able to help by replying in committee to some of the questions that arise today <e>", "<cs> my lords that would be a matter for discussion and it is one of the points we should put to the minister <e> <s> in so far as the bill makes certain provisions which allowed me to make the statement made surely if we have a situation in which a master or a crewman is to be held responsible and he says i am not going to take this boat out because it is unsafe that is what the bill provides on registration then registration will be refused unless guarantees can be given <e> <s> how this will be operated we shall have to discuss but i am anxious to know whether the government agree with the principle <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down may i first say that he has given excellent replies to most of the points but he did say that notes and clauses would be available at the end of next week <e> <s> the end of next week could be the th or th thursday or friday and we have the first committee stage on the th <e> <s> it is going to be difficult for noble lords without research facilities to be able to use them unless we have them earlier <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to ask the question of which i gave private notice to the noble viscount the leader of the house this morning <e> <s> the question is in the following terms to ask her majestys government whether they will make a statement on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount for allowing this private notice question and to the secretary of state for the statement that he has just made <e> <s> while it is foolish to claim that i have read all pages of the report which he said was published only at oclock this morning is it not correct that the general nature of the report justifies the insistence that this should have been a matter which should have gone to the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> am i correct in saying that the conditions laid down are precisely those in the report of the mmc and that no additional conditions have been put in <e> <s> is it not also clear that the government have no choice but to allow the merger to proceed <e> <s> is not the alternative to allow a foreign airline to take over bcal <e> <s> the chairman of bcal has suggested that this might be the case <e> <s> it may be recalled that i resisted that possibility in the course of our debate on th november which dealt with the general question of the proposed merger <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the point of my noble friends original question illustrated by the sad news which was announced on a radio programme this morning of the young lad who has been called for an operation on five occasions <e> <s> five times the operation could not be carried out because although the consultants and technical staff were available there were insufficient nursing staff in the emergency wards <e> <s> is not that one of the problems raised by my noble friends question <e>", "<cs> my lords in regard to what the minister said about local authority housing is there not a private members bill in the other place dealing not only with local authority housing but also with the large number of empty properties in private ownership <e> <s> does the ministers reply mean that the government will support that bill <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister interested to know that i have received a communication from a patient in the queen elizabeth hospital birmingham the subject of this question who is himself a renal patient on dialysis and an officer of the kidney patient support association <e> <s> these patients are concerned not with the next few months but that support will be given not only for present months but for future years <e> <s> is the minister aware that my noble friends question is very important for sufferers in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that the simple point of my question is clear <e> <s> it is not sufficient to give promised assistance for the next few months <e> <s> the people who are patients in this area and there will continue to be dialysis patients in this area want to know what will be available in the future next year and the year afterwards <e> <s> that is what we are asking the minister to tell us <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the certainty of majority voting can the minister say what effect this could have on any united kingdom policy decisions on air regulation and use of our airports <e> <s> i ask that in view of the reference by the chairman of the civil aviation authority to the london space being overcrowded <e> <s> can any of our policies be affected by majority vote <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house will be grateful to the minister for repeating this statement given by the secretary of state <e> <s> although little of practical value can be said at this stage it provides an opportunity for the whole house to join with the secretary of state and the government in expressing sympathy to the families of the persons who have died and to the many who are injured some of them critically <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount take a look at the provisions in the highway code relating to pedestrians at crossings controlled by traffic lights in places where there is no green man sign <e> <s> not far from my home there occurred recently a serious accident caused by a motorist turning right when the traffic lights were against him <e> <s> there seems to be no clear indication in the highway code about this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord who has just spoken for following up my question <e> <s> i realise that layouts are the responsibility of local authorities but the highway code is the responsibility of the department <e> <s> that is the matter about which i asked <e>", "<cs> in accordance with the views of the noble lord lord gray of contin we likewise are prepared to support the government amendments <e> <s> they provide for a majority holding which is what all of us would prefer <e> <s> although there is a vast group of amendments we give them general support <e> <s> at this stage i wish to thank the noble lord for carrying out his undertaking to let us have notes on clauses much earlier than he thought would be the case and also for his notes today explaining the new measures <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what the minister said <e> <s> we want to have some benefit to the british seafarers in any registration proposals <e> <s> the best course to adopt is to read very carefully what the minister said <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the only thing that i can say that is satisfactory is to thank the noble viscount for repeating the statement <e> <s> the concluding paragraph that privatisation is <e>", "<cs> i am obviously going to have no sympathy from the government on this matter <e> <s> from his first sentence i thought that the noble lord lord mottistone was going to agree with me <e> <s> despite what the minister says i still think that there is something in our suggestion <e> <s> it is not the type of issue upon which to divide the committee <e> <s> i shall look carefully at the ministers words to see whether we shall return with the proposal in some form on report <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment

procedure <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> i am seeking to obtain some information from the minister <e> <s> clause concerns offences relating to the furnishing of information and a duty to comply with directions <e> <s> sub-paragraphs i and ii provide on summary conviction for a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum <e> <s> the notes on clauses state that this is currently <e> <s> paragraph ii provides on conviction on indictment for a fine <e> <s> the notes on clauses state that this is an unlimited fine <e> <s> should there not be some indication given in this clause of the scale of a fine on summary conviction and some limits of the fine on conviction on indictment <e> <s> i confess that i have no legal knowledge on this matter but in other clauses we have information of a scale or a maximum <e> <s> that is not so here although the notes on clauses give us some information <e>", "<cs> the noble lords last sentence puts me in a quandary <e> <s> by leaving out paragraph we believe that there would be no provision for provisional registration <e> <s> if the position is as the noble lord says there is no purpose in pressing the amendment <e> <s> all i can do is to read carefully what he and the noble lord lord mottistone have said and in the meantime withdraw the amendment <e> <s> however we are still of the opinion that there ought to be an amendment to delete the provision but this may be covered by the period of duration which will follow in subsequent amendments <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in moving amendment no <e> <s> the noble lord lord mottistone referred to amendment no <e> <s> in my name and that of my noble friend lord carmichael <e> <s> therefore i think it would be for the benefit of the committee if i make observations about our amendment and say why we prefer it to the noble lords amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg the noble lords pardon <e> <s> i base my argument partly on the consultative document issued in when the department of transport and presumably the secretary of state at the time contemplated a temporary registration period of one month <e> <s> i should like to quote from paragraph of the consultative document which says <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise a few points on clause <e> <s> it deals with the regulation of registration in overseas territories and does so by reference to categories of registries <e> <s> subsection a lists four such categories <e> <s> i believe it desirable for the minister to give details of the categories of ships envisaged in paragraphs i and ii that is ships tonnages or types of ships <e> <s> there are also the rather vague additional categories under paragraphs iii and iv <e> <s> paragraph iii reads <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for what he said in particular his assurance that there is no intention that a charitable body as such will be used for the actual administration of the grants <e> <s> there is no difference between us and other noble lords in the house <e> <s> the fact that a proportion of the training costs is to be met by the government is a very useful addition to the merchant shipping industry <e> <s> we are all in agreement that that is a very useful provision <e>", "<cs> i readily do so and i am grateful to the minister for agreeing to look again at the first part of my amendment <e> <s> we shall look carefully at the second part and also at the point raised by the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> that was drawn to my attention after the amendment was put down <e> <s> it is obviously a point of some importance <e> <s> i welcome the ministers assurance that he will look again at the first matter and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i understand the desire for flexibility and using the word otherwise but i am afraid the minister has not explained why we need the words or a loan <e> <s> i am certain that is not the usual provision when we are talking about giving grants to any bodies or industry <e> <s> it is the word loan that particularly worries us <e> <s> to give a grant but to say that a body will pay it back hardly seems to be helping the merchant industry <e> <s> that surely is carrying flexibility a bit too far <e> <s> nevertheless i will read carefully what the minister has said <e> <s> i have no doubt we will come back on this question of the loan at the next stage <e> <s> in the meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise a point here <e> <s> i recognise i should have given the minister notice that i was going to ask this <e> <s> on these matters we not only welcome the briefing that we are given by the general council of british shipping but also the advice which we receive from the national union of seamen and from numas the officers union <e> <s> numas is concerned with one particular matter <e> <s> i put this in the form of a request to the minister <e> <s> will he confirm that officers studying for higher grade certificates of competency will receive assistance towards meeting the costs involved <e> <s> many officers are not covered by industrial arrangements providing for study leave <e> <s> alternative entry and course arrangements mean that many officers do not gain exemptions from academic subjects hence the time ashore college fees and examination fees are costly <e> <s> assistance at the entry and training stage should be carried through to higher certificate levels if the government aim to achieve availability of sufficient qualified officers is to be fulfilled <e>", "<cs> i wish to say a word before my noble friend decides what he is going to do about the amendment <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> contains important items <e> <s> although uniform and equipment have been referred to sub-paragraph a refers to call-out notices to be served on members of the reserve <e> <s> the clause also provides for regulating the conduct and discipline of members <e> <s> that is an important item <e> <s> the imposition of fines or the forfeiture of pay are also important issues <e> <s> this place should discuss such important matters by affirmative resolution <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> also deals with fines <e> <s> that is why the amendments are put forward <e> <s> they are not normal run-of-the-mill regulations but vital regulations <e> <s> we do not ask that every regulation under the bill should be treated by the affirmative procedure but these are important with regard to the merchant navy reserve <e>", "<cs> my lords although the progress about which the minister has spoken is encouraging would not the position be better but for two financial aspects <e> <s> is it not the case that investment in br for the next five years is estimated to be an average of million per annum whereas in the plan was for investment at the rate of million per annum <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his very detailed reply <e> <s> it will certainly give us opportunity to consider what he said in relation to some of the later amendments <e> <s> in that respect the minister has been extremely helpful <e> <s> the remarks of the noble lord lord mottistone also have been very helpful <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord finally withdraws his amendment will the minister explain a little more fully amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am grateful for the notes which the minister supplied to us today explaining the government amendments <e> <s> however i find that in relation to amendment no <e> <s> the notes read as follows <e>", "<cs> once again i am grateful to the minister for his detailed reply <e> <s> we are covering many different amendments and his replies will be very helpful when considering whether or not we will come back to these issues either in the same form or in a <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the support given to this amendment by the noble viscount lord simon <e> <s> i shall certainly study very carefully what the minister has said <e> <s> he put up justification why subsection should still remain <e> <s> we will study that with care and see what happens at report stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words on clause stand part <e> <s> this is a very important clause in the bill <e> <s> the minister referred in one of his replies this afternoon to section of the act <e> <s> it would appear that that section provides the basis upon which this clause has been drafted <e> <s> so it may be worth while seeing how the matter was viewed by the department of transport as recently as september and we are only in november now <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to note that we had the noble lord lord mottistone saying that this section is long obsolete and the minister saying that it is redundant <e> <s> strangely enough the people who work in the industry the seamen admit that the section is seldom used but they believe that it is vital for it to be retained as a reserve mechanism <e> <s> that is all they ask <e> <s> it is regrettable that the government cannot see that case particularly in such an industry where opportunities for union organisation are in many cases extremely difficult <e> <s> the decision of the superintendent or proper officer would be final in all these matters <e>", "<cs> i must inform the committee that on this matter i am advised by the national union of seamen <e> <s> i see that the government front bench speakers are smiling but i can assure them that i do not support anything with which i do not agree <e> <s> the national union of seamen is well aware of that <e>", "<cs> five <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord auckland has said we are grateful to the noble lord lord nugent for tabling this unstarred question <e> <s> it enables us to discuss this important issue and it has brought forward many people of prominence in the work of rospa <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that normal crime if one can use the word normal on the underground is rather different from this matter of graffiti and vandalism to which the original question referred <e> <s> could it not be connected with the diminution of staff particularly on the suburban underground stations <e> <s> those are frequently completely unstaffed <e> <s> has the minister seen the scheme launched by the tyne and wear passenger transport executive called metro watch which is carrying out educational work particularly in schools and through publicity <e> <s> it also pays special attention to patrols <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for explaining the regulations <e> <s> we welcome the action taken by the government both in the original <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord the minister sits down the point that the noble viscount lord simon raised is very important <e> <s> the regulations refer to ro-ro passenger ships <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not a matter which can be covered by the by-laws of the particular airport under the powers given to it if the secretary of state has so designated that it should have by-laws <e> <s> can the noble viscount say whether the civil aviation authority has any authority whatever to see that the by-laws are properly enforced <e> <s> would not this be a useful matter for the airports consumers committee to consider in view of its previous interest in matters involving the disabled <e>", "<cs> my lords before i attempt to reply to that statement which gives no information will the minister amplify what it is about <e>", "<cs> my lords does this mean that the government have no intention of referring the matter to the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> if so the house would like to know why not in view of the adamant attitude that his noble friend the secretary of state for trade and industry took over a reference to the mmc of the ba/bcal merger <e> <s> is there not as much public interest in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much appreciate the detailed answers that the noble lord has given <e> <s> i said at the beginning that i thought he would give very good explanations on these civil aviation matters <e> <s> however has he not now proved that there are matters of great public interest at stake <e> <s> that is why the matter should be considered further <e> <s> from what he says are we to conclude that the government are in favour of an sas/bcal merger or have they real apprehensions about it <e>", "<cs> my lords the information which the minister has given is most encouraging <e> <s> are the local authority associations being brought into these discussions because they will be vitally affected by the views of their trading standards officers <e> <s> i know that the society of motor traders is very worried about this will it also be brought into the discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this package agreement but does the minister agree that there could be a danger of believing that liberalisation is deregulation <e> <s> this is particularly important as on th november the secretary of state said in answer to a question in the other place that the air space over london is crowded <e> <s> must we not keep that in mind <e> <s> therefore we will still need to regulate the capacity our airports can cope with <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the importance of the question put by the noble baroness but is the noble lord also aware that some of us are concerned with similar problems in the suburbs and in other parts of the country <e> <s> can he tell us whether the street works advisory committee set up under the recommendations of the horne committee report is working satisfactorily or have there been any complaints about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for explaining this order <e> <s> i need not detain the house <e> <s> generally we welcome the order and i am pleased to note the emphasis that the minister gave to the amount of consultation that took place before the regulations were finally drafted <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords point is precisely that which was raised in committee <e> <s> i recall the comments of my noble friend lord mulley who said that it is no bad thing that ministers should have this wide discretion <e> <s> he added at col of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his detailed reply on the second amendment <e> <s> i shall not press amendment no <e> <s> and will readily withdraw <e> <s> but it was very noticeable that the two noble lords who opposed no <e> <s> said nothing whatever about amendment no <e> <s> which has never been before the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the observations of the noble lord lord harmarnicholls <e> <s> i think that gives part of the answer to the points made by the noble lord lord mottistone concerning whether or not our amendment would be bureaucratic and cumbersome <e> <s> when one looks carefully at the matter what is the real difference in procedure between the words contained in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall look at the suggestions made by the minister and by noble lords <e> <s> we may well come back to the matter at third reading <e> <s> the suggestions made have been very helpful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a distinct difference between what is being proposed this time and what was proposed at the committee stage although the one common factor is an endeavour to separate the responsibilities of the owner the owner covers the charterer the management company and so on and those of the master <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will understand my hesitancy in rising because i wanted to be certain that i had heard correctly <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for explaining the position and for accepting the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> we are of course dealing with clause and the minister referred to the consequences of a person being found guilty of an offence <e> <s> when i look at page and subsection i see <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to ask my noble and learned friends precisely what the difference is legally <e> <s> i am glad we have had this debate <e> <s> we have had it twice but last time it was included in a big group <e> <s> this time we have dealt with it on its own and i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i shall seek further advice on the matter <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that this short debate has shown quite clearly that all noble lords are concerned to do the utmost for the safety of shipping and shipping vessels and to do anything that is practical and necessary arising from the inquiry into the herald of free enterprise <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that explanation <e> <s> needless to say i do not propose to comment on it at this stage <e> <s> the question of licensing of tidal works by harbour authorities is a very important matter <e> <s> as noble lords will have noticed it covers three and a third pages of the marshalled list <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for the notes on clauses four pages long which were received at lunchtime today <e> <s> therefore i should like to consult those read what the minister says welcome what other amendments he is bringing forward at third reading and then decide whether it is necessary for us to bring forward further amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister will resist the amendment <e> <s> it is in effect the same as amendment no <e> <s> which we had at committee stage <e> <s> i dislike repeating arguments at report stage which i used at committee stage <e> <s> therefore perhaps i may just content myself by saying that section of the act was introduced following a very full inquiry presided over by lord pearson which reported in <e> <s> it may be argued that was years ago but at that time the report was supported by the general council of british shipping and the maritime unions <e>", "<cs> my lords i have just a few observations <e> <s> i agree with the premise of the minister when he said that anything that can be done to lessen the difficulties of people living in the vicinity of airports should be done <e> <s> i believe he has explained that satisfactorily <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister can clarify one point <e> <s> did he say that the monitoring exercise would not take account of the number of wards closed <e> <s> is that not the most vital information which we ought to have concerning wards which are not in use and the reason why they are not in use <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall the development initiated mainly by my honourable friend mr denis howell in the multi-purpose use of sports facilities for schools <e> <s> in view of the fact that the point raised by my noble friends question arises from the financial difficulties of professional football teams is it not possible for the government to take the initiative through local authorities and the sports council to give grant for the development of football grounds for multi-purpose activities <e> <s> i am not proposing that the pitches should be used because when a club has an excellent pitch such as that of my fourth division team leyton orient one does not want to see it destroyed <e> <s> however there are possibilities of developing other sports activities at football grounds particularly under the stand which could help the finances of the club and the local community <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for explaining the two orders <e> <s> i have read fully both reports of the boundary commission and i have noticed as he has said quite rightly that very few electors are involved in the constituencies concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister gave overall figures for london regional transport <e> <s> i understand that at the end of the drop in personnel on the underground services was of which were on the operating side <e> <s> does the minister not appreciate that there are large-scale complaints about the shortage of platform staff particularly on many of the commuter stations <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down and before my noble friend comments on what he has said i believe that the minister referred to the interest of the national economy <e> <s> is that the only aspect of the national interest which he believes could possibly arise <e> <s> will the minister point out in any of the clauses in the bill where the national interest as such is referred to <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> i find it hard to appreciate that it is difficult to get a definition of fatigue in the light of the fact that the department has been considering this matter for something like seven or eight years <e> <s> presumably it should have come up with a definition by now <e> <s> however i am pleased to note that the minister has said that the matter has not been abandoned and presumably will come forward in regulations at some time <e> <s> i hope that in view of the letter to which i referred dated january which is now six years ago there will be a speeding up of this matter because it appears to me that the minister appreciates that there is point in the amendment even though he does not wish to include it in the primary legislation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords at the report stage i supported with the backing of my colleagues the amendment of the noble lord lord mottistone to delete paragraph d <e> <s> i appreciate the arguments put forward by the minister but now i have the greatest pleasure in supporting this amendment which seems to meet the ministers argument that he did not want to rule out the possibility of any other relevant matter to the safety of the ship applying to this particular clause <e> <s> the amendment gets over that argument by suggesting that it should come forward in secondary legislation in the form of regulations <e> <s> it is a very reasonable amendment which the noble lord lord mottistone has put forward and i hope that the minister will appreciate that it goes a long way to meeting some of his arguments <e> <s> therefore from this bench we support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the experience and the authority with which the noble lord lord mottistone speaks on this matter an experience which i do not share <e> <s> i am grateful for what the minister has said but i was rather surprised when he said he was doubtful whether any master would wish to be compromised in this way <e> <s> as i believe i have said on previous occasions on some of these issues we have been advised by numast which is the officers union and which includes masters <e> <s> that union is strongly in favour of the adoption of the amendment <e> <s> the liability of the owner is laid down quite clearly in certain aspects <e> <s> that i agree but this matter goes beyond the owner <e> <s> we are considering other persons who might be responsible for offshore activities <e> <s> at some point one has to draw the line to determine where the master is responsible <e> <s> there must be a line somewhere <e> <s> to suggest that the master may either himself or through other members of his crew be completely in charge of loading and the stuffing of containers is surely carrying imagination a little too far <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i am grateful to the minister for that detailed reply <e> <s> he has mentioned the practical steps which cause him to reject the amendment <e> <s> he said that the matter was plain common sense not referring to my amendment i wish that he had been and he also pointed to the principle that the government are not duty hound to advise persons of offences for which they are liable <e>", "<cs> my lords in those circumstances i could almost say that i am delighted to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i am very pleased that the last amendment we proposed from this dispatch box has met with such a harmonious reception <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord mottistone for conveying the view of the general council of british shipping that in principle it supports what is in the amendment and the minister has confirmed that the government likewise are in support of the principle <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain the house for very long not because i regard the bill as unimportant but because there is a very heavy programme of business to he got through <e> <s> at the outset i should like to reciprocate what the minister has said in that we have had some very useful and interesting debates on this bill <e> <s> as with the pilotage bill politically it has been completely uncontroversial <e> <s> it has been controversial as was the pilotage bill from other angles <e> <s> but there have been no party politics whatever in our discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords as the final speaker before the government reply perhaps i may offer my congratulations and best wishes to the minister on his appointment as leader of your lordships house <e> <s> perhaps i may add my personal regard and goodwill as the deputy leader of the labour opposition <e> <s> however i wonder whether in the future if not tonight the noble lord lord belstead might regret that the final bill he brought forward as a minister should be this measure which will do so much harm as have so many other bills to local government <e> <s> i share the view of the right reverend prelate the bishop of manchester that morale in local government is falling <e> <s> those associated in any way with local government know that to be the true position <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord appreciate that i agree with what he says about the success of the publicity campaign <e> <s> he said that there were no definitive figures <e> <s> when those figures are available will adequate publicity be given to an analysis of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i readily devote the first of my allotted six minutes to giving sincere thanks to the two maiden speakers and also a welcome to the minister with his new responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to ask a question which is relevant to this matter <e> <s> will the minister agree that the national health service stands in very high regard among the great majority of people in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords it stands much higher than minutes <e> <s> it stands very high in the conception of most people <e> <s> will the minister also agree that <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that his right honourable friend the secretary of state commented that a report on the monitoring of the act commissioned by the ama and the pta group through the oxford universities study group was a very balanced report <e> <s> does that report not show that very few new competitors came in under deregulation particularly on the unprofitable routes <e> <s> is not the general conclusion of that report that far from increasing competition in some areas there was no increase in competition whatever <e>", "<cs> my lords as time is constrained i want to put two direct points to the minister <e> <s> first of all in view of the numerous comments made by i think almost every noble lord who has spoken about the record figures that have now been reached i will not say achieved for homelessness the numbers in temporary accommodation and the numbers in bed and breakfast what are the government going to do <e> <s> they have made no reference at all to this in their white paper on housing problems <e> <s> hardly a noble lord who has spoken believes that the governments housing bill will do anything to rectify the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the question asked about future meetings of the transport ministers council and the minister has kindly given dates for the next few meetings <e> <s> is the question of vat on transport likely to be raised at those meetings <e> <s> if so what will be the governments attitude to the possibility of vat being levied on our transport system <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the minister has just said is he aware that on th january his honourable friend peter bottomley mentioned the figure of in a written answer <e> <s> however he said that they comprised only per cent <e> <s> of the number of inward journeys <e> <s> is that not a shockingly low number <e> <s> in view of the interest that there is in this country concerning the use of weighbridges for outgoing lorries could not the matter be raised again with european transport ministers with a view to weighbridges being used at both ends of the journey <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble viscount lord mersey <e> <s> after the excellent way in which he has introduced the amendment there should be little else to say <e> <s> i am surprised that the government have not excluded fire service vehicles and equipment <e> <s> police vehicles are excluded and rightly so <e> <s> it is not a question of jealousy it is right that police vehicles should be excluded <e> <s> however i can remember enough about my fire service duties during the war when i was in the national fire service for five years to realise how important it is that emergency vehicles should be up to scratch for the time when they are wanted <e> <s> that is true of the equipment as well <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords who have spoken i am grateful to the noble lord lord mountevans for initiating this debate at this time <e> <s> he dealt at some length with the position of network southeast i prefer to go a little wider in my remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that the noble lord is raising a different matter altogether <e> <s> by the time those discussions take place in the council of ministers we might have found that we need dozens of meetings if what has happened on other matters has still not been realised <e> <s> we must wait to see what the council of transport ministers has to say about it and whether britain agrees <e>", "<cs> i should certainly like to hear what the minister has to say about the amendment <e> <s> i believe that few members of the committee would disagree with what the noble lord lord bellwin said about the purpose of local government <e> <s> equally i believe that no one would disagree with the noble viscount lord falkland in his attitude towards local government <e> <s> it seems to me that the two views are complementary and i do not know why we are arguing about the rights of local government in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords taking into account the answer which the minister has just given we have legislation to deal with exhaust systems and silencers on new machines and also replacement equipment <e> <s> therefore the whole problem is now one of enforcement <e> <s> does he agree that it is difficult to see how a community directive can assist with enforcement <e> <s> do the government have any ideas on solutions to the problem <e> <s> enforcement could tie up police to a considerable extent <e> <s> however the nuisance must be dealt with <e> <s> responsible motorcycle organisations agree with that assessment of the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords with reference to the supplementary question of my noble friend lord prys-davies is the minister aware that following the date referred to in the question of the noble lord lord crickhowell i have five other dates i have the documents with me when ministers said that they hoped to provide this second crossing by the mid-s <e> <s> but in each case perhaps i may have the leave of the house to quote it was stated <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition to the question asked by the noble baroness lady masham about transport for the disabled is the minister aware that people travel to westminster hospital from various areas of london <e> <s> it is in a convenient area for them to use their own personal transport and patients need to attend that hospital in order to see consultants and visit special surgeries <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i meant public transport in addition to personal transport which many people use as do i when attending westminster hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that on th april we had a considerable exchange of supplementary questions arising from a main question tabled by my noble friend lord graham of edmonton regarding the reduction of commission to travel agents <e> <s> it would be interesting to hear from the minister what has been the result because most people found that the supply of tickets from travel agencies was extremely useful <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not making a speech <e> <s> as regards london regional transport to which the minister referred has he considered the supply of a wodge of tickets for occasional users in order to save difficulties for drivers of one-person operated buses <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the mover of an amendment must be given the right to reply <e> <s> that is a democratic right which every noble lord accepts <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble baroness lady carnegy has given part of the answer to the noble lord <e> <s> lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> why did the government or the department which is really the government consider that these two items sport and leisure should be sent out for consultation <e> <s> they obviously had in mind that these were two possibilities to come under compulsory tendering <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble viscount looked carefully at the question tabled by the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i echo other noble lords in welcoming the noble earl lord gowrie <e>", "<cs> my lords the reference i have is may <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i was aware of that and i was endeavouring not to refer to a petition that may be presented because it will be a matter for the committee to consider and undoubtedly it will follow up the evidence which at the moment has been submitted through the doe <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for the widespread nature of his question <e> <s> some noble lords may think that that is a curious statement in that it will require a number of substantial statements from the minister <e> <s> however the question is very wide and wisely so <e>", "<cs> my lords am i not correct that the planning application originally provided for million passengers per annum <e> <s> if i am incorrect about that i apologise but i thought that was the position and i wondered to what extent passenger development had moved towards that figure <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put to the minister the supplementary questions which i raised last thursday and which his noble friend lord davidson said that he would refer to the minister for a reply this week <e> <s> is it not the case that the problem of runway capacity is mainly in the south-east and that the runway situation elsewhere in the united kingdom is okay <e> <s> is it not also the case that the problem in the south-east could be surmounted if the target of million passengers per annum at stansted was reached <e> <s> is the problem in the south-east not one of lack of runway capacity but of lack of safe air space capacity <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may refer to the supplementaries by my noble friend the leader of the opposition and the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter though i recognise that the minister may not be able to give actual details of the powers given to this council perhaps i may ask the noble earl whether he recognises that there is much criticism about the inadequate powers of the press council and that something much stronger than that is required for this broadcasting council <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that the problems of london traffic congestion have been aggravated by the abolition of the greater london council and the break-up of its transportation unit <e> <s> members may smile but is it not a matter of concern that there has been failure to agree among the london boroughs and hence there is now a five-year agency agreement for a traffic control unit controlled by the smallest local authority in greater london namely the corporation of london <e> <s> is that not a matter for concern <e>", "<cs> my lords would it be of interest to the minister to learn that since the noble lord tabled his question in travelling home from this house every night i have been checking the number of pedestrian crossings where one or both orange globes have been destroyed <e> <s> i am shocked by the number that are in that state <e> <s> can the minister say whether or not police motor patrols are informed that they should notify the local authority when such breakages occur <e> <s> should there not be emergency teams doing other work who can speedily replace the lights <e>", "<cs> my lords in expressing appreciation of this excellent review and report and the intention of the government to proceed with the new signs manual perhaps i may ask whether the government accept the implications of paragraph of the report <e> <s> this indicates a vast saving on an adequate signposting system but also points out the cost that will fall on highway authorities <e> <s> can we be assured that highway authorities will be reimbursed for the costs of re-signing <e> <s> perhaps i may also draw the attention of the minister to paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords this is only my second question <e> <s> i am only asking two questions which i believe i am permitted <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord the chief whip had let me ask it i would have finished the question by now <e> <s> is the minister aware that paragraph of the introduction emphasises that once a nameplate has appeared on a sign it should be continued until the destination is reached <e> <s> does the minister appreciate that this is a problem which is met by numerous people when they are meeting t-junctions from a minor road <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in a speech to the association of county councils on th february the secretary of state criticised local authorities for under-spending on local roads and he said that that implied overspending on other services <e> <s> is the minister further <e>", "<cs> my lords in expressing appreciation of the progress which is being made with regard to the air europe application can the minister give some assurance if it is within the power of the government that the cheap fares will not be at the expense of the conditions of the persons who work for the particular airlines <e>", "<cs> my lords arising from the reply that he has already given i have two questions to ask the minister <e> <s> first does the minister recall that in the department of transport report <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that the date on which the new legislation for married women takes effect will be the same date on which vast numbers of married women will pay a <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of what the minister said about other important matters that the transport ministers council has to consider perhaps i may ask him two questions in his very important role as minister responsible for shipping <e> <s> in a very detailed written answer on rd march his right honourable friend the secretary of state stated that last october he wrote to the shipping ministers of other european countries proposing co-operation on ferry safety <e> <s> can i ask whether that subject was intended to be considered at the last meeting of the transport ministers council or whether there was any intention that it should be on the agenda of a very early meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his explanation of the bill <e> <s> i can assure him and the house that the opposition fully support and appreciate the purpose of the bill although we have certain points that i shall raise in the course of my few remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords what consultation has the department had with the road user bodies such as the motoring organisations the road haulage and freight transport associations on the matter of signing <e> <s> this will be the most important thing <e> <s> i agree with the minister that it is not the name of the bridge that matters but whether people will have correct signs on the roads <e> <s> if they want to go to the bridge they should know they are going to the bridge and if they have to go northwards to the tunnels they should know they are going to the tunnels <e>", "<cs> my lords i am also grateful to the noble lord lord marshall of leeds for explaining the bill and taking the house through its various provisions <e> <s> this is a private bill and i therefore speak in a personal capacity but i say unhesitatingly that we on these benches support its general aims and desires <e> <s> we recognise the serious problem of fare dodging which the noble lord lord tordoff described as defrauding <e> <s> i understand that in the network south-east area alone approximately million was lost as a result of fare dodging <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say at the outset that the opposition not only welcome the two sets of regulations but give them wholehearted support <e> <s> i am not complaining that originally we had the negative procedure <e> <s> that enabled the provisions to be brought in very very quickly <e> <s> all noble lords will appreciate their importance <e> <s> on the other hand the affirmative procedure that we have tonight enables us to discuss certain matters arising <e>", "<cs> my lords are we not in a quandary here <e> <s> we have what could be a dangerous police precedent but at the same time a survey that will provide some valuable information <e> <s> can the minister say what will happen if the transport and road research laboratory personnel carrying out the test find that a person is over the limit <e>", "<cs> my lords on what consultations is that answer based <e> <s> surely there is a danger especially with the amount of weaving that goes on in motor-cyclists looking over their shoulders while travelling <e>", "<cs> my lords before the motor-cyclist changes direction he should look in the mirror to see whether it is safe <e>", "<cs> my lords the information given by the minister is very interesting <e> <s> however should it not be noted that in reply to a simple question we can receive a vast amount of information from the minister but as regards supplementary questions on other subjects it is very difficult to go beyond the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the ministers reply to the last supplementary question can we be assured that the government have still complete confidence in and support airbus industrie <e> <s> in the light of recent criticism by the chairman of british aerospace can we be assured that the government will be associated with any approach to airbus industrie in connection with those criticisms in view of their million launch aid <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the article referred to in the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm what i believe a number of noble lords believe he said namely that if any local authority with housing powers wishes to build new houses it may build from its accumulated assets <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may if he wishes but i have a limited time to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that this time will be added to my allocation <e> <s> in my own area where london regional transport put out to tender some new services country rates are being paid instead of town rates <e> <s> a whole garage has been put off because of that <e> <s> there have been cuts in wages through tendering out and particularly through minibus operations <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister states that he is out of time <e> <s> i believe that the debate could have continued for five hours not that i am asking him to speak for another hour <e> <s> as noble lords have observed it is very encouraging that noble lords should take part in a debate on transport <e> <s> we have had a very useful discussion and i am grateful to all those who have taken part <e> <s> i am also grateful to the minister for his replies <e> <s> however i hope that the minister and his department will take note of the useful information given and the experiences cited <e> <s> i hope that serious consideration will also be given to the constructive and impartial assessments being carried out by the ama and the pta group to which the minister has not referred <e> <s> ministers have stated that these are important and well balanced documents <e> <s> i believe that the minister has shown a certain complacency in his replies on deregulation <e> <s> those assessments ought to be considered carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the desire of the noble earl lord kinnoull to raise this matter in view of certain criticisms that have been made <e> <s> it is far better that it should be brought out into the open through parliamentary procedure rather than that criticisms should be made and not receive any effective answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i express gratitude to the minister for the supply of notes as to meaning of the amendments without which i should have been in some difficulty <e> <s> useful work has been done by the ministers department <e> <s> it is also helpful to have the indication that a large number of the amendments are of a technical character <e> <s> i have checked what happened on report in another place and there were no debates <e> <s> we should now be able to get through the business with a fair amount of speed <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister said this matter was raised during the second reading debate <e> <s> at that time i stressed again and again that we had pressed for action <e> <s> we welcomed incidentally clause which i believe is now clause <e> <s> this concerned readiness to take action against unfair competition from other countries <e> <s> during the second reading debate i and other noble lords on both sides of the house emphasised that ec partners were in effect breaching community laws on shipping particularly on the question of cabotage and coastal shipping and that our trading competitors were giving an unfair advantage to their shipping <e> <s> while we welcomed the new clause we stressed that action should be taken on cabotage <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether i am in order in raising this point on these amendments <e> <s> we have said on a number of occasions that britain is the only european country to have such charges for lights and navigational aids <e> <s> there has been pressure in particular from the ports and now the ports federation that this should be made a national charge and should not be charged on ships coming to our ports <e> <s> we are the only european country to have such charges <e> <s> in considering all these amendments i wonder whether the government have given any further thought to transferring these charges to the national charge <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister appreciate that we are in full agreement with him that this very important report needs to be given the most thorough and careful consideration <e> <s> hasty decisions must not be made even though we want early decisions <e> <s> when the minister says that the government will report to parliament will that be in the form of a document listing the governments responses which if necessary through the usual channels could be debated before legislation is introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister encourage the government to reconsider his reply to my noble friend that any grant or subsidy made would come out of the northern ireland budget <e> <s> will he do so first because of its effect on the general position in northern ireland and secondly because one would hope that subcontracting would benefit the whole of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may again intervene <e> <s> the minister definitely replied to my noble friend to the effect that any subsidy or grant would come out of the northern ireland budget <e> <s> is he now saying that that may be reconsidered <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that the most important part of my noble friends question is the first part relating to security measures at airports <e> <s> that is surely the most important point and it was emphasised by the noble baroness <e> <s> can the minister say when the matter is likely to be raised again <e> <s> will he provide information on the important question of whether a monitoring team could see that all airports carry out proper security measures <e>", "<cs> my lords one matter upon which i think most people will generally be in agreement is that outside parliament this bill has few responsible friends <e> <s> the noble lord lord wyatt of weeford said that most of the opposition was emotional and alarmist <e> <s> however when one looks at the list of responsible organisations which are opposed to the bills principles frankly such remarks with all due respect to the noble lord are just nonsense <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may take this opportunity to follow the speech of the noble viscount <e> <s> i agree with him <e> <s> i have read the report of the select committee and various other documents <e> <s> i agree that the committee has done an exceptionally good job <e> <s> most of the amendments before us in the bill are technical but we have had some explanation about them <e> <s> however i was very pleased to note the attitude of the committee towards the two individual applicants and the attitude taken by the committee on the question of compulsory acquisition and the home loss payments <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the caa report cap published only recently stresses in part that increased runway capacity would lead to increased airspace use the capacity for which is very limited <e> <s> part of that report outlines a number of points which require urgent decision <e> <s> there is no easy answer to providing airspace capacity <e> <s> that is the important issue on which it says that the government must take certain decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to return again on this matter but does the minister agree that the important issue is not that of runway capacity to which noble lords have referred but of finding a way to give additional runway space if possible provided that there is sufficient safe airspace capacity <e> <s> does he agree that these two issues must be taken into consideration <e> <s> the safety of airspace is as important as runway space <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for explaining again the details of this bill and for amplifying the statement issued on behalf of the promoters which i was pleased to receive <e> <s> i have read it with some care and i note that the noble earl has amplified some of the points <e> <s> i do not know whether they are agreements that is what i wish to find out or offers which have been made by the company <e> <s> i do not intend to give my second reading speech again even though i believe i have an hour in which to do so <e>", "<cs> obviously there are some deficiencies in the wording of the amendment after the short debate that we have had i am prepared to accept that <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord monson for saying that he would readily accept the principle of this amendment provided that it were worded somewhat differently <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his reply because this was a probing amendment <e> <s> we wanted to understand why the government had put this in subsection <e> <s> having had the reasoning we now have the opportunity to study it and decide whether or not to accept it <e> <s> there is the point which the noble lord lord tordoff raised which we shall have to look at very carefully <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for what the noble earl lord russell has said <e> <s> however the minister has not made any comment upon the point in the amendment regarding capital resources <e> <s> in view of statements that have been made by ministers in the other place can the minister repeat the position with regard to capital resources held by an individual in relation to liability for community charge so that it is on the record <e> <s> does the minister consider that our figure of an limit is reasonable <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords has consideration yet been given to the recommendations of the north report <e> <s> the report suggests that clamping might be extended to cases where the police constable sees that a vehicle is in a very dangerous condition or where there is no display either of a registered licence disc or an out-of-date one <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister appreciate that there was general support throughout the house for the launch aid for the new versions of the airbus partly because of a desire to take part in an important european co-operative venture and partly because it would provide employment in this country <e> <s> has he seen the report that contracts for the airbus wings for the two latest models have been allocated to textron aerostructures an american firm to the total of million and that eventually aerospace has it in mind to give billion of contract for the airbus wings <e> <s> is that against the general principle on which we supported the airbus project <e>", "<cs> as most noble lords will know i have spent a great part of my life trying to get electoral registers up to date <e> <s> therefore i am the last person who would wish to diminish in any way the importance of the electoral register <e> <s> however we are dealing with two registers <e> <s> the bill makes it perfectly clear <e> <s> it appears that the same officer might be the registration officer and the electoral registration officer but we are dealing with two separate operations <e> <s> the intention is that there should be a separate canvass for the community charge register <e> <s> in addition we have been pressing for a proper canvass for the electoral register <e> <s> this is not carried out in all areas <e>", "<cs> i should like to intervene and say a word in answer to the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls <e> <s> a bill may place responsibility upon an officer to do a certain thing <e> <s> surely that does not <e>", "<cs> would the noble earl give way <e> <s> i am glad he has made that correction for me but it makes our case even more important <e> <s> they are two separate officers <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by congratulating the noble lord lord cobbold on his maiden speech <e> <s> as his noble friend said there may have been disagreements with his comments but his point of view is taken seriously and is worthy of consideration <e> <s> i am sure that in the course of making many speeches in this house he will recognise that although views may differ they are listened to and discussed and we are grateful that they have been brought forward <e> <s> your lordships will gather from those remarks that i support the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister but also disappointed <e> <s> i am grateful to him because as one would expect he has given a definite promise that the representatives of local government will be consulted <e> <s> i am worried about a couple of references which have been made to the representatives of local government and not to local authority associations and therefore i wish to have this provision written into the bill <e>", "<cs> grouped with the amendment to which my noble friend lord dean spoke is amendment no <e> <s> l which leaves out subsection of clause <e> <s> little has been said about that <e> <s> subsection defines student <e> <s> the purpose of putting the amendment forward is to clear up doubts which exist about the definition of student <e> <s> during the committee stage in another place on nd february the minister for local government the right honourable michael howard stated at col that the government will shortly be producing a definition of student which would be the subject of consultation in the context of the scottish community charge regulations <e>", "<cs> that is not what i asked <e> <s> i said that the local authority association representing all the scottish authorities cosla has raised a number of points in respect of the consultation paper <e> <s> i asked what kind of reply had been given to cosla <e> <s> my information which is only a few days old is that cosla has submitted various points regarding the consultation paper on the definition of student <e> <s> therefore if an order has been placed can the minister say when it was placed <e> <s> if it has been placed and my information is wrong i shall apologise <e>", "<cs> the minister has referred time and time again to paragraph of schedule <e> <s> under that paragraph information can only be obtained where a magistrate has made a liability order <e> <s> are we not <e>", "<cs> as my name is attached to

roding has said <e> <s> much as i believe that the ptas and passenger transport executives are doing excellent work i should be prepared to support an amendment which said that if in two or three

with an enabling regulation to change to levying if we find that the ptas and ptes are not functioning properly within a certain time <e> <s> i should be prepared to support that and i have not consulted my colleagues <e> <s> will the minister do the same <e>", "<cs> perhaps i have not made myself clearly understood <e> <s> i said that i hoped that the minister would agree that the position of precepting should be returned <e> <s> i would readily consider the matter being looked at again in two or three years time if we found that the system was not functioning as it ought <e> <s> however in the meantime we must have a return of the precepting procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister appreciate that we are also pleased to see the development of the minibuses <e> <s> they originally began with one of the subsidiaries of the national bus company before it was taken over as a result of privatisation <e> <s> however his answer to the right reverend prelate the bishop of manchester was rather disappointing <e> <s> the big problem in many areas is still the lack of information about timetables and services <e> <s> in many cases this responsibility falls on the county council <e> <s> some do it very well <e> <s> however the passenger transport authorities are the only bodies to carry out this job effectively <e> <s> we were debating last night the problem of the possible secession and collapse of those authorities <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend said i have just picked up this list from the printed paper office <e> <s> it contains only amendments nos <e> <s> d to g a to f h a and e <e> <s> there is no mention of the other amendments to which the noble lord referred <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the spirit in which the noble baroness has put forward this amendment but listening to the noble lord lord monson it seems that the noble lord lord nugent need hardly have spoken <e> <s> the noble lord ignored almost every fact that the noble lord lord nugent put before the committee including the evidence gathered over the past five years <e>", "<cs> i believe that if evidence were found on the lines proposed in this amendment then to a great extent the bill would not become completely valueless but its value would be considerably diminished <e> <s> that would depend on any new evidence <e> <s> by passing the second reading we have agreed that there shall be the widest consultations <e> <s> i believe most of the amendments before the committee are ones that can be covered by consultation <e> <s> i believe that the facts that we have at present mean that we should not support this amendment <e> <s> the wider consultations may bring further evidence beyond that which the noble lord lord nugent mentioned but i doubt it <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to speak on this amendment but in view of the remarks of the noble earl i hope that noble lords will bear in mind what i said on second reading <e> <s> i believe that this is a most useful bill one which ought to get royal assent as soon as possible and we could then permit the regulations to be fully discussed <e> <s> frankly i am one of those who believes that we should write on to the face of the bill as many details as possible <e> <s> but in this case i believe that the regulations will require the utmost consultation <e> <s> that has been promised to us by the minister <e>", "<cs> i am sure that noble lords have followed what the noble lord lord teviot said <e> <s> i thought that he put his case very cogently <e> <s> he reminded the committee that last tuesday we debated the question of the precepting of passenger transport authorities being changed to levying <e> <s> i remind the committee that on that occasion nine noble lords spoke and not one of them supported the government attitude on this matter <e> <s> i was the only speaker from the labour opposition <e> <s> that indicates the all-round support <e> <s> we may still have to determine certain aspects of the matter in the light of the proposition put forward by the noble lord lord jenkin of roding who said that he was considering the possibility of a suitable amendment at report stage <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord teviot tells us his intentions on this amendment perhaps i may ask the minister to clarify two statements that he made which i may have misheard <e> <s> i believe in the first part of his remarks he said that the government had no intention of fixing a <e>", "<cs> the interchange of views indicates the foolishness of the provision in the bill <e> <s> as has been mentioned by the noble lord lord ross of newport if the chief executive officer did not report to his council that something was wrong which the chief financial officer now has to do somebody would ask what the hell the chief executive officer was doing <e> <s> surely it is his duty to see that the council functions correctly <e>", "<cs> should this debate on these two amendments go much further it will not be long before the government recognise that there must be a change <e> <s> a sufficiency of arguments has been put forward <e> <s> the noble lord lord hesketh used the argument that the chief finance officer must not be denied his resources <e> <s> where is that stated in subsection <e> <s> the noble lord is using his powers of invention <e> <s> subsection states that the local authority must provide resources if the chief finance officer thinks he needs them and that is something totally different <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that his department has studied very carefully the cycling schemes in the netherlands which i visit most easters <e> <s> their schemes not only cover most of the towns small and large but also cross-country routes <e> <s> has the department learned anything from them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will appreciate the openness of the statement which has been made by the minister <e> <s> it gives me great satisfaction that for once we can vote for the annulment of an order <e> <s> although we often have a debate on the prayer to annul we never vote on something which has been passed in the other place <e> <s> however we can do that quite readily tonight <e> <s> it makes a change <e>", "<cs> i generally respect the views of the noble lord lord bellwin but he will not deny the official figures of homelessness particularly in london <e> <s> the official figures show a staggering increase <e> <s> these are not people who have just willy <e>", "<cs> i am most surprised that the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne while moving the amendment should say that we must have regard to practicalities and that there is a lack of reality to the real world in this connection <e> <s> the noble lord should realise that although we may be in our seventies we have all had children <e> <s> indeed most of us have young grandchildren with whom we travel in cars <e> <s> all of them would be covered by what is proposed <e> <s> therefore we have some knowledge of the practical world and about driving cars with children in them <e>", "<cs> i believe that both noble lords proposing the amendment are sincere in their views of what should be regarded as freedom <e> <s> however we have been here before <e> <s> those were the arguments used against the amendment requiring the wearing of seat belts in front seats <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne agrees <e> <s> on that occasion the house decided that seat belts should be required and the other place accepted the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not regard an argument on one particular matter as being an argument for another matter <e> <s> we are dealing with the mandatory wearing of rear seat belts for children <e> <s> that is the issue <e> <s> all the research and monitoring on the subject suggests that the danger of being trapped by fire and flood is infinitesimal <e> <s> to suggest that we should pass the amendment is to suggest that we should take a completely different view from that which was taken <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i think that the committee will recall why the seat belt legislation was carried in this chamber <e> <s> i spoke from this front bench and made it quite clear that i was speaking in a personal capacity <e> <s> there was no whip and the legislation was carried in this chamber on the basis of the common sense of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i believe this is one case where the bill is showing some common sense and flexibility <e> <s> if the amendment were carried it would mean that every single car on the road which was or years old would have to have seat belts fixed or the bill would not come into effect <e> <s> that is what the amendment means <e> <s> the amendment reads that the secretary of state must <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to the question of control <e> <s> do i take it that the transport ministers council considered the problem which has been increasingly mentioned in all circles the overcrowding of air space and the possibility of a european air control system <e> <s> has that been considered <e> <s> was consideration also given to the growing complaints of the congestion at certain airports particularly those in certain european countries due to charter flights interfering with scheduled flights <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say what part section grants by the passenger <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister appreciate that his last reply is rather surprising <e> <s> for an ambitious project of this kind which i think we all welcome surely some thought must have been given <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that i very much appreciate his last remark that this problem goes far beyond football <e> <s> i say that as one who believes that football is a marvellous game <e> <s> i have supported one club for over years but i shall refrain from mentioning the name of that famous ground <e> <s> is it not a fact that certain suggestions have been made by individuals who know nothing about football have never passed through a turnstile in their lives and do not appreciate the problem that would exist if there were an all-ticket scheme which meant that some people had to get through turnstiles <e> <s> does he appreciate that the problem is in fact one of general violence in society and that we <e>", "<cs> my lords is that a satisfactory answer to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> the minister says that there should always be a competent person available <e> <s> does he appreciate that we need a guarantee that there will be <e> <s> in many cases the booking office is closed so that is one point where no one will be available <e> <s> does the noble lord appreciate that we need a guarantee that trained staff will always be available near one or other of the special releases <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord nugent in his opposition to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i have handled a number of transport bills from this dispatch box i can appreciate that the noble lord lord monson desires to be flexible in order to achieve something <e> <s> however this flexibility is carrying things a little too far <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne moved an amendment at the committee stage which was supported by the noble lord lord monson to defer regulations until compulsory seat belts for all vehicles were a condition of their being on the road <e> <s> now the noble lord wishes to limit the proposal merely to cars manufactured since april <e> <s> that is carrying flexibility a long long way <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be pleased to know that on this occasion i am not accusing him of undue flexibility <e> <s> having looked carefully at the wording of the amendment and of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i briefly but sincerely congratulate the noble lord lord nugent on introducing yet another important piece of legislation dealing with seat belt wearing <e> <s> if it were not for the exceptions and regulations i might be critical of certain aspects myself <e> <s> but i believe the regulations are there and the possibility of exceptions <e> <s> we have had assurances from the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister appreciate that we readily support the general publicity scheme that he outlined in his first supplementary answer <e> <s> has the disabled persons transport advisory committee raised any questions in respect of publicity and is it thoroughly satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister appreciate that his replies this afternoon are far more definite than those he gave on monday both to myself and to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> can we be assured that in his discussions with the inspector of railways the point has been made absolutely clear <e> <s> what matters is not who it is believed will be on duty but that there will definitely be a trained person available at all times <e>", "<cs> my lords i follow my noble friend because local facts are very useful to underline <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that the house is grateful to the noble lord lord jenkin of roding for going through the history of this amendment and also for recalling the powerful speech that he made in committee which so much impressed noble lords that there were nine speakers on the amendments at that time <e> <s> not one of those speakers supported the attitude of the government in proposing the change from precepting to levying <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister projecting a possible scenario or does he have definitive evidence that this is what will happen with ptas and districts <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that the noble lord has been busy on other matters but has he yet had a chance to read the document published by the caa on th june <e> <s> in its review of licensing policies it recognises that there are terrible constraints on air space capacity <e> <s> on page the review states <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house what is meant by the taxable capacity of an area <e> <s> i am sure that many of us would like to know precisely what is meant by that <e> <s> although there is provision here to notify each charging authority of the amount and the population is there any opportunity for them to make representations <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty of dealing with the comments made by the minister is that they are made in such an agreeable way that they suggest everything is nice and cosy and that we need not worry at all but it may be remembered that at the committee stage the amendment would have cut out the provision of all maximum levies by levying bodies whereas we are now merely wanting to except the ptas <e> <s> while it is nice to hear the minister say there is no rush indeed no intention to use the reserve power we do not know how long the present secretary of state will be in office <e> <s> secretaries of state for transport seem to have changed more quickly than other members of the government <e> <s> we therefore want to know about the future <e> <s> if the government have no intention of using the power why not include the exemption of the levy on the pta in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords in broad terms we can see no objection to the proposals contained in the new clause <e> <s> however this method of financing especially in the case of wimbledon commoners and other bodies appears to be anachronistic in the light of what is supposed to be a wide-ranging reform of local government finance <e> <s> it also seems strange that the house has had to wait until the report stage before the government have realised that such a provision must be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the various amendments moved by the noble lord lord teviot <e> <s> he has covered the ground fairly extensively but i should like to underline two or three points <e> <s> first he made the important point that passenger transport authorities were set up only to deal with transport policy as the name implies and therefore as single service authorities grants cannot be diverted to other purposes <e> <s> we know that grants for transport purposes other than to ptas can be diverted for other purposes <e> <s> noble lords will recall that we have had a debate and questions in the house about the upkeep of local roads <e> <s> highway authorities have to deal with highways and with other problems whereas passenger transport authorities have to deal only with transport services <e> <s> the amendments seek to ensure that grants are made to the ptas <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down and the noble lord lord teviot replies <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house again does the minister agree that with the levying proposal the ptas will be providing transport services for local authorities <e> <s> surely that is one of the arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords do the noble viscount and his department recall the report of january on innovation in surface transport produced by the house of lords select committee on science and technology <e> <s> in that report there are favourable references to the reintroduction of trolleybuses <e> <s> is the noble viscount aware that included in the appendices are five very encouraging statements to that effect <e> <s> in the light of the remarks the noble viscount has made is there any intention to conduct a fairly quick inquiry into the effectiveness of trolleybuses for public transport and the energy saving involved <e> <s> will there also be an economic assessment <e>", "<cs> my lords i noted that in his reply the noble lord lord hesketh said that they had been in touch with cipfa and the association of the chief officers and that a working party had been set up to try to work out details <e> <s> what he did not say was that those two bodies agreed with the governments proposals on this matter <e> <s> of course they would set up a working party <e> <s> all competent officers in local government believe in carrying out the law <e> <s> all competent officers believe that it is their duty to carry out something laid down in statute <e> <s> of course the association of the chief officers will endeavour to work out the details <e>", "<cs> my lords my first comment is on the last statement made by the minister about the administrative problems <e> <s> if this is a major administrative problem then heaven help the whole operation of the community charge legislation <e> <s> heaven knows where we shall be if my figures from the parliamentary answer are correct we are dealing with under individuals <e> <s> the noble earl asked what was a definition of a school <e> <s> we are debating at considerable length the education reform bill and i think the department of education and science could quite easily define what we mean by a school <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm what has been stated previously that there is no question of a grant involved in launch aid to british aerospace and that it is a loan which is repayable <e> <s> that is a very important principle <e> <s> is it not also the case that airbus industrie has recently concluded an agreement with rolls-royce under which the rolls-royce engine will for the first time be offered as a complete engine for the a <e> <s> does he agree that that is another factor to be considered in connection with british employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord teviot in his three amendments <e> <s> there seems to be no reason why grants for public transport should be available to authorities in wales but not to authorities in england <e> <s> i am certain that my welsh colleagues will not mind my drawing attention to that provision which is to he found in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that we appreciate his comments to the eurocontrol commission and his written answer on th november <e> <s> can he give some assurance that the early inquiry requested from the caa will not be confined to the five options which they presented to the house of commons select committee on transport but will take in the question of scheduled flights and charter flights <e> <s> further can the minister say what is the position with respect to spain which is not a member of eurocontrol <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister saying that there are no spheres where we should be giving special attention to certain industries or other activities <e> <s> does he not realise that the british film industry is an example to the world of british life <e> <s> that is the aspect that we should be considering <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to heads of agreement being worked out <e> <s> does that indicate that he will ensure that adequate provision is made for those tenants who disagree with the move <e> <s> what will happen to them <e>", "<cs> my lords while appreciating the ministers answer can he say on what kind of survey it was based <e> <s> in the light of the other facts that he has given is it proposed to ask the trrl to carry out a survey on the question of motorway barriers <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not one of the points on which the secretary of state has asked the civil aviation authority to report to him by november <e> <s> will that not include the question of night flights both landing and take-off <e> <s> will that not also involve the question of the use of quieter aircraft if there is to be an extension of night landings or take-offs <e> <s> the other important question is that everyone is now agreed that the problem is lack of air space <e> <s> should there not be a curtailment of nonpublic transport movements particularly those of the military <e>", "<cs> my lords following on from the last question does the noble lord appreciate that those of us who have followed football for half a century or more and who love the game want to do our best to deal with hooliganism <e> <s> does he appreciate that we recognise the truth of what he said on th june and he said this twice that hooliganism at football matches is a symptom of the general violence in society and must be dealt with <e> <s> is it not unfortunate that those invited onto the working party have already said they they condemn the whole scheme as impractical and expensive for smaller clubs <e> <s> is the national federation of supporters clubs which represents the people who go through the turnstiles going to be invited <e> <s> one fears that this scheme has been devised on a national basis by people who have never been through a turnstile in their lives <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the government have made up their mind and are asking the working party to work out the details without going into what should be done to deal with hooliganism <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that oxford university transport studies group has been commissioned by the association of metropolitan authorities to carry out a three-year study into deregulation under the act <e> <s> is he further aware that the university studies group has said that there are gross inaccuracies in the database used by trrl <e> <s> if that is so what will happen to the future of monitoring <e> <s> the minister says that it is being carried on <e> <s> i understand that these inaccuracies mainly affect deregulation in the metropolitan areas <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that during recent question times in your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to night flights <e> <s> is it not the case that in a recent transport debate in another place his right honourable friend the secretary of state made it absolutely clear that any extension of night flights could not be tolerated <e> <s> he welcomed the fact that the transport spokesman for the opposition in another place agreed with him <e>", "<cs> can the minister give me one example of the electoral reform society following up members of a trade union who have not taken part in a ballot <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has given some figures <e> <s> but is he aware that those figures disagree with the view expressed only recently by the building societies association which is concerned at the number of people who are unable to meet their commitments and whose houses are being repossessed <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister took pride in the fact that there has been an increase in private house building <e> <s> has he any comments to make on the fact that the building of council houses for rent a subject with which we shall be dealing later this afternoon is the lowest for a considerable number of years <e> <s> i do not have the year but it must be a period of about years <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has referred to the anomalies which will be cleared up <e> <s> as the new law will apply to scotland next year can he tell us how quickly that anomaly will be cleared up because the scottish authorities will wish to know <e> <s> is not the qualifying date for the electoral register in scotland the same as it is in england th october which is past <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the emphasis in the question to the importance of buying british manufactured goods as opposed to foreign imports do not the government consider that it is somewhat unfortunate in the interests of british employment and british manufacturing firms that british airways should have placed a substantial replacement plane order with boeing of america instead of ordering the part-british european airbus <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount appreciate that we welcome the proposals for development as regards air traffic control <e> <s> is he also aware that we appreciate the efforts of his noble friend lord brabazon in connection with the development of eurocontrol <e> <s> is he further aware i hope that this is not an unfair question as he is only deputising for his noble friend that i received this morning from the chairman of the caa a nats document which states at chapter that air capacity cannot be finite although it will be finite and that therefore there will be times at peak periods when demand exceeds capacity <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down in the light of the point made by my noble friend lord mcintosh about those who may not be able to vote the noble earl made no reference at all to the possibility of absent voting postal voting or proxy voting <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for explaining this order and putting it forward in such a simple manner <e> <s> though he has done that i have a number of comments and criticisms <e> <s> perhaps i may make it quite clear at the outset that this is not a party political matter at all <e> <s> i am certain that my noble friends on these benches welcome any proposals which are directed towards road safety and increase the points and other penalties where there are serious offences and the increases are thoroughly justified <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> if it is a really serious offence why limit the penalty to points <e> <s> why not go up to points as the government have done in other cases <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the ministers reply to his noble friend lady carnegy that all converted cars can use leaded or unleaded petrol is he aware that two surveys conducted by the magazine <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister appreciate that we have congratulated him on the initiative which he has shown in the development of eurocontrol and that we are pleased that his proposals have been accepted <e> <s> but does he also appreciate the point raised by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that the problem created by the shortage of air capacity is exacerbated by industrial disputes not necessarily in this country and that we were very disappointed with the reply that he gave to my noble friend lord carmichael on th october that that was a matter entirely for the countries concerned <e> <s> does he recall that my noble friend asked that there should be discussions with the trade unions in the ec to discuss the matter because we do not know whether the problem concerns wages man-hours or equipment <e> <s> is that not therefore a matter which ought to be discussed by the council of transport ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount for that answer <e> <s> is it fully appreciated that the organisations which support the working party are very responsible bodies <e> <s> they include the five local authority associations the aa the rac the institute of trading standards administration the office of fair trading and what is more important the five motor trade organisations <e> <s> is it fully appreciated that the report of the working party has revealed widespread abuse and cheating in the alteration of mileage on cars <e> <s> ought not the government to give the matter serious consideration at the earliest possible moment <e>", "<cs> my lords with reference to the comments made by the noble lord lord lucas i hope it will be appreciated that the working party report includes practical proposals for the dvlc to contribute in a very valuable way to this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords despite what the minister has said is it not two years since the minister for transport in another place said in reply to a question that the government were not satisfied whether a single-hub coach station was required or whether there should be a number of coach stations <e> <s> has nothing been done to consider that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will agree that that statement on the kings cross incident is of such great importance that it merits far more consideration than would have been possible in a -minute exchange of questions and answers in your lordships house <e> <s> we are given to understand that the report will cover days of public inquiry and we are informed in the press that it will contain something like recommendations <e> <s> although the government chief whip can make no guarantees perhaps i may ask for an early debate on the report to be arranged through the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords we have before us the commons amendments to three bills and i should like to refer to them all in my few remarks <e> <s> they appear to be corrections and minor modifications but i do not understand this particular amendment <e> <s> it is an amendment to clause and leaves out the definition of the offence involving disqualification <e> <s> i do not understand why the definition is omitted <e> <s> i am certain that with a simple explanation from the minister we can deal with the business without difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord teviot for tabling this unstarred question <e> <s> but for this debate i would have been at the jacola the joint airports committee of local authorities conference which as has been mentioned is meeting now at bristol <e> <s> in fact the minister for transport the noble lord lord brabazon of tara is speaking there tonight <e> <s> we are however delighted that the noble viscount lord davidson is to reply to us tonight on behalf of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset i should like to join the minister in expressing shock and grief that on this very day when we are debating the terrible tragedy at kings cross we are met with another tragedy in which the death toll may be even higher than that experienced at kings cross <e> <s> perhaps i may join in his expression of sympathy for the relatives of the bereaved and the suffering of those who are injured many of whom we understand are still waiting to be released <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> i was not referring so much to the paintwork on the escalator itself <e> <s> it has been suggested that there has been no comment on the general paintwork in the concourse and elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall a statement made on st november by his ministerial colleague in another place mr peter bottomley when he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i partly accept the ministers reproof that my question dealt with the noble viscounts second question <e> <s> however his question deals with new cars whereas mine like that of the noble and learned lord was devoted to existing cars <e> <s> i also possess a maestro <e> <s> i have been told by my main dealer that if i have it converted not with a catalytic converter but by tuning it will not be possible for it to run on both leaded and unleaded petrol <e> <s> as i am often in the north of scotland conversion may not be very wise <e>", "<cs> my lords the encouraging information which the minister has given suggests that decisions have already been taken in respect of the type of scheme required yet he referred to bodies being taken into consultation <e> <s> has a definite decision been taken on the form to be followed or is there still to be consultation with the motoring organisations and the road haulage association <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that many of these matters were considered during our debate on monday on the kings cross tragedy <e> <s> does he not also agree that there was a general feeling throughout the house that finance must not play any part in any requirements to improve safety <e>", "<cs> my lords we have congratulated the minister on his efforts to establish and develop eurocontrol <e> <s> is he aware of the serious statement reported on the radio this morning in respect of the report of the air transport users committee which is not yet in our printed paper office but which we await with interest <e> <s> it expresses serious concern about the problems not only of airport congestion but also of air space congestion <e> <s> are we not in grave danger of confusing liberalisation with deregulation and the problems that that would bring forward <e> <s> is there a lack of urgency in other countries to follow eurocontrol which the minister is trying to encourage <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for explaining the bill even though in regard to part i there are still certain aspects which i shall require the minister to explain <e> <s> i propose to vary normal procedure and to open my remarks by dealing with part ii of the bill <e> <s> the minister referred to the kind invitation which he extended to members of the house to participate in the demonstration rides for autoguide <e> <s> my noble friend lord carmichael who will be replying to the debate on behalf of the opposition and i took advantage of that kind offer <e> <s> we found it a fascinating experience <e> <s> we saw demonstrated some high technology and i am certain that the system will bring considerable benefit to motorists <e> <s> we are grateful for having had the opportunity to take part in the demonstration ride <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in the publication <e>", "<cs> my lords it is encouraging to learn from the minister that additional money will be provided to london underground to carry out the recommendations of the fennell report <e> <s> are we to understand that london underground has made a full assessment of all moneys required to carry out all recommendations of the fennell report <e> <s> i know that lrt has set up its own audit system but will the department carefully monitor what is happening in case additional money is required <e>", "<cs> my lords i somewhat share the view expressed by the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe about the timing of this debate <e> <s> nevertheless i am grateful to the noble lord lord mountevans for putting this question down because it enables us to put down some markers ourselves and i hope obtain some definite answers from the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is obliged to the minister for repeating the statement on this awesome tragedy <e> <s> it gives all noble lords an opportunity to join in the expressions of grief and sympathy for the families and friends of the large number of people who have lost their lives and also to express our regard and sympathy for the people of lockerbie who are seriously injured and to give our best wishes for their recovery <e> <s> other noble lords may as i did have listened to the reports throughout the early hours <e> <s> as the statement says we must have admiration for all the emergency services which came in from various parts to assist and did all that they could to help in the circumstances arising from the terrible

clauses <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will convey my thanks to his noble friend lord brabazon of tara for so kindly writing to me and other noble lords a few days ago explaining the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for outlining the regulations <e> <s> once again we give our full support <e> <s> any proposal from the ilo generally receives the support of the

original reply to the noble lord lord ezra was extremely disappointing <e> <s> is he not aware that to carry out separate london rail and road assessment studies without any correlation is sheer nonsense <e> <s> does he agree that there must be an all-inclusive discussion of londons traffic problems rather than such piecemeal inquiries <e> <s> the minister <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to say from this dispatch box that the two noble lords who introduced the amendment did so in an excellent manner <e> <s> moreover unless the minister can give some sound reason as to why the amendment

<e> <s> nevertheless i believe that the point had to be made <e> <s> at present a young man or woman can obtain a provisional driving licence for a motorcycle and can take the machine on the road straightaway <e> <s> he or she can ride that machine for two years during which period one part of the two-part test must be taken <e> <s> we merely suggest that the opportunity to ride should apply only for a journey to an approved training centre <e>", "<cs> i understand that the amendment moved by the noble lord lord strathcarron is to be taken with amendments nos <e> <s> to in my name and those of other noble lords <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord strathcarron intimates what he wishes to do with amendment no <e> <s> may i ask the minister a question <e> <s> he tells us that there are regular discussions between his departments officials and road safety officers <e> <s> i believe he said that there was a consultation as recently as yesterday <e> <s> is there any reason why something of the kind that we suggested in amendment no <e> <s> should not be written into the bill <e> <s> we say that time and time again <e> <s> we had a long debate in this chamber the other day concerning whether statements made in this place are admissable in courts of law <e> <s> i listened to a greater part of that debate <e> <s> whatever may be said we want to ensure that there is a proper method of consultation about training centres <e>", "<cs> i support the noble lord lord strathcarron in his amendment <e> <s> clause details the five classes for which the minister may make provision <e> <s> all these are important <e> <s> we have later amendments seeking to vary these or add to them but it seems that merely making this power of regulation permissive on the secretary of state is far too weak <e> <s> the secretary of state should be statutorily bound to introduce regulations either those as at present written into the bill or additions that we may seek to introduce later <e>", "<cs> the minister has made a valid point we do not wish to drive away volunteers <e> <s> however neither do we wish to attract commercial training centres which will try to cream off on certain days of the week <e> <s> i readily withdraw the amendment but i should like to consider carefully what the minister has said <e> <s> i should also like to seek the advice of those bodies which are directly involved the industry and the riders associations <e>", "<cs> i find it very difficult to accept that if this amendment is approved by the committee then that would put back the scheme for years <e> <s> while the minister has been speaking i have not had an opportunity to refer to the guidelines for the pilot autoguide system <e> <s> however as that is being considered surely the department must be considering the nature of the training courses and the question of instructors <e> <s> the regulations which may be made include <e>", "<cs> i must draw the attention of the minister to paragraph b which states that the secretary of state may provide regulations <e> <s> the bill speaks of <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that undertaking <e> <s> in those circumstances i readily withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> naturally i support the amendment to correct an oversight <e> <s> however perhaps i may make a statement about an amendment which i had intended to move the purpose of which was to bring in a new subsection <e> <s> the amendment moved by the minister refers to the production of certain documents <e> <s> i must point out that the amendment which i tabled was also regarding the production of documents <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in the discussion on the amendment and to the minister for his reply <e> <s> i should like to make just one or two comments <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the intervention of the noble lord lord lucas and for the further comments of the minister <e> <s> when i referred to guidance notes i meant the same thing as these guidelines <e> <s> i understand exactly why they are issued and have also read the annexes which i find extremely interesting <e> <s> however

grateful to the minister for his explanation <e> <s> the first observations that he made heartened me <e> <s> he gave an explanation that i understood <e> <s> however the possibility of having two entirely different types of project in the same area rather confounds me <e> <s> perhaps it is because i am unable to understand what can be done with modern technology <e> <s> however <e> <s> the idea that the same infrared lights can be used for one system and for another fills me with a little awe quite frankly as well as the competition between drivers as to which system they will have <e>

definition and what the minister says requires no definition <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that explanation <e> <s> i omitted to refer to a view expressed to us by the parliamentary advisory council for transport safety <e> <s> it has emphasised the fact that the majority of road accidents which occur in residential areas involve the most vulnerable of road users that is children the elderly pedestrians and cyclists <e> <s> therefore road safety is most important in considering on which roads vehicles should travel <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his explanation <e> <s> i shall have to read very carefully what he said <e> <s> i am not so certain that one of the points he made is covered in the bill <e> <s> therefore i shall read very carefully what he said and then decide what may be done at the next stage <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for giving us his assurance that he will look at these points <e> <s> the bill clearly states that the secretary of state can request <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that as long ago as consultants who were appointed by the department of transport recommended the southern route and that their view was accepted by the minister concerned in august <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that if there were any change at the scottish airports it would need to be dovetailed into the national system <e> <s> is it not regrettable that we may have competition between different bodies for these services <e> <s> should there not therefore be some national agreement which is missing from the airports act to avoid that <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister saying as he did in reply to the noble lord lord grimond that should there be failure to gain an amicable agreement between the baa and the caa and despite the opposition of the staff employed the government have no power at all to intervene and would not intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that the <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that this will be the ninth study of transport in london which has

opportunity to deal with both regulations at the same time and i am pleased that we are doing so <e> <s> welcome any steps to consider the environmental impact of <e>", "<cs> my lords in regard to the noble earls reply on local authority representation has <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government accept that it is most important for the success of this venture not just for the people of the south-east but also for those throughout the north the midlands and scotland that it should be achieved with the maximum degree of agreement <e> <s> therefore what steps will the government take to ensure that there is maximum agreement with the people who will be affected by this line development <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked what steps the government themselves would take to try to secure maximum agreement through their own contacts with british rail <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not agreement between the public utilities group and the local authorities and therefore there is nothing which should delay legislation <e> <s> have we not been told time and again that the government sympathise with the recommendations and will introduce them as soon as possible <e> <s> when is as soon as possible <e> <s> further is not the problem of holes in the road referred to by my noble friend lady fisher one reason for the criticism of the maintenance of local roads <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree that his original answer to my noble friend means that the government have no policy at all on endeavouring themselves to get co-ordination between all methods of transport <e> <s> as the question said that would he in the national interest <e> <s> are the government prepared to look into the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the grouping of amendments is that amendment no <e> <s> which has just been moved by the noble lord lord lucas stands on its own and amendments nos <e> <s> and which deal with the question of offences and the necessity for eyesight testing form a separate group <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to keep the house long on this matter <e> <s> when an almost similar amendment was before us at committee stage i said that unless the minister could give good reasons why it should be opposed we on these benches were disposed to support the amendment <e> <s> i fully recognise that our report procedure means that i have to make my comments now before the minister makes his <e> <s> there were suggestions at committee stage i believe they were made by the minister that the last thing the government wanted was to have drivers hanging around waiting for their full licence <e> <s> the minister accepted that <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> my lords whenever the minister promises to review a matter before a next stage we know that he does so and i am grateful to him for doing so on this occasion and also for sending me a letter indicating that he was going to put down an amendment to make this new provision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised at the nature of the ministers reply <e> <s> i disagree with little of what he said but frankly his reply had little to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that detailed reply <e> <s> i can appreciate also the point made by the noble lord lord lucas and amplified by the minister as regards consulting highway authorities <e> <s> one can see the weakness of the provisions in that regard <e> <s> but i hope that overconsideration will not be given to the question of confidence of operators <e> <s> while that is very important confidence of local residents is of equal importance <e> <s> i am glad that consultations with local authority associations are to continue <e> <s> i was possibly at fault when i referred to local authorities too <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister says that there are local authorities which are firmly opposed to the driver information system <e> <s> i have not heard any local authority at meetings of the ama highways committee which i endeavour to attend regularly make such a statement <e> <s> however i shall not state that there is no local authority which objects <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that noble lords listening to the minister will have assumed that he was referring to this particular system <e> <s> we should not bring in the question of opposition <e> <s> i am opposed to government policy on many issues but i am not opposed to the autoguide system <e> <s> that ought to be made clear <e> <s> the local authority association of which i am president and whose members will be covered by the trial areas is wholeheartedly in favour of the system subject to all the safeguards to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall endeavour not to repeat some of the things i said during the debate on rail privatisation on st december <e> <s> sufficient <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to delay the business of the house and the statement in particular but before the minister sits down perhaps i may remind him that this will be the second debate in less than two months in which i have asked about the unions better rail campaign <e> <s> will there be or has there been consultation with the unions <e> <s> if so what are the results <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for introducing the bill <e> <s> i am certain she will agree that the points made by the noble lords who have spoken in the debate will be of great value to the select committee considering the bill <e> <s> however the sponsors position has not been helped by the absence of an all-embracing london authority <e> <s> that was clearly shown by the noble earl lord russell and is evidenced also in part ii of the bill which deals with helicopters <e>", "<cs> my lords there is also the problem of cross-boundary working a point stressed by the noble earl lord russell <e> <s> licensing borough by borough would be almost impossible <e> <s> my most serious criticism is that in framing this part of the bill there has been no consultation with those working in the cab trade either through the appropriate section of the transport and general workers union which has a vital interest in the matter or as i learnt earlier this afternoon through the licensed taxi drivers association <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl undertake to look into the serious position at harwich outlined by my noble friend lord mishcon involving a large ferry company <e> <s> does he recall that in a debate we had recently on crime on the london underground his noble friend sitting next to him lord brabazon made it quite clear that while recruitment was taking place the metropolitan and city police were going to loan police officers to british transport police so that they could be trained <e> <s> is not the important point raised by my noble friend the training of these people at harwich <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to take it from the minister that the government support something along the lines of what my noble friend lady fisher advocated rather than having newspapers containing columns of advertisements placed by private enterprise for the sale of these number plates <e> <s> surely what my noble friend suggests is a far better idea <e>", "<cs> i beg your pardon <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies will he take cognisance of the fact that the house has passed an important amendment which allows for flexibility <e> <s> surely this is a matter which the government ought now to reconsider because it is suggested in the amendment we have carried that there should be a phasing-in process and that the scheme should be introduced in an orderly manner <e> <s> surely the government have changed their brief <e>", "<cs> i hope that noble lords were impressed as i was with the information given by the noble viscount lord craigavon <e> <s> i declare my interest <e> <s> for over years i have been a supporter of what is now a fourth division club <e> <s> it is a club which in the early s was promoted to the first division but did not like it very much and came out at the end of the season <e>", "<cs> i am referring to leyton orient <e> <s> i looked at the clubs programme last saturday <e> <s> it is interesting to see how attendances vary according to the visiting team <e> <s> it is a fact that there are casual spectators attending

used for every home game <e> <s> they are only used when an attractive club is visiting <e>", "<cs> everyone will agree that the facts given by the noble lord lord harris of greenwich are convincing <e> <s> i remind the committee and the minister that the amendment with which we are concerned is related to clause which deals with the designated football match <e> <s> at this stage we do not know who will designate it <e> <s> all the bill says is that an administrator will do it <e> <s> the minister has said that it will be in the hands of the football authorities the league and the fa but we have not yet reached that stage <e> <s> we are dealing now with the important decisions of how a match is to be designated <e> <s> that is the most vital principle in the bill <e>", "<cs> we should have a thorough understanding of what the minister is saying <e> <s> is he saying that if someone without a card goes up to a turnstile to pay his or whatever it might be to enter the ground then he is endeavouring to enter the premises and that is an offence <e> <s> that is what the clause says <e> <s> is the minister genuinely saying that that is the position or will he qualify the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minster able to give information to the house as to the number of listed buildings affected belonging to british rail <e> <s> can he also indicate whether there is a possibility of any major or important projects of british rail that will be affected in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the project outlined in the central london rail study which many noble lords consider necessary will be extremely expensive <e> <s> has not the secretary of state said that any such costs must be met by an increase <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister appreciate that his reply as regards the curtailment of research stations and the transfer to private industry will be alarming to many people <e> <s> what will be the relationship of the industrial research to the two ministries concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset perhaps i may make it perfectly clear that although i speak from this dispatch box i do so in a personal capacity and in no way can i pledge my party <e> <s> having said that i am one who has been heartily in favour of a direct rail link to heathrow for quite a long time <e> <s> i am certain that the great majority of my noble friends would likewise support such a venture <e> <s> i need hardly stress the need for this not only for the assistance to air passengers but the relief that it will give to road congestion in particular the a and the m and the underground <e> <s> i dare say that other noble lords have suffered as i have and have given up preferring to hire a car from my home to take me to heathrow rather than get on the piccadilly line in the rush hour with a few suitcases when other family groups are trying to do likewise <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that detailed answer <e> <s> is it not the case that the london planning advisory committee decided when it commissioned the trrl report that this was the best model available in view of the time factor <e> <s> in a subsequent testing exercise have not the consultants said that they saw no reason to doubt the original decision to use the trrl model <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that the department had commissioned independent consultants to make a further test <e> <s> has that test been set against the original testing exercise of the consultants to the advisory committee <e> <s> did it discover just where the mistakes had occurred if there were mistakes bearing in mind that the trrl is the governments own research laboratory <e>", "<cs> so far i have remained silent on this amendment and i have appreciated the conciliatory attitudes of the minister and those who have put forward the various amendments <e> <s> i also appreciate that we are to take these amendments one by one to see what is the governments attitude and i believe that that is the right course to adopt <e>", "<cs> i too wish to declare an interest <e> <s> apart from being a season ticket holder at years of age i totter down to my local football club with my neighbour who is <e> <s> i cannot imagine either of us getting over the barricades and committing hooligan acts <e> <s> to reject this amendment would be nothing less than bureaucratic <e> <s> before i was a season ticket holder i used to go in the seat stand <e> <s> that sounds a curious thing to say <e> <s> in that stand there were no reserve seats <e> <s> when i looked around me i used to see many old-age pensioners enjoying the match at reduced prices <e> <s> they used to sit in special areas <e> <s> if the government do not like the wording of this provision they should nevertheless agree to consider it <e> <s> they should realise that very few people over i would say none are going to commit acts of hooliganism <e>", "<cs> has the noble lord any evidence from the football authorities of the number of clubs that do not have special gates for old age pensioners and young children <e> <s> has he any evidence of anywhere where old age pensioners who go through a separate turnstile are made to go in a certain part of the ground <e> <s> i am certain that he has no evidence whatever to back those two statements <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to intervene again but clubs will not withdraw their special turnstiles for old age pensioners if this new scheme comes in <e> <s> that system will still operate <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the minister <e> <s> does he realise that there is also a question of replacement of hearing aid equipment often at very difficult times and at weekends which as i know from my own familys experience can be a problem <e> <s> does he recognise that that problem ought also to be considered in the review <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend speaks again can the minister correct a statement i believe he made <e> <s> i believe he said that the club will need to have a photograph and that the details of the guest will be checked <e> <s> however that is totally different from his later reply <e>", "<cs> if the minister gives me an assurance that what i said is incorrect i shall be quite happy <e>", "<cs> in the light of what the minister has said on this amendment perhaps he will look through his replies to amendment after amendment <e> <s> he may then realise the number of occasions where he wishes to have temporary membership cards for particular matches and the number of categories he wants to be guests of the club <e> <s> we have said that the small clubs are in danger and he wants them to keep lists of temporary memberships and guests <e> <s> does he realise what that will mean for small clubs <e> <s> i shall not mention the name of my club which is popularly known but it has an attendance of between and <e> <s> it is one of the few clubs which has a full-time female secretary and also a female assistant <e> <s> i do not have the faintest idea what other clerical staff there are <e> <s> however does the minister realise how much bureaucratic administration special guests and temporary membership will create particularly for the smaller clubs <e>", "<cs> it may be that i did not make myself clear <e> <s> we are not worried about the exceptions but the way in which the minister proposes to deal with them <e> <s> that is a problem which will create difficulties for the smaller clubs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl as i am certain is the house for explaining these orders <e> <s> i have read in complete detail the reports of the three boundary commissions <e> <s> as the noble earl says to a great extent the numbers of the electorates involved are inconsequential <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to complaints from the bus and coach council which were being considered <e> <s> do i understand correctly that section of the airports act makes provision for relevant charges <e> <s> in a later section it provides that if the caa not any other complainant so thought it is empowered to raise the matter with the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> is that the position <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm or deny whether the civil aviation <e>", "<cs> my lords has not the prime minister stated that the costs of the link must be borne by its users <e> <s> if that is correct will the government reconsider the position <e> <s> assuming that there is an environmentally satisfactory link

enable far more freight trains to be used on the existing link and per cent <e> <s> of its freight trains come from beyond the south-east <e> <s> is the new link not of national importance so should not the cost of building the infrastructure be borne by the state as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i supported immediately the amendment moved in committee by the noble lord lord teviot <e> <s> therefore i am very pleased to see this amendment now on the marshalled list <e> <s> when the minister said on report that he would be introducing an amendment we knew he meant to do so <e> <s> we are very pleased to see the text of the amendment here <e>", "<cs> my lords may i without taking too much time reply to one or two of the points raised <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord morris that in certain circumstances we would certainly query giving the secretary of state these wide powers <e> <s> but in the light of the discussions we had at committee and report stages certain assurances have been given by the minister and we are prepared to abide by those assurances <e> <s> we also had long discussions on the various points of importance in the guidelines for autoguide <e>", "<cs> my lords i echo what the minister has said about the way in which the bill has been dealt with by noble lords from all parts of the house <e> <s> i said at second reading that this was a completely non-political bill and that we should be considering it from the point of view of improving the working of the licensing system and the driver information system <e> <s> as the noble lord lord brabazon has said i believe we have made some improvements <e>", "<cs> my lords how can the minister say prior to the outcome of the piper alpha inquiry that the closure of peterhead will not present a problem <e> <s> surely he is making a judgment in advance of what the inquiry may report <e> <s> the inquiry may report a serious need for increased attention to the north sea <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that the minister cannot determine what legislation may be brought forward in the next session but have we not heard before the phrase that legislation will be introduced as soon as parliamentary time allows <e> <s> we are still waiting i believe the noble lord sympathises with us on this after three and a half years for the implementation of the horne report on street works <e> <s> does not the preface to <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that for some years now concern has been expressed by the unions and others about excessive overtime that has to be worked by many members of british rail staff <e> <s> is it not correct that as reported recently there is a per cent <e> <s> shortfall of drivers in network southeast <e> <s> as regards excessive overtime while one cannot comment on the results of the three rail inquiries now taking place is there not some concern at the evidence given of the excessive overtime that is worked and of the bad morale that exists due to the loss of skilled and technical staff arising from low wages to other concerns such as british telecom <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that the question put by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is far from the subject of the original question <e> <s> i referred to the position where there is a transfer of technical staff to illustrate the bad morale that exists in sections of british rail due to the low wages <e> <s> that is the point that should be considered and i hope that the minister agrees with that <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful to the minister for explaining in some detail these two very important sets of regulations <e> <s> i shall be extremely brief in my comments <e> <s> however that does not mean that these benches do not value the importance of the regulations <e> <s> it is not only equitable and a matter of common sense but in fact vital to considerations of safety that these regulations should apply to non-uk ships as such regulations already apply to uk vessels <e> <s> i recall the numerous discussions we had during the passage of the merchant shipping bill in which has now been enacted on these very points <e> <s> we are therefore very pleased that regulations are now being issued <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to understand from the ministers reply that london regional transport did not seek anyones advice before it took this action <e> <s> if that is so will the government give some advice to lrt as to what action it should take if there should be a renewal of this kind of threat <e> <s> further if the threats are taken seriously what action will the government take to ensure that london regional transport reviews its staffing policy to make sure that there is adequate staff in all london underground stations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back on this point but the minister said that the bomb threats were not taken seriously <e> <s> if that is so on what basis was that decision taken <e> <s> from what body did london regional transport seek advice before taking that decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i join other noble lords in thanking dr peter north and his colleagues for carrying out this review of road traffic law which involved some meetings and for presenting at the end of the day a first-class and excellent report of that review <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord brougham and vaux for his timely debate which has enabled us to not only debate the review report but also the governments white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for explaining these two orders and i need not say much about them <e> <s> we recognise that changes have to be made in order to keep level with the rpi <e> <s> as the noble earl rightly said in the case of the european elections while i might have jibbed at deposit i recognise that each european constituency covers the same area as a large number of parliamentary constituencies <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that when this matter was raised by the noble lord lord campbell of croy and myself at the second reading of the merchant shipping act we were greatly reassured by his reply <e> <s> does he appreciate that we also understand his reply today <e> <s> what action will the government take in the event of the european court saying that the action is illegal <e> <s> does <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that despite what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has said up to now the caa has expressed great concern about the possible shortage of airspace capacity <e> <s> that is a problem which still has to be solved <e> <s> is it not also a fact that the select committee on transport in the other place appears not to have taken into consideration whether there will be any change in the estimates of passengers arising as a result of the channel tunnel <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not spoken before <e> <s> therefore i am able to speak on this item <e> <s> i am frankly surprised that the minister has not replied to the direct question which my noble friend put <e> <s> what will be the machinery for determining the admittance of a child whether he is years or years <e> <s> it is not a pernickety matter <e> <s> there has to be some bureaucratic answer to that question <e> <s> if it is to be left solely to the common sense and decision of the gateman many of these other matters will fall into the same pattern <e> <s> what will be the machinery for determining this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords in part of her remarks the noble baroness seemed to be making a second reading speech on the general principles of the bill <e> <s> frankly as one who is well beyond the old age pension scale since i am now in my middle seventies i am amazed to be told that it is patronising for pensioners to be given cheap facilities anywhere <e> <s> i have in my hand my british rail pass <e> <s> i do not live in greater london therefore i am not as fortunate as other members of the house who have free transport in london <e> <s> my district council will not provide it but i have the british rail pass <e>", "<cs> my

turning logic completely on its head <e> <s> i shall not make a second reading speech because i want to keep hooligans out of football <e> <s> however to suggest that giving a membership card to pensioners will help them to keep hooligans out of football seems to me to be absolutely crass nonsense <e> <s> i am sorry to put it as strongly as that <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness lady stedman has said the information given by the minister is extremely interesting and valuable <e> <s> he referred to the fact that the body is an advisory and consultative body <e> <s> is there any proposal to make its decisions mandatory or should a separate <e>", "<cs> my lords these are very important regulations <e> <s> will they be made by affirmative resolution or by the negative procedure

press the minister <e> <s> i appreciate that he cannot give an answer now <e> <s> however this order will be of the utmost importance <e> <s> we do not wish to take up the time of the house having a prayer to annul it <e> <s> will he therefore urge government managers that the order should proceed by affirmative resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the reason for the rejection of the north committee recommendation to which the noble lord lord campbell referred was raised by myself during our debate on the road user and the law <e> <s> i said that far from having their confidence in clamping reduced the great majority of the million owners of vehicles resented the fact that a certain number were getting away with not meeting what was a proper responsibility <e> <s> i am afraid that the noble earls ministerial colleague did not give an answer <e> <s> will the government reconsider the matter because the great majority of the public would appreciate the implementation of the north committees recommendation <e>", "<cs> my lords most noble lords will appreciate the common sense in the ministers reply <e> <s> is he aware that many of us have complained to ourselves time and again about the dazzling which occurs from such rear lights therefore we appreciate the fact that their power will be limited <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord lord teviot for explaining the background to the bill and its clauses <e> <s> i echo what the noble lord said as regards thanking mr timothy kirkhope the member of parliament for leeds north-east who introduced the bill in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords despite what the minister has said is it not the case that the pilots voluntarily agreed that some million from their pension fund should be used for retiring pilots to ensure the smooth passage of the re-organisation under the terms of the pilotage act and that the negotiating forum to which the minister referred did not come into effect until st october <e> <s> my second supplementary question arises from the fact that the ports are now suggesting that half the balance that was present at the end of december which was long before the new forum took effect is to be used not to improve pensions and other benefits but to cut contributions <e> <s> does the minister think that it is fit and proper that the ports should adopt this attitude as they were in no way responsible for building up the balance of million <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the inspectors report dealt mainly with the fact that the expected use of the bridge would require a two-way three-lane bridge rather than two-lane according to the design which the government put forward <e> <s> we were told in a press notice issued in june last year that the review of a new design would take only six months <e> <s> why is it taking all this time <e> <s> is the review also considering the other point in the inspectors report concerning a segregated cycle path <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can say to the minister is will he please take a look <e>", "<cs> my lords i have just asked the minister a question will he please take a look <e> <s> i was very polite and courteous to the minister <e> <s> will he kindly take a look at press notice dated th july <e> <s> i think that he will find that what i have said is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount recall that in our debate on the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any evidence to justify the accusation made by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that the union aided and abetted the two recent strikes <e> <s> is it not the case that the industrial action which may take place next week has been the subject of a proper ballot <e> <s> should our efforts not now be directed to ensuring that <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that if before the negotiations started this morning members of the unions concerned had heard some of the remarks that have been passed this afternoon behind the minister todays negotiations could have been imperilled <e> <s> what we are concerned about is getting the negotiations settled so that we shall not have industrial action next week <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the supplementary question of the noble lord lord campbell of croy <e> <s> is it not a fact that the advisory council suggested that there should be a limit of four hours parking instead of two hours parking on yellow lines <e> <s> that suggestion has been rejected in the proposed modifications <e> <s> consultations will take place with a view to increasing the two-hour limit to three hours <e> <s> the four-hour period was rejected on the ground of congestion <e> <s> will this not affect the attendances of disabled persons at sporting and social occasions <e> <s> there is little difference in congestion as a result of a four-hour limit rather than three hours <e> <s> can this matter not be left to the local highways committee to consider jointly with the police <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble earl lord russell as indeed are other noble lords for putting down this question <e> <s> i shall endeavour to deal specifically with some of the present or proposed items of expenditure <e> <s> i shall do my very best not to stray on to the general problem of transport and management of transport in london because as has already been mentioned i shall be opening a wide debate on such problems on th may <e>", "<cs> my lords is is not a fact that the container of lindane was first lost in international waters in the channel <e> <s> when the container was found it was then in the french area of responsibility <e> <s> is it not of some concern that this should be left solely with the french to determine <e> <s> surely this is of international consequence and i believe the house would like to know on what scientific basis it is judged that there is no further danger arising from the lindane container <e> <s> is it not a fact that the international maritime organisation is to investigate the future carrying and transhipment of hazardous cargoes <e> <s> does that not indicate the seriousness of that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords am i not correct in believing that the proposed directive was the subject of a debate in the other place on th april when there was all-party support for negotiations to remove stricter licensing of minibuses especially in view of the minibuses used in the private sector and in the interests of handicapped and disabled people <e> <s> do the government still insist on both those changes being made to the proposed directive <e> <s> when is the directive likely to be discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords we are certainly grateful to the minister for explaining the order <e> <s> i read the explanatory note on the principal effects of the order then i looked at the size of the order and i wondered <e>", "<cs> my lords i am satisfied that our four-and-a-half-hour debate has served the purpose for which it was intended <e> <s> some noble lords have dealt with the national problems others have dealt with the serious problems in london and yet other noble lords have dealt with problems in other parts of the country <e> <s> we are grateful to the minister for the number of replies that he has given to various points although i am certain that many noble lords would like to reopen the debate having heard some of the statements he made <e> <s> i am grateful to all noble lords who have spoken in the debate <e> <s> more people have spoken in this transport debate than have spoken on many other occasions and that is to our satisfaction <e> <s> i hope that ministers will take heed of the important points that have been made by noble lords dealing with all kinds of matters relating to the important subject of transport <e> <s> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the motion for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the initial reply of the noble viscount <e> <s> can he confirm that under the act of in what i think is section the secretary of state has the power to issue regulations to control the movement of traffic and pedestrians at pedestrian crossings <e> <s> has the use of that power been considered at all <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount appreciate that contrary to the noble lord lord teviot we welcome the statement made by his ministerial colleague mr portillo that he does not propose any changes at all in the legislation in london affecting the relative position of taxi and hire car trades and that we also welcome his praise for the service given by the london taxi service <e> <s> does that imply that there will also be no legislation affecting the act of which there has been some criticism <e> <s> i also ask the noble viscount in the light of the statement by mr portillo which action is being proposed when the london local authorities no <e> <s> bill comes before the select committee clause of which proposes an allocation of minicab licences to each of the individual boroughs in london <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount recall that when the noble baroness and i join in welcoming her return asked the question of th march i also asked about the responsibilities of the caa under the airports act <e> <s> i was informed that the caa had not made any representations to the office of fair trading as has been done by the bus and coach council <e> <s> can the noble viscount say why the caa which has a responsibility for the airports and the passengers as well as the bus operators has not made representations on the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble viscount agree that if there was a general lifting of regulations to provide for such a facility it would make nonsense of the fact that we are still waiting <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount recall that during a previous exchange of questions i referred to a consultation document issued by the caa cap in which the issue of air capacity congestion was stressed as being a most important item <e> <s> i expressed the concern that many european countries seemed to lack a sense of urgency in dealing with the matter <e> <s> i mention that fact because it has now been suggested that delays this year will be due to the lack of adequate aircraft through the grounding of the boeing planes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene yet again in this matter but do the noble viscounts answers mean that the british government have less faith in the development of eurocontrol <e> <s> i understood that that was the position from a recent answer which i was given <e> <s> during that exchange i praised the noble lord lord brabazon of tara for the work that he has done on eurocontrol <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that encouraging reply <e> <s> however may i follow it up with two questions <e> <s> has the noble viscount seen the document issued as recently as may this year by the general council of british shipping <e> <s> that sets out all the fiscal advantages and the amount of discrimination practised by a number of community states <e> <s> does he realise that british shipping does not want retaliatory measures <e> <s> what they want is as the document says a level playing field for merchant shipping <e> <s> can there be some assurance that this will be secured in time for the single market <e>", "<cs> my lords in his first reply the minister dealt with the position with regard to public <e>", "<cs> i am pleased that the noble lord lord mellish spoke in the way that he did <e> <s> i am one of the members of the committee who sat throughout the whole of the second reading debate <e> <s> we have had another second reading speech from the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> he talked about the necessity to retain our competitive position <e> <s> will he outline the position of the netherlands germany belgium and france all of which have some form of dock scheme and would be appalled at the idea of adopting what is suggested in the bill <e>", "<cs> i hoped very much that the noble lord would give way at an earlier stage <e> <s> the last thing i would wish to do is to criticise my noble friend lord mccarthy on this matter <e> <s> i think he is better informed than anyone else in this chamber on these matters particularly as concerns industrial law <e> <s> i was not criticising my noble friend <e> <s> i said it was a pity that we had to take all these or amendments together <e> <s> it would have been good if we could have had a decision on each one but that might have been abusing the time and the privilege of the committee <e> <s> the government and the dock labour board are still free to pick up any suggestions that they wish if we agree to pass the first amendment <e>", "<cs> surely the noble lord is not going to use that as an argument <e> <s> the speech on second reading explained why some of the non-scheme ports developed their trade <e> <s> that is partly because they are close to the continent and also because of the introduction of containerisation <e> <s> the fact that should be a cause for boasting is that the scheme ports despite all the criticism still have per cent <e> <s> of our sea trade <e>", "<cs> i am greatly encouraged by what the noble lord lord rochester has said <e> <s> i only hope that he will go a little further <e> <s> having listened to many speeches of the noble lord on the importance of industrial relations i am certain that if he looks carefully at this amendment he could persuade his noble friends to support it <e>", "<cs> will the minister answer the points made by my noble friend about the community countries which have ratified the convention in particular the netherlands which has the successful and thriving port of rotterdam <e> <s> has he an answer for those points <e>", "<cs> i wish to make one comment in support of the amendment moved by my noble friend <e> <s> the noble baroness lady turner of camden referred to something the minister had said in another place <e> <s> at col of the standing committee in another place the minister stated that because of the way in which the assets were acquired the board may wish to hand them over for less than the market value or even for nothing <e> <s> he further stated that it may be perfectly sensible to do so and that the government will provide for that if the board wishes <e> <s> how does the minister equate that statement with his own statement earlier this afternoon which i think i have taken down correctly that the board will continue until the assets are disposed of in the interests of the industry <e> <s> surely it cannot be in the interests of the industry to have the possibility of disposing of assets even of only million for nothing as the minister in another place said at col <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the answer that he has given to the noble lord lord tordoff is it not correct that the bill provides that british rail must submit its plans for both international passenger and freight transport for the tunnel by the end of this year <e> <s> irrespective of the plans of british rail will the government insist on there being an adequate number of properly sited transhipment centres with adequate roads to those centres in order to achieve the maximum benefit from freight traffic <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government insist that such facilities are provided <e> <s> that is the important point <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has twice stated that the decision is a matter for the borough council <e> <s> yet earlier he said that his right honourable friend the secretary of state gave approval <e> <s> in view of some of the questions that have been asked on pedestrian safety is he satisfied <e> <s> from where did he receive his advice on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister saying that the secretary of state did not take into consideration any question of pedestrian safety <e> <s> is it argued that that is not his job and that he has merely to look at the neighbouring roads <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition to the document referred to by my noble friend lord carter has the minister seen the policy document dealing with improving the pedestrian environment which was issued by the three national local authority associations and published as recently as th june <e> <s> this document contains numerous authentic photographs of obstructions on pavements <e> <s> when the government introduce the street works legislation arising from the home report is it intended to deal also with any law that it may be necessary to clarify in regard to pavements <e> <s> when the government consider introducing their new simple guide to the law in conjunction with the

if one agrees with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that has no effect at all <e> <s> we are dealing with what should happen in the event of the bill passing and there being only one type of port <e> <s> i can see no reason why the government should not accept this <e> <s> i say that for a number of reasons <e> <s> first i looked at the speech of the minister in col where he made a scathing criticism of the position inside the scheme ports <e> <s> if that criticism is justified there must when <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that when i saw a copy of the report of the working party on the east london assessment study i was so concerned that in six of the options there was a dismissive attitude towards parkland walk to which the noble lord lord hunt referred that i wrote immediately to the ministers ministerial colleague the minister for roads and traffic and to the consultants to express my concern at that lack of consideration for environmental issues <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that i asked a question on this matter on th november <e> <s> i referred to proposals that had been submitted by a working party comprising responsible organisations <e> <s> i was told by the noble viscount lord davidson that the matter would be given consideration <e> <s> is the minister aware how extremely disappointing his reply has been as it is in accordance with a letter sent on th march by his ministerial colleague the minister for roads and traffic to the director general of fair trading <e> <s> can the minister tell me what consultation there has been with the organisations which comprise the working party to which i have referred <e> <s> among them are the rac the aa five national local authority associations the institute of trading standards administration the office of fair trading and five motoring trade organisations <e> <s> can the minister not agree that consultation with them is justified rather than offering simply the negative reply which he has given following on the negative letter received from the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to the letter being in the library <e> <s> the minister may be interested to know that i have read it because it was attached to a department of transport press notice <e> <s> in view of the criticisms of a responsible nature of the working party proposals does the minister not agree that those organisations should be consulted <e> <s> they strongly disagree with the viewpoint expressed by the minister and repeated this afternoon <e>", "<cs> as a non-scot perhaps i may intervene for a moment in the light of what the minister said about the national bus company <e> <s> he should add some further points and give some assurances <e> <s> are there not instances of former national bus company regional units buying up or amalgamating with other units of the nbc <e> <s> is there any guarantee under the bill that this will be avoided with the dissolution of the scottish bus group <e> <s> there are a number of instances of regional units of the nbc taking over or merging with other regional units of the nbc <e> <s> i believe that the minister wants to avoid that happening but can he give further assurances before my noble friend replies <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that on th june the noble lord lord hunt tabled a question on the east london assessment study when the minister intimated that the report would be available in the summer presumably july or august and that decisions would then be taken <e> <s> can the minister give some assurance that before decisions are taken there will be thorough consultations on the report <e> <s> if consultations are to take place with whom will they be conducted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to rise again but will the minister clarify what he just said in reply to the last supplementary question <e> <s> i think he said that the studies were not looking at public transport <e> <s> surely the studies will consider all passible options roads environmental questions public transport and all associated matters will they not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord as i am sure are other noble lords for explaining the two orders <e> <s> i can assure him that we give them our full support <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i am grateful to the minister for explaining the regulations <e> <s> as he reminded us during the committee stage of the legislation considerable reliance was placed on the regulations that were to be introduced in order to deal with the various points that were raised <e> <s> the general view was that the bill was so useful that <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble earl for explaining this short but very important bill <e> <s> although he said that there have been consultation and agreement between the parties i am afraid that i must be critical of certain aspects following some of the points raised by the opposition front bench <e> <s> as the division voting record will show there was not wholehearted support from opposition members of parliament in respect of various of its aspects <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down he said that i had no objection to clause <e> <s> i was referring to the raising of election expenses at parliamentary by-elections <e> <s> it seems that he was confusing that with an earlier clause <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister inform us how quickly the inquiry will be conducted <e> <s> can he assure us that it will not take a period of years <e> <s> i have in mind the increasing number of helicopter and light aircraft incidents <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister appreciate from the questions asked throughout the house that there is great anxiety about the matter <e> <s> as the noble lord lord nugent mentioned the issue has been raised on a number of occasions <e> <s> is the problem due to a shortage of trained engineers <e> <s> if so is it not possible for london regional transport to speed up the programme that he said would not be completed until the end of next year <e> <s> that is far too long a period <e> <s> could lrt not engage unemployed engineers working under the supervision of trained engineers in order to speed up this work <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall an excellent leaflet which was issued jontly by the freight transport association and the road haulage association addressed to heavy goods vehicle drivers as part of their road safety campaign in which two slogans were stressed keep to the limit and no need to speed <e> <s> despite the circulation of that document to drivers we still had the figures which the minister has now outlined of more than per cent <e> <s> of drivers exceeding the speed limit <e> <s> have the government in mind any consultation with those two bodies to which i referred and also with the transport and general workers union on the possibility of regulations on limiters <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl refers to the <e>", "<cs> my lords am i correct in assuming that this matter arises from an ec directive but that it will make no difference at all to any tests that may be necessary for drivers who may wish to go into higher classifications <e> <s> i wish to say how grateful i am that the minister has made available some notes on the amendments because when many of these amendments were introduced in another place either in standing committee or on the floor of the house not a word of introduction was given <e> <s> therefore these notes were extremely helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will no doubt have noticed that during the consideration of the amendments in standing commit tee in another place my honourable friend mrs joan ruddock said that the high risk scheme covered only a few of the people involved in drink-drive accidents <e> <s> although she supported the amendment she thought that a great deal more counselling help should be given <e> <s> i was pleased to note that in commenting on mrs ruddocks remarks the ministers ministerial colleague mr peter bottomley minister for roads and traffic agreed that the main thrust should be education and rehabilitation rather than the law <e> <s> can the minister say when steps will be taken to follow up mr bottomleys statement or whether that will be covered during the consideration of certain proposals in the north report <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say how much i appreciate the fact that the government have added this further point to the amendment passed in your lordships house <e> <s> we overlooked the point at the time and i am grateful that it has now been added <e>", "<cs> my lords this is quite an important amendment <e> <s> i assume that consultation will take place before the regulations are issued <e> <s> can the minister say which bodies and organisations will be consulted because the wording of the regulations is of great importance <e>", "<cs> my lords although i admire the noble baronesss tenacity in continually pressing the matter is it not a fact that the second part of her question is important <e> <s> the british airports authority and the civil aviation authority are in complete agreement that there is an urgent requirement to deal with the problem of air space and air flow movement on a european basis <e> <s> i fully support the noble baronesss comments but does the minister agree that despite his efforts in europe there is still a lack of urgency by a number of countries in the development of proper eurocontrol <e> <s> does he further agree that unless that matter is dealt with we shall not overcome the problem of delays of aircraft from this country <e>", "<cs> i follow briefly the noble lord lord ross and the noble baroness lady blatch <e> <s> i ask the minister to consider the four points on which the officer has to report <e> <s> the first is <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the caa in its news release of th july emphasised the uncertainties of forecasting <e> <s> it also said that the further advice which the minister mentioned will be given next summer will include forecasts on air space and airport capacity and will take into account the role to be played by airports outside the south east <e> <s> are not those extremely important matters on which we should await the information from the caa <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful to the minister for outlining the provisions of this order <e> <s> i thought that this might be his last duty as minister in the department of transport <e> <s> however i have seen the appointment of his successor in the other place and i do not know what will be the position <e> <s> during the time that he has handled transport matters the noble lord has always been co-operative and prepared to give advance information <e> <s> while we may have disagreed on policy matters we have always had a good understanding and relationship on transport issues <e> <s> i should like to take this opportunity of wishing him the best of luck in his new position and i congratulate him on the appointment <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a difficult matter to deal with by question and answer <e> <s> are the differences between the baa and the caa as much in conflict as has been suggested <e> <s> i have read all the documents <e> <s> it appears that the baa says that there should be additional runway space but that priority should be given to providing adequate air space whereas while the caa wants additional runway space in the south-east it believes that it must take into consideration the position of regional airports <e> <s> it recognises that air space is finite and therefore believes that there should be an in-depth inquiry into that matter <e> <s> the most important thing surely is to await the caa review <e>", "<cs> my lords i have done my best <e>", "<cs> the committee may know that i am the president of the association of metropolitan authorities <e> <s> i mention that merely to indicate that the passenger transport executives are associated with the ama and we therefore know something of what they are thinking <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the welcome for the governments action already given by two noble lords <e> <s> has the minister seen the report of the working party of the association of metropolitan authorities which looked into the whole question of the transport of dangerous substances by sea <e> <s> if so has a response been sent to the ama <e> <s> if not when will it be sent <e>", "<cs> i rise to speak briefly in support of the amendment <e> <s> i think that perhaps i should also declare an interest in the matter because i have been a member of the aa for the past years and i have also kindly been granted special membership by the rac <e> <s> however it is not because of membership of either of those organisations that if support the amendment proposed it is because frankly these signs are of benefit to all road users <e> <s> surely that is the important consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that we will be debating the order next week <e> <s> however i inform the noble viscount that i have seen the draft order and that i have read the full report of the european court <e> <s> i have also read the news release from maff of th october in which britains fisheries minister says that he does not expect the judgment to have a considerable effect <e> <s> the minister quoted certain conditions which will still apply <e>", "<cs> my lords as i believe most noble lords know i am president of the association of metropolitan authorities <e> <s> am i an officer of the association <e> <s> after years membership of a political party am i to be denied certain activities <e> <s> surely that is complete nonsense <e> <s> the point raised by the noble baroness about the ama was discussed at the ama annual general meeting when i was in the chair <e> <s> the issue was introduced by the minority party and eventually it was agreed that it was a matter for internal discussion within the association <e> <s> it has already been mentioned by my noble friend that the discussion is now proceeding <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord in this amendment <e> <s> he has covered the case and explained its purpose in very great <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down we understand that the information was supplied to the doe by the london boroughs association which is conservative-controlled <e> <s> can he say what reply has been given to the lba by doe officials <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may as i did at the committee stage support the noble lord in his amendment <e> <s> i am not going to repeat all the arguments i put forward on that occasion <e> <s> i think that the committee generally recognised that there were important reasons why we should have an amendment of this kind <e> <s> however there are two questions i should like to put to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful to the noble viscount for explaining this order and for dealing with some of the points which were raised during question time last thursday <e> <s> perhaps i may say at the outset that i am still unhappy with the order but that i appreciate the attitude taken by the government in resisting the application made by the commission to the european court <e> <s> i think that the government took the right stance <e> <s> the attitude i should like to take up in this matter is that of my party in relation to accepting the position of britain within the ec <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies perhaps i could take up the point raised by my noble friend <e> <s> he asked about the nature of the licensing authority <e> <s> i noticed that in the column of <e>", "<cs> my lords i support my noble friend <e> <s> i shall not weary the house by quoting the remarks made by mr peter lloyd under-secretary of state at the home office <e> <s> i can give eight examples from the columns of the committee stage report of another place of the complete confusion there exists over who has authority to determine what should be done in an emergency <e> <s> in some cases it states quite clearly that the authority rests with the police <e> <s> later it refers to the fact that the body responsible is the club <e> <s> then further on we find that it is a question of the club and the police getting together <e> <s> if the minister disagrees with what i am saying i shall with the leave of the house recite those eight points which i have marked <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister encouraged to learn that the piccadilly and northern line users committee by its research work confirmed the figure of per cent <e> <s> if one looks at the figures from the other direction per cent <e> <s> of escalators are out of operation <e> <s> that represents escalators since the total number is <e> <s> is that due to lack of proper planning no finance or shortage of skilled engineers <e> <s> if it is the last mentioned factor what is to be done about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that the house will appreciate the humour of the noble viscounts recent replies <e> <s> however does he agree that there is greater usage of londons underground than ever before and therefore for something in the order of escalators to be out of action at any one time is a very serious inconvenience to travellers <e> <s> that is our concern <e> <s> if that is a consequence of an inadequate period of working time would it be possible to add to the number of skilled engineers <e> <s> if there are not sufficient skilled engineers about i should like to know why <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble viscount for repeating that very important statement arising from a most tragic accident <e> <s> at the outset i should like to join in the expression of sympathy to the families and friends of the people who lost their lives and to those who suffered injuries some of them as the statement says most grievous <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount for explaining the new regulation <e> <s> i wish that the explanatory memorandum made some reference to the fact that an intention of the regulation was to increase both the number of repairers and the competition <e> <s> there is no reference to that in the explanatory memorandum <e> <s> it is a point that i have made on previous occasions <e> <s> i find the remainder of the explanatory note helpful <e> <s> i am glad that the noble viscount has made some reference to that point <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount sits down can he deal with the point that i raised <e> <s> who carries out the checking after calibration and repairs <e> <s> if he does not have the answer can he write to me because somebody must carry through the checking if there is to be control over the repairing <e>", "<cs> my lords if the figures that the noble viscount has given have been achieved is it not because there is a deterrent effect <e> <s> does the minister agree that there is still the problem to which my noble friend referred namely that where there is illegal parking on main highways and bus lanes and also dangerous parking it is far better to remove a vehicle than to clamp it <e> <s> is the noble viscount aware i am certain he will be that when the clamping procedure was introduced in the act one of its main purposes was to catch the persistent offender <e> <s> is he further aware that in the area of the gwent police authority new technology has been introduced called intelligent ticketing terminals <e> <s> the system enables the police immediately to identify the persistent offender <e> <s> will the minister say whether the system is being monitored and whether it is likely to be discussed with other chief officers <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of what the noble viscount has said i shall check my source of information <e> <s> however i have in front of me a leaflet describing the scheme in printed advertising form <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> but is it fully appreciated that the home report was published as far back as november and in their response in july the government accepted most of the recommendations <e> <s> as the minister rightly says a working party has been carrying out detailed discussions among the department of transport the local authority associations and the public utilities group <e> <s> can he give some definite statement that there will be legislation this year <e> <s> not only do street works cause congestion but if there is no action all the work of the working party will be wasted <e> <s> in the past minister after minister not the noble lord has told me in this chamber exactly the same as he has now said that legislation will be introduced as soon as possible yet the impression has been given by the minister for roads and traffic that there will be no legislation this year <e> <s> can the noble lord give me a definite answer <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister appreciate that i regard it as a little unfair to throw back at this side of the house and indeed at his own noble friends the fact that we do not want to be overloaded with legislation and that therefore this item can wait and wait <e> <s> it is five years since the report was published it is four years since the government accepted its recommendations <e> <s> the working party has been dealing successfully with the problems <e> <s> as noble lords on the ministers side of the house have said the matter requires urgent attention in view of the problems of congestion that arise when street works recur in the same area time and time again <e> <s> will the minister take up the matter with his right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount be surprised to learn that this is one occasion on which i completely agree with the reply that he has given <e> <s> i do not know whether he has looked at the question on the east london river crossing put in your lordships house on th april when his noble <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that in a press notice issued by the department of transport as recently as th november it was clearly stated that there are no less than drink-driving convictions each year <e> <s> as he referred to investigations made by the home secretary will the home secretary also take a very careful look if random breath testing is to be introduced which i support to ensure that there will be very sound guidelines for the police to follow that there will be reporting of the progress of random breath testing and monitoring so that a fuller report can be given <e>", "<cs> my lords i consider this debate to be a most important one <e> <s> transport has gradually become a more important subject for debate in your lordships house <e> <s> i wish to try to avoid going over some of the details which i have already raised in our debates on congestion the development of british rail and the channel tunnel and other matters <e> <s> however that does not alter my view of the importance of the report <e> <s> i join with other noble lords in expressing appreciation for the splendid work of the committee and for the way in which the report was presented by the noble lord lord shepherd <e> <s> the way that he presented the report gave us all a thorough understanding of its contents <e>", "<cs> my lords i never referred to centralised planning <e> <s> i referred to co-ordinated planning strategic planning and cohesive planning <e> <s> i have not suggested that one body should decide the way in which i should travel <e>", "<cs> my lords much as we admire the experience and the motor cycling skill of the noble viscount is this not one case where he believes that everyone is as good and as cautious a driver as he is <e> <s> if pedestrians on a traffic light controlled crossing see the traffic moving one way they may believe that they can safely cross over where the lights are red <e> <s> is it not frequently the case that traffic in one lane turns left to the danger of pedestrians <e> <s> this is what i encounter almost every day when i walk past traffic lights in my own area <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble viscount for repeating the statement <e> <s> frankly it is almost a non-statement <e> <s> it contains many words but few positive proposals which we can grasp <e> <s> reference is made to the consultation papers and the four assessment studies <e> <s> an envelope was placed in my hand about minutes ago the contents of which frankly i have not read <e> <s> i do not therefore know what is in the consultation papers or in the assessment studies <e> <s> i do not blame the noble viscount for that but this is the kind of procedure that we have raised on numerous occasions <e> <s> by itself the statement does not convey the full impression of what is being done <e> <s> we need to read the other documents as well and to have them in good time <e>", "<cs> and comfortable transport as my noble friend says <e> <s> i do not wish to begin a discussion on congestion in london because we have had a debate on that but i must make those points <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased about that because this is a quite lengthy statement of five pages <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of what the noble viscount said in his answer can i take it that he is now confirming the point which i put to him during our debate on the infrastructure of the railways <e> <s> it was that the investment of british rail is not funded by the government but is provided by british rail itself from fares and charges and also from land and other asset sales <e> <s> does the noble viscount also agree that the increased investment by british rail is matched by the huge decrease in the public service obligation <e> <s> a statement on the subject was made yesterday by the secretary of state <e> <s> are we not now in the position where britain gives less public support to its railways than any other country in the european community <e> <s> the result is that we have lower wages higher fares and frankly an inadequate railway system <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of what the noble viscount said in reply to the question about investment in would he care to look at column of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i join the noble viscount in welcoming the success of the various series of aircraft made by airbus industrie <e> <s> is it not the case that british aerospace always refers quite rightly in glowing

be published <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister saying that if the btp committee had decided to retain the confidentiality rule and the rule preventing publication no one could overrule that <e> <s> surely a minister could overrule that <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the reply of the noble viscount <e> <s> does he recall that in the letter sent by the secretary of state to the chairman of the civil aviation authority last october he urged that there should be no hurried decisions <e> <s> the words that he used were that there should be no decisions in the margin <e> <s> he made it absolutely clear that there should be no further development on any greenfield sites <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree that clamping is not always and necessarily the wisest policy <e> <s> there may be instances in which clamping can be dangerous and the vehicle ought to be removed <e> <s> are criteria laid down for that situation <e> <s> do i understand from his previous reply that it is left to a local authority to decide whether it shall extend clamping to its area and then obtain approval <e> <s> my own local authority has six very busy shopping areas which hardly see a warden at all and there is constant illegal parking on very busy roads <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i and other noble lords have been pressing the matter for at least the past two years <e> <s> as long ago as the government stated that they accept the recommendations in the home report and that legislation will be introduced as and when the opportunity arises <e> <s> we have been given that answer time and time again <e> <s> as the subject is to be debated next wednesday on an unstarred question will the minister consult his right honourable friend the secretary of state in order to obtain a better answer outlining definite action <e>", "<cs> my lords it is interesting to hear the noble viscounts reply <e> <s> however i have in my files the press notices of january from british railways board and also the department of transport <e> <s> they refer to brb accepting the consortium as the best bidder for the railway works but no reference at all is made in either communication to the price <e> <s> can the minister give a definite undertaking that no pledge was given at the time that the price would not be divulged even though it may be in the accounts of brel for the past year <e> <s> can he say exactly what are the conditions laid down for the clawback to which my noble friend refers <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an interesting debate which has raised several interesting points <e> <s> i want first to make it clear that we on this side of the house shall not oppose the third reading <e> <s> it is not our policy to do so but i shall have some comments to make in that regard before i close <e>", "<cs> my lords i referred to the second reading debate <e> <s> it was only then that by chance the transport and general workers union heard about the bill <e> <s> of course this time they have fully informed noble lords of the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord nugent for giving us the opportunity tonight despite a thinly-attended house to discuss the urgent need for action on public utilities <e> <s> as has been said already the committee was <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble viscount for outlining the purpose of this bill and for doing that so quickly in the light of the debate which is to follow dealing with transport and the disabled <e> <s> in reading the speeches from the other place i believe that there was only one critical speech <e> <s> i do not intend to make a critical speech <e> <s> i also noted that numerous other opportunities were taken in the other place to comment on the work of the caa <e> <s> i do not propose to do that except to refer to one or two items which i believe are relevant to this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add my congratulations to the noble lord lord rockley on his maiden speech <e> <s> i am sure he will not take it amiss if i say that i hope that he will speak on many future occasions on matters on which i agree with him completely <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount referred to the short-term objectives set by the secretary of state in his letter to the chairman of lrt <e> <s> as those short-term objectives include peak capacity reliablity and availability of lifts and escalators why is it that the date for completion of those short-term objectives has been put back as far as march <e> <s> does he agree that those objectives should be completed long before then <e> <s> i further ask the minister whether this increase in fares was discussed with the london regional passengers committee <e> <s> if so what was its attitude <e>", "<cs> my lords without detracting from my noble friends question and the ministers reply does not the incident justify the concern expressed by the officers organisation numast about proposals to reduce various manning levels <e> <s> is it not the case that last year sealink proposed abolishing the rank of fourth engineer whose responsibility is the maintenance and checking of engines <e> <s> is it also not the case that ferry operators have suggested applying to the department of transport for exemption from the necessity of carrying a radio operator on their ferries <e> <s> if that is so will the minister do his utmost to ensure that those two changes do not occur <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that your lordships are grateful to the noble viscount for his explanation of these draft regulations and order and for detailing the main points so clearly <e> <s> the noble viscount said that the orders had been the subject of wide consultation including consultation with political parties <e> <s> i should like to ask whether the parties agreed to the changes or whether there were queries <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount say whether it is proposed that a statement to that effect will in future appear on form a <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not my intention to delay the business of the house for more than a few moments <e> <s> i gave notice that i wished to raise matters relating to this bill <e> <s> i also gave notice to the promoters through their agents of the two matters which i intended to raise <e>", "<cs> i am perfectly happy that my amendments should be considered along with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it may be recalled that at second reading on th february i mentioned that in the debates in another place there had been a number of complaints and criticisms of the work and functioning of the civil aviation authority <e> <s> it was not my intention then nor is it my intention today <e>", "<cs> my lords despite what the noble viscount has said i do not believe that he has quoted fully the reply given by the minister responsible for roads and traffic on th february <e> <s> he said that a fair amount of research had been carried out by trrl and the departments of transport and trade and industry and that no further funding would be given <e> <s> surely it is an important matter that the government should continue to fund despite the present lack of attractiveness of electric vehicles <e> <s> should not the government encourage research and be prepared to fund it <e>", "<cs> my lords reference has just been made to the loss of the lindane containers <e> <s> when the house discussed this matter on th may i asked about the position of the international maritime organisation <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble viscount can repeat what he has said <e> <s> has the matter been raised with the imo since then and has pressure been brought to bear under the international convention <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount take the view that the report of the central transport consultative committee published today belies everything that he has just said <e> <s> that body is the consumers watchdog for british rail <e> <s> in dealing with network southeast the report says that british rail must take another look at its corporate plan <e> <s> the committee

traffic conditions and transport matters my noble friend lord mcintosh of haringey who deals with local government and environmental issues discussed this bill with me <e> <s> he made it quite clear that he will leave part ii on traffic entirely to me and that he has no strong views on any other aspect of the bill <e> <s> therefore the noble baroness need not convince my noble friend lord

ticket barriers being applied at westminster station in the mornings <e> <s> to my knowledge it is not being applied there <e> <s> i asked the minister what the view of the london regional passengers committee is on this situation <e> <s> has the minister any comments on that <e>", "<cs> my lords after the explanatory speech of the noble lord lord jenkin and the explanation of the work of the committee by the noble viscount lord hood there is not a great deal i wish to say on the general scheme <e> <s> on second reading i gave my full support to the proposals and have no reason to change my opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the case for electrification justified by the fact that british rail in its corporate plan which was published as recently as december last year included the midland main line along with the east and west coast main lines as definite routes to assist with the flow of trains from the channel tunnel to the north via the kings cross low level international station <e> <s> in the light of the inclusion of the midland main line in the corporate plan why is there no reference at all to the midland main line in the report which followed the section consultations which set out the british rail routes for international rail travellers to the north <e>", "<cs> my lords first i must congratulate the noble lord lord bonham-carter on the way in which he has presented his bill and on the tremendous support he has received from other noble lords in your lordships house <e> <s> it is my job to endeavour so far as i can to explain the attitude of the labour party to the subject and to the bill before us <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the view of numast the officers organisation well known <e> <s> its report is the result of a two-year study in which

to be framed <e> <s> will the government have made their minds up by the joint meeting of the international maritime organisation and the ilo on this matter which will be held in september <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord marshall for the way in which he explained the purpose of the bill <e> <s> i say at the outset that i wish it a speedy passage through the house <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount sits down perhaps i may make one correction <e> <s> i mentioned that the alterations to the heathrow express railway bill were made by the other place

was not saying that i was critical of british rail <e> <s> i was repeating a criticism of the kent county council <e> <s> i believe as does the noble lord that british rail will do their utmost to develop freight <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that iata published on th april a policy document <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount pass on to the noble baroness my own view that although we do not want delay on the other hand we do not want to find that a decision has been taken on a caa report when the recommendations of the iata policy document may have far-reaching consequences on that report <e> <s> surely that is an important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount confirm that my reading of the act is correct namely that notwithstanding the provision for the five-yearly review the caa may at any time seek reference to the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> secondly am i right in saying that when this issue was first raised i think it was on th march last year i was informed by either the noble viscount or his noble friend lord brabazon that the bus and coach council had sought a reference from the office of fair trading <e> <s> can he say what happened to that reference <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may point out at this stage that i intended at the outset of the debate when dealing with amendment no <e> <s> to state that i was speaking also about my intention to oppose the inclusion of clauses and in the bill but i omitted to do so <e> <s> however in the light of my previous statement i do not propose to press the matter further <e>", "<cs> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords reference has been made to the act <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware that under the transport act

improvements in particular to british rail main line stations does finance play any part in developments in particular of moving stock <e>", "<cs> my lords i heard the answer which the minister gave to the second part of my question <e> <s> however could he answer the first part in which i referred to the disabled persons transport advisory committee <e> <s> how often does it meet and has it met recently with representatives of british rail <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> frankly i am rather amazed at the suggestion that copying directions to the airport manager and the minister agrees that that person is primarily responsible for security could be dangerous to a third party <e> <s> i wonder what the departments justification is for that <e> <s> is it suggested that the wrong person might be appointed as airport manager <e> <s> can we not trust airport managers who are in charge of security to adhere to the directions that may be copied to them from a secretary
