["<cs> my lords i owe the house an apology <e> <s> i failed to attend here in time to hear the opening remarks of the noble lord who has just sat down <e> <s> i apologise for that <e> <s> i must admit that i am unused to a house which has the singular merit of a winding-up speech in a previous debate taking only two or three minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that the original question asked by the noble lord lord campbell of croy was directed towards access to equipment and installations <e> <s> the noble lords reply seemed to say that the learned judge whoever he will be will have the right of access to papers <e> <s> does that mean that he will not have access to installations and equipment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that while the whole house deplores the violence and the looting that took place last evening in bristol the house is also greatly disturbed by it because it brings to an end the period of comparatively sustained calm in this area <e>

this reason <e> <s> i think the public need to be reassured and there is a great danger of various people jumping to as it were preconceived explanations of this trouble yesterday evening unless a fairly high-powered inquiry is set up <e> <s> because it is very disturbing for the country as a whole that this violence has taken place in an area where there has not been as much immigration as there has to other cities in our country <e>", "<cs> my lords on a point arising from the lord belsteads reply i am not disputing in any way that the chief constable on the spot must take the decisions <e> <s> what is disturbing to the public is the reason why he had to take that particular decision <e> <s> it is a serious matter in a british city if the police have to be withdrawn for a number of hours because of any disturbance <e> <s> the reasons underlying that are truly disturbing <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the general tenor of the statement may i ask the minister to say what grounds the government have for thinking that these measures are adequate to deal with this enormous problem <e> <s> if i may put it in three specific points if the building of additional places in prison in the past six years has proved inadequate what hope have they by allowing for places to be provided in the next years of finding that adequate <e> <s> as money has been allocated for reasonably secure establishments for the health authorities and they have almost always spent the money for other purposes what grounds have we for thinking that reasonably secure establishments will be provided for the mentally disorientated <e>", "<cs> my lords it is amazing that the noble lord lord gifford has to ask this question at the present time because i was on the committee in another place in when the children bill as it was then was going through <e> <s> there was no dispute as to the right of the parents to be represented in care proceedings <e> <s> it was only then put as a question of doubt whether the economic circumstances of the country would allow the provisions of sections and of the act to be implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me for intervening will he address his mind to the question which has been raised by my noble and learned friend and myself about the probability of the judge involved becoming in the course of years the

of the points he has made <e> <s> i am sure he will forgive me if i say with respect that i think he generalises a bit too much <e> <s> in fact it is so easy to generalise on these things and having spent a lifetime in practice in the law i would not like to think of the number of murder cases for example in which i have prosecuted or defended <e> <s> the essence of the parole system is that you

of people in this country no longer feel that in order to have adequate financial support for severely handicapped children it should be necessary for their parents their best friends next-door

whole community feels that this should be a priority <e>", "<cs> my lords i also think it was sensible of the government to undertake this review and particularly i would commend and approve the decision of the government to modernise and improve the warning and monitoring facilities if only for the fact that if we are all to be blown to smithereens it will be a comfort to your lordships and to other people in this country to have at least a little warning of it <e> <s> can the minister say whether the million which he says will be the annual expenditure after certain steps have been taken includes expenditure <e>", "<cs> i should like to add to what my noble friend lord cledwyn of penrhos has said and thank the noble lord the minister of state for his explanation of the amendments <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate the government and <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could say that these next amendments relating to wales in the names of my three noble friends and myself will not of course be moved in the light of the amendments already approved by the committee <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord for his comments and i am grateful that he is going to look at the matter again <e> <s> it needs to be looked at again <e> <s> let me emphasise this point <e> <s> in a way every professional body has a vested interest in the complaint before it <e> <s> it is very

noble lord lord belstead did not deal <e> <s> let us suppose that a foreign government complains about a programme <e> <s> it is not libellous otherwise it would be excluded by subsection <e>", "<cs>

annan report <e> <s> yet he gave no reasons at all for the governments departure from the recommendations of annan <e> <s> nor did he deal in any way it seemed to me with the speech of the noble lord

withdraw the amendment but i give notice that if a satisfactory solution is not found then on report stage we will press it to a division <e>", "<cs> i did not intend to speak on this amendment <e>

if the bereaved and the dead are to have a remedy by way of complaint to this commission it is better that the amendment of the noble lord lord morris is accepted <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will give way for a moment i do not think he has properly appreciated the effect of the amendment <e> <s> it does not require the complaint to be published that is dealt with by clause <e> <s> this amendment is concerned with clause which deals specifically with hearings and it is concerned that hearings should be in public <e> <s> clause allows the commission to deal with a complaint if they think fit without a hearing <e> <s> it is not required to be in public <e> <s> the effect of the amendment is simply that if the commission decides there should be a hearing the hearing should be in public <e>", "<cs> i think that this is a very very important issue <e> <s> first may i deal with the point made by the noble lord lord drumalbyn about who can bring a complaint <e> <s> if he will

the situation <e> <s> i shall move amendments nos <e> <s> and and refer briefly to amendment no <e> <s> but leave the meat of that to be referred to by the noble lord lord strabolgi <e> <s> it is subsection of clause that is at the heart of this clause <e> <s> it involves the situation where the dead can complain through their personal representatives <e> <s> i happen to believe that there is a case for amending the laws of defamation so that in fact the personal representatives of a person recently deceased who is defamed might have a right of action <e> <s> i am not alone in that belief and i think that there is a distinction to be drawn between those recently dead and those long dead <e> <s> where the line is to be drawn is a matter for argument <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking for myself i think that the compromise suggested by the noble lord lord belstead on this narrow point of the dead and subsection is about the best that can be achieved in the circumstances <e> <s> i should like to put on record my belief that there are other and much wider implications to subsection than have been dealt with in this very short debate <e> <s> nevertheless having regard to all the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord belstead is a kindly and persuasive man but i am not persuaded at all by him on this occasion <e>

programme and they know exactly what they want to complain about <e> <s> the bill requires the complaint to be made in writing and the complainant must specify exactly what it is the commission is to investigate <e> <s> so <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say that i find the arguments of the noble lord lord belstead very different from those that mr leon brittan the minister of state used in another place <e> <s> he has actually drawn the analogy between a court of law and this commission <e> <s> the noble lord lord belstead knows that that is so <e> <s> i know that here lord belstead has been backtracking on what has been said in another place <e> <s> if i may deal with the points made first the noble lord lord goodman seemed to overlook the point that if the complainant has a remedy at law where for example he has been defamed as in the case of a man whose sexual morality has been impugned by a film or something of that kind then he has no complaint because there is a specific provision in this bill that if he has a remedy at law he has no complaint <e> <s> so we are not dealing with that kind of complaint <e> <s> that matter goes by the board <e>", "<cs> my lords after the remarkable send off from the woolsack it was inevitable that this debate should range far and wide <e> <s> we have heard a moving appeal for example for a less sectarian and more christian approach by both sides in northern ireland an appeal to preserve the theatrical profession the grass roots of which as i understand it apparently blossom in attics <e> <s> but having said that i want to come back to what i thought was a fascinating and diverting speech by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> it was fascinating because of the breadth and height of the canvas on which he painted <e> <s> it was diverting i think because it diverted your lordships attention from what was in the queens speech or more importantly what was not in the queens speech <e> <s> i was not very surprised that at the end he exhorted us to lift our eyes to the stars but of course coming from a rather old-fashioned country wales i know that when we do not like the look of what is before us we lift our eyes unto the hills but i suppose it is more difficult to do that in the metropolis <e> <s> of course if the noble and learned lord assumes that we look heavenwards only at night then in fact one can understand his exhortation to us to look to the stars <e>", "<cs> my lords while from these benches welcoming the form and the reason for the introduction of it may i also draw attention to the third report of the joint committee on statutory instruments <e> <s> i see that the explanatory note attached to the form is entirely in english <e> <s> it consists only of lines and surely it is not beyond the wit and the energy of the translators in the welsh office to translate the explanatory note into welsh <e> <s> if it is necessary for the form to be in welsh as it is in certain parts of wales equally it is desirable that the explanatory note should be in welsh <e> <s> from what the noble lord lord belstead has said i gather that the government are going to consider sympathetically what was said by the joint committee in their third report and as i understand that that committee is currently considering another welsh form concerning housing where it may be even more important that the explanatory note should be given in welsh can the noble lord lord belstead tell us whether the government intend to introduce into that form an explanatory note in welsh <e>", "<cs> my lords assuming that what the district council proposed is lawful as opposed to unlawful can we take it from the attitude of the secretary of state towards this young lady that it is the intention of the government if it is found that the district council is indeed behaving lawfully to change the law <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that the immense amount of money spent on the independent deterrent detracts from our effective defence on a conventional basis which this country sorely needs <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that the paucity of psychiatric secure units is now a national disgrace that people are being sent to prison and kept there when they should be treated in these <e>", "<cs> i agree that the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones has made an unanswerable case for this amendment <e> <s> i believe what worries your lordships house are not so much interceptions made with a warrant but interceptions made without one <e> <s> the noble earl lord gowrie stated that there were cases of warrants issued by the home secretary in the last recorded year which i understand was <e>

the foreign secretary to russia next week as now reported would that not be a very suitable opportunity to raise this case directly and personally with the soviet authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to your lordships and in particular to the noble lord sitting on the government front bench that i missed his speech as i have been at a memorial service at westminster abbey <e> <s>

<s> mr john macdonald the queens counsel who appeared for the barbudans at the constitutional <e>", "<cs> my lords while agreeing that the police must have the equipment necessary to defend society and to defend themselves will the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make a brief comment or two about the speech of the noble lord the foreign secretary which with great respect to him i found singularly unconvincing <e> <s> when he made his attack on the bbc and it was a very scathing attack referring to them beating their tom-toms i am bound to say that i reflected to myself that the foreign office know very well that somebody would be here beating the big drum for them and not the tom-toms <e> <s> so it happened this evening <e>", "<cs> three tanks my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords leaving aside the question of cost is it not wrong in principle that the decision whether or not the child is put in care is often determined by a court without the parents having legal representation <e> <s> if they happen to be inarticulate parents it <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble earl explain why this statement is necessary at all in the first place and secondly why it was necessary to couch it in terms which suggest that the secretary of states decision was entirely justified <e> <s> particularly on the latter point in view of the criticism made by the court of appeal that he did not listen to representations made after the enactment had taken place that is that he relied on a decision he had reached really before the enactment was made is it not dangerous for the secretary of state to indicate that he will reach exactly the same decision when he has not yet considered the representations <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord lord belstead can answer three questions arising from this report <e> <s> first as it is impossible to ask meaningful questions on the conclusions reached by mr dear without reading his report could not the noble lord arrange for a copy of the full report rather than a summary to be placed in the library <e> <s> secondly can he assure the house that all the evidence considered by mr dear was made available to the noble and learned lord lord scarman when he conducted his inquiry in a wider context <e> <s> thirdly was mr dears report made available to lord scarman before he completed his report <e> <s> does the noble lord not appreciate that it is important that this report is available when the scarman report is published and no doubt this house will wish to debate the matter and that mr dears report should also be available <e>", "<cs> my lords the mental health act was in its day regarded as a thoroughly enlightened piece of social legislation <e> <s> its greatest achievement was to remove needless formalities in the admission process <e> <s> but as the years have passed as the noble lord lord renton has mentioned already its reputation for far-sightedness and liberalism has become to look a little exaggerated <e> <s> it did not after all actually cause the fall in the use of compulsion that trend was well under way in the years preceding it <e> <s> although it established mental health review tribunals which at their best provide an admirable review only those patients detained under the longer-term powers could apply to them <e> <s> the very large number of patients detained for -day periods have had no remedy <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that the use of the words by the secretary of state this very serious step is entirely justified <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean the government are unwilling to consider with the bbc perhaps the restructuring of some of their foreign services <e> <s> if for example there were vacancies in this latin-american service could it not be so adapted that there would also be the beaming of some services to spain <e> <s> if restructuring is possible under the limit of the budget which the government have set are the government against the bbc doing that <e>", "<cs> my lords the shortness of the bill raised hopes that this might be a very short debate but the noble lord who has just sat down has obviously devoted a great deal of time and attention to his speech as he has devoted a great deal of time and attention to writing and speaking on these subjects and one sympathises with his viewpoint <e> <s> but i am bound to say that when i received the bill and the supporting memorandum two questions came to my mind first was the bill really necessary and secondly was it wise <e> <s> i must say that my tentative answer to <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much agree with many in fact all the criticisms made by the noble lord lord cledwyn of this order <e> <s> if i may pose a question why is there such a rush to get this through <e> <s> it is a matter entirely of a legislative quirk that the welsh water authoritys structure can be altered by means of an order whereas no regional authority in england can be so altered without legislative action <e> <s> that is entirely an accident <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree <e> <s> if i may paint the proposal in a broader context for a moment given its history that is water undertakings run by private companies and by local government over the years water is now run as a public utility on a national scale <e> <s> one quite understands the reasons why one should look critically and carefully at the way any public utility whether electricity gas or water undertaking is run <e> <s> but why should proposals of this kind be introduced piecemeal <e> <s> surely there is a very good case for investigation by the government into how consumer representation or consumer influence is brought to bear on a public utility <e> <s> for example there is not a great deal of praise i am bound to say for the consumer councils in the gas industry or the electricity industry <e>", "<cs> i very much support the plea made by the noble and learned lord lord elywn-jones that the committee should declare itself on what is a vital matter of principle <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones referred to the fact that today there is a heightened appreciation of the position of a mental patient and it seems to me that that is because we are debating in depth the welfare of mental patients generally <e> <s> it will probably be another or years before your lordships again deal with such a matter <e>", "<cs> i did not intend to speak to the amendment at this stage hoping to hear from the noble lord what the reaction of the government was to the proposal <e> <s> if i knew what his reaction was in principle perhaps i would then be in a better position to deal with the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord elton for dealing with the matter as he did <e> <s> but i find that the answer he gave is very unsatisfactory because i do not think there is justification for section of the principal act as it now stands <e> <s> from my information there are four or five applications made to a high court judge in a year that i think is the maximum in any one year for civil actions and the provision in section is to ensure that no frivolous actions are brought <e> <s> but if only four or five applications are made in a year by everybody detained in mental institutions in this country that does not seem to suggest that that kind of safeguard is appropriate or necessary <e>", "<cs> may i respectfully suggest to the noble lord lord elton that the suggestion just made to him by the noble and learned lord lord renton should be very carefully considered <e> <s> it seems to me apart from anything else if the noble lord is saying that the government are awaiting the decision of the european court that we do not know when that decision will be given <e> <s> if they accept the repeal of section now and are then in a position to bring in their own amendments which can then be considered by this house they will not be in any way prejudicing their own position at strasbourg <e>", "<cs> i respectfully agree that they would he strengthening it <e> <s> it would then be open to this house to consider the governments amendments and whether they could be supported <e> <s> it seems to me <e>", "<cs> i greatly appreciate the degree of care that the noble lord lord elton has given to considering his reply in this

particular significance in the law <e> <s> i said public highway and not public road <e>", "<cs> my lords before i say what i want to say about the amendment may i thank the noble lord lord elton for the very constructive approach he has shown which underlines i think the approach of the house to this problem in accepting certain wording of mine which i put forward as amendments at the committee stage <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for doing so <e> <s> it also illustrates the point that we are very anxious to get the bill right <e> <s> having said that the noble lord is as aware as i am that he did not begin to accept the basic proposition on this clause which i put forward at second reading and which i put forward again at the committee stage namely that the question of who is to decide whether a patient is capable of consenting and whether thereafter treatment should follow should not be left simply to a second medical opinion because the implications are too great <e> <s> i agree entirely with the noble lord lord richardson that this amendment is certainly markedly different from the amendment which we discussed last time <e> <s> we did not come to this and appreciate the point which the noble lord has made <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the noble lord lord renton appreciates that the government amendments nos <e> <s> and simply amend the governments subsection as it is <e> <s> the reason why they would not be called is that amendment no <e> <s> substitutes the wording of the amendment for the whole subsection <e> <s> so further amendment would not be required <e>

<e>", "<cs> my lords i feel incumbent to say a few words on this matter because i devoted the whole of my second reading speech to the principle that it involves and indeed i moved amendments in committee <e> <s> i am totally opposed to the governments view as set out in clause <e> <s> it seems to me that as a matter of principle we should never pass into our law a provision which if misused in a different political climate would enable all kinds of things to be done <e> <s> let us not forget that we are saying that on the view of a second psychiatrist a person capable of giving or withholding consent should be forced to have treatment <e> <s> i should have thought that that principle was all right for some totalitarian countries where we would criticise it very much indeed in a completely different political climate <e> <s> i believe that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance and we should never in this house allow to pass into our law a provision such as is contained in the clause a provision which i do not think is necessary and which is potentially dangerous <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that this amendment encompasses a very sensible suggestion and we on these benches would certainly support it <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect it appears on the second marshalled list of amendments <e>",

fact that the court exerts a very benign influence and is extremely helpful <e> <s> that is my information <e> <s> i do not doubt that in the vast majority of cases the evidence of one medical practitioner is almost certainly enough <e> <s> but there are a few cases where if a person is put under the protection of the court it could be regarded as a deprivation of personal liberty for

on <e> <s> that is the exception at which this amendment is aimed <e>", "<cs> my lords did the noble lord lord elton say that the government have contingency plans or draft legislation to allow people other than judges to pass the death penalty <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount implying that the bbc were deliberately misleading or that they were misleading through ignorance <e> <s> if the latter is the case is it not incumbent upon the ministry of defence adequately to brief the information services so that they do not make misleading statements <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness

principle behind these regulations <e> <s> it seems to us that the fee for planning application <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with the greatest regret that i must dissociate myself from the support for the government expressed by my noble leader and friend lord byers <e> <s> i find it impossible to support him <e> <s> i am totally against any military escalation in the present situation and i speak not as a pacifist but as one expressing quite the opposite viewpoint <e> <s> i have for years been a defence spokesman for my party <e> <s> i have been a great supporter of nato and i was for years

one of the very first points that i made <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount not agree that while we are expressing our great sympathy for those who have lost their lives and been injured and while we are expressing our admiration for the fortitude and skill shown by our forces the government should always keep in mind the objective in the long term that is to get a secure and not a permanently insecure solution for those islands miles away <e> <s> should not the government avoide being carried away by any euphoria and bear in mind always the need for a negotiated settlement that will achieve this end and bear our sacrifices in mind with that objective in the background <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a second reading debate on a bill which in its present form at least is largely non-partisan <e> <s> i am bound to say that i agree with the assessment of the bill made by my noble friend lord wigoder although we have not discussed it that it is a very modest bill <e> <s> it is like most advances if there have been advances in this sphere a patch in the patchwork quilt that passes for penal policy in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords may i echo the expression of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones that the nation has been deeply shocked by this incident and the enormous potential for danger to her majesty involved in it <e> <s> the facts will be revealed later but i should like to ask about one or two matters arising from the statement <e> <s> what time of morning was it when this incident took place <e> <s> there is merely a reference to friday morning <e>

notices that the statement says the man was arrested on friday morning <e> <s> presumably he is still in custody <e> <s> if so have any charges been brought against him <e> <s> has he been brought before a court <e> <s> these matters are obviously of the gravest concern to the country as a whole <e> <s> one can only echo the admiration which has already been expressed about the way in which her majesty dealt with the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the court appearance on saturday was the man charged with an offence committed on th june or was he before the court as a result of the incident which took place on friday morning <e>", "<cs> my lords will not the noble baroness agree that there is a great danger of this country becoming extremely complacent about its security <e>

discharge in his absence to congratulate the noble lord lord rea on his maiden speech <e> <s> his distinguished predecessor and uncle was held in great affection and respect by this party of which he was the parliamentary leader in the house and the quality of the contribution made by his successor to todays debate leads one to believe that he has in him the means of rivalling the respect and affection gained by his uncle over the years in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords does the secretary of state agree that the weakness of the gatt is that the reservations made by this country and by all the other signatories to safeguard their own national interest should trade require it are such because a subjective judgment is taken of those national interests that if they all implemented those reservations we would really be in a protectionist world despite the gatt and was no progress made on reducing the reservations <e>", "<cs> my lords is it any part of the remit of the criminal injuries compensation board to pass comments on the sentencing practice in this country <e> <s> do the government invite these comments to be passed <e> <s> is it right that these comments should be

<s> your lordships may recollect that on thursday th february of this year when this bill was before your lordships for its second reading i explained that the two main purposes of the bill were contained first in part ii to authorise the construction of a bridge over the river severn with approach roads on either side to give access to the proposed multi-storey car park in the borough of shrewsbury and atcham and secondly in part iii to protect the old market square in the centre of that borough <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the county council wishing to pursue their objections i point out that they put in a petition they reached an accommodation with the promoters and the petition was withdrawn <e> <s> the petition was never in fact before the select committee the matter had been agreed and settled prior to that <e> <s> no doubt there are matters of detail which the county council will want to clear up <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would only be patient i will

select committee is saying that it ill-becomes the football club who were going to develop the practice ground themselves for commercial purposes to complain later within two years that the development would affect the practice ground they were going to get rid of it <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may reply very shortly to this amendment i should like to deal with the one point of principle which was raised by the noble earl lord kinnoull <e> <s> that is whether this house has a discretion on third reading <e> <s> certainly i would not argue to the contrary but i think that the conventions of this house are as important as its formal rules <e> <s> i respectfully agree with what the noble lord the chairman of committees said that the speech of the noble lord lord beswick was a typical example of how this house is not equipped to hear evidence <e> <s> he reported on conversations with the directors of the football club <e> <s> the select committee heard the director who owned per cent <e> <s> of the shares and had seen him cross-examined so they were in a far better position to judge what the rights and wrongs were than emerge from the speech of the noble lord lord beswick <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that over a quarter of the annual cost of the national health service seems to be administrative costs <e> <s> if there is to be a cutting down or slimming of services could it be confined to the administration rather than to the medical and associated services <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord renton on initiating this debate <e> <s> it is appropriate that he should do so bearing in mind his distinguished record in this field and his chairmanship of the committee which reported in <e>

in this sphere <e> <s> one can read innumerable articles and innumerable debates in your lordships house and in another place which state the difficulties <e> <s> what i want to state is our approach to the problem and the remedies which we would seek to solve the problems outlined in the noble lords speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to make a very short contribution to this debate <e> <s> i do not wish to stand between the house and the maiden speech of the noble and learned lord lord templeman who must surely be making a maiden speech in an unprecedented situation <e> <s> one is intrigued to know what his views are after years of reflection and contemplation bearing in mind that he was the learned judge at first instance in the <e>", "<cs> my lords if i follow the noble lord correctly

package deal <e> <s> we on these benches would certainly give wholehearted support to the package deal but not to a selective deal of the kind indicated by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also thank the noble lord for his amiable delivery of what is obviously bad news for the ratepayers <e> <s> i want to concentrate my questions on one very short section of his statement which adverts to the suggestion that there should be no rate increases in the coming year and that there could even be a fall in the rates <e> <s> how can the government possibly reconcile that expectation with the fact related in the statement that manpower levels are now down to those of <e> <s> there is a per cent <e> <s> decrease in the central government contribution leaving aside the measures to deal with high spenders <e> <s> there are further duties and responsibilities being put on local authorities <e> <s> there is the rate of inflation which though it has fallen is nevertheless considerable <e> <s> how can they therefore expect no increase or even a very small increase in rates without vicious cutting of the services which would be to the great detriment of the social fabric of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of the statement may i ask the noble lord lord skelmersdale to answer three questions <e> <s> first would it not be fairer in the circumstances for local authorities to suspend any prospective sales of this type of house <e> <s> secondly in view of the likely finding on the further research of the deterioration of these houses may i ask whether the government will undertake to provide adequate means for local authorities to compensate themselves and any people who have purchased these houses in the past <e> <s> thirdly does this not indicate that there may be a need to amend quickly the building regulations and standards required for council house building <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not expected to get to my feet quite so soon <e> <s> indeed i was looking forward to hearing the noble lord lord kagan <e> <s> however i rise to add my voice to that of the noble lord lord donaldson when he sounded alarm bells on this subject and it is important that we should do that <e> <s> in the commissioners of prisons wrote this of grendon <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness the leader of the house not agree that there is scope for shortening questions on statements in the house <e> <s> some of the so-called questions which follow statements from the front bench are inordinately long and amount to speeches rather than questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to associate myself with the expressions of sympathy following the sad and lamented death of michael roberts <e> <s> he came into the house of commons in when i was there and everybody liked him <e> <s> he was by nature a combative character he never pulled a punch so far as i know in politics and he was greatly respected and admired on all sides <e> <s> it so happened that i had a long chat with him at lunchtime last wednesday the day before he died <e> <s> he will be greatly missed not only by his party but in the house of commons and in wales <e> <s> the family had already had a grievous tragedy a few years ago when his daughter died <e> <s> i am sure the whole house will join with the noble baroness lady young in expressing sympathy for his wife so bereaved <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that the foreign offices intransigence in this matter is deplorable <e> <s> it is deplorable from the public point of view <e> <s> i have no interest to declare <e> <s> i was a participant in a wilton park conference many years ago when the powers-that-be considered that i needed a bit of brain-washing on my attitude towards europe <e> <s> i knew mr <e> <s> slack when he was a distinguished headmaster of a famous school <e> <s> but the point at issue in this matter is surely one of principle <e> <s> we are not dealing as it were simply with an economy measure by the foreign office <e> <s> we are discussing a relationship which could have happened in any ministry or with any employer between a very distinguished man and his employers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> he said that no promise was given to mr <e> <s> slack as to the grading of the post <e> <s> but was anything suggested to him not a legally binding promise <e> <s> was there an undertaking given expressly as lord beloff said that if satisfaction was obtained on both sides as it were the contract would be renewed <e> <s> was any suggestion then

in a certain grade and it is said if you give satisfaction for five <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not correct that in for example west germany the actual cost of placing youngsters in vocational training schemes is relatively small as against what we have to pay in unemployment benefit to youngsters who do not have jobs <e> <s> is it not time that we took advantage of the recession at least in order to ensure that our youngsters are all given vocational training which they very much need <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl at the commencement of the th speech bewailed the fact that there was very little left to say <e> <s> i noticed that it did not inhibit him in any way <e> <s> at the beginning of the st speech i am tempted to say that there is nothing else to say nevertheless i will say it <e> <s> in my parliamentary experience over a fair period in the other place and a few years in your lordships house that experience has been enlivened by listening occasionally to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor in one of his more puckish moods <e> <s> we had such a mood today <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble earl agree that one of the worst habits of ministers is to give an undertaking as to their understanding of the meaning of clauses in bills which has no effect whatsoever on the interpretation of that legislation when it later comes to be interpreted by the courts <e> <s> that is the way which is often used by ministers of all parties to avoid further debate on the clauses of a bill <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble minister agree that what is implied in this question is that the independence and discretion of the judiciary should be interfered with and that the implication in this question that that should be done is wholly repugnant to our tradition in this country <e> <s> furthermore does he agree that the implication of the question that crimes of violence which we all deplore can be reduced by this method is completely wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever its intrinsic merits i feel that this debate will prove to be important if and only if as a result of it there is a greater sense within our responsible citizenship of the deep underlying causes of the rise in crimes of violence and i hope that we shall be able to use our influence to persuade responsible bodies and authorities to take the necessary steps to counteract many of the forces which are operating on our society today <e> <s> the most reverend primate in his most impressive opening of this debate said that this house is full of experts on this subject <e> <s> i venture to think though he was flattering to the house that he was entirely wrong <e> <s> there are no experts on this subject either in this house or in any other house <e> <s> for far too long we have <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble baroness agree that the statement allied to the statements in relation to scotland and england and the bill published today bring into high relief the whole future of democratic local government in this country <e> <s> if for example in an economic depression <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor think that the independence of the judiciary is inevitably affected by communication between the executive and the judiciary <e> <s> when the executive seeks to learn of the experience of the judiciary in dealing with certain matters is there a normal means of communication or is it left to informal discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that the benches who have to deal with these matters have to consider and balance very finely the great problem of creating martyrs by simply increasing penalties as noble lords have implied in their questions and that the creation of martyrs in this situation might be the very last thing that your lordships house would want <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord lord prys-davies for initiating this debate and for couching the question in the terms in which he has wide enough to give us scope for a proper debate on this matter <e> <s> i must immediately cross swords with the noble lord lord gibson-watt when he tries to dissociate the government from any responsibility for these cuts <e> <s> surely the afrc is carrying out a mandate given to it by the government and there is of course a joint consultative body which is consulted <e> <s> if he reads the house of commons reports on the financing of agricultural research and development he will read something of the background of this matter which he already knows very well because of his great experience in this field <e>", "<cs> i am grateful my lords to the noble baroness for telling me that but looking at the report of the committee and the list of memoranda and so on included in the minutes of evidence they are not referred to <e>", "<cs> but not published my lords <e> <s> i am grateful for that intervention <e> <s> in many ways it is the most famous plant breeding station and certainly the most famous on grasses after all we are a country that depends so much on grasses and its seems very odd that we did not have the position of the welsh plant breeding station properly considered <e> <s> also it is within my knowledge that in recent times there has been a proposal which was turned down by some of the shrewd farmers on the committee concerned with this matter that the name of the welsh plant breeding station should be changed <e> <s> it was suggested that it be changed to the welsh agricultural research station or the aberystwyth agricultural research station <e> <s> that was an attempt to downgrade the station and treat it as an outlying station which i think the farming members of the committee realised immediately <e> <s> that is the general fear in wales <e> <s> this is the only plant breeding station or institution that is directly funded through the agency of the afrc in wales <e> <s> that compares with many in england and i shall presently come to the position of those institutes in scotland and northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords surely on those figures the noble earl has just given one year and he has not dealt with the cutting out of the barley <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt but it is not right that the speech should continue without the noble earl agreeing that if you add saved on the barley to the other savings that he has already mentioned you get per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords today i am standing in the shoes of my noble friend lord mackie shoes which are rather too large for me and it is the only time that i have intervened on this bill <e> <s> my noble friend told me that he was broadly in favour of the amendment moved by the noble lord lord belstead but having listened to the criticism of the drafting of it by the noble lord lord renton i very much sympathise with the viewpoint of the noble lord lord renton and i think that he is basically right <e> <s> it seems to me that the great danger in drafting this kind of bill is that there are so many lobbying interests that one tends to get a cosmetic bill <e> <s> the interests concerned want to see the words that they have suggested to the minister and were agreed when they saw him privately in his room in print in the bill itself <e> <s> that leaves very bad drafting <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount sits down would be give us the benefit of his experience <e> <s> the term willing has often been used in acts of parliament in the rent acts and so on but it has not been interpreted <e> <s> it has never been held to add anything to the meaning and therefore why should prudent and willing be in at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like the noble viscounts comments on whether the word willing is necessary <e> <s> i know that it is time-hallowed in that it has been in previous legislation but has it ever added anything <e> <s> if a judge or an arbitrator is interpreting the matter why should he be burdened with the word willing <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement made is clearly very important because the importance of this crossing to the economy of south wales cannot be over-estimated nor indeed its importance to the rest of the country <e> <s> therefore i welcome the three assurances that have been given by the government <e> <s> but would the minister deal with one or two matters which are bound to cause some worry <e> <s> first he says that after the work has been done the bridge will provide a safe ready and reliable communications link <e> <s> but clearly it has to be used for the next five years in a more limited way <e> <s> will he confirm that during that period it will provide a safe ready and reliable communications link that though obviously basic remedial work is necessary with its present limited use it is nevertheless a safe means of communication <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister assure us that he will take into account the fact that the sign at the interchange between the m and m is too late <e> <s> surely motorists want the sign one step back from that <e>", "<cs> my lords i would have thought that a state of scarcity is a state of substantial deficiency <e> <s> what does the word scarce mean in ordinary english <e> <s> does it need to be qualified at all <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bancroft speaks with all the authority of a distinguished ex-civil servant <e> <s> i speak as a politician <e> <s> i am sure the government will heed the words that have been spoken by the noble lord lord bancroft <e> <s> however as an old politician i must say that the handling of this affair by the government has been disgraceful and insulting <e> <s> i have looked at the words of the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs reported in <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been following the noble lords argument carefully <e> <s> does he suggest that the amount should be increased <e> <s> is he in favour of this <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the fears of the noble lord lord john-mackie that the result of this bill may be that we do not have any more let land and no more tenancies and that the objects of the bill will fail <e> <s> but in a way that is almost inevitable in a world of inflation where the agricultural economic climate has been fairly good in recent times <e> <s> therefore when land becomes free it is inevitable that the landlord should seek to keep it in hand or to sell it when it comes on the market unless he is very highly motivated to let <e> <s> as i said the other week the difference between a prudent landlord and a willing landlord is a contradiction in terms in the present economic context <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would support this amendment <e> <s> it is important that the smallholdings estate should be maintained <e> <s> i do not appreciate the point made by the noble viscount lord ridley who pointed out that this is a non-statutory duty imposed on a county council <e> <s> that may be so but the situation that would obtain if the amendment were passed would be no different from that which is required in regard to planning matters where the ministry of agriculture has to certify in relation to agricultural land whether they are opposed to it passing out of agricultural use for planning purposes <e> <s> it seems to me that on a like principle there is such an interest in maintaining the smallholdings estate <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i wish to make a short contribution to the debate <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord lord alport from these benches that he has a great deal of support for the bill <e> <s> as he says it is not really a party matter but i commend his approach <e> <s> it is a matter that needs to be dealt with on a national and not on a local basis <e> <s> i am sure of that <e> <s> secondly for people to say that they are in favour of the bill in principle and then to put forward the special type of pleading that we have heard from the noble lord lord john-mackie is something that i am hound to say does not commend itself to me <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us of any instance in our history where there has been a change in local government structure which has actually resulted in savings <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl confirm that the pupil-teacher ratio is at its worst in the deprived areas of this country in the inner cities <e> <s> will he not agree that something has to be done in those areas in particular <e>", "<cs> my lords as there is no commercial reason for increasing gas or electricity prices what reason do the government really give for raising them <e> <s> if it is not indirect taxation through the back door what is it <e>", "<cs> from these benches i too hope that the noble lord lord alport will resist this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that the degree of casuistry involved in the advocacy of the noble earl lord caithness of his amendment was astonishing <e> <s> in modern times and we are really dealing with modern times as the noble lord lord john-mackie has said all you need to do is to use the modern combine cut off the head and you can leave a stubble as long as you like <e> <s> also of course these days very rarely is the stubble burned separately from the straw <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down would he not agree that the bill put forward by lord alport in no way prevents the burning of straw on strawberries and in no way prevents the burning of stubble <e> <s> all it does is to license it <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the late hour i intend to encapsulate my remarks within a very few minutes <e> <s> the noble earl is to be congratulated once again on raising this subject in a form different from that in which he normally raises it <e> <s> i would say immediately that the answer to the question which he has asked must be in the affirmative <e> <s> one would have wished that the government were prepared now to have a new look at the future of the penal system <e> <s> after all the prison service is there simply to serve the penal system <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that there is an urgent case for setting up a departmental committee to investigate immediately the incidence and the nature of piracy in these industries <e>", "<cs> i want to speak very briefly in support of this amendment because it seems to me that unless this amendment or something like it is passed with the present pressures upon our society we shall get that much closer to a national police force which i think would be highly regrettable <e> <s> one of the unperceived achievements of mr arthur scargill is that he has almost built a national police force single handed in our country which is one of the things i do not think he had in mind when he began his present action <e> <s> but one can see that unless the local authorities know where they are in relation to the kind of pressures and the kind of demands that are undoubtedly made we shall have the alternative demand which is for a national police force <e> <s> for a variety of reasons which i do not have to go into now i think that would be a highly regrettable step <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord prys-davies has done a service to wales by raising this particular problem in this committee in relation to this bill because the maintenance of minority culture at a time of modern mass communications is a very very difficult one as we have known in wales for centuries <e> <s> the english are now experiencing it in relation to americanism in their own lives <e> <s> but in fact one of the <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to interrupt again but i want to say that i am almost certain the minister will find that on their expenditure those five authorities cover the majority of the population of wales <e> <s> therefore we are talking about a matter that is very important to the country <e> <s> if i understand him correctly the mover of the amendment has it in mind to avoid the kind of competition that would occur in local authorities between those who are pressing for money to be expended on the welsh language education and those who want to improve the education generally <e> <s> in the county in which the noble lord lord gibson-watt and i live a relatively small minority are welsh speaking and most of them are in my areas of the county rather than in his <e> <s> the powis county council would be faced with an impossible competition and it is that which the mover of the amendment is seeking to avoid <e>", "<cs> my lords to what extent have the government addressed their minds to the probability that whatever the significance of the economic recovery which we all hope will be considerable with modern technological developments there may not be a significant drop in unemployment <e> <s> what do the government intend to do about that <e>", "<cs> my lords anyone who is concerned with the integrity of our trial system in this country and who has practical knowledge of the sophisticated way in which large crime and international crime are organised these days will support the principle behind this bill <e> <s> having said that i must give a more qualified support to it than have my noble friends lord harris and lord donaldson <e>", "<cs> my lords what i hope to do this afternoon is to set out the basic approach that we shall take from these benches with regard to this bill <e> <s> we recognise that from the communitys point of view this is an important bill in both the giving of powers to the police to protect the community and safeguarding individuals within the community from the misuse of those powers <e> <s> there are many good and necessary proposals within this bill which we welcome <e> <s> at the present time there is uncertainty among all as to what exactly are police powers and there are widely differing police practices over the whole range of activities in different parts of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i would accept that <e> <s> but what is more i would expect that when he is in office he would write rather differently from what he writes when he is in opposition <e> <s> however when a government seek to introduce an unprecedented bill which has important constitutional implications and which flies in the face of accepted parliamentary practice and when there is not so much as a hint in the manifesto that this is the intention then they certainly have no mandate for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i am not using the word precedent in the legal sense <e> <s> what i am saying is that if parliament passes this bill the fact that we have passed it will be used subsequently as a justification for action of a similar kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that today we have heard the house at its best and at its worst <e> <s> we heard it at its best when noble lords of all political complexions or of no political complexion tried to elevate this debate into what it deserves to be an important issue which affects all of us by its long-term implications for the constitution of this country <e> <s> we heard the house at its worst when we heard noble lords who for party reasons have been scratching around for plausible arguments to try to justify what they know is unjustifiable <e> <s> the noble lord lord alport absolutely put his finger on it when he suggested that if in fact this bill had been introduced by a labour government many of the members who are trying to justify this bill would have been outraged <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister not agree that there is legitimate concern in all parts of this house that the issue of firearms should be as it were an extraordinary event and not a routine event and that their use should be regarded as quite exceptional <e> <s> appreciating everything the noble lord said about the possible charges that may arise in respect of those people who were within the premises or those who used the firearms would he not agree

assistance i was just wondering whether the noble lord lord elton would regard the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord renton as a compromise on this matter and an acceptable one because on

we support this <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a sensible amendment and i want to ask the noble lord lord bellwin if he has considered this matter <e> <s> the wording of the amendment seems sensible in that it gives him far greater flexibility in dealing with these complicated matters which have been so well described by my noble friend lord evans and by the noble lord lord sefton <e> <s> at the same time it imposes no obligation on him to make the orders at different times but provides much greater flexibility which i should have thought desirable in a complicated issue of this kind <e>",

learned lord to reflect on one matter <e> <s> when he was speaking to the amendment moved by the noble and learned lord lord scarman he introduced reference to his own amendment <e> <s> as i

that the legal profession certainly expected him to do so <e> <s> it is widely thought that he personally has very great sympathy for the law centre movement which has developed apace <e> <s> yet we are all aware of this clash of interests as it were within the lord chancellors department and of the clash of interests between one of the great departments the department of the environment and the lord chancellors department on this matter <e> <s> therefore i believe the time was ripe this evening in response to the question asked by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones for an authoritative statement on behalf of the government as to the future of the law centres <e>", "<cs> my lords the law centres are enabled by virture of an agreement with the law society to advertise very much more than ordinary lawyers are able to advertise <e> <s> they also publicise <e> <s> one of the important functions of the law centres has been to educate and to inform people of rights people who otherwise would not know <e> <s> it is particularly true with regard to such topics as immigration and nationality and the rights of people to obtain a different status within this country <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord campbell of alloway has reflected on what he has just said <e> <s> the noble lord has put forward excuses for proposing retrospective legislation <e> <s> there are always good excuses for retrospective legislation <e> <s> they are intended generally to deal with an existing evil in some way or another <e> <s> but that is no justification for retrospective legislation <e> <s> if the noble lord considers the matter what are the government doing <e> <s> what they are doing i believe because they have not thought out the whole plan for the reform of local government in the metropolitan areas is to resort to unacceptable constitutional practices <e> <s> they are in great danger if this bill becomes law of having entrenched in an important piece of legislation practices that the noble lord lord campbell of alloway would have condemned outright in any other government <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that i do not feel greatly reassured nor did i find the words of the noble and learned lord lord denning in any way reassuring for this reason <e> <s> with the greatest respect it did not seem to me that he had applied his mind to the powers which are exercisable under this bill <e> <s> if he will take a closer look at those powers i am sure he will not agree that they are minor matters at all <e>", "<cs> the orders are to be made under the provisions of clause and i also spoke of course to that amendment <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble lord what i explained at the outset is that my purpose in putting down the amendment was to draw attention to the general plan within the bill for the excessive use of delegated legislation and the nature and quality of that delegated legislation <e> <s> i gave only one example but there are many others <e> <s> it is late in the day and i have no intention of dividing the committee on this matter <e> <s> i simply want to alert the committee to what i believe is a very important consequence of the bill <e> <s> it will enshrine greater powers of subordinate legislation than we have ever had before and it has definitely changed the quality of the legislation that is delegated to a minister <e> <s> no doubt we shall come back to this matter on report and in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord was saying that the government were not prepared to distinguish between drugs and other consumer goods <e> <s> why not <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister not agree that throughout history there has always been a tendency in some quarters to blame juries when there has been a verdict that does not perhaps please the establishment <e> <s> as it was the recent spy trial that gave rise to this question is it not correct that each juror on that panel was positively vetted <e> <s> although i was one of the defending counsel in the case i took no part in peremptory challenges myself nor did i attend a meeting where they were discussed <e> <s> however were counsel in that trial not exercising a right conferred by parliament and reaffirmed only five years ago when the whole matter was debated at length <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble and learned lord agree that it is rather disturbing that after many years of existence the parole board is not given vital information <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that there is very great scope for more business sponsorship in the south-east of england that is in the prosperous area and more scope for public sponsorship of the arts in the provincial centres which are not so well endowed with business <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady macleod raised the point in an otherwise eloquent speech that this was a premature question raised by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> i could not disagree more <e> <s> the shot across the bows to which the noble lord lord elystan-morgan referred was surely on th may <e> <s> the vessel has been proceeding in the same unacceptable direction ever since with no lifebelts and no lifeboats offered by the lord chancellors department <e>", "<cs> my lords if we may now return to this important debate this is an issue that worries people in london and i would guess in the country almost more than any other at present <e> <s> the noble lord lord harris of greenwich in his constructive speech drew attention rightly to the vicious circle that is insufficiently appreciated by the public and indeed by politicians generally the vicious circle that exists in narcotic-related crime <e> <s> it is widely believed that the prevalence of the use of narcotics is linked to idleness either enforced idleness in the case of those who are unemployed or idleness in some instances by choice certainly in regard to those who use cocaine <e> <s> once people are using narcotics they tend to become addicted <e> <s> and once they become addicted as the noble lord lord harris pointed out they need money a great deal of money <e> <s> an average of a week is often cited <e> <s> once they need money the only way very often that they can get it is by resorting to crime <e> <s> we then see the enormous increase in robbery burglary and attacks on ticket collectors and that sort of thing <e> <s> it is a vicious circle <e> <s> it is no use thinking that one agency alone can tackle the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this is not quite dealing with the same point <e> <s> when mr leon brittan for example resigned recently which is perhaps a greater parallel it was because of his own improper authorisation of the leaking of the solicitor-generals letter and not because one of his civil servants had made a mistake or done something improper <e> <s> it was his own act and his own view <e> <s> the noble lord lord carrington was resigning over his own viewpoint and not because of his responsibility within the department <e>", "<cs> my lords the prime minister as has been pointed out did not feel in any way obliged to resign or even take lesser responsibility for the mistakes which she impliedly admits were made by her senior officials mr powell and mr ingham <e> <s> therefore given this climate which is only indicative of a trend the house of commons has been bound to take steps which ultimately suggest that civil servants have an overriding obligation either to parliament itself or to the electorate as represented by parliament <e> <s> civil servants who are increasingly known and named are bound to wish to a degree to co-operate in this process if sometimes they are impliedly or specifically blamed by ministers and are identified because evidence before a parliamentary committee is a very good forum for defending oneself in public <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i never forget lloyd george any more than the noble lord lord cledwyn does <e> <s> but on the other hand unlike him i do not end my life with lloyd george <e> <s> we have moved on a considerable period of time and in ideas since his day <e> <s> but if the prime blame rests anywhere for the breakdown or at least the modification of the so-called whitehall pact it rests with government and the refusal of ministers to accept full accountability to parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down he interrupted me to point to the example of the noble lord lord carrington <e> <s> i was on my feet at the time but i have now given it mature reflection <e> <s> i think that was right <e> <s> it was a genuine example of the acceptance of ministerial responsibility in its fullest sense <e>", "<cs> my lords i have found this debate fascinating <e> <s> i am most grateful to all the noble lords who have taken part <e> <s> i thank the noble lord lord belstead very much for his very full reply and for the courtesy of that reply <e> <s> as the noble lord pointed out the debate attracted the contributions of four very distinguished ex-cabinet ministers and a previous head of the civil service <e> <s> i put this motion down because i thought the time was ripe for such a debate in the cooler atmosphere of this house in the light of events over the last couple of years <e> <s> i regard this debate as a precursor to the wider debate which the noble lord lord cledwyn envisaged in a much wider-ranging sphere <e>", "<cs> my lords on northern ireland the government were asked to think carefully about their next step <e> <s> i hope and trust that the government think carefully about their next step on every issue including the drug trafficking offences bill with which we are now concerned <e> <s> it is very easy for people to use their rhetoric to describe the abominations of drug trafficking <e> <s> it is a very difficult trade with which to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for dealing with this point <e> <s> what worries me is the provision of a penalty if the confiscation is not fulfilled <e> <s> it is up to years as the noble lord pointed out <e> <s> it seems to me that the european court might interpret this as an additional penalty <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord broxbourne said that this was a pale ghost of the amendments tabled by the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not a case of much ado about nothing <e> <s> it seems to me that neither of these two amendments nor the existing subsection is necessary in the bill at all <e> <s> surely when a statute is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the whole house is very grateful to the noble earl lord longford for introducing this subject this evening <e> <s> indeed i could not help thinking as he opened his speech that while he <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says that there is no programme to close rural sub-post offices <e> <s> is it right that there is a policy to close them <e> <s> does he not realise that that causes great hardship in areas where public transport is virtually non-existent <e>", "<cs> my lords when i announced to a group of my friends within the curtilege of this house that i intended to take part in this debate one of them a distinguished ex-teacher ventured a remark to the effect that everybody thinks that he or she can contribute to a debate on education whereas when there is a debate on the law or anything pertaining to lawyers generally only lawyers take part <e> <s> i ventured to reply that if that were indeed so it was regrettable and that lay people have a great deal to contribute to the law <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the condition of our schools and the atmosphere within our schools today are a cause of the greatest concern to many parents <e> <s> most members of this house can afford to send their children or grandchildren to public schools if they choose to do so they can choose to contract out of the state system <e> <s> but how many of us would today pay money to send children to schools in the state sector <e> <s> that is the test <e> <s> yet that is the sector for which we are responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords i have cast aside the speech that i intended to make because it is late on friday afternoon <e> <s> i do not know what it is that invites us all to make longer speeches on fridays than we otherwise might <e>", "<cs> perhaps not all my lords <e> <s> instead i shall make a few general observations on the background to the bill <e> <s> i may first say that i very much agree with the speech made by my noble friend lord hutchinson of lullington <e> <s> i will add just one point that i know he would have added <e> <s> we entirely agree with the noble and learned lord lord scarman that the greatest single improvement to the bill would be an amendment to clause to allow the secretary of state to ban certain marches and protestations <e> <s> i say the secretary of state because that would under the normal procedures of the commons allow emergency debates if approved of by the speaker to be raised to challenge that decision <e> <s> that seems to be an extremely effective way of handling the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords it is obvious that in circumstances of this kind the government in the public interest must err on the side of caution and this the government have done <e> <s> would the noble viscount confirm that there is strict monitoring going on and that in fact the lambs in this and the surrounding areas will be tested again to reassure the public and that the results will be published as soon as it is done <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble and learned lord not reconsider the matter and not deal with it perhaps quite so flippantly as he has done <e> <s> is he aware that this is a matter i believe that is deeply hurtful to the people of wales who regard it as undermining the administrative entity of wales for administrative purposes <e> <s> as the work in this office is as great as it ever was what are the grounds for removing it <e> <s> can the noble and learned lord say with whom he had consultations <e>", "<cs> i very much support this amendment and i do so on rather different grounds <e> <s> when one looks at the wording of clause it is obvious that a serious situation must have arisen <e> <s> first the reasonable opinion of the chief of police must be that the powers under clause are not sufficient to prevent disorder arising if a certain procession is allowed <e> <s> therefore he is enjoined to apply to the local authority or in the case of london to the secretary of state and it is the local authority who make the decision with a supervisory power in the secretary of state <e> <s> it seems to me that this power though a very serious one is necessary if <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl tell the house how the country managed before <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that virtually every civilised country has now a parole scheme and that none of them has ever abandoned it once it has been used <e> <s> does he agree that by the very nature of parole there are bound to be a few failures and that a failure which is highlighted by this horrific case points out that it is relatively rare <e> <s> it points out the general success of the parole system <e>", "<cs> my lords does the leader of the house not agree that the question raises the point of the role of this house <e> <s> there is a tendency to extend the house of commons procedures into this house <e> <s> there is a requirement for a self-denying ordinance on all sides <e> <s> does not the experience of the last couple of weeks suggest that the government are also misusing this house <e> <s> they are virtually completely changing the legislation within this house <e> <s> i would respectfully suggest that there is need for a debate perhaps in the next session on what the role of this house should be <e> <s> because it is going beyond a revising chamber at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord congleton i have no academic or medical qualification justifying my taking part in this debate and unlike him i have no close connection with a university teaching hospital or a university with such a hospital attached to it <e> <s> however i do not think i need any such justification to take part in this debate <e> <s> the noble lord lord prys-davies is not only to be congratulated on drawing the attention of the house to this very important matter but also through this debate alerting the public as it were the potential patients of the national health service who are eventually going to suffer from the crisis that is obviously affecting the medical schools at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i have an interest to declare in that my elder daughter is a speech therapist of five years standing and she certainly would not have forgiven her father if he had not taken part in this debate <e> <s> but i am also very happy to do so because over the years when she was an undergraduate and since i have had occasion to meet speech therapists and students of speech therapy at different stages of their development and not only from this country but from other countries who have stayed with us <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble lord lord jenkins for initiating this debate <e> <s> it seems to have come at a particularly appropriate time not so much because of the affair that is going on in australia but because in the other place there is an early-day motion headed by the very respected former home secretary mr merlyn rees calling for an inquiry into the alleged political surveillance of the noble lord lord wilson of rievaulx when he was prime minister of this country <e> <s> as your <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord the lord advocate aware that in another place yesterday conflicting views were expressed by the solicitor-general for scotland on the one hand and the secretary of state for scotland on the other as to the duties of the lord advocate <e> <s> the solicitor-general expressed the view that it was the lord advocates duty to decide whether the warrant met its purpose and that it was not too wide but the secretary of state seemed to imply that the sole duty of the lord advocate is to authorise the issue of a warrant <e> <s> is not the view expressed by the solicitor-general the correct one <e> <s> is it not a fact that the lord advocate did not see the warrant that he did not ensure that it met its purpose and that it was not too wide in this particular instance <e> <s> is not the view expressed yesterday by the secretary of state in another place incorrect <e>", "<cs> my lords would the lord advocate kindly reply to the specific question asked <e> <s> was the advice given yesterday in another place by the solicitor general for scotland correct <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that there is a perceptible change of attitude particularly among young people towards drug taking and is this not the result of much more publicity being given to its effects <e> <s> are there not signs of resistance in the increased price on the street where the number of purchasers has gone down <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not correct that the judgment of the european court binds every other member of the community and that there has been no kind of discrimination against this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the noble lord for repeating the statement <e> <s> with regard to the three housing issues which are to be included in the bill will he confirm that there will be no retrospective action against councils which have already made deferred purchase arrangements <e> <s> as regards aid to the housing associations will the noble lord confirm that help is to be given to those people most in need the homeless <e> <s> with regard to land registers which is obviously a sensible move will the noble lord confirm that there will be safeguards for those involved in home ownership <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord give way for a moment <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble lord why if his theory is right today it did not work in the s and the s <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble earl lord gowrie began his speech i thought that we were going to listen to a confessional but as he went on it was quite obviously not to be so <e> <s> i agreed very strongly with him on one point the need for much lower interest rates and fixed interest rates possibly for risk capital but otherwise i had extreme doubts about many of the things that he said and i will deal with them perhaps later in my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that that is so but the noble lord knows perfectly well that in answers in this house in speeches on television and so on very misleading figures and non-comparable figures are given <e> <s> whereas changes are sometimes necessary to improve the system or to adjust to radical changes in the economy and the way in which it is organised frequent change such as we have had particularly when the effect has been a substantial downward revision of the estimated number of unemployed following a period of rising unemployment is very suspicious <e>", "<cs> my lords i always listen with fascination to the orations of the noble lord lord paget of northampton <e> <s> i did not quite gather whether he regarded conscription as the ultimate deterrent or not but i entirely agree with one point he made <e> <s> any defence policy must necessarily be credible <e> <s> the real issue before us is what is a credible policy for our time our age given the differences that have now arisen <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house is grateful to the noble and learned lord lord ackner for his speech even though he sentenced us to minutes <e> <s> it was very well worth it <e> <s> he made a point which is absolutely right <e> <s> the problem that has arisen in our prisons and the deterioration of them is due to the increase in crime <e>", "<cs> my lords a welshman is naturally reluctant to intervene on the second reading of a bill which on the face of it applies only to scotland <e> <s> but <e>", "<cs> he has not <e> <s> well i thought he might have my lords <e> <s> added to this it is likely that the administrative costs of collecting the per cent <e> <s> charge from the poorest would outweigh the income generated <e> <s> the tory reform group document says that the per cent <e> <s> charge is effectively redundant and surely it is absolutely right <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister any figures for the services lost in the country nationwide and has he any figures to show whether the average fares have dropped <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first add to the congratulations expressed by the noble lord lord windlesham to the noble lord lord irvine of lairg on his notable maiden speech <e> <s> while keeping within the confines of the convention of not being controversial he showed the power of penetrating criticism <e> <s> and rhetorically i am bound to ask the question if he is as good as this when he is being non-controversial what will he be like when he is controversial <e> <s> we look forward very much to hearing the noble lord again and very soon <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i join with the noble lord lord trefgarne in his expression of sympathy to the families of those who lost their lives and suffered from the damage caused by this terrible flooding <e> <s> i should also like to adopt the questions put by the noble lord lord cledwyn <e> <s> i shall not repeat them but i should like to ask the noble lord one additional question <e>", "<cs> i have considerable sympathy for the amendment <e> <s> it is the most constructive effort that i have seen to deal with this very difficult area of the law <e>", "<cs> i oppose the question that clause stand part of this bill <e> <s> the right of stand by for the crown is a very important right and the equivalent for the crown of the defences right of peremptory challenge <e> <s> if one right is accepted and the other is rejected the balance is lost in our system of criminal procedure <e> <s> to get down to the basics of a trial by jury in this country the aim of a trial is the return of a just verdict according to the evidence <e> <s> in the light of experience and knowledge we believe that the best way of obtaining a just verdict is by means of a jury <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in a quandary over these two amendments <e> <s> the reason is quite simple <e> <s> i was very much in favour of retaining the peremptory challenge knowing as i said on the occasion of my speech in committee that it had been misused <e> <s> in my experience at the bar i have never known the right to stand by for the crown misused <e> <s> on my circuit i have used the right to stand by for the crown more often than i have used the right to peremptory challenge although i did not use either of them very much at all <e> <s> i remember once prosecuting a case and standing by a police informer <e> <s> a senior police officer had told me that the man was a police informer so in order to save him embarrassment i told defence counsel that i stood him by for the crown <e> <s> nevertheless there is a quandary here <e> <s> i entirely agree with my noble friend lord hutchinson about the instances he gave from his experience and i could repeat one or two from mine though nothing like as many that you learned sometimes for the defence of some embarrassing fact relating to a person on the jury panel and the right way of dealing with that was surely to have the right of peremptory challenge <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for informing me of that point <e> <s> all i can say is that there were conventional guidelines conventions that were certainly followed <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that if closures are so imminent that they do not allow consultation that points in the direction of bad administration <e>", "<cs> we on these benches support the amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that as regards this bill a great deal of criticism has been rightly made of the fact that regulations are to be so relied upon <e> <s> i can understand the benefit of secondary legislation when the principles or the guidelines are clearly set out in primary legislation <e> <s> here i think it can fairly be said that the principles that are to guide the lord chancellor are not clearly set out in this bill <e> <s> the least safeguard that can be hoped for is that at least there should be an affirmative resolution of the house for the regulations <e> <s> i do not think it is a sufficient safeguard and it does not obviate the need for setting out plainly in the primary legislation the principles upon which the lord chancellor will frame his regulations <e> <s> but we support the amendment on the grounds that it is at least a safeguard <e>", "<cs> it seems to us on these benches that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has a good point and he has practically convinced us of it <e> <s> but may i express one concern and that is on wardship cases where the child is a party to the case <e> <s> where is that covered in the present provisions <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with the views expressed by the noble and learned lord lord ackner <e> <s> there is a lacuna in the law or in the provisions for testing in the interests of the community the matters

overemphasised the differences as i understood him in his argument against the amendment <e> <s> i come back to the point raised by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> it was a point of detail <e> <s> if it is necessary to deal with the charge that can be made with regard to legal aid there can he another amendment <e> <s> this is a question of principle <e> <s> there is a gap in the law <e> <s> how can an important factor that governs the lives of many members of the community be expeditiously and economically dealt with on behalf of that community <e> <s> there is an overwhelming case for a class action <e> <s> i am not sure that the amendment properly deals with this issue <e> <s> but on the question of principle i entirely agree with the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> should it be necessary to improve or change the amendment on report so be it <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord ackner presented me with an unanswerable case on the principle of the amendment <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect to the noble lord i think that that matter can be dealt with at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the lord chancellor has made a very important statement this afternoon in support of these amendments <e> <s> it is always a matter of concern as to where the distinction should be drawn between those matters which should properly be the subject of affirmative resolution and <e>", "<cs> my lords in the temporary absence of my noble friend lord meston who dealt with this matter during the committee stage may i from these benches welcome this amendment couched as it is in the most felicitous and diplomatic terms <e> <s> the noble and learned lord is to be congratulated on the way that he has solved this problem and met the various representations made to him <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord prys-davies i very much welcome this bill and i do not know of anybody in wales who does not welcome it <e> <s> what i thought was refreshing when i read the debate in another place last evening was the concentration of the present secretary of state on the welsh economy <e> <s> he did not regard it merely as an extension of the british economy <e> <s> he recognised its dependence but nevertheless he treated it as something distinct and separate <e> <s> that is very important in wales because our social and cultural life cannot flourish unless the economy of wales flourishes <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to speak in the debate but several points have been made which i believe require answering <e> <s> i should first like to deal with a point made by several noble lords <e> <s> it is that the violence that has been observed on the west bank was greatly exaggerated by the media and that it was a media creation <e> <s> reference was also made to the fact that journalists were present and that they affected the projection of the violence to the outside world <e> <s> the south african government have always used exactly that argument as regards <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister able to tell us what the german contribution to the same budget is <e>", "<cs> i am in a dilemma over the amendments <e> <s> it seems to me that the only reasons for having any licensing laws are entirely practical ones <e> <s> if everyone was a responsible social drinker there would be no need for licensing laws at all but the truth of the matter is that that is not our situation <e> <s> over the past years alcohol-related problems have multiplied enormously throughout the country and i regret to say more so in wales than in any other part of the united kingdom <e> <s> anyone who thinks that if continuous drinking is available that will result in less drinking rather than more is absolutely deluding himself <e> <s> we know that that is true <e> <s> for example the argument has been put forward in this chamber many times and in every civilised legislature in the world that the more available the drugs are the greater the drugs problem becomes <e> <s> therefore the truth is that the more readily available alcohol is the greater that problem will become <e> <s> this is because a minority of people in this country and in other countries will overindulge <e>", "<cs> yes i shall give way in a moment <e> <s> anyone who thinks that the fact that alcohol is available within the precincts of this place and is not abused is a good example is wrong <e> <s> we are not a normal cross-section of the population <e> <s> we should be fooling ourselves were we to think so <e>", "<cs> scotland like wales has its own problems in relation to drink <e> <s> we do not know how the provision or non-provision of licensing laws is related to our present alcohol-related problems <e> <s> no one knows <e> <s> we know that since alcohol became more available alcohol-related problems have increased <e> <s> there could obviously be a connection <e>", "<cs> i suggest that the noble lord should read the report dealing with alcohol problems in wales published in by the education health advisory committee for wales <e> <s> he will find that the committee thinks that among other matters involved it is not the only one is the availability of alcohol <e> <s> all i am saying is that we do not know the relationship between those factors and therefore our approach must be cautious <e> <s> any government who did not take a cautious approach to this matter would be acting irresponsibly <e>", "<cs> i do not in any way advocate strict prohibition all i am saying is that we would not need licensing laws if everyone was responsible <e> <s> the only reason we have licensing laws is that we recognise that many people are not responsible <e>", "<cs> on the balance of argument i feel that the noble lord lord morris of kenwood is right <e> <s> when magistrates adminster the licensing laws they sit in a different capacity from their normal judicial capacity as magistrates <e> <s> they have the right to move for the revocation of a licence and it appears to me that they should not be prevented from moving for a restriction order <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble earl will forgive me but i think that his argument is illogical <e> <s> to take his example of the licensing magistrate who lives miles away that magistrate can take initiating action by revoking a licence so why cannot he act by restriction order <e>", "<cs> from these benches we support these amendments <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord jenkin of roding has made out a substantial case against the amendment but there is also a substantial case for it <e> <s> i remember that as counsel years ago i made many applications for licences for supermarkets <e> <s> they were unusual in those days <e> <s> one had to satisfy the licensing justices on all the requirements set out in subsection a b and c of the new clause <e> <s> one had no hope of obtaining the licence without satisfying them <e>", "<cs> that may be the theoretical proposition but the practicalities of life in a supermarket are totally different <e> <s> i am not disputing that the best run supermarkets and hypermarkets try to ensure completely adequate supervision but we have to cater in our laws for the average not the best <e> <s> therefore i think that there is a very substantial case to be made for this amendment <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth has raised a substantial point <e> <s> it arises from the modern process of producing non-alcoholic or very low-alcoholic beer from which the alcoholic content has been extracted at a certain stage <e> <s> i am sure that the right thing in these circumstances is for the government to look at it again because it may be necessary to provide a further safeguard by the definition of intoxicating liquor in the original act <e>", "<cs> i shall only detain the committee briefly on this point <e> <s> one of the most interesting <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am the first speaker from these benches to follow the maiden speakers i should like very much to congratulate them on their notable contributions to todays debate <e> <s> my old friend the noble lord lord carlisle of bucklow spoke great words of wisdom and i hope that the government pay heed to what he said <e> <s> my noble friend lord russell made a scintillating contribution which augers very well for future debates in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not put my name down to speak but what was said by the noble lord lord renton a moment ago has provoked me into making an observation which will be very short <e> <s> there is a good deal of sense in what the noble earl lord onslow has suggested <e> <s> i do not see that it in any way detracts from the sovereignty of parliament <e> <s> if parliament decided to change modify or to restrict the private act procedure then it could equally restore it so that it in no way affects the sovereignty of parliament <e> <s> i simply could not follow the argument <e> <s> i normally am able to follow the arguments of the noble lord lord renton but i simply cannot understand him on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not agree <e> <s> parliament has limited its own powers in many ways and in many directions <e> <s> it still does so virtually every day of the year and that in no way affects its sovereignty <e>", "<cs> i rise to support both amendments but to speak only to the second which is the crucial one <e> <s> it is extremely unfortunate that we should be discussing a matter of crucial importance to the future of wales and the welsh language at minutes past four in the morning <e> <s> the government managers should have been aware of the delicacy of the position in wales with regard to the subject of the welsh language <e> <s> the bill is of crucial importance to education in the country at large it is of supreme importance so far as concerns the future of the welsh language <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister explain what is the policy of the government to prevent the spread of aids within her majestys prisons <e> <s> for example is there a policy of concentrating known aids sufferers in the same prison hospitals or are they allowed to remain in separate prison hospitals <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope to press the government to go a little further on this matter <e> <s> if i can give the history of the definition of a welsh-speaking school its significance is that in a welsh-speaking school alone is welsh a core subject <e> <s> it is a definition that meant that when the bill was introduced in another place it required at least two foundation subjects to be taught partly or wholly in welsh <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister consider again the defence of public interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i wanted to ask whether the minister would consider persuading the government to look again at the defence of public interest <e> <s> as he is aware once a jury has retired in this country no judge can control it <e> <s> it is widely believed by those of us who have conducted official secrets cases that juries consider the public interest but put their own interpretation on it <e> <s> would not it be safer for the government to define what the public interest would be within that context <e> <s> will the government consider that matter before the presentation of a bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know how the noble earl lord caithness feels about being cast in the role of the great caesar <e> <s> however from these benches i hope that he will so to speak lend his ear to the arguments which have been proffered in support of the amendment moved by the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the drought in the united states and the forecast of a grain shortage are the government revising that policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his statement <e> <s> is he aware that on the six oclock news the contents of this statement were relayed to the british public <e> <s> does the minister not agree that that is a grave discourtesy to this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply wish to clarify to the house that i was informed by our chief whip that this matter had appeared on the news <e> <s> obviously it can be investigated further <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there are many children in this country who need adequate speech therapy services but who do not receive them <e> <s> is this not partly due to the fact that it is nobodys particular responsibility <e> <s> there is a dichotomy here between the duty of the health authority and the duty of the education authority <e> <s> is it not time that this matter was cleared up properly <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord armstong of ilminster on his maiden speech <e> <s> i can give it no higher praise than to say that it was on a par with a remarkable speech of adjudication i heard recently delivered by the noble lords equally distinguished father sir thomas armstrong at the llangollen international eisteddfod <e> <s> perhaps i may add that whereas i entirely agreed with the father i found that in some parts of the noble lords speech today i did not agree with the son <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm that the report in <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike the noble lord lord stanley of alderley i cannot claim to be a shepherd but i am a sheep farmer in a less favoured area <e> <s> less favoured in this context of course is within the terms of the agricultural policy of the ec <e> <s> i congratulate the noble lord lord gallacher and his committee upon the report <e> <s> i apologise for the fact that my noble friend lord mackie of benshie who was a member of the committee and who would <e>", "<cs> my lords as we abolished the death penalty for most offences in this country in and as the protocol allows for the emergencies of war or the imminence of war why does this country not sign the protocol so that it effectively would bring us into line with other european nations and not invite an annual debate on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords when do the government expect the unemployment figure to fall to the level <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to admit that when i first read this motion in the name of the noble lord lord irvine of lairg i thought that he had put it down with his tongue in his cheek <e> <s> at that time i thought that he could hardly have expected to have the support of no fewer than three noble and learned law lords in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a free market in eggs and do the government not believe that that is the way to achieve fairness to customers <e>", "<cs> my lords i also welcome the bill <e> <s> it is another example of the debt which we owe to the law commission <e> <s> the setting up of the law commissions in this country and in scotland was one of the greatest steps in legal reform in the history of our country <e> <s> last evening i read through the three short reports which are the foundation of the bill <e> <s> as it is not within my sphere of the law i had forgotten about the rule of <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to concentrate on one example of the governments method of conducting relations with foreign countries <e> <s> that is the prime ministers speech in bruges to which reference has already been made <e> <s> perhaps i may reassure the noble baroness lady young that i have a full copy of the speech as issued by the conservative political centre <e> <s> i have not relied simply on newspaper reports <e> <s> i happened to be in europe with a group of british business people when the speech was delivered and there was general alarm and consternation <e> <s> re-reading the speech reinforces the reasons why that would have been so <e> <s> when one reads it one realises that the prime minister was to a large extent in many parts of the speech tilting at windmills <e> <s> for example she said <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell the house how many british nationals are long-term prisoners in turkey how long has the longest been there and are they ever visited <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords not at all <e> <s> i am sure that on reflection the noble lord will agree that he was unfair to the noble earl lord longford <e> <s> i recollect that in i was a member of a committee before i was a member of the other place <e> <s> it dealt with the question of compensation for victims of crimes of violence and its chairman was the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me a particular pleasure to follow the noble lord lord elton and indeed to reflect on the statistics presented to us by the noble lord lord reay earlier that the ratio of prisoners to prison officers was <e> <s> i think i have recollected that correctly <e> <s> as he was speaking i wondered what the ratio was in some of those schools in the inner cities where we have these great problems with year-olds in the classrooms and the teachers <e> <s> it would be very much higher there than in the prisons <e> <s> i therefore wondered as i listened to the noble lord lord elton and to the noble baroness lady faithfull whether we are spending our money at the wrong end <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not correct that the high exchange rate policy of the government whatever other merits it has makes it very difficult for our manufacturing industry particularly a manufacturing industry which seeks to sell within the european community and encourages such manufacturers to seek to manufacture abroad rather than in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords there are three propositions in the motion <e> <s> before i address myself to them i should like to make a few general observations on the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall come to the reason why i express it in this way <e> <s> the point i made is that in regard to certain bodies the urban development corporations for example and the rural development corporation in my own part of the country which is now described under some other name when there was a specific problem one needed to direct funds with no competition for those funds to achieve a given end <e> <s> it is right to say for instance that when the labour government originally set up the rural development corporation in my part of the country it is after all a very liberal part of the country it had an extremely balanced board <e> <s> there was an ex-member of another place mr emrys roberts a one time director of calico printers and an experienced businessman and chairman <e> <s> the noble lord lord jenkin of roding referred to the fact that he had a system run by his civil servants apparently of appointing people to non-elected bodies <e> <s> i do not doubt that ministers of all denominations or parties have shown in the past that they were capable of achieving a balance <e> <s> i accept therefore that there are non-elected bodies that are essential to achieve certain given ends with modern government <e> <s> great care must be taken to make sure that there is a balance when they are appointed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say at the outset that i have an important and longstanding engagement this evening <e> <s> if by any mischance the debate continues beyond the time at which i must leave i apologise in advance for being unable to hear the final speeches <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps he will allow me to correct an impression which he may have given namely that a lay client can directly approach a barrister for advice in this country <e> <s> he cannot do so <e> <s> the professional client other than solicitors and overseas clients can but not a lay client in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way <e> <s> he has referred to the case of the two ladies faced with a great bill <e> <s> it is right to say that there had been a payment into court in that case of a certain sum which they refused to accept <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the noble lord lord thomas of gwydir in congratulating the noble lord lord prys-davies on initiating this debate <e> <s> the noble lord and i were fellow students and i remember that he then hailed from the village of llanegryn in merionethshire and has lived most of his adult life in industrial wales pontypridd <e> <s> so he has knowledge of both sides of welsh life rural and industrial <e> <s> however throughout his life he has always been a stalwart fighter for the rights of wales and for the welsh language and culture <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt that the government have an economic policy at all that is they have a financial policy because as has been stated in the debate they tend to have tunnel vision and to concentrate their minds on the money problem and the money problem alone <e> <s> it is quite obvious that in this country there is a clash of interests in the demand between the city and manufacturing industry <e> <s> the former is short-term the city wants quick profits speculative profits <e> <s> industry on the other hand wants long-term investment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am also grateful to the noble baroness for explaining clearly this dubious scheme <e> <s> it appears that beef producers income is bound to go down as a result of the scheme <e> <s> i believe that the money available would have been better directed at the prime producers of the beef rather than the fatteners <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that it would be a salutary discipline for the police and prosecution service if there were a statutory limit on the time a prisoner could be kept in custody on remand <e> <s> would it not be far better to extend the limits to the whole country with exceptions in certain cases in which a special application would have to be made and grounds for an exception proved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for the indications he has given <e> <s> it was not my intention to press the amendment it was really a probing amendment <e> <s> it is however important that in their code of practice the government should give a clear indication <e> <s> i do not believe that anything less would suffice <e> <s> it is not enough to rely upon the reservoirs being in the national parks <e> <s> it so happens that the areas i have mentioned although beautiful are not national parks <e>", "<cs> my lords to return to the earlier question as i imagine that no one in the house can object to medical aid whatever their other views may we expect an early decision on whether the government will support medical aid for palestine <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government take the view that genocide actually has to be committed before action is taken under the convention when acts which appear to any intelligent observer to be acts preparatory to genocide have already been committed <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i too should like to thank the noble earl for repeating the statement in this house <e> <s> perhaps i may say immediately that i entirely agree with the governments view that there should be a debate in parliament before legislation is introduced <e> <s> i also agree with the remarks that fell from the lips of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones at the conclusion of his remarks <e> <s> nevertheless the report highlights the many difficulties that face this country should we decide to change the law <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that we need national funding for the pure research <e> <s> it cannot all be attributed to near market research <e> <s> does she also not agree that the result of the pure research in agriculture has been of great benefit to this country and to the world at large <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has said that the cegb have already incurred half the contractual costs for sizewell b can the noble lord say what that sum amounts to <e> <s> can he also say what are the total costs which have been incurred so far for hinkley b wylfa b and sizewell c <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may apologise to your lordships for the absence from these benches today of my noble friend lord lloyd of kilgerran who has made a very considerable contribution to your lordships debates <e> <s> he is indisposed and in bed and i have stepped into the breach at very short notice <e> <s> i do not pretend to have any detailed knowledge of company law <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot help noticing that amendment no <e> <s> consists of pages <e> <s> it purports to amend the financial services act which has given such trouble to everyone who has had anything to do with it <e> <s> i was drafted into my present interest in the bill at this very late stage and i cannot pretend that i have absorbed all the detail of the amendment <e> <s> as a matter of principle it seems <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate my noble friend lord ezra on raising this very important question at such a time <e> <s> i am sure that all noble lords in the house are entirely agreed that it is highly desirable to reclaim and recycle waste materials <e> <s> however the point at issue which is posed by the unstarred question is whether her majestys government are satisfied with the progress which is being made on reclamation and recycling <e> <s> i should have thought that it was obvious that they cannot be <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord molloy will forgive me if i do not follow him in what he has said but i am sure that the whole house particularly appreciated his remarks about cambodia as it did the speech of the right reverend prelate the bishop of ripon earlier <e> <s> the house needed to have its conscience quickened as it were by reference to that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that it is now generally recognised that the reforms were a mistake and that much of local government is now administered over too large an area and by authorities that are too remote <e>", "<cs> my lords since i am recovering from a rather heavy attack of flu and for other reasons i shall be very brief in winding up the debate from this bench <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble and learned lord said hear hear perhaps he bore in mind that this debate has been very much a repeat of the debate on the green paper <e> <s> it is a sad reflection that so many people who took up entrenched positions then have had to repeat them today <e>", "<cs> although there are certainly precedents for authorising the amending of primary legislation by means of subsequent statutory instrument i have always regarded it and i think it is widely regarded as an unsatisfactory and sloppy legislative practice <e> <s> it is one which ought not to be encouraged least of all one should think by a lord chancellor <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment by saying that it is a practical amendment <e> <s> the purpose of the clause is to transfer work from the high court to the county court <e> <s> therefore a much greater burden and greater responsibility will be placed on circuit judges <e> <s> it seems obvious to me that there should be a direct conduit between the lord chancellor and the circuit judges <e> <s> the obvious person to fulfil the role of spokesman for the circuit judges would seem to be the president of their council <e>", "<cs> i wish to add a very few words <e> <s> i agree with what the noble lord lord mishcon has said save for one point <e> <s> it is not only a question of money <e> <s> obviously we must do everything we can to support the lord chancellors department in obtaining more money to make the fulfilment of part i of the bill feasible <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government sent any food to romania and if so how much <e>", "<cs> i know that my noble friend lord meston for whom i have the greatest regard signed the amendment but i have always had doubts about it <e> <s> i have always believed that the view of the association of district councils was correct <e> <s> i found the comments of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor most convincing on that point <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reinforce what has been said <e> <s> i supported this amendment and added my name to it because i believed that the meaning was obscure <e> <s> i thought that a safeguard was needed <e> <s> that is why i supported the idea of adding the words <e>", "<cs> i was going to say something very similar <e> <s> looking at paragraph of the white paper it seems to me that it is probably an oversight that this provision was left out of the bill <e> <s> perhaps the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor can indicate his view on this <e>", "<cs> i should also like to congratulate the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor on his reaction to these amendments which is very reassuring <e> <s> however as i understand his response he was only concerned that amendment no <e> <s> m was too restrictive and that he did not believe he should be restricted only to consult the authorised bodies because he might want to go outside that <e>", "<cs> as i understand it as all of the designated judges in a few years time will be solicitors in any event i am surprised that the noble lord lord mishcon suggests that one of them might be eccentric <e>", "<cs> i did not intend to intervene in the debate but i believe that this is a matter which should be left to the new machinery <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon referred to his experience <e> <s> i also have experience because before i was chairman at a quarter sessions where solicitors had an unlimited right of audience <e> <s> during my time there not one of them exercised that right <e>", "<cs> i wish to ask the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor one or two brief questions <e> <s> during his remarks on the previous amendment he said that research carried out by the national consumer council tended to show that first-time buyers young couples do not receive financial advice from solicitors or from anyone else <e> <s> however i would point out that from solicitors they receive legal advice and legal advice has financial implications <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble and learned lord lord donaldson on this point <e> <s> my initial reaction was to be in favour of the amendment <e> <s> however when i look back at my experience of judical review one often has leave from the original judge and finds that by the time one reaches the actual hearing circumstances have changed enormously because affidavits have been <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say that we certainly support this amendment and i need not add to the arguments advanced in its favour <e>", "<cs> my lords it has always seemed to me that the justification for the cab rank rule is that it is a guarantee of the advocates integrity <e> <s> it governs the courts reception of his role <e> <s> judges and juries are used to the role of the advocate in the highest spheres and they know that he operates against the background of the cab rank rule <e> <s> it affects his performance in many ways <e> <s> he knows that the judge and jury do not identify him with his clients case or the views that he is expressing on behalf of his client <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not authorised to speak for the noble lord lord evans of claughton but i know that he would wish me to say on his behalf that i am extremely obliged to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for giving this matter consideration and for bringing forward this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that the situation in manchester appears to have arisen from dangerous people being kept in dangerous conditions <e> <s> would it not be a good idea if lord justice woolf were asked to look at the matter in two segments the immediacy of the cause of the problems in manchester and the broader question which has given rise to the prospect of such outbreaks also taking place in other prisons <e> <s> that is a very much broader question <e> <s> is it not right that lord justice woolf should look at both aspects the immediate problem and the background to it <e>", "<cs> perhaps i also may express disquiet about the words <e>", "<cs> i shall change the analogy although i do not think it is necessary <e> <s> let us take a programme about the guildford four <e> <s> at the time when the programme was made it could have been deeply offensive to public feeling for the verdict of a court in this country to be challenged <e> <s> however because the challenge was persisted with and there were grounds for it it would have been in the public interest for the programme to be put forward <e> <s> yet the duty of the commission would have been to consider whether the proposed programme was offensive to public feeling <e> <s> does the commission consider public feeling at the time or in retrospect <e> <s> public feeling in retrospect might have been quite different <e> <s> i suggest that this form of words is too wide <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord lord renton tell me what either the word true or the word due adds to the concept of impartiality <e> <s> if the amendment merely stated impartiality is preserved would that not cover the case adequately <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> however is he not aware of the views of the chief and assistant chief fire officers association that the move is likely to lead to a dramatic reduction in training for members of fire brigades in the uk <e> <s> as that will impinge on public safety does he not agree that it may well prove to be a retrograde step <e>", "<cs> my lords does that not contrast with the position in west germany where more than two-thirds of the gross national product is accounted for by exports <e> <s> should we not be looking more at the way in which germany achieved that position particularly now that we are within the erm <e> <s> is it not a fact that british industrial production for exports has decreased as a proportion of our gross national product during the past years <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish strongly to support the noble lord lord stanley of alderley in respect of this matter <e> <s> i shall address only for a moment the so-called constitutional problem <e> <s> i do not believe that it exists <e> <s> i should simply like to remind your lordships of what the noble lord lord carrington as leader of the house said on the trade union and labour relations bill on th november <e> <s> we were dealing with an amendment which this house had
