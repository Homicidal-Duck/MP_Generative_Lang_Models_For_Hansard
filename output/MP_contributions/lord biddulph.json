["<cs> my lords several noble lords and good friends of mine have accused me of remaining silent for too long <e> <s> over the years i have listened to the great knowledge that your lordships have on the vast and varied range of matters debated in this house and to the eloquence with which your lordships deliver your speeches <e>", "<cs> i think that is an important point because quite a lot of these cages are situated in estuaries in places where they are subject to storm damage <e> <s> the cages may be smashed and there may be the release of salmon and rainbow trout into the estuary which immediately head for the nearest river <e> <s> these escaped fish are not indigenous to the river particularly the rainbow trout and i think this may cause complications <e> <s> thus i bring up this point of storm damage and the escaping of salmon from these cages <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may get on to the question of drought conditions <e> <s> they vary from river to river <e> <s> but might i suggest that the question of temperature and oxygen content might come into this as well <e> <s> it is quite clear to me that in certain rivers salmon do not run if the water temperature rises above degrees or the oxygen content has dropped <e> <s> it does not matter whether there has been a month-long drought in these rivers because the salmon will still run <e> <s> but if the oxygen content should drop or the water temperature should rise above a certain level they will not <e> <s> so it might help to define this question of drought if these other factors are taken into consideration <e>", "<cs> i must stress again the international implications <e> <s> for the total tweed salmon catch was reduced by per cent <e> <s> while other eastern coastal rivers increased their catches slightly <e> <s> i am sure this is to be attributed to the northumbria fishery <e> <s> i cannot think it could be anything else <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not terribly impressed by the strength of the ministers argument against including my amendment in this bill <e> <s> the problem i have illustrated will always remain and i shall be pleased to hear from him where and when he would anticipate that the problem should properly be taken care of <e>", "<cs> my lords i must support the amendment of my noble friend lord ridley <e> <s> i have personal experience of these very severe drought conditions <e> <s> during the spring and summer months of the western isles and the west coast of scotland experienced a very extended period of drought <e> <s> in particular there was no measurable rainfall from mid-april to th august <e> <s> some noble lords might well remember that fort william which i think has the highest average annual rainfall in great britain actually introduced water rationing <e> <s> loch rhea which is the estuary of the river grimersta and the river blackwater on the isle of lewis had literally thousands of salmon in it at that time <e> <s> they were unable to run the river and move up and down with the tide for a period of about three months <e> <s> they had to wait for the rain to come <e> <s> all the time the numbers of salmon were increasing <e> <s> fortunately the grimersta estate owns the netting rights in loch rhea and no netting at all took place during this period <e> <s> if other parties had either leased or owned the netting rights in the estuary particularly in the estuary they could have made a killing <e> <s> they could literally have netted the entire stock of salmon belonging not only to grimersta but to the river blackwater as well <e> <s> needless to say because of the concentration of salmon poaching became a major problem and the water bailiffs had to mount a day and night long watch to make sure that the salmon were not annihilated <e> <s> i very much support the amendment of my noble friend <e>"]
