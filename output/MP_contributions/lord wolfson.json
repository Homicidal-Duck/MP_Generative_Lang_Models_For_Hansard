["<cs> my lords this is my maiden speech and i am comforted in the knowledge that your lordships have a tradition of tolerance on these occasions for which i am grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply which helps to put in some perspective the intriguing matter of the family silver <e> <s> it is normal business practice to produce a balance sheet and to separate capital transactions from revenue items <e> <s> that is governed by company law and tax statute <e> <s> should not the same relevant information be provided to the public in the annual budget statement <e>", "<cs> after the very stimulating remarks of the noble and learned lords lord simon and lord denning i feel that i am entering a minefield but i do so with my eyes and ears open <e> <s> i think one should get the matter into perspective namely that the sunday shopping bill is about retail trading and is not about cinema ushers nor is it about choir singers <e> <s> i hope that the government will give favourable consideration to the reasoned amendment expressed so sincerely and ably by my noble friend lord renton and supported by the noble lord lord mishcon and the noble and learned lord lord denning concerning the provision of uniform employee protection <e> <s> this does not derogate in any way from the main purposes of the bill <e> <s> indeed i believe that they would be enhanced by removing an obstacle to its harmonious implementation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but can he indicate to what extent he thinks the second oil price explosion was responsible for the very large drop in manufacturing output which did not occur only in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am speaking at relatively short notice in this debate which has been so eloquently and wittily introduced by the noble lord lord barnett i shall be reasonably brief a fact which i know your lordships will welcome <e> <s> i wish to apologise to the house that for family and personal reasons i may be unable to attend the late stages of this very stimulating discussion <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will forgive me <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the governments statement with its forward-looking attitude <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble earl one or two points <e> <s> first would the government be prepared to provide matching funds for very much needed investment in research in the scientific technological and medical areas <e> <s> a lot of this goes on in countries such as america and israel and it does create a stimulus and give universities an incentive to look for additional funds <e> <s> salford was mentioned by one noble lord and they have done extremely well <e> <s> they are obtaining per cent <e> <s> of their funds from the private sector <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment proposed by the noble baroness <e> <s> in human terms it is morally right and this is one of those occasions when both the heart and the head can work in unison <e> <s> i hope the government will agree <e>", "<cs> my lords it is never easy to follow such distinguished and knowledgeable speakers and i do so with great humility and as a businessman with financial interests not with great technical knowledge of the matters in the bill but with a certain degree of knowledge after years of the practical implications of such legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i join your lordships in congratulating the noble lord lord derwent on a notable maiden speech <e> <s> not only was the content excellent but he has such a fine speaking voice that i hope he will exercise if often in this chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not directly involved in the arts world but as trustee of a charitable foundation i have had many associations with a wide variety of projects over the years <e> <s> i know what a very important contribution the broad range of arts makes to our countrys standing in the world and i have considerable respect for those i have met who are engaged in this creative work <e>", "<cs> my lords in following the stars of this important debate and in particular my noble friend lord thorneycroft whose sparkling remarks were a joy to listen to i am conscious that i am rather in a the role of a b-film actor but i am consoled by the fact that some b-film actors have done well <e>", "<cs> my lords in a <e>", "<cs> my lords the result of the general election demonstrated that the electorate wants a market economy based on enterprise and choice one in which an ever-increasing number of people can participate as investors and owners of capital assets <e> <s> there is a desire to see the creation of wealth that will bring broadly based personal benefits with an enhanced and efficient investment programme in the national health service education and housing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for initiating this very useful debate and for giving us the benefit of his expert views to which i have listened carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords the education reform bill is a welcome measure to remedy some of the deficiencies in the existing system and should in time enhance the results which are currently being achieved for the nation and the pupils <e> <s> to paraphrase a well-known expression the bill seeks to refresh those parts that the present arrangements do not reach <e>", "<cs> my lords as one with an interest in catalogue trading i thank the secretary of state for his reply <e> <s> will he keep in mind that a telecommunication-based home shopping system could be the forerunner of an ec single market project in backed by computer link-ups programmed for ordering payment and simultaneous translation <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask has he not made one of the central points of the bill namely that high spending local councils will charge more to the ratepayers <e> <s> they in turn will then wish to examine the policies of the councils <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support this amendment <e> <s> whatever may be the theoretical niceties i believe that the deeply moving speech of the noble baroness lady ryder with her immense practical experience and tireless efforts on behalf of charity must carry great weight in every part of this house <e> <s> i do not think it necessary to add to what has already been said <e> <s> i was very taken with the views of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter and i hope that all parts of the house will support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as something like per cent <e> <s> of local authority expenditure is financed by the exchequer surely we should recognise the fiscal privileges of the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to congratulate my noble friends whose maiden speeches have set such a high standard in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords as approaches what steps are the government taking to improve the <e>", "<cs> i support the aims of the bill but i share the practical reservations expressed by the noble lord who so ably moved the amendment <e> <s> i especially agree that there should be a phasing-in process and that there should be a selective approach <e> <s> i am rather concerned about certain aspects which i hope members of the committee will allow me to mention briefly <e> <s> indeed i am sure that i am not alone in my concern <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that it is a shortage of sites rather than a shortage of sponsors which is causing the programme to be slower than necessary <e> <s> the sites are not being provided by the local authorities as they might have been <e> <s> can he say what the government are proposing to do about the situation <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that there is already a comprehensive body of legislation dealing with acquisitions and takeovers and i am sure that the noble lord lord williams does not wish every acquisition to be referred to the secretary of state otherwise he would be more harried than he already is <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord agree that in many cases employees and shareholders are becoming one and the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos for initiating and so ably introducing this debate <e> <s> perhaps i may also congratulate my noble friend lord trenchard on his thoughtful and informative maiden speech <e> <s> i apologise to the house that a long standing commitment make it difficult for me to remain to hear the final speeches <e>", "<cs> this is a very sensitive and human issue which concerns an indispensable commodity <e> <s> i think that the case has been very well put by the noble lord lord wise and other members of the committee <e> <s> i wish to support this amendment <e> <s> i hope that the government will give very careful consideration to what has been said in all parts of <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the purposes of the amendment on humanitarian grounds <e> <s> the cost would be minimal and could quite easily be saved in other directions <e> <s> the question of priorities is always difficult but i think it is clear that the unfortunate people covered by the amendment are a priority <e> <s> the minister i am glad to note has confirmed this <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may reply briefly <e> <s> i thank my noble friend for his kind remarks but i did suggest that when all the facts were available at the time of third reading that might be the time to consider the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a privilege to follow such a redoubtable speaker as the noble lord lord houghton <e> <s> having listened to his robust views as one engaged in the work of charitable trusts and having spoken in the debate last year i shall try to be concise today <e> <s> once again we are indebted to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for introducing this discussion <e> <s> i am very pleased to note that the noble lord lord nathan is to speak next <e> <s> his father was largely responsible for the act <e> <s> in he drew up the deed for my family charitable trust for which i am always grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i acknowledge being in a minority but the debate is concerned with one of the most monstrous crimes against humanity in history and for the survivors time cannot heal the pain <e> <s> in his moving opening address my noble friend the minister referred to that sad aspect of the subject <e> <s> being a member of the jewish faith although sir <e>"]
