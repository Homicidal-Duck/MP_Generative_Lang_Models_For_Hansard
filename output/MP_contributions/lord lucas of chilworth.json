["<cs> my lords it is my privilege from this side of the house to extend our congratulations to the noble lord lord armstrong on the occasion of his making his maiden speech <e> <s> if i should take up one or two of the points that he made it is not with any intention of inducing into his remarks any note of controversy it is just that i wanted to say some of these things in any event and it should not detract at all from the measured and responsible speech we heard <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords will wish to hear the noble lord lord armstrong again on other occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether it is the policy of her majestys government in regard to increased pay for the armed forces that as a contra local overseas allowances should be cut so in practice nullifying the effect of any increases and therefore exerting a detrimental effect on recruitment to the forces <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i have to thank my noble friend for his answer may i ask him two questions <e> <s> is he aware of the current monopoly position in gasoline production and distribution which is distorting the market and is he able to give an assurance in that statement that this monopoly position will not be extended <e> <s> secondly can he give an assurance that such wider public ownership will be designed to ensure that sufficient of the assets will not fall into any one particular grouping that may have an undue influence in both main and downstream operations <e>", "<cs> my lords further to my noble friends answer to my supplementary question regarding monopolies may i ask him whether he is aware that in their recent report the monopolies commission accepted that there was a monopoly position already existing <e> <s> therefore may i ask my noble friend again whether he can assure noble lords and myself that such a position will not be further extended <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his answer <e> <s> is he able to confirm that some million are lost by evasion and is it not a fact that this would represent about per cent <e> <s> of the existing licence fee of <e> <s> if so would it not be more reasonable to put an end to the evasion before other means of collecting this tax are considered <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to follow the noble lord lord jacques and if i <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that i am glad that at long last we have arrived at this mornings position <e> <s> perhaps it is well to remember that it was some years ago that there was in effect virtual agreement on all sides and we then had the hiatus that has led to the unhappy steps being taken that have rather forced our hand <e> <s> i think it is sad that a major industry has to have its hand forced by what some members of your lordships house might call an outside agency <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his explanation of the bill and for the humour with which he was able to introduce it <e> <s> however the subject is not terribly humorous and i come straight to the point i wish to make which is probably a re-emphasis of the point made by my noble friend lord malmesbury and the noble earl lord grey namely the question of compensation <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the nice things about following the noble baroness lady gaitskell is that one can always congratulate her upon the sincerity of what she has to say even if one does not necessarily agree with it <e> <s> the noble baroness is always sincere in what she has to say <e> <s> however i should like to turn from the more intricate subject of the debate to the rather more ordinary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend lord ferrier will accept that if i knew the answer to that question i might be speaking from there and not from here <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i have <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that the code of practice has so far failed <e> <s> would it not therefore be better to introduce some rules as to picketing in the terms of the employment bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in the name of the noble lord lord greenway on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would not my noble friend agree that whether we like it or not there is a case to be put for increased axle weights <e> <s> whether or not noble lords agree with the case is another matter but their case should be put within the context of the armitage report and an opportunity then given for a public and then perhaps a parliamentary debate on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i start from much the same position as the noble baroness in questioning whether the airports are for the benefit of the people who use them the passengers <e>", "<cs> i think that one must understand what a colony is <e> <s> my noble friend will correct me if i am wrong but i understand that a colony is a working hive so that if one has hives all populated with bees then one has colonies <e> <s> at a time that is quite a lot of money <e> <s> it is my understanding that many amateurs many hobbyists as well as commercial beekeepers would not exist on one colony or on two <e> <s> the number of hives is probably something between and and the very big ones might go up to <e> <s> if i am wrong no doubt my noble friend lord malmesbury will correct me <e> <s> we are not talking about small amounts of money which today could reasonably be expected to be borne by the beekeepers <e> <s> hitherto american foulbrood and english foulbrood diseases have been borne by the beekeeper <e> <s> at that time the amount of money involved was considerably less <e>", "<cs> we have had a rather unprecedented session on this bill which belies its smallness and certainly emphasises its importance <e> <s> until my noble friend lord ferrers made his last few remarks i was thinking that perhaps it might be as well having aired it to leave it be <e> <s> however he himself has rather determined my attitude because i think it is totally and absolutely and grossly unfair that he should stand here and say that because of a variety of reasons notably the exchequer your lordships in committee may not do the job they think they should be doing <e> <s> i would challenge him right now what do her majestys government think the exchequer liability might be <e> <s> have they no faith in the measures which are set out in this bill and which are going to be implemented by order at some time <e> <s> do they fear that the disease may slip through <e> <s> if so perhaps we might look to them for not having provided adequate measures for which there is power in this bill as a result of which healthy stock has been destroyed and a great amount of farming industry has also been lost <e>", "<cs> i beg to move the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i start this evening from a viewpoint rather different from the one i had earlier this afternoon because it seems to me that running through our debate is the theme of urgency not only urgency in so far as the overall problem is concerned but urgency to deal one way or the other with the finniston report <e> <s> i find it quite extraordinary that the department of industry can really expect the institutions to respond to the report published just a few weeks ago by st april <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord lord shackleton has correctly identified the quotation <e>", "<cs> it is on page the second paragraph <e> <s> the actual quotation is on page of the summary <e>", "<cs> i did say that it was in the summary <e>", "<cs> my lords turning to the new degree structure and having already introduced that by virtue of speaking about the conference in october i find at this stage that my thinking runs that creating a new as it were elitist degree could seriously put in imbalance those awards in other disciplines <e> <s> i should think that the argument as between degree awards as a result of purpose training and purely for scholarship the point made by the noble lord lord scanlon in his very interesting maiden speech might be destroyed <e> <s> it seems to me here that this sets another hare running whereas the degree award system as between one discipline and another might well be complementary and i find myself more in agreement with what was said by the noble lord lord howie of troon on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords may i at the outset offer congratulations to my noble friend the minister on his first presentation of a major bill from the dispatch box <e> <s> at the same time it would be ungracious of me not to offer congratulations also to the noble lord lord underhill on the other side of the house although i cannot say that i am going to follow him too closely in his arguments <e> <s> although he certainly deployed an argument he did not in any way i thought demolish that of my noble friend from this side of the house <e>", "<cs> because it is so expensive <e>", "<cs> my lords will her majestys government consider using their best endeavours to have car parking arrangements that is for time and money suspended during that day so that those who bring cars into london or any other cities with passengers are not put to too much inconvenience or undue expense <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy with what lies behind the amendment of the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> however i feel that the construction and uses regulations would take adequate care of any question of overloading <e> <s> there are a number of vehicles that are constructed to carry more than five passengers and one driver and one notable exception is the peugeot family estate car which is a widely-used vehicle <e> <s> be that as it may i think that it is rather irrelevant because as i say <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to those of your lordships who have spoken <e> <s> if i may i should like to start right at the beginning with the act <e> <s> i am no lawyer but in section <e>", "<cs> this is a point which has always interested me <e> <s> why when everybody has decided that publication is a good thing should it then be left to another legislative process in this case to be dealt with by negative resolution <e> <s> in that terminology negative is very negative because these kinds of things do slip away <e> <s> if the regulation has to be approved by a positive motion then of course it comes up it is firm and it comes in front of one <e> <s> on the negative it slides away <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord underhill does what he suggests he might do why can he not for a moment be absolutely practical or pragmatic i am never quite sure which word to use about this <e> <s> the truth is that you are not going to get agreement because there are two totally different interests and those two interests are going to fight tooth and nail for their own ends <e> <s> it is rather foolish to suggest that you can put into a bill a phrase like <e>", "<cs> i have a great deal of sympathy with my noble friend <e> <s> i always do have as he does in regard to points which i raise <e> <s> but i do not feel that on the one hand he can expect the government to offer these opportunities to existing operators and potential new operators and on the other hand still expect to protect those who may be in business <e> <s> my main objection to the proposed subsection is not to the safeguard as regards loss while the commissioners may or may not be making up their minds but to the fact that you cannot quantify the amount <e>", "<cs> i feel that my noble friend lord mowbray and stourton has been rather forced into something of a grudging admission to have another look at this matter <e> <s> i should like to feel because i have some sympathy no more than sympathy with the point made by the noble lord lord mishcon that my noble friends looking will be most generously founded so that we may all know that the point has been thoroughly examined and perhaps we may be given a very full answer on report <e>", "<cs> if i may take up the time of the committee <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies i think the noble lord lord mishcon said in his opening remarks road fund licence <e> <s> i am sure he did not mean that and that he meant road service licence <e> <s> we must get this absolutely right so that there is no confusion <e>", "<cs> my lord i rise also to support my noble friend and my honourable friend from another place whom i see in the gallery from my own part of the world in their endeavours in pursuing this matter from march of last year <e>", "<cs> might i support my noble friend lord mowbray and stourton in his answer <e> <s> i do not think that lord mishcons argument is terribly good <e> <s> in fact there is already provision in the bill for the commissioners to award licences so far as they wish <e> <s> one of the great difficulties of entering into an in perpetuity situation is that provided all goes well at least on the surface no applicant at the earlier stage will find himself with an opportunity of getting in <e>", "<cs> on this occasion i find myself supporting the noble lord lord underhill although i should tell the committee that i am speaking more on behalf of my noble friend lord sandford who but for a most urgent and pressing engagement would have been here today <e> <s> he has asked me to speak on his behalf although it is a matter with which i have sympathy <e> <s> it is also right that i should tell noble lords that my noble friend lord sandford is president-designate of the association of district councils <e> <s> my noble friend and i take the view that particularly in a trial area where the role of the traffic commissioners would be absent it is even more necessary that the local transport undertakings and the people involved should be consulted <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i say that he is of course quite right in that the protection to which he referred appears on page of the bill <e> <s> but in line of page that protection is preceded by the following requirement <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord underhill presses his amendment i should in fact like to ask him not to do so in that my noble friend has made a positive effort which i find really quite acceptable <e> <s> the kind of words that i should have preferred to see are such words as shall consider such representations <e> <s> that would cut out as it were this long harangue that my noble friend lord bellwin foresees <e> <s> at the same time it would require the county authority to consider representations <e> <s> it gets away from this wretched dictatorial word notify <e> <s> if the goodwill expressed by my noble friend lord bellwin is there and i believe it is i should have thought that we could find a phrase which was totally acceptable to all of us <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend whether it is intended that the provisions for certificates of professional competence applicable to northern ireland are those that are currently ruling in this country <e> <s> if so is he able to say anything at all about the continuance of the current scheme whereby the qualifications are vetted by a group including trade unions before the certificate of professional competence is granted or whether in fact as seems to be felt in some quarters the present method of awarding the certificate is going to be changed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords although the amendment of the noble lord lord underhill and his explanation of it appear quite reasonable i must point out that the amendment does not go quite far enough <e> <s> in the event of the experiment taking place in a small locality and for example the period being within the five years what will happen afterwards <e> <s> the trouble with so many experiments and a good example was the sleeping policeman is that they almost always go on forever and become the absolute custom and the experiment becomes fact <e>", "<cs> my lords before i comment upon lord underbills amendment i feel that your lordships should perhaps take particular note of what is happening in the bill <e> <s> i have not been in your lordships house very long but i have seen marked changes in the way in which we conduct our affairs <e> <s> perhaps one of the more distressing features that seems to have crept in over the <e>", "<cs> my lords since we are discussing the two amendments i should like to speak to both <e> <s> in the first instance while i have every sympathy with the noble lord lord underhill in amendment no <e> <s> he has acknowledged that were it to be passed it would be undoing a situation that has applied perfectly correctly and happily although it may be regrettable over a number of years <e>", "<cs> my lords while we are on this particular subject and while i support my noble friend lord bellwin it may be an appropriate time to recall the debates that we had on this subject in when the interests of the hackney trade were being debated <e> <s> i think one should remember that the hackney trade carry out a number of the functions which the licensed hire business carry out in so far as they the hackney trade undertake private hire work <e> <s> this is an areas which used to be the province of the private hire industry <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make two points <e> <s> first i should like to join with other noble lords on both sides of the house in the exchange of pleasantries <e> <s> that is always nice at the end of a rather hard-fought bill <e> <s> secondly what i really want to do is to echo the words of my noble friend when he moved that the bill do now pass <e> <s> he said that this would give opportunities <e> <s> while there may be some doubts both on this side of the house and on the other side as to certain aspects of this bill it is a complaint of many of us in both houses that governments do not provide the kind of climate for enterprise <e> <s> this bill provides the climate for enterprise in the field of passenger transport <e> <s> if however enterprising people do not take advantage then they cannot grumble <e> <s> if that is all this bill does that is absolutely splendid <e> <s> it gives an opportunity <e> <s> we will measure it possibly the next time we return to power in the later s <e> <s> then if we have to change it we have to change it <e> <s> that will be the testing time of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i would have preferred to call this bill something of a nonsense bill <e> <s> it is a nonsense to bring forward a bill of such importance in this particular manner and at this particular time <e> <s> my noble friend lord kinnoull quite rightly describes this as another measure in the battle of safety on the roads a matter in which your lordships have always been interested <e> <s> it is therefore grossly inappropriate that your lordships should be asked to debate a bill of this nature that has government support when no more than the private members view has been put before your lordships when no more than minutes of debate have taken place in another place <e> <s> that minutes debate took place in standing committee and half the time was taken up with argument perhaps i should correct myself to say discussion about the position of the greater london authority <e> <s> this is as i say something of a nonsense <e> <s> it has been around since june of last year <e> <s> there has been no debate on it on the floor of the chamber of the other place <e> <s> it is as i say inappropriate that your lordships should have this bill at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he tell us on what premise he bases his supposition that the locals will soon get used to the humps <e> <s> the noble lord supposes that the humps will be constructed in residential roads yet there is nothing in the bill to prevent anyone from supposing that a hump might be constructed on a motorway let alone in a residential road <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend lord kinnoull comments my noble friend has not answered my question why should not the authority show that these other measures to which we both have referred have already been taken into account <e> <s> all the amendment asks for is that they should show that it has been taken into account <e>", "<cs> i am quite happy to take two members on for the price of one brief <e> <s> i do not mind that at all <e> <s> i asked a very simple question to which i have had no answer <e> <s> however i do not want to delay the committee <e> <s> i will look very carefully at that which has been said but in no way am i going to allow myself purely and simply to withdraw this amendment at this time other than with the proviso that if i am not satisfied with what has been said or with what conversations may take place i may reintroduce it at the report stage <e> <s> upon that basis i ask the committees leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to delay the committee too long because i am going to ask the committee to decide whether this amendment should be included <e> <s> there can be no justification for a piece of blanket legislation none whatsoever <e> <s> it is quite wrong to extract from the act section i have it here and both my noble friends are of course quite right that experimental period does apply to depressions as well <e> <s> however we are not talking about that now we are not talking about experimental periods <e> <s> we are talking about a piece of legislation <e> <s> i do not think we can allow a piece of blanket legislation however it may be guarded by regulations in other parts of the bill <e> <s> it may well be that those amendments which are down later in the name of myself and my noble friends may not be acceptable to the committee in which case i believe that a number of the safeguards go <e>", "<cs> i do not want to keep on with this because i am going to ask the committee to divide anyway but i want to clear up this question of consultation <e> <s> during the second reading debate on this bill on rd july at col the noble viscount lord long said <e>", "<cs> before i reply to the noble lord the minister may i ask whether he was speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and at the same time <e>", "<cs> in that case perhaps it would be best if spoke at this stage to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the two amendments are broadly related although it is not as regards amendment no <e> <s> that i feel so strongly i rather received the answer which i anticipated <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> deals with the residential area or the mile per hour limit <e> <s> i think that the argument here is based on the title of the report <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down i should certainly have a good deal more faith if a little more faith was displayed by himself and the government in attending to the bill without having this pressure of time put upon us <e> <s> i think that that shows a remarkable lack of faith <e>", "<cs> the report continues <e>", "<cs> i take up lord monsons point <e> <s> i think he says i trust that he will correct me if i misheard him that the road to which he referred is an open stretch of road that is not subject to a speed limit <e> <s> he described it as narrow and spoke of the traffic that goes down it <e> <s> he has said exactly that of which i am fearful <e> <s> there are powers to restrict the speed of traffic namely the speed limit <e> <s> however it is rather more difficult to get a speed limit introduced under the existing regulations under the existing law that it will be to get a hump constructed if the bill becomes an act <e> <s> that is exactly what i foresee for some particular reason and youngsters riding horses represent a very good reason <e> <s> a particular reason has been advanced <e> <s> a wish has been expressed that humps should be introduced <e> <s> the parents of the children would like it <e> <s> i expect that they would <e> <s> that is why the bill goes too far <e> <s> it allows exactly that type of thing to happen <e>", "<cs> i was a little surprised that my noble friend should suddenly come on to expenditure and cost effectiveness <e> <s> i will want to come back a little bit on that when we reach amendment but on the question of cost benefit analysis the surprising thing is that in the trrl report there is no mention whatever about making an analysis or a study of these <e> <s> at least seeming that the noble lord lord underhill is whizzing through the index may i say that i have not seen it let me put it that way i have not recognised it <e>", "<cs> i think that it was the noble lord lord hale who asked me a specific question <e> <s> he asked did i think that regulations could now be made that would be satisfactory <e>", "<cs> i think that the answer to the specific question that the noble lord lord hale raised is no i do not think so because far too much water has passed under too many bridges tonight <e> <s> there can be no going back now unless in the next transport bill or by some other method there is an opportunity to reintroduce the sense of those amendments which by virtue of this time element have been dismissed out of hand <e> <s> there is no doubt about this that the committee has been told you will deny a weapon in the armoury of road safety if you agree to one amendment <e> <s> that is why my two noble friends adopt the stance they do adopt and i do not blame them for so doing <e>", "<cs> i said this was a probing amendment <e> <s> i wanted to find out something about costs <e> <s> i also wanted to wag a warning finger at highway authorities and priorities of money <e> <s> this is perfectly permissible within the context of this bill <e> <s> regrettably i found out very little about the cost of installing humps <e> <s> we are still left with the trrl figures <e> <s> i do not think that this is important because it depends what they make of them how many humps there are and how long they are <e>", "<cs> this has put a somewhat different dimension upon the point under discussion <e> <s> it would be best if we all had a look at what has been said decided whether we were entirely happy about it and had another talk about it at the next stage <e> <s> there are some blurred edges but we do not want to keep pressing this because we are not going to get very much farther <e> <s> with the idea therefore that we might discuss this again at report i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pity the minister has spoken but i hope your lordships will give him leave to speak again because while the amendment has been proved to be defective by virtue of the national speed limit of mph on roads other than dual carriageways i wanted to raise a point which was mentioned in the letter and which the minister mentioned in committee when we discussed a very similar point <e> <s> he then said <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in the united kingdom domestic market about million-worth of spare parts are sold through do-it-yourself shops and that in a recent survey carried out by leading british brake manufacturers into the quality of of the lesser-known makes of brake pads only were considered to be satisfactory by those standards were marginal and failed outright <e> <s> in view of those two points is not a safety factor involved in the sale of other than genuine and approved parts in the united kingdom alone <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble viscount lord simon has joined my name with his opening adress it would seem appropriate that i should speak now <e> <s> i can assure your lordships that i was not consulted at all perhaps there is no reason why i particularly should have been consulted with regard to the change of date from friday to this afternoon <e> <s> i was however informed by my noble friend lord avon that the date had been changed <e> <s> that was while passing through the division lobbies late on thursday <e> <s> on the other hand when there was a move earlier last month to change the committee stage by a couple of days there were consultations and i expressed the view to my noble friend lord kinnoull that i was not willing to accept the change <e> <s> but <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend <e> <s> it will be miles an hour or less which of course brings the hump into roadways which are most probably in residential and urban areas <e> <s> it follows i think quite reasonably that it will be for the local authority the highway authority to determine where the hump would best serve its purpose <e> <s> but it also follows that residents or the owners and occupiers of properties in areas which they consider to be dangerous or requiring deterrents other than the speed limit may press for humps to be constructed <e> <s> it has always been my contention that a lot of people may very well desire traffic to go down somebody elses street and so make this kind of representation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble earl the minister my noble friend lord kinnoull and my noble friend lord ferrier for their contributions <e> <s> on the last point i would challenge the noble earl upon these particular figures but on another occasion not this evening <e> <s> all i would say to him is that the essence of road hump building is to reduce the speed or flow of traffic rather than to aid pedestrian ways as we saw in the pictures in the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the noble viscount lord simon in this amendment even more so having heard the remarks just made by my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> i do not want to get into the position implied by my noble friend lord auckland nor indeed the implied position given by the noble lord lord hale <e>", "<cs> my lords may i at the outset declare that i have contrary perhaps to some thoughts in your lordships house and certainly outside no connection no involvement whatsoever with electric vehicle manufacturers or component manufacturers or indeed any company so involved <e>

that the noble lord lord energlyn will forgive me if i do not follow him across the exciting scenario that he has just painted because i want to confine my remarks to the role of the industrial training board as indeed did my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> if i were to take the first half of his speech as mine it might save a lot of time but i am not sure exactly where his half is in relation to my notes so if i become a little disjointed perhaps your lordships will forgive me <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support my noble friend lord balfour of inchrye and in so doing i should at the outset declare my interest negative though it may be in that i am a recently-elected vice-president of rospa <e> <s> i may add that the council were quite well aware of my objection to this measure before they elected me <e> <s> i should also apologise to my noble friend lord cross to whose speech i did not listen but i have listened to the others <e> <s> the one which worried me most was that made by the right reverend prelate the bishop of london <e> <s> i found that his closing remarks were totally objectionable totally untrue and totally emotional <e> <s> he said in relation to supporting my noble friend lord nugents bill that we must support this bill to stop the appalling carnage on our roads <e> <s> i have listened to that for so many years that i am sick and tired of it <e> <s> indeed the noble and learned lord lord wilson also used the same expression <e> <s> i do not know what those two noble lords mean by carnage <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord monson may well be right about that <e> <s> i was going to say something slightly different <e> <s> i was going to say that compulsion in this area was probably contrary to conservative policy <e> <s> the conservatives pledged themselves to less legislation less government interference a return to personal decisions by the people <e> <s> i believe those may be the reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to intervene in this evenings debate purely as a member of your lordships committee on science and technology which as the noble lord lord digby and the noble baroness lady birk said set up a sub-committee only last november to consider the whole area of hazardous toxic waste disposals <e> <s> i have no doubt that the chairman of the committee the noble lord lord gregson would have wished to take part in this evenings debate but he is unavoidably detained at meetings in manchester <e> <s> when he discussed this matter with me last week we agreed the <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would be prepared to list those goods that he so confidently thinks can be transferred from road to rail with perhaps the generosity with which he listed the faults of the railways <e> <s> would he not agree that there is no professional traffic manager who does not look at all the options open to him whether carrying cement oil motor-cars parcels or anything else <e> <s> if one system is not suitable for one reason or another then he chooses the other system <e> <s> it is not just a question of listing a certain number of goods that ought to or could or might be transferred <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may start my contribution to tonights debate which is apparently turning into one on alcoholism rather than on the bill before us perhaps i may with great respect chide my noble friend on the front bench for the way in which the government not only this government but other governments have not in fact tackled this whole problem in what i might describe as the round the whole problem <e> <s> while i noted with great interest what the noble lord lord byers said with regard to the report that is to come out shortly it is my understanding that this is a report on drink in respect of work it does not cover the whole problem of alcoholism <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble baroness for giving way because i should like to answer her <e> <s> on many saturdays whether or not there is a home game at southampton quite early on in the upper street precinct where there are no motor-cars and where there is a tesco i have seen with my own eyes

compulsion were to be brought into effect in this country <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for his answer <e> <s> i am sorry that he chose to respond to the two amendments because i do not believe

kind of information which i seek <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e> <s> it will be with some reluctance <e> <s> i do not find my noble and learned friends answer at all satisfactory <e> <s> it seems to me very arbitrary to refer to the average of fines in the courts as the yardstick against which penalty points should be totted

noble and learned friends answers to be totally unsatisfactory <e> <s> i really find them to be what i might crudely describe as ham-fisted and heavy-footed answers <e> <s> they are a kind of answer

heavier <e> <s> i prefer to do my speeding down in the south where the rate seems to be around a mile <e>", "<cs> i again apologise for detaining the committee but there are three points in this

which illustrate the gravity of this particular offence <e> <s> perhaps some noble lords may remember that during the second reading when we were discussing drink accident connected offences i asked how many deaths or serious injuries involving road accidents had a drink element attached <e> <s> we have heard that some convictions were made <e> <s> i have to thank my noble friend for a letter he wrote to me with regard to the specific question in which the answer was that per cent <e> <s> of drivers killed in road accidents had a drink content <e> <s> the point i was trying to get at was with the high proportion of offences over milligrams as the minister told us out of how many deaths and serious injuries involving road accidents have a drink content <e> <s> i am anxious to get at that figure <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as we were advised that my amendment could not be called in the event of the amendment of the noble lord lord underhill being agreed to it seems appropriate that i should speak to my amendment which in essence embraces many of the same points <e> <s> i noted that when responding to the noble lord lord underhill my noble friend lord skelmersdale said that of course there is a lower limit provision in the bill as it stands <e> <s> if my amendment were adopted that lower limit would not stand because it is precisely that which i want to take out in amendment no <e> <s> b <e>", "<cs> the amendment has been incorrectly printed and i was going to explain how it should read so that when i invite the minister to include my amendment with that of the noble lord lord underhill in his further consideration he will at least have the right wording of my amendment <e>", "<cs> that is absolutely correct i am most grateful to the principal deputy chairman <e> <s> now that the proper wording of the amendment has been established i would ask my noble friend to bear it in mind when he gives the further consideration that the noble lord lord underhill has requested and that i too would seek so that preparatory to discussion at report stage we can arrive at something a little more sensible than what is at present in the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to return your lordships to the unhappy subject matter before us that of road accidents and continue our debate on my noble friends amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> since this most controversial proposal was first put before parliament we have discussed it some times in one house

accusation to me <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will forgive me for intervening i wanted to speak about the main amendment but i expected to do this when we came to debate the government amendment after we had debated the noble ladys amendment which is the usual course <e> <s> can my noble friend adopt that more usual practice <e> <s> we could deal with the noble ladys amendment and then return to the substantive amendment <e>", "<cs> it would be discourteous if i did not speak <e> <s> in fact it was in the closing remarks of my noble friend that he answered what was really underlying the questions i was going to put <e> <s> i take it from what he said that the euphoria of this afternoons decisions will not cloud the departments views as to what is now desirable <e> <s> a great number of points were raised this afternoon a number of other points have been raised on this new government clause <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee and my noble friend will reject the amendment <e> <s> there are two real reasons for suggesting that it is quite inappropriate <e> <s> first there have been no consultations whatsoever with the users of motor vehicles through the rac the aa so far as any government intention to alter the law is concerned <e> <s> with regard to the locking up of a motor vehicle by way of a device not for a minute do i believe that it would work <e> <s> we have been dealing with parking problems for years and years <e> <s> in during the passage of the road traffic act my noble forebear had exactly the same problem and we have not advanced so far as to resort to the locking up of peoples property in this way <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to my noble friend the minister for what must be considered a totally satisfactory answer <e> <s> i can do no more than accept his advice and his promise of a government amendment at report stage <e> <s> while i am talking to this matter may i add that i am sure my noble friend on the front bench will accept that were the noble lord lord wise here he the farmer would have moved the amendment <e> <s> it is only because of my noble friends illness that he is prevented from attending <e> <s> however with my noble friends assurances i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i have a good deal of support for this amendment of my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> i do not think i am quite so implacably opposed to road humps as i was last summer though i still have grave reservations about their efficiency <e> <s> i can drive over road humps with a skill that i learned when i was a rally driver <e> <s> it is not very difficult and one can get up a tremendous speed if one wishes <e> <s> i think to some extent that answers the noble lord lord underhill who accepts that it can be done by those who are practised <e> <s> indeed it is quite a popular sport among young gentlemen with motor-cycles and mopeds to ride at these things pretty damned quickly a burst on the throttle a lift of the front you sit well back on the machine the front wheel goes well up in the air and you ride over the hump on the rear wheel alone <e> <s> it is a great sport and i have seen it practised on sunday afternoons just outside winchester <e> <s> so i rather think my noble friend lord mottistone has certainly put forward a point here which deserves a good deal more attention than perhaps has been given to it so far <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend the minister for his reply <e> <s> it would be churlish of me to say that i do not find it satisfactory <e> <s> perhaps it would be more fair of me to say that i do not find it entirely satisfactory <e> <s> my noble friend has repeated the same kind of argument which we heard on monday with regard to points <e> <s> he said that the point is quite low whereas in the case of drinking and driving it is much higher and the penalty is very much higher <e> <s> therefore we must have a different kind of machinery and different kinds of controls <e> <s> that is an argument of quality not of principle <e> <s> if we are going to have the principle i think we must have the quality right <e>", "<cs> indeed it does <e> <s> it gives me a good deal of confidence <e> <s> to close the matter may i say that i hope my noble friend and his right honourable friend will keep in the forefront of their thinking when talking about motoring offences penalties the methods by which we enforce legislation the real problems which can occur <e> <s> the question of law enforcement particularly in this field is one of public confidence <e> <s> it is so often a public relations exercise and we do not want to set motorists against the police <e> <s> no way do we want to do that <e> <s> if the motoring organisations and motorists themselves believe that there are restrictions to be observed that will go a long way towards ensuring that the things we are all after such as deterrents and fixed penalties will run smoothly <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my noble friend said that road humps had one set of dimensions and that rumble strips had a different set of dimensions <e> <s> i want to be totally assured that the secretary of state can in no way through the experimental clause in the old act allow humps to be put down on other roadways <e> <s> i am happy that the highway authority cannot do so but i am not entirely happy about the position in respect of the secretary of state i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord avon really rather frightens me <e>", "<cs> my noble friend says good but i do not know whether he means that <e> <s> in the early part of my noble friends response he spoke about what might happen in the next few years <e> <s> while this may be an enabling provision it does not enable matters to go on and on <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend say <e>", "<cs> i am delighted that my noble friend can assure me that there was nothing sinister <e> <s> i had a horrible feeling that something was to be hidden in the road underneath the hump but he assures me that that is not so <e> <s> all is to be revealed on the hump on the surface in due course <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may give support in principle to my noble friends amendment and may i compliment him on the expert manner in which he deployed his argument <e> <s> it really was rather splendid <e> <s> i think he should join those of us who have more work in haulage rather than stay in the biscuit business <e> <s> however what the noble lord said i believe to be quite correct but it is not as simple as that <e> <s> as far as the rigid vehicles go this is quite understandable because his large sign can be displayed <e> <s> there is a constancy about a rigid vehicle <e> <s> when you come to articulated vehicles and road trains there you enter into a veritable forest of confusion <e> <s> i think i can only describe it in that way <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i shall be critical this evening but if i am it is not in a spirit of destruction because i totally believe in and totally support our membership of the community <e> <s> if i were or years younger i would probably belong to that group of young people who are perhaps now disheartened <e> <s> they have seen in the last years since winston churchills very famous speech in in zurich the hesitations the stops the starts and the failures of the community <e> <s> they have seen possibly because of the way the media report things the now almost annual confrontations between ministers over matters relating to the common agricultural policy fishing rights and our contributions <e> <s> that is not really what the community is at all about <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to follow a maiden speaker because it gives one the opportunity of expressing the gratitude of the house to him and i do that in no small measure tonight <e> <s> it is perhaps even more welcome for me to hear somebody speaking on transport matters i sometimes think we are rather lean in this house on transport matters and the noble lord lord mountevans has shown us that he has a keen grasp of the subject <e> <s> indeed his quickness with figures was perhaps a little unnerving for me <e> <s> no doubt his past in promotions management at the british tourist authority has provided him with that background if he went to british rail he might enhance their reputation as well <e> <s> he reminded us that he has been with us for only a year but now he has made his maiden speech i hope we shall have the opportunity of hearing him again <e>", "<cs> my lords may i at the outset declare my interest in the national deaf childrens society largely because one of its vice-presidents is a <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down i would point out that when he spoke about the categorical assurances which had been given he was speaking about the assurances which had been given by the employers the british transport docks board as presently constituted <e> <s> would not my noble friend agree that were he able to bring before your lordships an assurance couched in similar terms from the employees side of the dock industry a number of us might possibly be better satisfied <e> <s> is he able to say what kind of response the employees side of the industry has made to these provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment as i did at committee stage and for exactly the same reasons that i referred to at that time <e> <s> i am a little sorry that my noble and learned friend has not been able to communicate the further thoughts until perhaps only a few hours ago <e> <s> one might have expected the department to have come up with some suggestions following that committee stage <e> <s> the main objection which i still have is that we cannot allow for the sake of the convenience of the court the opportunity for justice to be swept into one penalty point number <e> <s> i reiterate that i believe that the insurance companies themselves are to a very large extent to blame for some people failing to have insurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble and learned friend for his very long answer <e> <s> i should like to say at the outset that i am not surprised that the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby should have advanced his arguments <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that earlier he declared that he was not a car driver and loathed all motor-cars so i am not in the least surprised that he adopts the attitude he does <e> <s> i am sorry for him because if he is not a driver and has not enjoyed some of the hazards and pleasures of modern-day motoring he does not know what he is missing five points or three <e>", "<cs> my lords were it so i am quite sure that all the noble lords who are motorists would rewrite this particular schedule in very different terms i believe that this bill is not written for motorists by motorists <e> <s> i believe it is a really genuine attempt particularly in part iv after many years to get to grips with some of the hazards and the dangers experienced on our roads <e> <s> it is a road safety section and i believe it goes quite a long way towards meeting a great number of the desires of those who do not motor as well as those who do <e> <s> i am surprised again that expressions of support for this should have come from so many noble lords <e> <s> however i do not want to make too much of an issue of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to have to tell my noble and learned friend that i do not like what he has come up with <e> <s> i think that he has gone too far <e> <s> one would be tempted to recall what the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby said about being fastidious in trying to define this point too carefully <e> <s> on the other hand i do not think that we have defined it at all since if i understand my noble and learned friend correctly we have now moved away from the particular place of sanctuary because we cannot define it properly and we have moved to the gravity of the suspicion <e> <s> i do not think that that is quite good enough <e> <s> i do not think that we can allow policemen to barge into peoples homes if necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment which as the noble lord lord underhill reminded us is in very similar terms to one moved at an earlier stage <e> <s> i should at the outset thank my noble friend for arranging a series of demonstrations at which members of the department showed your lordships a number of machines that might be used <e> <s> the three machines demonstrated to us were all american it seems a rather unhappy situation that the british industry has not been able to provide such a machine and i understand that other machines are being evaluated by the department <e> <s> if by virtue of the demonstrations it was sought to persuade us that the machines are as near foolproof as possible one cannot accept that in that we did not see other machines which might be used <e> <s> in addition although we had quite clearly explained and demonstrated to us the way in which the machine could start at zero take a reading and finish at zero i am happy to say that we were not invited to provide our own blood or urine samples against which the machine could be tested and checked so there could reasonably remain some doubt <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i can be of help to my noble friend since he has been very helpful to me <e> <s> i would refer to amendment no <e> <s> the consultative document <e> <s> i would have thought that the answer to lord balfour of inchryes question could very well be contained in that kind of document when the various representations of milkmen doctors harrods and any other person can be made to the department <e> <s> it would seem to me that if we press my noble friend this afternoon he is going to have to write for us a series of regulations and make certain decisions on questions which have not yet been discussed by the interested parties <e> <s> that is what is behind my amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i think my noble friend might be able to rest behind the assurance he has given earlier which is unlikely to be challenged when we get to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support my noble friend lord cork and orrery but i cannot <e> <s> i believe the amendment is defective in that it would not do what he wants it to achieve because he is attempting to put design criteria into a requirement <e> <s> indeed were he to press the amendment and win we should find that he has inhibited all advanced design which i do not think is his intention <e> <s> if i take the more generous view that the noble earl lord cork and orrery put forward the amendment in order to draw attention to the difficulties which are being experienced with current and different safety belts then i can support him along those lines but i have to tell the noble lord that it would be absolutely wrong to force on to motor vehicle manufacturers a design feature of this nature because again one would inhibit their experimental work <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies i should like to say something in general support of my noble friend lord mottistones amendment <e> <s> this matter has perhaps rather more to do with what my noble friend the minister had to say in response to the amendment of the noble earl lord cork and orrery when we discussed seat belts at some length <e> <s> i must say to my noble friend that i was a little disappointed in his response at that time because if i recall correctly he said in effect this legislation that will probably be on the statute book should give a great boost a great emphasis to the seat belt manufacturers and designers <e> <s> i do not believe that it will do anything of the sort <e> <s> i think that they are far more likely to do as they have done with the motor car industry in the last years and sit back and say well there it is we can just trot out anything that will meet the requirements <e>", "<cs> my lords it is only fair to say that one is indebted to my noble friend lord nugent of guildford <e> <s> however as the amendment appeared only this afternoon one might ask him why he took the advice of the government he may prefer to ask our noble friend the minister to go through this rigmarole to achieve what we are all namely the five of us who put down amendments in so far as the affirmative resolution is concerned looking for rather than accept the more simple amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> is rather narrower than amendment no <e> <s> which the noble lord lord underhill the noble earl lord howe and i put down <e> <s> i am sure he <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i do not think i shall adopt the same principle that the noble lord lord monson adopted in having your lordships accept his amendment requiring the government to amend it later <e> <s> i think i would sooner rely on my noble friends assurance that he will propose something next week at third reading which will meet the principle contained in the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be churlish if i did not express my gratitude to my noble friend lord skelmersdale for setting down this amendment <e> <s> i should also like to take this opportunity to thank the noble lord for his letter of rd june following the short debate on this matter at committee stage <e> <s> during that debate my noble friend accepted the principle that he has just reiterated and as he so rightly said he agreed that the figure of at todays value was worth something like <e> <s> however at committee stage there was no suggestion that the defects in my amendment included that of <e>", "<cs> my lords briefly much as i admired the arithmetic of the noble lord lord monson i found the basic argument to be quite wrong <e> <s> it seems to me to be quite wrong that you can buy your way outside the law <e> <s> i do not

lord lord underhill responds and notwithstanding the niceties which have been pointed out by the noble lord lord nugent i feel bound to say something since i have put my name to the amendment <e> <s> i support the general tenor of the amendment and at the same time accept what my noble friend lord bell-win has said <e> <s> i hope that perhaps the noble lord lord underhill will not feel the necessity to press this amendment <e> <s> however i must say to my noble friend that we are not concerned with noble lords who have had the benefit of widespread discussion and demonstration of some of the machinery that might be used <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend lord nugent will forgive me if i do not add my congratulations to others upon his success in clause <e> <s> i remain opposed to the principle of compulsion <e> <s> however i am happy to join him in congratulating my noble friend lord bellwin on his conduct of this bill <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend responds i should like to ask the noble baroness lady jeger whether she is really right about the family doctor <e> <s> in the type of circumstance which she has described i should have thought that

the opportunity to provide an answer <e> <s> the reason for the situation is that purely and simply over the years governments and local authorities have failed to recognise the growth in the use of

suggestions from such as sir peter masefield that it should move to something of a regional set-up <e> <s> if one accepts the amendment one would not be able to do this at all <e> <s> then i think one would negative what we are trying to do that is to create greater opportunities for decentralised authority so that private enterprise private money can come in as and where it wants and it will not

that they will not take very long <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend would allow me to say this <e> <s> while i am quite happy to accept the sense of my noble friends proposal of this amendment he said one or two things which sent a few tremors through me <e> <s> for example he spoke about it being only a testing station <e> <s> of course one might want to reserve a position for another authority <e> <s> i recall from some two or three years ago <e> <s> when we were looking at the chain system that some of these sites are highly desirable pieces of property <e> <s> most of

licence if the offence is one <e>", "<cs> there is obviously still quite a lot of confusion here and i think that some of the confusion may be eased as we progress <e> <s> certainly fixed penalty

satisfied with his answer <e> <s> quite frankly i am tempted to ask the committee whether his view or mine obtains <e>", "<cs> it really seems to me having moved the amendment that we have received a lot of promises we have a lot of talking to do and i did suggest that we might want to come back to this <e> <s> it seems to me a good idea if i beg leave to withdraw the amendment at this time <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord mishcon sits down would he not agree that this is exactly the point we tried to make last year <e> <s> this is being done as a convenience to the courts to relieve the burden <e> <s> it really has nothing to do with anything else it is to relieve that burden <e> <s> whether or not it does at the end of the day only the years will tell <e>", "<cs> i regret to tell the committee that i would have to speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his response and i am grateful to the other noble lords who gave their support to the amendment <e> <s> i had rather expected that the legal people would make an objection along these lines to providing a loophole <e> <s> however i do not believe that this would be so the analogy that might have been drawn between this offence and drink-and-driving offences and this escape is what worries the legal profession is not valid since any motorist who is directly affected by the clause would by definition admit his guilt by accepting the fixed penalty notice but he can refuse the penalty notice and go to court <e> <s> in other words the policeman says if you will not accept the penalty notice i shall report this with a view to prosecution so that the normal process of law goes on <e> <s> i do not think that the analogy is correct <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend for his not unexpected answer <e> <s> i am however very glad to note that the noble lord lord underhill supports the general tenor of differentiated offences <e> <s> if i may just make one quick comment to the noble lord lord davies of leek i can understand why quite <e>", "<cs> i need no assurance <e> <s> returning to this amendment excluding all offences other than speeding it was put down for the purpose of finding out from the government what was their general attitude <e> <s> i do not accept my noble friends view that if we moved the limit five or mph for the purpose of this amendment motorists would purposefully meet the excessive amount because i know of very few speedometers certainly in the older motor cars that are so calibrated and that can be observed so finely by the motorist that four or five mph can be seen <e> <s> so i think that any excess is likely to be unintentional rather than purposeful particularly if that excess was made in smaller numbers <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend lord avon could explain the figure of cases <e> <s> if there were offences of failing to stop a vehicle when required to do so by a police constable in uniform this sounds a rather large number <e> <s> but ultimately were other offences contained in that figure of in other words was failing to stop the lesser or secondary charge that was brought <e> <s> the other charges might be exceeding the speed limit resisting arrest drunk driving robbery failing to report an accident or hit and run <e> <s> so as to the cases it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord davies of leek reminds us of something we have discussed on a number of occasions <e> <s> one of the great difficulties which local authorities have because of the financial constraints within which they are now working is to do just what the noble lord is suggesting <e> <s> if one wished to be anecdotal one could certainly trot out a number of occasions when one has been apprehended for a speeding offence in particular <e>", "<cs> one always hesitates to interfere in anything to do with scottish law but there are problems here as lord underhill says <e> <s> it seems to me that the scottish motorist will be penalised notwithstanding the clause arrangement <e> <s> the only way he can get away with a fixed penalty is to give an address south of the border for the production of his driving licence <e> <s> that will make the border police fairly busy with people popping over backwards and forwards <e> <s> if he cannot give an address of a police station in scotland and he cannot do that because the scottish law provides rather differently in terms of the responsibilities of the fiscal then by definition the offending scottish motorist has only two options either to plead guilty and let the fiscal make the penalty or plead not guilty and go to court <e> <s> all this arises because he cannot get his driving licence home again <e> <s> it does give rise to a number of what appear to be anomalies as between english motoring law and scottish motoring law <e>", "<cs> i should like to attempt to answer the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> i shall wrap it into one parcel per cent <e> <s> of private motor cars on the roads today are in fact supported in one way or another by companies and the charges for operating those motorcars are deductible against tax <e> <s> if the noble lord lord monson wishes to know exactly how a good transport manager arrives at his tax deductible costs i think that it would perhaps be better if i spoke with him outside your lordships committee <e>", "<cs> that is always the problem <e> <s> if you do not the penalty is bigger <e> <s> that seems to me to be the negative or punitive way of trying to whip people into line <e> <s> i prefer not so much stick but a little bit of carrot <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to give general support to lord underhills amendment and for the reasons he has outlined <e> <s> i see however two dangers in this <e> <s> first the fixed penalty notice is a new arm of law enforcement <e> <s> the offer of the fixed penalty will depend frequently on the situation the circumstances and the two people involved <e> <s> i can see no way where you can impose uniformity of view as between a policeman in one part of the country and another in another part <e> <s> on the other hand unless some strict notes of guidance are put down we can have an unhappy situation recurring where certain police forces are well known to be hard on this that or the other <e> <s> there are notwithstanding the figures the noble lord lord underhill read out to us two forces in the country which are quite notable for their <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord lord mishcon whether he is aware that if one had guidelines issued which gave exclusions under certain heads then should offences come before the courts which appeared to be contrary to those guidelines the various protection societies notably one thinks of the motoring organisations could monitor those cases and then the will of parliament could be seen to be being observed and if not appropriate action could be taken <e> <s> would he agree that that could be the outcome of his suggestion <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble and learned friend the lord advocate this question <e> <s> is not the assurance that he has just given us a repetition of that assurance which my noble friend lord avon gave us when we were discussing amendment no <e> <s> that of the police constable having to provide the motorist with a notice of his intention to award a fixed penalty before he proceeded further in the matter <e> <s> my noble friend at that time said at one time we were inclined to accept this kind of amendment but there are certain legal difficulties and the department wanted to have another look at it <e>", "<cs> i must say that i do not find that explanation very satisfactory <e> <s> i might add to my noble and learned friend that i do not propose to go further with this matter at least not this afternoon <e> <s> it seems to me that on the one hand one is trying to move to a simpler system of penalty enforcement with regard to motoring offences <e> <s> it might perhaps be fairly useful if i now speak to my later amendments on the schedules so that we do not have to go through the whole thing again <e>", "<cs> i assure the noble lord lord ross that i have no wish whatever to impose my will on the scots in lawful or any other matters and i said at the outset that i was not proposing to take the amendment further <e> <s> i moved it because i wanted an explanation which is surely not an unreasonable request to make of my noble and learned friend the lord advocate <e> <s> i admire some of the differences that obtain in scotland particularly in regard to property transactions they have a far more sensible way of dealing with such matters but having heard the explanation given by my noble and learned friend i assure lord ross that i have no intention of raising the matter again tomorrow <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord it might be dealt with in that way and most probably it would be <e> <s> however if it happened on the english side it could not be so dealt with <e> <s> it would have to go to court <e> <s> i find that odd but perhaps i had better just leave it there regarding it as being odd and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for his continued support for the principle that is underlined by the amendment <e> <s> i would say to my noble friend lord avon that currently until october of this year as he said the motorist is permitted only three convictions for speeding before disqualification <e> <s> after october under <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend leaves this completely would he when giving consideration to this matter bear in mind that there seems in the country to be a general feeling that we do not want to move anywhere towards a dual force <e> <s> the police generally are held in high regard <e> <s> they are the enforcers of the law and it would be quite wrong to give another body equal or similar status <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for that very detailed and interesting explanation <e> <s> may i just comment on the remarks made by the noble lord lord underhill and by the noble baroness lady denington <e> <s> i have no wish whatsoever to impose a heavy goods vehicle operating sector in a situation which is totally and blatantly undesirable <e> <s> i have no wish and neither i am sure do any of my friends in that business to operate from a place where we are not wanted i apologise to the committee for that appalling grammar <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> that is the kind of emotive talk which appalls me <e> <s> the noble lord said that he knew of an operating centre which started with three vehicles and which now has <e> <s> it could not have increased by without the licensing authority granting the appropriate licences <e> <s> you cannot just buy them and stuff them into a park and operate them you have to have a licence on them <e> <s> therefore there is a failure further down the line my split cardboard box argument <e> <s> i do not see how he can apply that kind of argument to the point which my noble friend lord mottistone makes <e>", "<cs> i am not assuaged one little bit <e> <s> my noble friend talks about a balance <e> <s> here we are asking quite simply for a balance to be stntck a balance between the licensing authority being able to impose any conditions upon a new applicant a renewal of a licence or a variation <e>", "<cs> i do not know about there being an agreement to group <e> <s> certainly no proposal has come before the committee <e> <s> a suggestion came from the department of which i had a copy and that was that <e> <s> i am not prepared

subsection <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend for that explanation and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged to noble lords for taking part in this debate <e> <s> it comes as no surprise that such an innovation as this strikes a little deeply into everybodys motoring bosom so to speak <e> <s> my noble friend in fact said that there were meter spaces in central london <e> <s> my information is that there are only meter spaces in london <e> <s> this reduction was largely as a result of the labour glc policy to cut parking spaces <e> <s> at the same time residential parking bay numbers went up so that on the one hand we are using the streets as permanent garaging for residents and there must be something odd about that while depriving the transient mover the rightful space and the turnover that the noble lord wants <e>", "<cs> those figures make it even more disappointing in westminster and in central london <e> <s> there is not much

asked for regarding this aspect he can have all the rest later on and then we can come to the principle on the motion that the clause stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> may i thank my noble friend for bringing us a little nearer dinner time <e> <s> it is quite obvious that my noble friend lord avon has had an expression of views in particular with who shall clamp and who shall unclamp <e> <s> it is quite obvious that there is more imagination in the committee than in the department and parliamentary draftsmen <e> <s> that does not surprise me since this measure was only put down a very short time ago <e> <s> it has not been thought out <e> <s> this particular subsection of the clause has not been thought out <e> <s> my noble friend has suggested that we should have a talk about it <e> <s>

in amendment no <e> <s> which is so very similar to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the noble lord has of course put the point quite clearly <e> <s> we want to ensure that we do not get a number of mechanical devices which are patently unsuitable and which in fact might be copied <e> <s> one can think of chains for example with a padlock on the end <e> <s> that is a very simple rather nonsensical way of looking at the situation <e> <s> so any device that may ultimately be used in this rather objectionable system would have to be a device that is not going to cause damage is not going to impede a passer-by or a passing cyclist or somebody of that nature and is therefore going to be subject to some specification approved by the minister <e> <s> i can see no reason why my noble friend cannot accept an amendment as simple as this one <e>", "<cs> my noble friend the minister unhappily again used the phrase persistent offender <e> <s> he said that the police had identified three areas where there are persistent offences which of course implies persistent offenders <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill and i are seeking to determine here and now where the experiment shall take place <e> <s> although my noble friend said and a number of other areas and these orders will of course have to come before parliament it would certainly be very much more helpful if we knew exactly where it would happen <e> <s> then we would know the authority which would remove a great number of doubts <e>", "<cs> in this collection if that is the right word of amendments i should like to thank the noble lord lord underhill for explaining clearly not only his point of view but also mine because i do not dissent from him in his enjoining my name with the process of argument <e>

conduct either an experiment or introduce these measures <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend for that offer to have a farther look to see whether the matter can be clarified <e> <s> he did not in fact read my mind quite as accurately as he thought for i had no intention of going as far as i obviously have <e> <s> i simply wanted to find out the governments thinking on the matter <e> <s> the committee will know that i have some reservations about the kind of insurance most people have <e> <s> with my noble friends assurance i too would like to look at the matter again and perhaps have a chat with him about it at a later stage but i do but not wish to pursue the matter further tonight <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we now come to the end of a fairly long debate on clause a new clause introducing new measures to punish parking offenders <e> <s> from second reading onwards i have made no secret <e>", "<cs> i wonder if i may speak before my noble friend the minister responds <e> <s> i hope that the minister will reject this amendment at this particular time <e> <s> there are quite serious and positive reasons for a rejection at this time notably that

not discussed the regulations to that measure and it may be that those regulations are not passed <e> <s> it seems to me that we are jumping the gun and that this is an inappropriate time to apply

amendment <e> <s> we are wrong in making it mandatory to fit a laminated screen <e> <s> i do not disagree with any of the figures that the noble lord lord underhill has produced <e> <s> there are however some very serious drawbacks to making this matter mandatory <e> <s> the first is that there is a growing practice with even the lower priced motor-cars to go for electrically-operated windows <e> <s> in the unhappy event of there being an accident and there is a documented case of this if the doors jam and the electric system fails a large person if he has the wit and presence may break the side windows but would still be unable to get out of the car <e> <s> the laminated windscreen would make it impossible for a person to get out <e>", "<cs> may i just respond <e> <s> it is my understanding that apart from the sliding glass in the door of a railway carriage which is laminated other glass is either toughened glass or annealed glass and the little hammer is there to save you from actually putting your fist your shoe or whatever it may be through the glass <e> <s> but that little hammer will not go through a piece of laminated glass <e> <s> even if your noble kinsman were

to my noble friend the minister for giving a very full explanation of the proposals <e> <s> to start at the beginning the minister said he thought that my amendment was defective and was too widely drawn <e> <s> he said that excluding people concerned with the industry drew too wide a net <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend misread me or perhaps i misled him when i said what my previous amendment was concerned with <e> <s> this amendment uses the words engaged in which is a much narrower net <e> <s> but it is not for me in this matter to be at all satisfied <e> <s> it so happens that i am not but it is not for my noble friend to satisfy me <e> <s> he has to satisfy the industry or to put it in another way we in parliament have to satisfy the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend the minister for the very careful explanation of these regulations to which i wish to draw your lordships attention very shortly <e> <s> i quite accept that regulation which relates to the construction and use regulations is desirable because i would look forward within a very short time to those construction and use regulations being very severely amended <e> <s> it is of some great disappointment to me that since parliament decided on the principle of compulsion the seat belt manufacturers have progressed so little in a uniformity of locking mechanism and a simplification of locking <e> <s> so i would hope that they would be able to move a little more rapidly in the next few months without us having to come back to parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to thank my noble friend for his further explanation <e> <s> i was looking at my own driving licence and wondered exactly how a policeman could see other than the name and address <e> <s> my fear is that when greater knowledge of the fixed penalty system comes about motorists will still rightly or wrongly hold the view that a decision is going to be made on sight of the licence <e> <s> they then may well elect not to offer the licence at that time saying they have not got it in which case they will be served with a further notice to produce it at the nearest police station in five days time <e> <s> it could well be that the motorist will take advice from a lawyer and the whole procedure gets drawn out <e> <s> there is then further work at the police station even <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble and learned friend finishes can he tell the house what is the additional burden when as i understand it the scottish police stations still have a number of forms and pieces of paper to complete with regard to a case that will go to the procurator fiscal <e> <s> it is only substituting one set of forms for another <e> <s> secondly as i understand it the association of chief officers of police and notably the strathclyde division have made no submissions on this matter <e> <s> it seems to me that we are making a sharp division even though it be for allegedly a small number of potential offenders <e> <s> this does not seem to be right to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his explanation and while i am not too happy about his suggestion to the house i have the feeling that at the end of the afternoon it will have to be accepted <e> <s> however there are some points which i think the government might take on board perhaps for another day <e> <s> when my noble friend talks about section of the act and the five days which were generally thought to be quite reasonable and that there have been no complaints we did not have arising the situation that i have suggested that is that an offender may be denied an opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords not surprisingly i rise to object to this amendment and i do so on a number of grounds <e> <s> first it is surprising that my noble friend did not see fit to move this amendment when we debated this matter at some considerable length last summer across the floor of the committee <e> <s> he now comes along with this amendment <e> <s> to say the least this is unusual in your lordships proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what relevance that has to the arguments <e> <s> i am suggesting that the noble earl has accepted the principle on variable points <e> <s> that is all i said <e> <s> this is one of them <e> <s> it brings in an offence which all <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend the minister for his explanation of this amendment which goes such a very long way to meet some of the objections and criticisms that some of us made during the earlier stages of the bill <e> <s> the haulage industry generally is fairly happy now with this amendment and while appreciating that a balance between the environmental necessities and the operation of a proper and legitimate business have to be weighed fairly finely i am left with perhaps only one small niggling doubt in my mind <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend could give an indication of how the government would expect authorities to interpret the term <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lord avon for tabling this amendment which as he said goes such a long way to meet the comments that i made at the earlier stage <e> <s> so far as the comments of the noble lord lord underhill are concerned i can understand what he is saying but i think that what we are really trying to do in terms of immobilisation is again to get at the persistent offender rather than the one who offends by oversight <e> <s> if in either of those two categories the meter-feeder is a miscreant then i suggest that the authorities have adequate power though perhaps not sufficient personnel to deal with that matter in its own right <e> <s> meter feeding certainly is not a practice which any of your lordships would condone <e>", "<cs> my lords may i give a welcome to amendment no <e> <s> u <e> <s> subsection totally met the amendment which i intimated earlier i would not be moving <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether it is proposed that the results of the first months or so of the scheme monitored by the transport and road research laboratory will form part of a report <e> <s> will that report be made fully available to interested parties including members of your lordships house or indeed members of another house <e> <s> therefore when the minister considers the continuation or the extension about which he is bound to make an order as i understood it then subject to the negative resolution that report from the t and rrl will be available so that members of either house may make representations <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the amendment and not wishing to frustrate anything that my noble friend lord mottistone wanted to have included in the bill there is one other aspect to subsection <e> <s> i understand that it is written in terms of the act <e> <s> i accept that the noble lord lord underhill has drawn attention to european community harmonisation and to the position of the rest of the world but i should like to ask my noble friend what is the position with regard to appliances which may be offered for sale for export <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can help my noble and learned friend <e> <s> when i was at aldermaston last summer i was shown a number of devices <e> <s> the laboratory was concentrating on two devices one was english and the other was an american appliance <e> <s> it was a matter of some concern to me that when the government made people aware that they were bringing out these new devices and invited manufacturers to offer machines for testing many machines came from overseas particularly from america but only two machines came from english manufacturers <e> <s> since these machines are basically electronically operated there seem to me to be a very grave lack of enterprise on the part of the british electronics industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for that very full and comprehensive explanation <e> <s> i do not think that any of us would argue now about the need for clause <e> <s> some of us were particulary worried that for the sake of putting right a part we were going to lose all <e> <s> in other words i wonder whether clause with all its advantages is not outweighed by some of the disavantages <e>", "<cs> my lords since my noble friend the minister has spoken to his own amendment no <e> <s> cc as well as the amendment of the noble lord lord underhill no <e> <s> a and my own amendment no <e> <s> d i think that it would be most helpful if i too were so to speak <e> <s> i welcome what my noble friend has said and i welcome his amendment so far as it goes but like the noble lord lord underhill i do not think that it goes far enough <e> <s> at the outset the government did not accept the principle of governmental responsibility with regard to appliances used by the police forces <e> <s> that was said in <e> <s> due i believe to the general pressure that has been brought to bear on them during the last to months the government have now accepted some element of responsibility with regard to the instruments that are to be used <e>", "<cs> my lords may i give my noble friend lord strathcarron some support <e> <s> my noble friend said that it could be a question of the motor-cyclist losing his licence but it is more than that <e> <s> if he does not pass the test at the end of two years he is deprived from riding <e> <s> since there are very few circuits in which a motor-cyclist can train or practice that do not come under the road traffic acts he would be extremely seriously disadvantaged <e> <s> the lazy and the idle man we are not worried about <e> <s> the amendment covers the chap who is accidentally disadvantaged or prejudiced by events outside his control <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to thank my noble friend for that explanation and i am quite happy to tell your lordships that i have no intention of pressing the amendment to a division <e> <s> i am also happy to accept the governments assurance with regard to those matters which lie totally in their hands in other words the trunk roads <e> <s> i have some hesitation however about placing reliance upon my noble friends hope that other local highway authorities will follow the same practice <e> <s> i hope therefore that the advice which will be given is written in such terms as to prevent highway authorities from falling into the ever-present trap of succumbing to the demand of local pressure groups to reduce speed limits <e> <s> it has been proved by the department that they are not effective so far as road safety is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a few comments <e> <s> during previous stages of the bill i have expressed doubts about this method of testing speed <e> <s> with the noble lord lord underhill i share certain misgivings <e> <s> however i do not feel that those misgivings will disappear by accepting the amendment <e> <s> i would be very reluctant to have the detailed regulations put before parliament to be discussed by parliamentarians who with the greatest respect to all of them might have scant knowledge of the technical matters put before them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i come in at this juncture to speak to this amendment <e> <s> it also gives me the opportunity to assure the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside that i meant no discourtesy whatsoever to eminent scientists <e> <s> what i was worried about was that if we go too far down the road of requiring so much to be brought before parliament we might he in danger of getting a technical specification written into regulations which so few of us would he able to deal with in a parliamentary process <e> <s> that is all i meant <e>", "<cs> my lords on reaching this stage of the bill may i thank all four of my noble friends who have piloted this bill through your lordships house for their very great help and where i have not previously expressed personal thanks for the discussions and conversations which have taken place i do so now <e> <s> unlike the noble lord lord underhill i welcome very much part i of this bill and look forward to an expansion of the national bus companys operation <e> <s> so far as part ii is concerned i must confess to having some few reservations and i shall look forward to seeing the complete plans of the lloyds authority in due course <e> <s> i hope that the industry which the testing system serves it is not in fact the other way round will indeed be satisfied and share the governments confidence <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that a humble address be presented to her majesty in the following terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord lord underhill should have taken time this evening largely to repeat the arguments that he laid before us in our debate on th april <e> <s> he has added nothing new whereas the government and the media generally have answered many of those questions <e> <s> of course the real reason is that those who are opposed to lorries will remain implacably opposed to lorries whatever is done <e> <s> but of course they cannot escape the fact that lorries are part of our life without which we would not survive <e> <s> the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the transport and road research laboratory is still evaluating the relative merits of a number of likely ways of improving both daytime and night-time conspicuity of motor cyclists <e> <s> the results of this evaluation should be available early in the summer and our conclusions will be announced at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for her very kind remarks <e> <s> i am quite sure that her unhappiness is not associated with them <e> <s> the noble baroness will probably remember as indeed the house will remember that in the transport and road research laboratory produced a report which was found to be not acceptable by a majority of people <e> <s> further studies were therefore undertaken <e> <s> a very great degree of seriousness and speed is involved <e> <s> which is why these other reports and investigations will be completed later this year <e> <s> i am happy to be able to tell the noble baroness that the figures for motor <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount is not correct in his assertion that there is total acceptance of the use of headlights being an aid <e> <s> in fact it can be a disadvantage <e> <s> the series of tests which is now being undertaken is to determine the effectiveness of motor cycles using headlights both by day and in inclement weather <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord underhill for his remarks <e> <s> all deaths on the road are serious and the government accept this as being a very serious matter <e> <s> the research and inquiries now being undertaken and made embrace all areas of conspicuity particularly that of motor cyclists <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why these inquiries may perhaps be taking rather longer than usual <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot totally accept that argument <e> <s> it may be a contributory factor <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend lord strathcarron for that helpful supple <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noise is probably most evident when the motor cycle has already passed <e> <s> there are regulations in respect of noise levels of motor cycles but i cannot add anything as regards the number of prosecutions of the type mentioned by the noble lord lord leatherland <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of studies will be made to provide information on any changes in the severity and nature of injuries sustained in road traffic accidents including any that might be attributable to seat belt wearing <e>", "<cs> my lords the preparations which have already been made to monitor accidents will provide information on the level of seat belt wearing the effect on traffic fatalities and any changes in the severity or nature of injuries resulting from such road traffic accidents <e> <s> it is not believed that the kind of injuries sustained in road traffic accidents can be positively set as a result of the wearing of seat belts or otherwise <e> <s> certainly whatever information comes out of the monitoring will be freely available <e>", "<cs> my lords the government favour voluntary installation of head restraints but to date there is no firm information to suggest that there is at this time a case for compulsion <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly any of the monitoring that reveals figures will have some suggestion as to the cause and effect <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friend lord mottistone i can tell him that i am perfectly satisfied that all relevant features with regard to an accident whether or not seat belts are being worn will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords the accident investigation units employed on this task will certainly take all relevant facts into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to tell the noble lord lord collison that lateral accidents are of course of extreme danger <e> <s> the effects they may <e>", "<cs> my lords first i echo all your lordships words in regard to the question of the noble baroness it is timely that we are having a debate on this matter <e> <s> i want to answer precisely the precise question what initiatives are her majestys government taking to encourage community member states to move to lead-free petrol <e> <s> i must tell the noble baroness not a lotand i want to explain as shortly as i possibly can why not <e> <s> this is not to say that we totally disregard the community or what the community are doing <e> <s> in fact the commission have established a working group which is currently looking at all vehicle emission problems and that includes lead gases and so on <e> <s> it is due to report to the commission in june <e> <s> we have taken an active part in providing technical and other information <e> <s> it is absolutely vital that any consideration of environmental standards for vehicles must take account of all the relevant issues <e> <s> those issues include need the medical and energy implications costs technical feasibilities and so on <e> <s> the commission understand this and they have charged the working group with examining those issues <e> <s> what the commission do with the report or any other information when it comes out is largely up to the commission <e> <s> of course we would take note of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that i echo the thanks of the house to my noble friend lord campbell of croy in bringing forward this motion tonight <e> <s> of course my noble friend is well known for his interest in matters pertaining to disabled persons and i am sure that it would not be amiss if i reminded your lordships that he was the chairman of the scottish committee during the year of disabled people <e> <s> i should like to thank him very much for his very kind personal remarks to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i would imagine that having a refusal notice would prompt the <e>", "<cs> my lords the fee was at a maximum of which has now been raised to and it may be levied if the local authority the issuing authority so decides <e> <s> some do so decide and some do not <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are making available over million this year to support industrys own efforts in the field of initial skill training including some million to support first year and redundant apprentices in the engineering industry <e> <s> continuing support for apprentice training in will be primarily through the youth training scheme which overall will cost some million in a full year <e> <s> a major target of the new training initiative which is strongly supported by the government is to reform existing apprentice arrangements by removing unnecessary restrictions and substituting agreed standards of competence <e> <s> but it is primarily for employers to identify and take steps to meet their own long-term skill training needs and then for the government to support these efforts <e>", "<cs> my lords the shortfall if one can so describe it of apprentices in the engineering industry is not unique to that industry <e> <s> in fact there is a similar fall in apprentice recruitment throughout the whole of industry <e> <s> that fall due to the recession and the reluctance of employers to take on more apprentices and trainees than is absolutely necessary resulted in the msc reducing the amount of support <e> <s> however i can tell the noble lord that although million has been made available during the current year there has not been a full take-up of that amount by industry <e> <s> there are also provisions for taking care of those apprentices who unfortunately find themselves made redundant there is the adoption scheme where an <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are aware of that and my noble friend is right in what he says <e> <s> but there are provisions to enable small businesses who would be willing to take on perhaps one trainee be it a boy or girl to join in a community system <e> <s> by that system a major sponsoring unit it might be a company or a chamber of commerce provides the outline of the training the small company providing some particular detailed part of the training over a shorter period than a full apprenticeship <e>", "<cs> my lords the new youth training scheme which comes into being in september of this year will go a long way towards meeting the objective of which the noble lord speaks <e> <s> this scheme is part of the whole system of young peoples training it is contained in the new training initiative by which it is hoped to move from the old-fashioned time-served/age qualification to a system whereby a young person will receive what might be described as modular training gaining certificates experience and diplomas all of which at certain periods of collection will add to full skill status and the engineering industry is one of those in the forefront in moving in that direction <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a worrying feature <e> <s> it is perhaps part of the effects of the current recession out of which we are optimistic of moving shortly <e> <s> the government have provided a number of incentives for industries in general to accept more apprentices <e> <s> that they have not come forward may be one problem and there is an educational problem here in that in particular in the engineering industry young people do not find the prospects attractive <e> <s> i am not talking in terms of money <e> <s> in many instances they find that an engineering career does not attract them <e> <s> there have been more apprentices recruited in this area in the last or months <e> <s> nevertheless the amount of money that is made available and it is for government only to support industrys own efforts has not been taken up <e> <s> it is for industry itself to look for recruitment that in the future will provide skilled men <e> <s> the government can do little more than provide assistance and advice as well as the environment in which this can be done <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are in fact taking that kind of step in that the training initiative provides for a change from the traditional four-year apprenticeship starting at age and finishing at to the system that i have described of diploma and certification involving necessary skills rather more commensurate with the traineess own abilities <e> <s> that in itself will allow a greater flexibility <e> <s> there has been a higher number of redundancies than one would have wished <e> <s> there were last year the bulk of which i speak from memory perhaps my noble friend will allow me to confirm the figures to him were placed by the field officers of the training boards <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i could agree with one of the three propositions which the noble lord lord gormley has offered to the house <e> <s> the level of unemployment generally has little to do with the necessity for industry to undertake recruitment and provide skilled men for the future <e> <s> if we allow it to go down at this time a dreadful position will result in say five or seven years time and so it is very much the responsibility of industry to take a longer-term view where training for the future is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are fully aware of the importance of transport <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that those communities served by community buses or other services are greatly encouraged and helped by them <e> <s> the government would most certainly like to see further initiatives being taken in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not accept that the trial areas and the de-licensing arrangements are totally ineffective <e> <s> that is not the case particularly in certain areas hampshire being one of them which have made great use of the facilities provided <e> <s> as regards the support transport supplementary grant is only a small proportion of the finance available to county councils for that expenditure <e> <s> i note of course the concern expressed by the noble lord lord underhill and i will certainly bring it to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed yes is the short answer <e> <s> the regional transport officers the county co-ordinating officers are continually having discussions with the post office regional directors who are empowered to use their discretion in providing post buses for this purpose <e> <s> however the criteria are rather strict and it is not always practicable or possible to enlist the services of the post office whose first priority of course is the carrying of mail <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know exactly which part of the country the noble lord is referring to <e> <s> i cannot think that the government are totally responsible for the price of petrol <e> <s> in fact most of the community bus services would be running on diesel and there is already a subsidy for the bus services of about million in duty rebate <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be but the question on the order paper has nothing to do with serpell and your lordships will recall that we shall be debating that report next week <e> <s> i am quite sure that we could deal with this point on that occasion if it should be raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i am not able to answer the noble lords first question <e> <s> however i can tell him that the / tsg settlement accepted bids of million for bus revenue support which is an increase of per cent <e> <s> in cash terms over the previous year <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to have to tell the noble lord lord tanlaw that i must again repeat what he was told on the last occasion when he raised this point <e> <s> he was then told that it is not for central government to interfere with the rights of local authorities and i have to tell him again that this bill makes no provision for local authorities so to do <e> <s> the highway authority is responsible and must remain responsible for the provision of facilities for cyclists <e> <s> it is for the highway authority to decide how to organise that provision in the best interests of cyclists and other road users <e> <s> as my noble friend lady trumpington has said cambridge has done so to a greater or lesser degree <e>", "<cs> during the passage of the bill i am very anxious not to spend irrelevant time on matters outside its scope <e> <s> the bill is concerned with the preparation of three-year plans leading to the provision of bus and train services <e> <s> cyclists are essentially outside the scope of the bill <e> <s> if however the committee would like me to enlarge upon the provisions which my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter has asked me to do i can do so <e> <s> the government have clear policies with regard to cyclists <e> <s> they were contained in the cycling policy statement which was published after consultation in january of this year <e> <s> they encourage the provision of improved facilities for cyclists <e> <s> the overriding aim is to improve the safety of cyclists by providing facilities which will act as alternatives to the use of heavily trafficked and potentially dangerous roads <e> <s> we provide financial support for the innovative elements of local cycling schemes and we undertake research and provide advice on the provision of these facilities <e>", "<cs> of course the government realise the difficulty that many parents have in affording full fares for older children and of course the government are concerned with the family <e> <s> it is for this reason that the level of childrens fares is provided for in the childrens subsidies within the general subsidy which is eligible for support under the transport supplementary grant <e> <s> in london and most metropolitan counties reduced fares for children are part of the overall fares structure and that is where it has to be <e> <s> it is not for the secretary of state to say whether a subsidy is too low or too high <e> <s> most members of your lordships committee who have spoken have rather missed the point <e> <s> the secretary of state has no direct responsibility for determining fare levels <e> <s> this is a matter for the transport executives commercial judgment and as such it would be reflected in the plan which they will put forward which is met by the pel <e>", "<cs> i am surprised that the noble lord lord mishcon should accuse me of being less than frank <e> <s> indeed perhaps i would say to the committee that he is being less than frank <e> <s> he is drawing into this afternoons debate an emotion it is called children <e> <s> it has nothing whatsoever to do with children <e> <s> it has to do with money and how it is spent <e> <s> there is not a question that this bill prevents childrens fares from being paid <e> <s> it is not so <e>", "<cs> i am repeating <e> <s> millions of pounds are spent in transport subsidy and childrens fares are met they are included in the general subsidy which is eligible for support under the transport supplementary grant <e> <s> it is that aspect when it is included in the total plan that goes before the secretary of state <e> <s> if the noble lord says that the half fare is a childs right that is a description <e> <s> if the metropolitan authority in offering its plan sees that right in perpetuity it has only to add it to its plan <e> <s> it will be part of the plan <e> <s> it is not a question of childrens fares but a question of total expenditure in subsidy <e>", "<cs> before the committee makes up its mind i should like to assure the committee that the payments for school bussing are not included in the pel <e> <s> they are dealt with by the education authorities <e> <s> school bussing is the point raised by the noble lord lord sefton <e> <s> it is the plan that is to be put before the secretary of state the plan prepared as between the transport executive and the authority that will show if it be the case that children have been accounted for <e> <s> that will be grant-aided within the terms of the pel <e> <s> so there is no question at this time of imposing by virtue of this bill a disadvantage on children whether they are going to school or to play <e>", "<cs> of course i cannot give an assurance that a claim under the pel will be met in full <e> <s> the whole point is that the pel is to be given consideration both by the secretary of state and the authorities concerned <e>", "<cs> at present an authority can tell its executive to provide a loss-making service <e>", "<cs> the committee should have firmly in their minds as we go through this stage that this bill can be considered only in terms of a complete package <e> <s> draw out little bits of it and the package is totally destroyed <e> <s> if that is the intention of noble lords opposite then i can understand it <e> <s> but i have to say now in reference to lord underhills remarks a short while ago that they do not like the bill i can understand that because the bill puts upon local authorities through the passenger transport executive a ceiling limit outside of which they have to run the gauntlet of the electorate <e> <s> therefore when we are talking about this particular amendment i ask the committee to bear in mind that we are talking about one part of a total package <e> <s> this is not a bit by bit bill <e> <s> this is one total package of one bill <e>", "<cs> it is the pel <e> <s> i have used that term to describe the pel and it is the limit to which they can go without being challenged <e>", "<cs> the government will of course listen to anything that noble lords may say during committee <e> <s> i was merely suggesting that we have to look at this bill as a package <e> <s> the basic principle of this bill is that transport executives and authorities offer a plan <e> <s> the secretary of state discusses this with the authorities <e> <s> a protected expenditure level is then established <e> <s> if indeed i said to the noble lord lord mcintosh limit <e> <s> i in fact should have said level <e> <s> a ceiling level a protected expenditure level <e> <s> obviously a metropolitan authority can exceed it if they so wish <e> <s> they would be ill advised so to do <e>", "<cs> with regard to the important point made by the noble lord lord underhill about what the other place did i would point out that it spent hours dealing with only clause and part of clause and i invite your lordships committee to consider exactly whose fault that was <e>", "<cs> i am extremely surprised that the noble lord lord tordoff should address that question to me bearing in mind where i sat over the last five years examining almost every transport bill line by line <e> <s> of course this is exactly what your lordships house and its committees are for <e> <s> i merely underline the fact that there is much work to be done and was spent in the other place <e>", "<cs> i do not know perhaps some of my noble friends might have thought that it was anger but some might have thought that it was just excitement <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot help the noble lord because i just do not know the answer to that question <e> <s> my understanding is that the secretary of state may take into consideration any benefit that the local authority through the transport executive puts into its plan <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for reading that out <e> <s> it all seems eminently satisfactory to me <e> <s> how can the government be expected to stand back when and i quote one instance which was given during the second reading debate that of south yorkshire a per cent <e> <s> increase in subsidy led to only a per cent <e> <s> increase in bus passenger miles <e> <s> a considerable part of that increase in subsidy went on the acquisition of other undertakings <e> <s> the government have an overall responsibility and it is because of these excesses because the wilder excesses of subsidy have occurred that the government have to take this step <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord although i must confess that i have found the last minutes or so extremely interesting <e> <s> i want to answer specifically the question which the noble lord lord mcintosh asked which dealt with the question of benefits <e> <s> he referred to a document and i imagine that the document must have been the <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i do not propose to answer that question now because the document deals with the planning system to which we shall come later <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh raised one small point and asked does this exclude or does it include <e> <s> i am saying to him in answer because i want to be helpful that notwithstanding the document from which he quoted if authorities put forward other matters the secretary of state will be able to take them into account in determining the protected expenditure level upon which depends the amount of subsidy outside of which local authorities can determine their own course <e>", "<cs> i can only repeat what i have already said <e> <s> the words set down in the amendment are restrictive and we believe deny exactly what it is that the opposition are asking for which is that the secretary of state can take into consideration benefits <e> <s> by writing down particular words it constrains him <e> <s> i think that the committee would not wish the secretary of state to be constrained in considering the matter of benefits <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble baroness lady denington would allow me to interrupt and to take up the words of the noble lord lord mishcon a little earlier <e> <s> in this amendment we are not dealing with rates in particular we are dealing with a definition of benefits <e> <s> while i could quite easily answer her <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble baroness but i ought to come towards the end of what i can offer to the committee with regard to benefits <e> <s> i can only repeat that with the amendments reference to social economic and environmental transport advantages it is wide but we feel that there is at least the possibility of argument that some benefit which it is believed will be derived from the plan when it is <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would be for the convenience of the committee if i suggested that we should now pause in our consideration of this bill and adjourn for one hour for dinner thus allowing the other business of the house to continue <e> <s> if that meets with the agreement of the committee i beg to move that the house be now resumed <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord marsh on two counts this afternoon first for raising this immensely important subject for debate and secondly for the humour and good nature with which he has introduced it <e> <s> we are indebted and will be for a long time to the noble lord for his contribution on matters of this kind where his experience is of so much value <e> <s> additionally this afternoon we have the privilege of hearing two maiden speakers and i am quite sure that we shall look forward to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i would in fact prefer to come to that point when i wind up largely because i suspect that there may be other questions around the fringe of the costs and who what and why and it may be more convenient to the house if i attempt i do not know whether i shall succeed to embrace all answers of that kind at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to make some attempt to respond to the very large number of questions and points that have been raised this afternoon <e> <s> as indeed the noble lord lord bruce of donington said and as i think we all expected we have had a very interesting and wide-ranging debate <e> <s> i am most grateful to all members of the house who have taken part in this debate and can assure them that whatever shortcomings i may display in not being able to respond to every one due note will properly be taken of everything that they have said <e> <s> my lords too pay tribute to the two maiden speakers the noble lord lord ezra and the noble lord lord prys-davies <e> <s> i would wish to come back perhaps a little later to some of the remarks that they made <e> <s> i welcomed what lord prys-davies said about the <e>", "<cs> my lords i heard an exclamation of surprise perhaps or astonishment <e> <s> let us just look at the figure in context <e> <s> it is a huge amount of money but in the british taxpayer paid million to british rail in support and subsidy which is about an hour <e> <s> just over for a consultancy represents less than half a days subsidy and that does not seem to me to be an unreasonable price to pay to get a review of finances and an identification of million savings which with energy and efficiency can be achieved within the very short term <e> <s> speaking purely as a business man i like the return <e> <s> it sounds quite good to me if i get my million savings over the short period <e>", "<cs> my lords if i can clear it up i shall be delighted to do so <e> <s> i do not have that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged to the noble lord lord bruce because we can certainly clear that up <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state has made it clear that serpell forms an input to a major debate in both houses of parliament with the public and with all the interested people <e> <s> he wants that debate <e> <s> when that debate has been completed and i would not want to put a timescale on it decisions might be made <e> <s> but it does not mean to say that all decisions will be held up until that time because that would be quite wrong <e> <s> certain decisions have already been taken by british rail which have come within the ambit of the report they concern cost savings and so on <e> <s> i trust that that answers the noble lord lord tanlaw <e>", "<cs> my lords at least we agree on some part of the interpretation of integration <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not expect to pay for a repeat performance <e> <s> i believe that repeat fees are somewhat lower than the original <e> <s> i have repeated that the serpell options are illustrations and it is right that people should understand that particularly so far as the network is concerned <e> <s> what we want to do is to widen the context in which we look at these rural and other transport services <e> <s> i can put the matter no better than did my right honourable friend in the debate in the other place on rd february when he said at column <e>", "<cs> before coming to the substance of the amendment i should say that the general aim of the clause is to ensure that each authority and executive thinks hard about whether that executives activities could be better operated as smaller units <e> <s> there is evidence that large monopolies have a tendency to allow costs to increase rapidly particularly when the only control over them is by a subsidising local authority <e> <s> between and <e>", "<cs> of course the government would welcome and have welcomed those authorities and executives which have carried out reviews the three the noble lord lord underhill mentioned and those reviews covered the matters which the government have in mind in clause of bringing some parts of the operations of executives into smaller groups <e> <s> that could be carried out under the terms of the general review which is permitted under the act and we are all agreed on that <e> <s> it would not be necessary for the secretary of state to require an authority to carry out a review if under the general powers such a review had taken place <e> <s> the aim is to ensure that the authorities which would not otherwise carry out a review of this kind could be asked to do so <e>", "<cs> in specific answer i would say that i cannot see that in fact it makes a great deal of difference which words are used <e> <s> the bill states <e>", "<cs> no i did not say that at all <e> <s> what i am suggesting with respect is that the noble lord is playing with words <e> <s> there are a number of enactments that require various bodies to do various things and this is not greatly different <e>", "<cs> that is exactly what i said <e> <s> i said that the noble lord asked me whether i could demonstrate whether i could tell him what are particular activities <e> <s> bus divisions in london smaller self-accounting units indeed there are two of them split-up of operating centres geographical operating centres profit/cost centres those are the kind of particular activities to which we would refer <e>", "<cs> i beg the noble lords pardon with regard to amendments nos <e> <s> and the government are concerned that executives should look further than those points of general note and see <e>", "<cs> i said geographical areas and i quoted london as an example <e> <s> what i said was a geographical area <e> <s> so splitting a bus service into geographical areas into self-accounting areas could be an activity rather than perhaps leaving a large mass <e> <s> that could be a part of a managerial organisation <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord sefton knows very well that i cannot give him that assurance <e> <s> he picked up geographical areas and then applied it to merseyside <e> <s> then he made one little change and started talking about zones <e> <s> he shakes his head but he did talk about zones <e> <s> i do not know how a geographical area breakdown might or might not apply in merseyside <e> <s> however if the secretary of state asked merseyside to make a review with that in mind no doubt they would follow some of the points the noble lord himself has made <e> <s> the point that only the merseyside county council or pte could find suitable areas is not necessarily so <e> <s> that they have done so is evident in their plan <e> <s> perhaps they are in front on that <e>", "<cs> this bill does not put an obligation as of now upon that authority to do anything that the noble lord suggests might be done <e> <s> he has just read out the first subsection of the clause <e> <s> that reads <e>", "<cs> i cannot tell the noble lord if there is to be any increase in the number of civil servants employed <e> <s> if the question that the noble lord asked is in relation to what happens to the review afterwards then i think that that is contained in subsection of clause <e>", "<cs> when i first looked at this amendment i really was not quite clear what the noble lord had in mind to achieve by it <e> <s> i must say that i still am not really sure what the noble lord hopes to achieve by it <e> <s> as far as i can see the effect of the amendment would be to permit the authority to exclude payment for the cost of the review from its revenue account <e> <s> clause does not specify who shall pay for the undertaking of the review <e> <s> if the amendment proposed to remove the cost of undertaking the review from the exective i could understand it but the amendment says something rather different <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon endeavoured to explain the intention of the amendment <e> <s> i believe i answered the point that he made <e> <s> if the intention is that the cost of the management review should fall outside the expenditure to which the protected expenditure level relates the amendment does not achieve that aim <e> <s> even with the amendment the authority could pay the executive for the cost of the management review only by making a revenue grant and any revenue grant comes within the scope of the bill <e> <s> the rather more general point is who is to bear the cost <e> <s> the whole purpose of the management review is to encourage research into improving efficiency and attaining better value for money <e> <s> if a commercial concern decided that yes we must carry out a management review the cost of this will fall absolutely upon the company <e> <s> this happens whether the review is initiated by management itself or by the shareholders <e> <s> perhaps the government are shareholders in that they are finding from central funds and from the taxpayer enormous sums of money <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i will not go away with this <e> <s> it is for the authority to decide on the precise form of the review <e> <s> if the authority pays for a review by consultants or on its own it does not come within the pel anyway <e> <s> if however it decides that the executive shall pay and it is for the authority to decide who pays then the noble lord is <e>", "<cs> the noble lord may be horrified but he is trying to suggest to me that the cost of the review can disappear out of the revenue accounting <e>", "<cs> of course he is because where else can the charge be met but in the revenue account <e> <s> it is an expenditure on the business and on the operation <e> <s> it has to be paid for by the operation <e> <s> if a review is called for during the course of a year in which the pel has been fixed and we discussed much earlier on monday what other sources of <e>", "<cs> indeed consideration has been given to it but certainly i cannot resist the blandishments of the noble baroness lady nicol and the noble baroness lady denington in support of what the noble lord lord somers says or in support of what the noble lord lord mishcon said <e> <s> all i can do is to promise to go away having in my mind all that has been said and give it some further consideration <e> <s> i certainly undertake to do that and to write to the noble lord lord mishcon and to other interested noble lords <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the clause is to reinforce the requirement that executives should have regard to cost effectiveness <e> <s> it does this by requiring them to seek and accept tenders for suitable activities that might be more cheaply and effectively provided elsewhere and we instance for example late night or weekend services <e> <s> when the noble lord lord underhill read out the notes on clauses he said that this would include both certain peak hour provision and services late at night or at weekends <e> <s> had he gone further he might have added competition for other activities of the executives such as maintenance work or ancillary services such as cleaning or catering that could also help to reduce costs <e> <s> the notes on clauses gave him an indication of the areas in which one might expect an authority to seek outside tenders <e> <s> the move towards the provision of more cost-effective and efficient services just has to be in everybodys interest and executives must be placed under a firm obligation to ensure that activities are carried out by others where they can do so more cheaply and efficiently <e>", "<cs> i think that i should remind the committee that this bill is very much about efficiency <e> <s> it is absolutely essential that all authorities and the ptes look very hard in the future to ensuring that they get real value for money <e> <s> it is not unreasonable therefore to see if there is a contractor outside who can undertake a service or an activity better and cheaper <e> <s> if necessary they are then empowered to enter into an agreement <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord underhill is quite rightthere are powers under section of the act and passenger transport executives are free to enter into agreements <e> <s> although london transport has power to enter into agreements with the nbc its current powers are not so wide as those provided by section so a similar power is made available to london transport under clause <e>", "<cs> i think that the only answer that i can give the noble lord lord mishcon is that the discretion lies with the executive under subsection of this clause and with the authority under subsection <e> <s> the secretary of state does not have discretion by anything written in clause with regard to going out to tender <e> <s> the law if the bill passes into law would just require the executive to go out to tender as it may determine <e> <s> the secretary of state has no discretion in this matter <e>", "<cs> i think i have to answer only the one point from the noble lord lord mishcon and that is will the secretary of state take into account when fixing the pel whether the executives have gone out to tender or not <e> <s> that is the gist of his question <e> <s> of course the secretary of state will take account of anything that appears in the plan that requires his consideration so that if the plan includes a certain area of activity which it is proposed should go out to tender which may cost <e>", "<cs> i am quite happy to talk to both amendments nos <e> <s> and if that is the wish of the committee <e> <s> dealing first with amendment no <e> <s> where an executive has sought tenders and a tender shows that a particular activity can be satisfactorily and more cheaply carried out other than by the executive surely the executive should be under a duty to accept it <e> <s> the duty that an executive has to ratepayers and to the travelling public is to provide services as cheaply and efficiently as possible <e> <s> that is exactly what clause seeks to achieve <e>", "<cs> i think that i can answer the noble lord quite simply <e> <s> quite obviously a tender <e>", "<cs> i can only reiterate what i said previously namely that the executive only have to accept tenders where it appears to them and i repeat where it appears to them that the activity can be satisfactorily and more cheaply carried out <e> <s> in view of what has been said i am quite happy to go away and read and consider again what noble lords have said with regard to this matter <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord lord mishcon whether it is not a fact that the ptes have a duty to their ratepayers and the travelling public to provide services as cheaply and as efficiently as possible <e> <s> that is their duty <e> <s> this clause goes some way towards assisting them in discharging that duty <e> <s> the clause is not a new concept <e> <s> nothing new has been introduced in this clause <e> <s> the best executives already sub-contract work <e> <s> the provision merely encourages the other executives to search for areas and then to search for tenderers to meet those areas where it could lead to savings <e>", "<cs> my lords as my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport has announced today the government propose that the police should be able to use wheelclamps for an experimental period in westminster south of bishops bridge road and marylebone road and north of <e>", "<cs> my lords the widest publicity will be given through the press and other media and also in the local areas <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend expects to review the experiment after about months that is about months before the total period of two years which was allowed under the transport act of last year <e>", "<cs> my lords there are about one-third of a million car parking offences in london each working day and the scheme is designed to reduce the number of people who may offend in this respect <e> <s> if a gross danger is likely to occur then the provisions that already apply for taking up and removing a car will continue to apply <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a very different question <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects on behalf of my noble friend the lord privy seal i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords there are currently wages councils <e> <s> there are no plans at present to abolish particular councils <e> <s> however each one is kept under scrutiny and we are ready to abolish individual councils when the need for them ceases to exist <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed we are very well aware that the proposals of some wages councils particularly some made recently have had an inhibiting effect on recruitment particularly of young people and this is an unhappy situation <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords that was so at that time <e> <s> but other and better wage negotiating procedures have been adopted and as and when these come into full being throughout the remaining councils the need for those councils will no longer exist <e>", "<cs> no my lords i was not aware that that institute had expressed that view <e> <s> perhaps the contrary view should also obtain that of the employers <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord lord blyton says but in my original answer i said that her majestys government have no plans at present to abolish particular councils <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> about in the last years <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords i thank my noble friend for that intervention <e> <s> to put it properly into perspective i think that perhaps i should say that the remaining councils in fact look after the wages interests of only million people <e>", "<cs> my lords that may have obtained at that time but i hardly think that ruthless exploitation obtains today <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords from both sides of the house this morning have drawn attention to the difficulties facing the unemployed and some have argued the case for assistance through the kind of concessionary fare scheme envisaged in the bill <e> <s> my colleagues in government have no difficulty in recognising the conviction with which those views are held <e> <s> neither are my colleagues less concerned at the plight of the unemployed than any other noble lord in your lordships house <e> <s> it is a matter of concern <e> <s> but we have to ask ourselves is subsidy for travel the best way of helping those who are out of work <e> <s> can the very considerable demands which such subsidies would make on national resources be justified in terms either of transport policies or indeed of social welfare <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very surprised that the noble lord lord hatch of lusby can stand there and ask me that question <e> <s> he did not have the courtesy to put his name down which is quite customary in your lordships house for second reading debates and then he asks me that question <e> <s> i am happy to answer the noble lord but i merely draw the attention of the house to that practice <e> <s> there is no contradiction <e> <s> concessionary fares that are worked out by ptes with their local authorities and that are self-financing are to be commended <e> <s> were we not to have that kind of arrangement in other words if we have an additional subsidy we estimate that a further million might be required in subsidy <e>", "<cs> my lords in the year ending st march miles of trunk roads and motorways were completed in the united kingdom <e> <s> of these miles are trunk roads and are motorways <e> <s> comparable figures for local authority roads which are not the governments responsibility are not held centrally <e>", "<cs> my lords progress so far in is satisfactory <e> <s> in england a combination of fine weather very low tender prices and the ability of some contractors to redeploy resources to road construction have enabled us to achieve far more than anticipated contracts are expected to be completed or open to traffic of them ahead of schedule and that will add a further miles of motorway and miles of trunk roads to the national network <e> <s> to answer the second part of my noble friends supplementary regarding by-passes of these are on trunk roads and have been or are being by-passed <e> <s> there are plans in preparation for a further and of the remaining eight have relief roads other than by-passes planned or already in construction <e>", "<cs> my lords work on the m is now under way and it is expected to be completed in the early autumn of this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i am not able to tell the noble lord the number of roads and projects that have not been completed <e> <s> i can tell him however that the accident rate on trunk roads and motorways involving both passenger cars and commercial vehicles is reducing each year <e>", "<cs> my lords the m orbital route is on target and completion date for the whole is scheduled for miles are completed and a further miles are expected to be opened this year which means that by the end of the year over half the total length will have been completed <e> <s> the remaining contracts should be let about this time next year <e>", "<cs> i could not agree with that my lords <e> <s> for example million is the estimated figure for new construction and maintenance for the current period <e> <s> that is per cent <e> <s> up on the previous year which was per cent <e> <s> up on the year previous to that <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a private bill <e> <s> all i can say to the noble lord who suggested that the government should postpone it is that it is not in the governments remit to postpone the bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill recognised the necessity for the bill <e> <s> without it a vacuum will be caused in a year or two <e>", "<cs> my lords whether or not a toll should be charged the fact is that motorways have been thought to be part of the strategic network of roads and should therefore be provided by central government and supported by local government <e> <s> where however an alternative is provided either a tunnel or a bridge which in every case has been asked for by the promoting companies which would show an exceptional saving albeit at an exceptional cost it has been felt almost from the beginning by successive governments that the taxpayer should not have to bear the cost since he bears the cost of road construction but that the bridge user should bear the cost <e> <s> the money is taken from the road user by virtue of the toll <e> <s> therefore if one tries to relate the two the question which the noble lord lord somers has asked is a little different <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that only the federal republic of germany have a system of biennial testing <e>", "<cs> my lords the testing in other countries is similar in that luxembourg tests annually after three years belgium annually after four years and the netherlands after five years <e> <s> in france denmark greece and ireland no testing takes place <e>", "<cs> my lords we had a long discussion on this issue in comittee when i said that a specific reference in clause to reduce fares for children not only made it clear that they were included within revenue grants made by authorities but also confirmed the power to pay grants for childrens fares <e> <s> that surely is a helpful and positive step <e> <s> some authorities have recently had doubts about the legality of payments for reduced fares for children which they have traditionally made and a variety of authorities make different arrangements for fare reductions <e> <s> as there is doubt about the law relating to subsidies it is appropriate that the bill should clarify matters <e> <s> the first of the two amendments we are discussing in removing the reference to childrens grants from the definition of revenue grants would once again cause <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may come to the point made by the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead in a moment i say straight away to the noble lord lord mishcon that i am very sorry to have been the person to induce a quarrel between the noble lord lord mishcon and his noble friend <e> <s> certainly that was never the intention <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon knows very well that i cannot give an undertaking that childrens concessionary fares will be allowed in full <e> <s> it is the total subsidy that is looked at how that subsidy is spent is entirely for the local authority <e> <s> i have said already that childrens fares do not meet their full cost <e> <s> if i were in commercial business right now i might suggest why not load as much as i can onto the childrens fares because after all the secretary of state is going to pick that up and then i can use my subsidy somewhere else <e> <s> the whole point of this is to achieve a balance of expenditure <e> <s> how it is spent is the responsibility of the local authority to decide in the light of its local requirements <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord sefton appeared to me to have momentarily i am quite sure it was only momentarily lost sight of the purpose of this bill <e> <s> the purpose of this bill is to bring some degree of control on the expenditure upon transport by the metropolitan authorities <e> <s> your lordships will remember that my noble friend said at second reading and during the committee stage that expenditure in the current financial year was estimated at about million and for the coming financial year there was a total expenditure of million anticipated <e> <s> if we added those elements that the noble lord lord sefton has just outlined to us a whole wide-ranging group of people that million could be even larger <e> <s> that is the burden that fell upon the ratepayers and that is the burden which the ratepayers felt unacceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite happy for the words harder and harsher to remain when it comes to monetary matters <e> <s> when it comes to looking after other peoples money a hard and harsh look has to be taken at expenditure <e> <s> a lot of businesses have been doing that for a number of years and there is nothing wrong with that <e> <s> yes i am quite happy about that <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house of course the noble lord lord tanlaw is absolutely right <e> <s> perhaps your lordships will forgive me on this occasion and put it down to my being a comparatively new boy in this position <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with interest to the explanation given by the noble lord lord underhill of amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is very similar to the one put down during the committee stage <e> <s> i am afraid that my noble friend was not persuaded then and indeed we are not persuaded on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it might be particularly helpful to the noble lord lord pitt if i went at some length into this matter of how to deal with the deficit <e> <s> the bill provides that where an executive makes a deficit it has to make good that deficit in the following year <e> <s> but the bill also provides that where the executive plans to use the reserves the associated deficit is exempted from the duty to make it good <e> <s> in the first year and this is the matter about which the noble lord lord pitt particularly asked exemption is provided by clause always provided that the executive has notified the secretary of state of its intention to appropriate reserves before he gives his guidance to the authority <e> <s> but in subsequent years the proposal to use reserves must be proposed by the executive in its plan and it has to be approved by the authority <e> <s> the relevant power is in clause <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i understand that the greater london council which is the traffic authority responsible intends to install additional traffic lights at this junction shortly with a view to improving the flow of traffic <e> <s> both the council and the metropolitan police are monitoring the situation carefully and are keeping my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport informed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the messages that capital radio send out <e> <s> however i can tell my noble friend that about vehicles use hyde park corner each day and that excludes the underpass <e> <s> at peak flow there are about vehicles per hour <e> <s> the additional two sets of traffic lights are to complete a traffic management scheme <e> <s> these lights should come into use over the weekend of th march and as the traffic management scheme is experimental it may well be some time before this can be evaluated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not able to remove them nor indeed is the secretary of state for transport <e> <s> the greater london council are the traffic authority and it is a matter entirely for them <e> <s> much as i regret that the noble lord has been inconvenienced i should tell your lordships that over the last four or five years there have been a consistently high number of accidents in that area and the traffic management scheme is in part to alleviate that irreparable damage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill who has quite obviously grasped the seriousness of this situation and recognises that a traffic management scheme is necessary both to control the traffic and to reduce the toll of accidents <e> <s> i confirm that this is an experimental scheme the results of which are being monitored and will be reviewed in the fullness of time <e>", "<cs> my lords patience is a virtue seldom found in men and very seldom in drivers <e>", "<cs> my lords the monitoring is done by both the glc traffic department and the metropolitan police <e> <s> i have little doubt that the comments made by your lordships this afternoon will add to the whole point of the monitoring <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give an answer to the noble lord lord wigoder but i am sure he will recognise that when any new traffic scheme comes into operation it takes some little time to settle down <e> <s> i can tell him that officials from my department were at hyde park corner from very early this morning for about three hours and did not notice any ill effects from the scheme <e> <s> the scheme is now one month old <e>", "<cs> none whatsoever my lords <e> <s> it is far too early to come to any conclusion on a scheme as massive as this <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give my noble friend any exact date but obviously it will be <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord bellwin i beg to move that the bill be now further considered on report <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to thank the noble lord lord underhill for explaining the purpose of this amendment <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that the secretary of state is indeed reasonable and he certainly has no intention of asking for information other than that which he considers necessary and relevant for the purpose of giving initial advice <e> <s> this is really the point <e> <s> the secretary of state can ask only for information which is relevant to giving initial advice <e> <s> he does not have freedom to require any information <e> <s> indeed as the full planning cycle gets off the ground much of the information for setting the next years initial advice will no doubt come from previous years plans <e>", "<cs> my lords whether consult is the right word or not i would have thought that the words seek the advice of can imply taking the advice of a more learned or superior body and then being under a duty to consider and accept that advice <e> <s> we would not want to imply that in the bill <e> <s> if an authority does not like the executives proposals there are plenty of safeguards for the authority to require the executive to set out the implications of alternative proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to tell the house that there is already adequate statutory cover for the purposes of this amendment <e> <s> the purposes are twofold first to ensure that executives obtain the information which they themselves need from the nbc secondly to ensure that they can obtain information required by the secretary of state <e> <s> so far as the first point is concerned and as the noble lord lord underhill reminded us section of the transport act places the nbc and the executives under a duty to co-operate with one another and to enter into agreements as to the services to be provided by each within a metropolitan county <e> <s> agreements have been concluded between executives and nbc subsidiary operating companies <e> <s> under the terms of these agreements there is already a flow of information to the ptes about nbcs operators within their areas <e> <s> certainly at this time there appears to be no difficulty with regard to the transfer of information <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said i think we would all accept that even in the best relationships some difficulties might arise <e> <s> perhaps they have <e> <s> i would suggest to the noble lord lord sefton that he raises a hypothetical question to which i regret i cannot give a hypothetical answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for explaining the purport of his amendment <e> <s> although he thinks that this is a very reasonable amendment in fact i would have chosen a rather different description <e> <s> although at first sight it seems harmless enough in <e>", "<cs> my lords may i answer particularly one point <e> <s> the bill as drafted does not prevent an authority having particular regard to other matters <e> <s> as my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter so succinctly put it if we add the words of the amendment it blurs the clarity of the subsection <e> <s> we could not agree to compel the authority to have particular regard to matters which are not specified <e> <s> that really is the point <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened to the remarks of the noble lords lord underhill and lord tordoff i can say categorically that the secretary of state has no intention of requiring transport authorities to cause frequent reviews to be made of the management and organisation of their executives <e> <s> once a review has been made whether it has been initiated by the executive the authority or under clause of this measure the authority and the executive will need to consider the report and <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord underhill is quite correct <e> <s> at committee stage i undertook to read and consider what noble lords had said at that time <e> <s> we were then discussing an almost identical amendment no <e> <s> at that time which sought to insert a provision in the bill that an executive should not be bound to accept the lowest or any tender <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i add that certainly lord mishcons recollection of the issues that we discussed on the last occasion is correct <e> <s> he failed to say that there were a great many noble lords on both sides of the house who pressed for the government to have a further look at this matter and indeed we have done just that <e> <s> we do not see the requirement under the clause as an imposition as the noble lord lord mishcon described it <e> <s> it is a requirement that the executive and the executive alone may decide whether or not any of their activities is suitable for going out to tender <e> <s> it is for them so to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> if the tender is unsatisfactory in any way the executive are not bound to accept it <e> <s> there must be a reason for an executive not wishing to accept perhaps the noble lord lord tordoff will allow me to continue and if there is such a reason why the executive do not think the tender is satisfactory they ought to be able to say so <e> <s> if they cannot there must be some doubt as to whether or not it is satisfactory and they are under a duty if the tender is satisfactory in all respects and can be undertaken at less cost to themselves to accept <e> <s> did the noble lord lord tordoff want to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it the house will accept that i was interrupted rather than that i am coming to the box for a third time <e> <s> yes i did say in all respects but perhaps i should remove those three words and say satisfactory <e> <s> at the end of the day it is for the executive to determine whether the tender is satisfactory and if it is coupled with the point as regards the cost then they should accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords todays debate on this amendment is the third we have had in a fortnight about travel concessions for unemployed people <e> <s> it was quite clear particularly from what was said in the debate on lord molloys bill recently that there was then and indeed from what has been said this afternoon there is now a great deal of sympathy on all sides of the house for the problems faced by those without work <e> <s> but what we must ask ourselves i suggest is whether the measures here proposed represent a sensible response to those problems whether this amendment really is an effective means of bringing help to the unemployed and equally important whether it can be justified on general grounds of social policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for explaining why this clause has been tabled again and of course i accept the reasons why that is so <e> <s> i am sorry that the letter of my noble friend lord bellwin to my noble friend lord teviot which was copied to the noble lord lord underhill was not available to him before he put down the amendments but he has obviously had an opportunity of giving consideration to the contents of that letter <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend the lord privy seal i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords we all share the sorrow expressed by the noble baroness lady white at the sad news of the death over the week-end of mr alec jones <e> <s> as the noble lord the leader of the opposition has said he played a most valuable part in the life of wales and will be sorely missed by his friends <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that both the noble lord lord underhill and the noble viscount have given a welcome to the development of liverpool street station which is the subject of this bill <e> <s> indeed the government themselves acknowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord underhill has reminded us we have had some interesting and really quite long discussions on this point during previous stages particularly on the financial duty imposed on an executive under clause <e> <s> amendments have been put down to enable an executive to make good deficits over a three-year period rather than in the next year and we have explained on a number of occasions why such loose financial management is unacceptable <e> <s> this amendment is only slightly different from the others we have considered in that it enables an executive to break even over a three-year period the relevant period to which the noble lord referred rather than <e>", "<cs> my lords again i remind your lordships house that we have had some amendments put down at previous stages of this bill in similar vein which we have resisted as being unnecessary and because frankly they would have added nothing to the bill <e> <s> i have to resist this amendment as well both because it is unnecessary and also because it actually repeats a provision that is already in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i of course accept that the amendment has nothing to do with the benefits <e> <s> however i wonder whether the amendment results from perhaps a slight misunderstanding of the <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would in effect put back into the bill a provision similar to section of the transport act <e> <s> with the amendment we return to the subject of that section that was discussed in some detail in your lordships house and in another place that of the authoritys power to direct an executive to provide a loss-making service <e> <s> as the noble lord lord underhill explained the authority has power under section of the act to direct its executive to provide this loss-making service on the condition that it provides the necessary grant <e> <s> it is the case that section is to be repealed in april next year because its provisions as we have previously made clear will be effectively replaced by clause especially subsection and to an extent subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house it is not i who am springing a trap it is the noble lord lord mcintosh who is making quite unwarranted and quite uninvited assumptions <e> <s> he has said that the responsibility of the authority is to provide the best transport plan possible <e> <s> he said that that may well include a number of headings which he mentioned among them social needs <e> <s> of course that is so that is absolutely right <e> <s> but he then assumed that those social needs which may only meet the needs of a small number of people would be provided at the expense of the mainstream service <e> <s> that is as an assumption with which i cannot agree because it need not necessarily be so <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am sorry that the noble lord lord sefton has not received a particular response to that question <e> <s> what i can tell him is that it is the governments intention to defend to protect the authority up to the protected expenditure level outside of which if an authority wished to proceed it would then be for the courts to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords during the report stage of this bill on th march we had a long and interesting discussion in relation then to amendments nos <e> <s> and which were moved by the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> these were basically on whether an authority should be able to increase its amount of revenue grant to an executive during the year in order to cover any emergencies <e> <s> the noble lord suggested then that this might be made subject to the approval of the secretary of state and my noble friend lord bellwin promised at that time to consider all that had been said on that occasion <e> <s> my noble friend has indeed done so and your lordships will know that when he promises to do something he always does it <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am rather forced to my feet by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> i would suggest that he has lost his bet because i added a totally different argument from that which was previously advanced one which i should have thought would appeal to him <e> <s> i said and i cannot recall having said it before that it seemed to me that this would result only in considerably greater interference by the secretary of state in the affairs of an authority and an executive <e> <s> i know that we are at one in not wishing that to happen but that is what the amendment suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords without being frivolous perhaps i could remind your lordships of some of the words the noble lord lord underhill used when we were discussing the last amendment <e> <s> he referred to having had to adapt his amendments to meet what we had said <e> <s> frankly this amendment is an absolute adaptation it is fundamentally the same but it brings in the british rail element and adds one word <e> <s> recognising these small differences i would not have thought they were very significant but if the noble lord wishes again to debate the basic issue then that is of course his prerogative <e> <s> the present amendment introduces the word reasonably which my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter pointed out in a teasing way when we last discussed this would be necessary in the interests of consistency <e> <s> of course the house did not accept that amendment as the noble lord reminded us <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be very difficult for me to follow my own line of argument and indeed for the noble lord lord underhill to follow it if i gave way before i had <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord lord underhill and the noble lord lord howie of troon are particularly anxious that i should respond i can do no worse <e> <s> neither can i do any better than say that i can and do repeat the assurances i previously gave on report <e> <s> first the secretary of state will not ask for a clause review any later in a year than the date on which he gives his guidance under clause <e> <s> secondly he will not require reviews under clause more frequently than once in three years <e> <s> the secretary of state is in fact likely to use his powers under clause very rarely because authorities are far more likely to carry out such reviews of their <e>", "<cs> my lords notwithstanding what my noble friend lord mottistone said nevertheless we do have an amendment and i think that it would be right and proper to respond to it and your lordships would expect me to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for explaining the purpose of the amendment <e> <s> however i <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord underhill and lord pitt for raising this point <e> <s> i can appreciate their worries about the likely consequences if there were to be a delay after royal assent in issuing guidance and the authorities making their determination <e> <s> i do not however believe that the amendment is necessary <e> <s> i hope that i can categorically set your lordships minds at rest <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> i regret very much that my noble friend lord bellwin is unable to be present today <e> <s> i wish to begin if i may by reminding your lordships that at second reading he described the urgent need for greater certainty and stability for our public transport services both in the glc and the metropolitan areas and the need for improved efficiency and better value for money <e> <s> finally he emphasised the need to achieve a proper balance between the interests of ratepayers and of transport users <e> <s> that is what this important bill seeks to do <e>", "<cs> but my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it would perhaps be helpful were i to respond now to various points which have been made <e> <s> to change the tone of this debate just a little may i at the outset say how grateful i am to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter to other noble friends and to the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well have been the point the noble baroness was attempting to make <e> <s> the point she made certainly with me was <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to thank the noble lord lord brooks of tremorfa for the very lucid way in which he has described the bill which he is putting before your lordships this afternoon <e> <s> i am also grateful to him for bringing the bill forward and to the honourable member for gateshead east who launched the bill in another place <e> <s> i should like to add a few words of support <e> <s> this is a worthwhile measure which will remove the wasteful anomaly of different legal and administrative controls applying to the modernisation of level crossings depending on their circumstances <e> <s> railways have to be authorised to cross roads on the level and modernisation can be needed to improve the safety of crossings to make the railway cheaper to operate or to speed the flow of traffic using the crossing <e> <s> to enable itself to modernise crossings the british transport commission the forerunner of the british railways board took the powers which have been described to us in the act <e> <s> these were added to in the transport act <e> <s> however as the noble lord said neither of those two acts is normally available to railways other than british railways <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the greater london council originally estimated the cost of this experiment at <e> <s> additional works have been undertaken but the cost of these is not yet known <e> <s> the experiment is part of a programme of minor schemes accepted by the department of transport as being eligible for transport supplementary grant purposes <e> <s> however it is for the greater london council to decide how that block grant is allocated between its many eligible schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand from both the police and the glc authorities that since the installation on th march of the additional traffic lights there has been some improvement in the traffic flow <e> <s> additionally i can tell my noble friend that as we return from post-easter holiday traffic the monitoring will be continued and a certain amount of fine tuning has to be undertaken in particular in relation to the light sequences <e> <s> however i should remind my noble friend that the primary concern of the greater london council in putting this traffic management scheme into operation was to reduce the excessive number of accidents that have taken place in the area in the last few years <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to my noble friends last supplementary question i can tell her that the lights remain operative whether the horses are crossing or standing still <e> <s> with regard to the accidents there have been a number involving personal injury <e> <s> the most important accident figures for comprised involving pedal cyclists involving people in motor cars and involving people in psvs <e> <s> in all in there were personal injury accidents in there were and in there were <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot confirm whether or not more police are employed at this stage <e> <s> certainly i can tell my noble friend that until such time as the system has been accepted by the motorist it takes some considerable time for motorists to accept any change in traffic movements and until such time as the fine tuning has been accomplished there may well be people who perceive congestion when there may in fact be none <e> <s> i have little doubt that as the system gets under way and becomes accepted by motorists the blockages of which he speaks will be minimised <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord lord underhill for that intervention <e> <s> he is absolutely right <e> <s> if we take his advice and examine this gyratory system in three or four months time we shall be better able to make a more sensible judgment than at a time only two or three weeks after it has been fully in operation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord lord molloy <e> <s> he is right <e> <s> i replied first to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter on st march <e> <s> since that time the additional lights have been brought into operation <e> <s> that was on th march <e> <s> the glc observers the police and officials from my department who have made observations report in a manner that suggests that the scheme is more likely to be profitable and practical than otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the remarks of the noble lord lord annan will be taken to heart by those who support the scheme <e> <s> i can only repeat that time will tell <e> <s> there has been very little time for assessment to date <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give my noble friend that assurance <e> <s> engineers from the greater london council traffic department are monitoring the scheme in a proper and acceptable manner <e> <s> adjustments to the system will be made as they become necessary <e> <s> this will not be left to chance <e>", "<cs> my lords i stated that among the numbers of accidents listed there were personal injury accidents concerning passenger service vehicles psvs <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> it is a simple measure which will relieve the port of london authority and the mersey docks and harbour company of part of their current debt burdens <e> <s> it fulfils an undertaking given to parliament by the secretary of state for transport on th december last year when he announced the new financial rgime for these two port authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i thank the noble lord lord underhill for the general welcome which he gave to the bill <e> <s> as i said when introducing the debate the bill is a simple measure <e> <s> it has the quite straightforward purpose of providing the port authorities of london and liverpool with a capital structure appropriate to their present size and situation <e> <s> the debt reductions for which the bill provides are smaller than the pla and the mersey harbour company would have liked but they offer a real prospect of returning to profitability in the years ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords the government fully accept that when lead-free petrol is introduced transitional arrangements will be needed for a number of years to ensure that leaded petrol continues to be available for vehicles that need it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for those remarks <e> <s> i am equally glad that we are able to give that comfort to those owners <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord lord underhill that full consultation with all the interested parties in the united kingdom the oil industry the motor industry and indeed the users will be undertaken <e> <s> i am quite sure he will accept that these consultations may take some little while to resolve as there are a number of problems <e> <s> so far as the eec is concerned noble lords may like to know that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment will be discussing this matter with colleagues at the council meeting in europe next month in june <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> it was in that the government recognised the problems associated with lead in petrol and made arrangements for the level to be reduced from grammes per litre to in <e> <s> this will be a per cent <e> <s> reduction in the lead content in petrol and will make the most significant difference to the whole problem of leaded petrol <e> <s> the move towards lead-free petrol i am quite sure it will be realised by all noble lords will therefore be of a very much smaller denomination <e>", "<cs> my lords the price of petrol is somewhat wide of the question on the order paper but certainly there has been a move during the last few years to adopt the litre system <e> <s> but if one looks very carefully one will see certainly at all the garages and filling stations with which i have been associated over a number of years and have knowledge of today that there is a chart on the side of the pump giving the equivalent rates <e>", "<cs> my lords first <e> <s> i have little doubt but that the present government will remain in power <e> <s> so far as the cost is concerned noble lords will recall that lead-free petrol was shown to be somewhat more costly <e> <s> if people wish to have all the environmental benefits of lead-free petrol they must recognise that they have to be paid for <e> <s> in chapter of its report the royal commission on environmental pollution sets out all the costs associated with this move <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i have any note about the surplus of refining capacity but certainly the cost of petrol at our pumps results from a wide variety of factors <e>", "<cs> my lords research has been going on for a number of years and there are a number of alternatives to lead <e> <s> one is methanol and another is mtbe <e> <s> these are both produced in small quantities largely on the continent <e> <s> they are very expensive but they could certainly provide an alternative additive to increase the octane rating <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord cares to put down a specific question on the order paper i shall be delighted to give him what answer i can <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite happy to give the noble lord lord bruce of donington an assurance that i shall look at that point <e> <s> he uses the word significant and i would point out <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons amendments be now considered <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lady trumpington the noble lord lord bishopston and the noble lord lord avebury for their welcome to these amendments <e> <s> i very much regret that i am not

administrative detail <e> <s> perhaps i could set out separately in a day or two the exact implications of those periods which the noble lord mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> the government have on this occasion taken the unusual step of proposing to parliament that the bill should come into force only one week after royal assent <e> <s> this is in order to minimise the danger that site owners might attempt to deny their residents the protection of the bill by taking action before the bill comes into force <e> <s> in parenthesis i think that perhaps this is in part the answer to the question asked by the noble lord lord avebury because those who never had an agreement at all under the act or indeed those who might well have had an agreement under the act would find that had they exercised their options originally the minimium period was five years and there was an option of a further three years it would be this year in a matter of weeks only that those options would run out <e> <s> i think this is in part the answer that the noble lord lord avebury was seeking <e>", "<cs>

thought that appears to be in the mind of the noble lord <e> <s> lord mcintosh that anything serpell may have said in that report has been singled out in terms of recommendations <e> <s> after all we do not see serpell as listing a number of recommendations it discussed a number of options <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble and learned lord will recall that i said we in the department <e>",

this measurement is required for such purposes as harbour dues port dues pilotage fees the day-to-day needs relative to a ship including where it goes and obviously from where it has come <e>", "<cs> my lords the government recognise the importance of the railways in the national system including the contribution they can make to national defence and will therefore give the board their full support for investment that is directly related to the objectives announced by the secretary of state for transport on th october <e> <s> it is the boards responsibility to draw up the investment programme <e>", "<cs> my lords before answering the noble baronesss supplementary questions i am sure that my noble friend lord gowrie <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that my noble friend is referring

railways perform <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always grateful for the long series of supplementary questions the noble lord lord underhill asks me because i can usually shelter by saying that this is perhaps not the opportunity to have a full-scale debate <e> <s> the best way i can describe the governments attitude towards investment is to remind the house that on th october my right honourable friend announced agreement to the investment of million in the tonbridge-hastings line electrification scheme <e> <s> that hardly demonstrates a reluctance on the part of the government to invest in worthwhile projects <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all noble lords would agree with my noble friend that this certainly is an element in encouraging greater use of the railways <e> <s> i am quite sure that british railways board in whom the government have much confidence will take careful note of what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to say that we expect the motorway to be finished in provided that the few statutory procedures still outstanding are sucessfully completed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to tell the noble lord that i am absolutely confident of the dates that i have given him <e> <s> i think he is referring to an exchange of correspondence that we had earlier in july when i explained the then delay on that section wisley-chertsey <e> <s> i am happy to tell him that due to the exceptionally fine weather and also to the exceptional efforts of the contractor in moving in more men and machinery this section will be completed before the end of this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend is referring to the section known as the mmaple cross section <e> <s> if he is i can tell him that it is under construction and that it is estimated that the opening date will be mid- <e>", "<cs> my lords the am section currently under construction is expected to open in january <e> <s> this i think is the section to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> he was kind enough to suggest that he himself was in some little difficulty coming from buckhurst hill <e> <s> i had a map prepared and i think it might be sensible if i offered him a copy of it to help him and his friends in that area <e> <s> the honey lane junction will not be opened separately from any other section within this three-part link <e> <s> the mm traffic will therefore need to get on or off the m either at honey lane or at the brentwood interchange <e> <s> there would be no on-off provision of slip roads at the theydon garnon interchange between the m and the m <e> <s> i think that the noble lords concern and that of people in that area is somewhat misplaced <e> <s> i may add that if after the am stretch opens there are difficulties we are pledged to consider expanding the junction at loughton <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether my noble friend is right in thinking as he does of this major construction work <e> <s> certainly this is a million investment in roads covering miles which has not suffered from cuts or delays <e> <s> so far as the second part of my noble friends supplementary question is concerned i am sure that he and noble lords elsewhere in the house will recognise that road expenditure has to take its place in a very long never-ending enormously-growing queue for funds <e>", "<cs> my lords the interchange to which the noble lord refers will not be complete until the spring of <e> <s> the work is complicated by the need to ensure that the vehicles a day continue to pass through <e> <s> special efforts and

could not promise that there would not be some inconvenience at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i could do so but not this afternoon since i came prepared to deal with the m itself <e> <s> if the noble lord would like to put down a question i shall be delighted to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to repeal certain provisions of the fosdyke bridge transfer act beg to move that

<e> <s> in developing the road programme we will continue giving high priority to roads bringing environmental relief and to by-passes in particular <e> <s> without taking into account our cross-country schemes which relieve communities they pass or local authority road schemes for which my department is not responsible the trunk road programme in england has under construction by-passes worth million and nearly more by-passes worth million in preparation <e> <s> the details are set out in the roads white paper published in september cmnd <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe the governments own comprehensive proposals for relieving communities on or near their own trunk roads of the heavy lorry nuisance as it is sometimes described as set out in the recent white paper would probably be the best way of proceeding in this matter <e> <s> i am uncertain as yet therefore whether a pilot study of the sort suggested by the noble lord is the best way of proceeding <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure i follow the point made by the noble lord lord molloy <e> <s> it appears to me that he is confusing the governments responsibility for trunk and motorway roadways and those which are the responsibility of the local authorities who are of course supported by the government through the transport policies programme and the transport supplementary grants system <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the noble lord lord underhill is right in the narrow view he ascribes to the roads policy document to which i have referred and he will be the first to recognise that the criterion upon which the civic trusts report was based is different from that on which our own is based <e> <s> there can be no doubt that different bodies will apply different criteria <e>

the responsibility of the local authority who as i say are supported and encouraged in building by-passes and other relief roads <e>", "<cs> my lords not without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords since i am in complete sympathy with my noble friends amendment or the substance of it and with what lord underhill has had to say i do not think that it would be helpful if i was to reiterate what has already been stated <e> <s> it is i believe sufficient to advise your lordships that we have sympathy with the amendment <e> <s> the aims are synonymous with those of the government in drafting the bill <e> <s> however i believe that arbitrators might find it very difficult to interpret the words that are set down in the amendment <e> <s> as a result further discussions between officials in my department and the general council of british shipping have taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear again this afternoon in this debate that there is one thing that unites all sides of the house and that is our real concern for the problems which are created by unemployment <e> <s> the government are concerned with these problems also but particularly with the problem of unemployment itself <e> <s> we now seriously consider that there are grounds for believing that the underlying unemployment trend has been reversed <e> <s> if i say that i hope that no member of your lordships house will accuse me of complacency about the difficulties facing those who are unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> he is quite right <e> <s> it was an amendment to defer the bill that was carried which set the bill back <e> <s> that was carried by votes <e>", "<cs> my lords the other source to which i am referring is the fare box <e> <s> i am talking about transport costs <e> <s> already million is spent in ratepayer-taxpayer money to support subsidy in local authority transport <e> <s> the amount which the noble lord suggests might be trivial we estimate with not too great an area of accuracy within greater london and the metropolitan counties to be at least one-third of million in lost fare revenue if this scheme were brought into use <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly not a hunch <e> <s> it is an estimate based on certain figures that are available to us <e> <s> but if the noble lords implied question is have we carried out a survey <e> <s> the answer is no <e>", "<cs> my lords i was just about to leave that subject but i will give my noble friend the assurance that i will look very carefully at what he asked earlier and i will see that he gets a proper response <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend would give way <e> <s> i think he is <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of your lordships i shall now repeat a statement which has been made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to both noble lords for their reception of this statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord tordoff suggested that what is now proposed is not totally acceptable and of course we would accept that <e> <s> but as the noble lord lord underhill suggested there is no cause for alarmist or alarming rumours which have been spreading about <e> <s> of course there is a need for urgency in finishing the assessment of flint and neills original appraisal which led to the appointment of mott hay and anderson to check that appraisal they were of course independent engineers <e> <s> agreement has been broadly reached between the two sets of engineers and my right honourable friend very shortly will have before him all the facts to enable him to make decisions as to what should happen in the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount lord tonypandy for his comments which also enable me to take up a point made by the noble lord lord tordoff to which i did not respond earlier <e> <s> we recognise that the use of the bridge has expanded quite considerably in recent years <e> <s> however it is interesting that the increased traffic volume across the bridge is in line with increased traffic flows in other parts of the country <e> <s> of course we recognise that it is a vital link into and out of wales and my right honourable friend will be most anxious to ensure that the commercial life of the principality is not endangered <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord underhill for his response <e> <s> he asked a great number of questions and perhaps i may answer them in an order different from that in which he put them to me <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord over-estimates this potential problem <e> <s> i am not sure of the exact figure but i recall from my other being of more than a year ago when i was involved in the haulage industry that very few licence holders or people who applied for a licence ever applied in person <e> <s> it was nearly always done on the telephone or by letter <e> <s> on the very few occasions when it will be necessary for an applicant or a licence holder to go to the office i imagine that good sense prevailing the traffic commissioner will take himself to the nearest office within the area to suit the customer <e> <s> that is what it is about suiting the customer <e> <s> after all the customer is paying the fees <e>", "<cs> my lords may i too congratulate the noble lord lord kings norton and his colleagues on their succinct presentation and the quite clear conclusions of their inquiry on the international road haulage quotas in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for reminding me of that <e> <s> if the rha felt that certainly evidence in the department does not suggest that they are entirely correct <e> <s> if i may make one mention of the speech of my noble friend lord mottistone when he referred to invisible barriers to trade he was of course quite right <e> <s> that is contrary to the spirit and the intent of the treaty <e> <s> this is one of the points which my right honourable friend will have very much in his mind when he goes into these discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to my noble friend for the information that he has given me <e> <s> it is somewhat contrary to my understanding of the matter and i can promise him that tomorrow morning i will certainly look further into it <e> <s> if i am wrong i will of course apologise to him but i do not believe that i am wrong <e> <s> going back to the days when i was in the haulage business i recall that if a despatcher does not know what time his lorry will get to a certain place he is a had despatcher <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that it has not been possible to trace the vessel which caused this unfortunate pollution off the isles of coll and tiree last month and which resulted in such a regrettable loss of bird life in the area <e> <s> samples of oil were taken from the shores of coll and tiree and from the plumage of oiled birds during the incident and these were compared with samples taken from two vessels known to have been in the area at the time but tests indicate that none of the samples taken from the vessels matched the oil spilled in the incident <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> government scientists are quite satisfied that the techniques now employed could achieve that result <e>", "<cs> my lords the marine pollution control unit comprises a small number of people but it also has eight aircraft which are maintained and operated around the clock <e> <s> they are stationed in various parts of the country <e> <s> in addition that unit has recently acquired airborne remote-sensing equipment for identifying oil at sea <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much regret to have to tell the noble lord lord shinwell that that is not so <e> <s> there is a voluntary code of identification mostly used in the dover straits particularly by vessels carrying dangerous or hazardous <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly assure my noble friend that i shall draw his remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend <e> <s> we have no evidence that ships flying flags of convenience are worse culprits than others <e> <s> we think that the incident to which my noble friend lord campbell of croy refers in his question is probably the result of illegal tank or bilge washing <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no evidence to suggest that the size of tankers has very much to do with the occurrence of spillages <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> it will undoubtedly be of interest to noble lords to know that the international convention for prevention of pollution from ships and the protocol of which sets out the regulations came into force on nd october <e> <s> the transfer of information between the northern european port operators and ourselves

understand my noble friends concern in this matter <e> <s> solid white lines are installed only when forward visibility falls below a certain value <e> <s> the value used in the criteria is the safe stopping distance related to the speed of traffic <e> <s> there has to be a measure of control through the double line system and the good sensibility of the driver <e> <s> i might perhaps draw my noble friends attention to paragraphs and of the <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends how the hatching is contained <e> <s> if the hatching is contained in a solid white line that is a prohibited area and it would be an offence to cross over those hatched lines <e> <s> if one was apprehended one might find a penalty of three points against the in the list of penalty points <e> <s> if however the hatching is contained by a dotted line an interrupted white line that is an advisory warning and the noble lord would take his life and perhaps someone elses into his hands were he to cross over that danger area <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend is right <e>", "<cs> my lords the setting down of white lines on trunk roads is the responsibility of the department <e> <s> it is however the local highway authority which is responsible for the white lines in its own area <e> <s> most white lines are in urban areas <e> <s> it is therefore a local matter involving local people and local decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords my department already spends a good deal of money on advising motorists through television and by other publicity <e> <s> but certainly the point that the noble lord makes will be borne in mind when we review our publicity programmes <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would like to write to me explaining where the difficulty that he perceives arises

production of the report that we are discussing tonight <e> <s> may i also add my thanks to him for his very clear explanation of the conclusions to which his committee came <e> <s> while i am on the thanking side of our debate may i thank him for his very kind remarks which were particularly directed towards officials in my department when he was discussing the evidence which they gave <e> <s> i wish first to respond to the report because so very many points have been made that i think it will be helpful if i do that and then given sufficient time i shall attempt to respond to the points made in the wider context of this afternoons debate <e>", "<cs> my lords successive administrations in recent years have envisaged such changes <e> <s> my right honourable friend is now giving most careful consideration to new policy initiatives and he hopes to be able to make a statement before long <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can give my noble friend lord gainford a total assurance <e> <s>

would be our policy today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the leader of the opposition for his question <e> <s> the short answer is that a statement will probably be made next year <e> <s> some very delicate negotiations with the pilots the pilots association and other interested parties are currently in hand and they are taking some little while to resolve <e> <s> i would

in august <e> <s> passenger carryings have been as follows million in million in and million in <e>", "<cs> my lords the metro is a very effective public transport system which is well used by tyneside people <e> <s> it is also a very expensive capital investment <e> <s> it will cost some million by the time it is finished <e> <s> as to how it compares with other forms of transport in the locality i have to tell my noble friend that it is not possible to divide the different modes of transport in terms of their cost since the authority aggregates the total costs <e>", "<cs> my lords to deal first with the last part of the noble lords question there is no question of the passenger transport executive being abolished <e> <s> the system represents a huge benefit to the people of tyneside but it has to be related as i intimated in my first supplementary answer to the total cost of million per cent <e> <s> of which has to be met by the taxpayer which is a not inconsiderable sum <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we accept that it is a splendid system but i have to repeat that it has to be related to the overall cost <e> <s> happily the tyne and wear local authority have been prudent in the level of subsidy which they have attached to transport they are among the better metropolitan counties <e> <s> any proposal to extend the system to the airport would have to be considered on its merits but the construction costs would be substantial and the financial receipts and social benefits would have to commensurate with its extension <e>", "<cs> my lords whether or not the cost of the extension would be very small it would depend upon the type of scheme and upon whose eyes one were looking through as to whether it was a short or a long distance <e> <s> nevertheless any suggestion to extend the line has to come from the local authority and not from her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness can certainly ask but i very much regret that the minister is unable to answer <e> <s> however i shall be delighted to send the information to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords the two systems are not comparable <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord the leader of the opposition i am not in a position to give such an undertaking but so long as the pte operate the system for the benefit of those who currently enjoy it at no greater cost than hitherto i can see no justification for making any change <e>", "<cs> my lords with permission i shall now repeat a statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank both the noble lord lord underhill and the noble baroness lady burton of coventry for the way they have received this statement <e> <s> i am also indebted to both of them for the tribute they have paid to lord king the directors and the staff of british airways and for the good wishes for the future which they have extended to these people <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with my noble friend lord harvey of prestbury that there is to be the transfer of a monopoly <e> <s> indeed british airways have no monopoly <e> <s> british airways are subject to market conditions in particular to those overseas <e> <s> as to making any change in the competitive situation my noble friend will know that this is not within the purview of government <e> <s> it is the civil aviation authority which controls routes and prices <e> <s> the prospective privatisation of british airways raises implications for competition and for the sound development of the british airline industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord lord beswick has reminded us that we should also pay some tribute and regard to the work done by the management and board of british airways before the present regime <e> <s> it would not be for me to ascribe responsibility for disappointing results in the late s and early s <e> <s> it is sufficient to say that the airline is in a far more healthy state now than it was then <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> if i may deal with his last point first he is quite right in reminding your lordships of the tremendous recovery british airways have made in recent years <e> <s> he is quite right in reminding us that that is due solely to the efforts of those in the field so to speak right up to the board and the chairman because that is where recovery really happens <e> <s> it is quite right to say that they have put in a tremendous amount of effort and many have indeed made great sacrifices <e> <s> i am very glad to endorse my noble friends comments in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may remind my noble friend lord glenkinglas of my comments about the caa <e> <s> it is because of the prospect of privatising british airways in that there will be changes in the domestic airline field <e> <s> it is for that reason that the caa are to undertake a review of the implications for competition and for the development of the british airline industry <e> <s> it is through the caa and not the government through the offices of my right honourable friend that any change is likely to come about <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the government do not give the caa instructions <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will allow me to finish then he will recall that it is the civil aviation act a consolidation act which picked up on a number of acts of previous years which gives the caa their authority <e> <s> my right honourable friend and therefore the government has an appellant role only in those matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not consider that i can add anything to the remarks of the noble lord lord beswick because he was merely putting the record straight <e>", "<cs> my lords i am again obliged to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i recall that occasion and i am grateful to my noble friend for endorsing and underlining my remarks from his own knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly draw my noble friends comments to the attention of my right honourable friend <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that both the articles of association and the memorandum will be placed in the library and he will then be able to see exactly what they say <e>", "<cs> my lords the principal rates of heating addition paid to people on supplementary benefit are p or p <e> <s> the circumstances in which these additions are paid are contained in schedule to the supplementary benefit requirements regulations <e> <s> broadly speaking heating additions are paid to supplementary benefit claimants who need extra warmth because of age or because they are in poor health to those who consume more energy because their homes are hard to heat and to those who have central heating in their homes <e> <s> this is all set out in the simply-written leaflet <e>", "<cs> my lords supplementary benefit heating addition rates are now at the highest real level that they have ever been <e> <s> since fuel prices have risen by a little

certainly look at that and be happy to confirm the matter to him <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i did not mention the matter because it is not true and neither did i think that it was relevant to the series of questions that my noble friend lady gardner of parkes addressed to me <e>", "<cs> my lords during the debate on th december my noble friend lord avon gave figures with regard to deaths from hypothermia <e> <s> it is regrettable that any death should be caused by hypothermia <e> <s> i am assured that the department takes note of causes of death particularly among elderly pensioners

<e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords the department of transport published its latest bulletin <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his comments on the reduction in the number of deaths and serious injuries and i am sure that that welcome is shared throughout the house <e> <s> on improvements to seat belts the united kingdom car manufacturers and seat belt manufacturers together with the transport and road research laboratory are currently carrying out further work to improve seat-belt anchorage points and seat-belt locking points <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of what the noble lord lord underhill has said with regard to publicity <e> <s> i do not think that there is any evidence of complacency in seat belt wearing since the rate has been maintained since st january <e> <s> as the house may perhaps be aware this wearing rate is monitored at over monitoring stations throughout great britain <e> <s> the government are aware of the report to which the noble lord referred and are giving it further consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords of course my noble friend is entitled to ask anything he likes relative to this question <e> <s> there are no reliable figures available at the moment <e> <s> the house will recall that the government are to present a report towards the end of the third year of the experiment <e> <s> i can tell my noble friend that the monitoring that is currently in force will take what account it can of the matter he has raised <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no evidence of over-confidence and i do not have at my fingertips the figures with regard to pedestrian accidents <e> <s> they will be found however in the bulletin to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i fully understand my noble friends question in so far as a hook is concerned <e> <s> if my noble friend is referring to the pillar anchor point which i think she is she will recall that the anchor points are specified in an eec directive to which of course we subscribe and a hook would not conform to the specification which includes the present anchor points <e> <s> however as i intimated in an earlier supplementary the whole seat-belt locking and anchor system is currently being further developed by both belt manufacturers and car manufacturers <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think i can agree with the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> i think we have to deal with the matter as it is today <e> <s> it is a satisfactory position <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is of course quite right and more protection of drivers is being sought by them <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of standardising the fixing point or the locking mechanism has been examined on a number of occasions <e> <s> if we lived in an ideal world of course it might be possible to devise an ideal locking system <e> <s> currently we feel that the freedom that is permitted in the british standards which is in conformity with the eec regulation allows for further more general and more widespread experimentation which might ultimately lead to that ideal situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the article to which the noble lord <e> <s> lord monson refers <e> <s> however we do not have reliable statistics to support per cent <e> <s> the contention he makes <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> a worse reason is that if it were a hook it is likely it would be far less effective than the self-locking bolt system which is currently employed <e>", "<cs> my lords research has continued into this complex problem and the british standards institution is expected to agree a standard next month <e> <s> we shall then consult with manufacturers on the quickest practicable timetable for making lorries conform with the standard <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that my noble friend is pleased with the situation <e> <s> concerning the time-scale he will probably remember that it was the armitage report of that drew particular attention to the need for further work to be done on spray suppression so perhaps the time-scale is not too extended <e> <s> i am not sure how long the consultations with the vehicle manufacturers will take but one might envisage something in the way of months rather than the years that have preceded this situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall deal with the first question of the noble lord <e> <s> lord underhill about accidents <e> <s> while we recognise that excess spray is a problem he will also recognise that the number of fatal and serious injury accidents in which lorries have been involved has dropped steadily particularly in the past years from incidents in to in <e> <s> while one must not be complacent about this it shows that the accident rate in which lorries are concerned is improving <e> <s> we do not regard spray from coaches as a major problem and at this stage we do not propose to take any action <e> <s> coach wheels are recessed into the bodywork and that substantially cuts down the amount of spray <e>", "<cs> my lords currently visiting vehicles would be exempt <e> <s> they are exempt through both the geneva and the vienna conventions <e> <s> since there is no european directive on this matter as i have explained we are in the lead we would advise operators as we have already advised the commission of our intention in this matter <e> <s> it is hoped therefore that harmonisation will be brought about based on our standard <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole question of spray is not limited just to an amount of water or slush or sludge <e> <s> it is a matter of some engineering complexity in that spray as we see it is really droplets of water containing energy <e> <s> the spray suppression equipment which is now being devised is one which is designed to absorb the energy from the droplets so that the water falls of its own volition and is not thrown out by its own energy concentration <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to tell the right reverend prelate that i have no knowledge of the matter of which he has spoken but i will certainly investigate it <e> <s> however i cannot promise to make a visit to see for myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord lord somers is drawing a very unfair conclusion <e> <s> on the one hand we are talking about vehicles currently in use whereas so far as helmets are concerned we are talking about people who can go quite simply to buy a helmet <e> <s> it is not as simple to fit worth of equipment on to a lorry which is in heavy use under operating conditions <e> <s> as i suggested in an earlier answer this is something we are looking at but i advised your lordships that there were some practical difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> the problem with motor cars is a good deal less than the problem with lorries <e>", "<cs> my lords there is always continuing experimentation and research being undertaken by motor vehicle manufacturers with regard to exhaust pipes and exhaust systems <e>", "<cs> my lords i have explained that we in the department are looking at the problems associated with retrospective legislation <e> <s> there are practical difficulties <e> <s> to draw a further analogy the noble lord will probably remember that when traffic indicator lights were fitted they were fitted on vehicles after a certain date and that prior to a particular date certain vehicles were exempt <e> <s> it does take some time of course for improvements of this kind to work through the system <e> <s> there are real practical difficulties in the way of doing what the noble lord suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords crosstrade freight revenue is provisionally estimated to have accounted for per cent <e> <s> of total revenue from international activities of the united kingdom shipping industry in or per cent <e> <s> of international freight revenues <e> <s> charter receipts and passenger revenues make up the remainder of the total <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure of million of united kingdom shipping earnings on crosstrades compares with the total of million of total revenue from international activities <e> <s> i confirm that the proportions are satisfactory but it is not without a considerable amount of endeavour by the shippers the shipping lines and indeed the government that this figure is being maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are doing a great deal in a number of international fora to fight for the rights of british lines to continue their traditional crosstrading activities <e> <s> it is the governments policy in the interests of the british shipping industry itself british exporters and consumers alike that an open competitive rgime in world shipping should be maintained <e> <s> it is for this reason that we are party to the current discussions of the united nations conference on trade and development and in particular to the ec agreement to work through the consultative shipping group to ensure that there is freedom of competition for our ships and those of our community partners <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as russian crosstrading is concerned i can tell the noble lord lord greenway that about per cent <e> <s> of the trade of soviet vessels is derived from trade between non-soviet ports <e> <s> in recent years russian vessels have carried between and per cent <e> <s> of the value of all british seaborne trade <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much regret that i cannot tell the noble lord whether the figures are gross or net but i will make inquiries and ensure that he is informed <e> <s> it is not true that per cent <e> <s> of united kingdom shipping is foreign owned <e> <s> it is a smaller amount than that <e>", "<cs> my lords last july the department of transport issued a discussion paper which considered the scope for encouraging year-old moped riders to take training and pass the moped test <e> <s> my honourable friend the minister of state for transport has been studying the responses to this paper and will be making positive proposals shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords recognising my noble friends interest in this matter as chairman of the british motor cycle safety foundation i can also recognise his supplementary questions <e> <s> shortly has been described in your lordships house in various ways <e> <s> my noble friend will appreciate that when one is considering compulsion for year-olds one has to make very sure that one does not also greatly affect year-old motor cycle riders <e> <s> my noble friend will recognise that the level of casualties is unacceptably high <e> <s> therefore the matter is of some complexity and my honourable friend the minister would want to get it as near right as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understand the noble lord lord underhill correctly he is talking about ages <e> <s> he will probably recall that moped riders are invariably between the ages of and learner motor cycle riders start at years and having passed part and part of the test would then progress to a larger machine <e> <s> therefore the two sets of figures that i have given embrace both groups <e>", "<cs> my lords according to our information there is a surfeit of off the road training facilities throughout the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise what my noble friend is saying i do not think that i can completely agree with him <e> <s> although it is an attractive proposition to induce year-olds to take tests with the probability of an exemption for moving on to other machines certainly those who were consulted in july and august of last year were not unanimous in their views on this aspect <e> <s> it is for that reason that my honourable friend has found some little difficulty in arriving at the right kind of solution <e>", "<cs> my lords the principles behind the settlement were as in previous years to allocate the available resources and grant between county councils in accordance with the secretary of states judgments of their transport policies and needs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord lord underhill finds my original answer inadequate <e> <s> i did in fact answer precisely the question on the order paper <e> <s> the noble lord asked me whether the transport supplementary grant has been reduced by per cent <e> <s> i have to tell him that from last year the grant has been reduced from million to million and that is a reduction in cash terms of per cent <e> <s> that there was a reduction from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> in the marginal grant rate above the threshold is quite correct <e> <s> it was done in order to make good certain imbalances that had occurred in previous years <e> <s> i might add that there is nothing sacrosanct about the per cent <e> <s> marginal grant rate in that the circular which led to the introduction of tsg in the local government act envisaged that the rate of grant would eventually be reduced to per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am just not old enough to remember whether it is any government <e> <s> i suspect that most governments have used the weapons to hand <e> <s> however i can tell my noble friend that the transport supplementary grant reduction is very much in line with her majestys governments general policy of reducing the central government contribution to local spending <e> <s> to turn to a piece of detail which my noble friend raised may i remind the house that an increase of per cent <e> <s> is being made in the accepted expenditure for the maintenance of roads while there has been a small fallback in that for rail and bus which is largely within the control of the local authority itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise what the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos says that this reduction is quite a considerable amount <e> <s> i personally would not accept one of the three solutions which he offers <e> <s> i believe that there are plenty of grounds for greater efficiency in the cutting of costs which would affect the balance <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not worked out the percentage to which the noble lord lord underhill referred <e> <s> i accept that his arithmetic is correct <e> <s> i confirm again that there is a reduction in the grant <e> <s> nevertheless there is no reason for us to suppose that that amount of money which local authorities wish to spend above and beyond the grant <e> <s> which is only a supplementary grant to support desirable schemes cannot be found from much greater efficiency and the cutting of costs within their transport organisations <e> <s> we discussed this matter over a year ago <e> <s> i brought before your lordships a number of instances and i stand firm on what i said then a year ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not refer to cuts i referred to a reduction in the level of transport supplementary grant <e> <s> noble lords opposite may find that somewhat humorous <e> <s> i am not particularly anxious to have the noble lord lord molloy put words into my mouth <e> <s> i cannot give him the assurance from this box because it is not within my province it is within the province of the local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will want any proposals for private participation in rapid transport systems in the docklands to be carefully evaluated on their merits <e> <s> i regret i cannot be more definite than that in the absence of specific proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right in both his assumptions <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> this is a joint development between the lddc and the glc through their agents london transport <e> <s> at the moment there is no question of its being left or removed <e> <s> that is the position <e> <s> but the scheme will not come into use before and there is much preparatory work yet to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords this might be a convenient time to interrupt the report stage of the agricultural holdings bill and with the permission of your lordships to repeat a statement which has been made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport <e> <s> the statement is as follows i should like to make a further statement about the severn crossing as i promised the house on th november last <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords lord underhill and lord hooson for their general remarks in response to the statement i have repeated <e> <s> perhaps i could answer the questions in the order in which they were put to me <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill said that the length of time for the repairs between five and six years indicated the great seriousness of the structural weakness of the bridge which had led to near panic <e> <s> i have to tell your lordships that the timescale of five or six years is not resultant upon any structural weakness nor grave serious deficiency <e> <s> i was unhappy to hear the noble lord use such an emotive word as panic <e> <s> the five-year or six-year timescale is to ensure that there is the minimum disruption of traffic <e> <s> quite obviously if the lanes were even more severely curtailed than they are at the moment work could proceed a little faster <e> <s> i have already explained that the major works will be carried out particularly at offpeak times <e> <s> there is no suggestion that the bridge is unsafe for use at this present time none whatever <e> <s> that under certain circumstances particularly wind and excessive loading at peak hours my right honourable friend has thought that to be doubly sure traffic restrictions should be made is i think quite reasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord massereene and ferrard is quite entitled to ask any question and if i do not have the answer i can promise that i will provide it for him <e> <s> he asks why has the bridge deteriorated <e> <s> there is no evidence of failure at the design stage nor of the actual building <e> <s> there has been a very marked change in the traffic using the bridge and the densities at which the bridge is used <e> <s> this has caused concern that given certain circumstances the margin of safety would be diminished to a degree which would be unacceptable <e> <s> certainly on any bridge or engineering structure repairs or renewals must be taken care of over a period of years <e> <s> i think that there may have been a good deal of misinformed publicity in the early stages which have not been borne out by the studies undertaken by engineers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos and i am glad that he accepts that the government realise the importance of the crossing to the principality <e> <s> the noble lord asked specifically about the further technical studies referred to in the statement <e> <s> a number of points in connection with the strengthening repairs and renewals require further detailed examination <e> <s> basically these include the choice of the hanger system any change in the deck strengthening and the use of particular surface materials <e> <s> it will be necessary for these further studies to be undertaken but in no way will they affect the basic feasibility of the programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can only agree with the noble lord lord raglan <e> <s> the government recognise the strategic and economic importance of the crossing to wales to other parts of the united kingdom and to bristol and the south-west as the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> my lords yes is the short answer but i think that the noble lord would like something a little more expanded than that <e> <s> diversion signs were put up last year at junctions and on the m <e> <s> they are manually operated and advise of delays on the severn crossing <e> <s> they are to be replaced with signs which are remotely controlled which is perhaps synonymous with electronically from the police point at the almondsbury m m interchange <e> <s> it is expected that the sign at junction will be operational in a few weeks time at easter <e> <s> the sign at junction however will not be ready until the end of next summer <e> <s> the criterion for activating the signs are likely to be delays of one-and-a-half to two hours at the crossing <e> <s> the new signs also will be capable of warning of restrictions on account of high winds <e> <s> the whole monitoring and sign procedure is continually under review and i can assure the house that my right honourable friend the secretary of state will ensure that adequate warnings are given should those currently planned not prove to be as effective as all of us should like <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly take note of what what the noble lord said and will draw the attention of my right honourable friend to that <e> <s> but i wonder whether if motorists perhaps slowed down a little knowing that they were coming to the junction they would have time to stop before they actually got there <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord underhill my noble friend lady macleod the noble lady lady kinloss and my noble friend lord colwyn for their universal acceptance of these regulations <e> <s> i will not take too much of your lordships time but i feel that i ought to respond to those points that have been made although i think perhaps the noble lady lady kinloss

<e>", "<cs> no my lords not with me <e> <s> the noble lord asked a number of questions <e> <s> the british standard does cover pedals cranks and most of the major components of a bicycle <e> <s> the

having taken minutes i expect my noble friend the minister to rise to reply at pm and the debate to end at five minutes past six oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords a three decibel reduction in the permitted noise from new lorries that is from decibels to was implemented last year and a further reduction of around two decibels will result from the implementation in of a more onerous noise test procedure <e> <s> the european commission have made proposals to reduce lorry noise by an additional four decibels from and these proposals are being discussed in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell my noble friend lord belhaven and stenton that vehicles are checked at the roadside and also in hgv testing stations <e> <s> vehicles with faulty exhaust systems are prevented from being used until the fault is corrected <e> <s> the police have brought about successful prosecutions a year involving vehicles of all types emitting excessive noise <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not have a practicable method of doing this in the confines of a heavy goods vehicle station <e> <s> the noise-testing procedure is quite complex requiring a great deal of space and a lot of very sophisticated machinery <e>

delighted to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords the qhv scheme is the quiet heavy vehicle scheme <e> <s> so far as removing vehicles from our city centres is concerned the noble and learned lord will appreciate that it is these lorries which probably take his meat and vegetables to the market place where he may buy them and it is essential that they go there <e> <s> removing the noise from the

regret that i am not able to agree with my noble friend <e> <s> although these reductions of two or four in numbers of decibels to which i have referred sound rather small the explanation is technical

so loud that it will cause pain and damage to the ear <e> <s> tests have shown that a -decibel reduction in the conditions which i have described corresponds broadly to what people perceive as halving the noise <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot do so without detaining your lordships for the best part of the afternoon <e> <s> i said that it is a combination <e> <s> if i isolated one from another it would put a different accent upon the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say heavy <e> <s> i said complex and complicated machinery <e> <s> there is we believe an adequate roadside check and an

their expressions of concern to sir michael giddings and his family and indeed for their condemnation of the matters giving rise to this statement which as both say is extremely serious and extremely disturbing <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill asked whether reports on previous inquiries should be produced to augment the inspectors report <e> <s> i can say that all matters that have happened previous to the abandonment of this inquiry will be carefully considered by my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> my right honourable friend will decide whether these should be made public <e> <s> but the statement says that a further inquiry will be set up and it may be injudicious to prejudge by the advancement of some further information at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords

the noble lord lord wigoder we believe that it is the same group that is causing this disruption <e> <s> i think therefore that the matter has to be kept a little in perspective <e>", "<cs>

the noble lord how many abandonments there have been in the past years <e> <s> i can tell him that there have been three in very recent times sufficient to cause concern in government because the

assure him most sincerely that i will ensure the point that he has expressed will be brought positively before my right honourable friends <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i accept very sincerely from the

be brought before my right honourable friends <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i did not hear the last part of the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as any claims for costs are concerned they will have to be made to a certain set of criteria and objectors will be told that <e> <s> i do not think that i can promise that there could necessarily be differentiation in the case

find success in his withdrawal from that office can hardly be expected to celebrate <e> <s> i have said on more than one occasion during the course of this exchange that the government treat this matter seriously <e> <s> i hope that the words i have used this afternoon express to noble lords in all parts of the house the concern of the government and indeed the further concern in my receipt of

more pertinent question is concerned i have said that i will and i repeat i will before this day is out convey to my right honourable friends the expressions of concern which have been made in the

transport users groups <e> <s> i have to refute nearly all the first set of points which the noble lord embraced in that we do not see the submission as particularly underlining a need for a reversal

we certainly encourage instructors to seek formal training but there are many who do not respond to intensive training and it may be far better if they take their training instruction from a registered instructor over a longer period <e> <s> i suspect that that would mean that the national joint council of approved driving instructor organisations would have to have some say in the approval of the instructor training establishments <e>", "<cs> my lords that is quite right <e> <s> that is why at least one-fifth of the time that the trainee instructor spends in giving instruction has to be supervised <e> <s> but it does not mean to say that it is only one-fifth <e> <s> very much depends on the ability of the supervising instructor to determine how much time <e> <s> one-fifth

one-fifth of the time <e>", "<cs> my lords the study which the department of transport is to carry out into how a second road crossing might be provided in the general corridor of the existing bridge

form of merchant shipping act <e> <s> it makes associated provision for amended citation together with other merchant shipping acts <e> <s> i hope therefore that the amendment as proposed by the commons meets with your lordships agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords the purposes were to deter illegal parking to improve traffic flow and to increase the availability of short-term parking at meters <e>

lords as i said in my original answer the success or otherwise of the scheme cannot be totally evaluated until we have the results of the monitoring being carried out by the transport and road

<s> with half of westminster surveyed so far additional spaces have been identified <e> <s> work is also proceeding on new off-street car parks in westminster including one at cambridge circus which will be opening later this year with spaces <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we would all agree with the remarks of the noble lord lord jenkins of putney <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the immobilising of the vehicle tends to deter that motorist and indeed others and that enables a higher turn-round of authorised parking places which in its turn relieves the congestion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that my noble friend will recall that the clamping experiment applies to only one area of london <e> <s> it is an experimental area <e> <s> therefore no comparisons can be made with other areas of london <e> <s> the regulations form part of the transport act sections to which enable the experimental period to last up to two years <e> <s> this experiment began on th may <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards bringing the evaluation forward i could certainly draw my noble friends remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend in the anticipation that the transport and road research laboratory might hasten its evaluation <e> <s> however i cannot agree with my noble friends later remarks with regard to persecution <e>", "<cs> my lords no i was not aware of what happened in portland square this morning <e> <s> therefore i am unable to give any explanation as to what might have been done to alleviate the situation at that particular time in that particular place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill who reminds us of exactly what happened in your lordships house and indeed in another place <e> <s> comments of the kind that have been made this afternoon will of course be taken into account when the evaluation is made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for her remarks about the judgment made by certain people in a certain area <e> <s> she is right when she suggests that the authorities have power to move a car to another place to relieve obstruction <e> <s> in the case of a high degree of obstruction there is of course the additional possibility of removing the car <e> <s> to erect signs would represent a significant departure from normal policy <e> <s> it is not the policy to fix signs describing the penalties which would arise in the event of a breach of the law or regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards diplomats cars there are differences in their treatment and my noble friend lord elton described the differences last year in response to two questions on th and th december <e> <s> on the point about evenhandedness it is for the constable on the spot at the time to evaluate the situation and to make his decision <e> <s> therefore there cannot be the evenness of judgment which is implied in my noble friends question <e>", "<cs> my lords there are differences in some countries but in the majority of countries the clamping of diplomats cars is not carried out <e> <s> following the announcement to your lordships by my noble friend lord elton of two new measures being taken with regard to diplomats from foreign countries and foreign missions in this country significant steps have been taken <e> <s> at the time he made his statement there were diplomatic cars which were registered with x-plates and d-plates which claimed total immunity <e> <s> a thousand of these cars have been removed from that classification by being plated with only the x-plate that is with limited immunity by motor cars being removed from the list of official fleets and by motor cars being removed from the lists of household motor cars <e> <s> therefore there are now only motor cars with d-plates with complete immunity and cars previously having immunity are now liable to the full force of the law <e>", "<cs> my lords data on the blood alcohol level of road accident fatalities are obtained from procurators fiscal and most coroners <e> <s> estimates indicate that about motor cycle riders and other motor vehicle drivers killed in were over the legal limit <e> <s> three hundred and ten other accidents in which a rider or a driver not fatally injured failed an initial breath test or failed to provide a required sample caused around other fatalities <e>", "<cs> my lords the current penalties for attempting to drive when unfit to drive through drink or drugs have a maximum of six months imprisonment and/or a fine and an obligatory disqualification for a minimum of one year or three years if a second offence is committed within years of a previous offence and it is generally thought that that is an adequate level <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend and i shall draw the attention of my right honourable friend to her comments <e>", "<cs> my lords while i recognise the noble lords concern in these matters i think he would probably agree that his question is perhaps a little wide of the original one on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords there has not been a sustained research programme on pedestrians but that which has been undertaken over recent years suggests that pedestrians with an element of alcohol in their blood over the excess limit as prescribed by law contribute not insignificantly to some fatal road accidents <e>", "<cs> my lords in the event of an alleged offender coming before the court it would be for the court to decide whether such a claim has any germane effect upon the offence for which he has been apprehended <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord elton answered this question some months ago <e> <s> where a diplomat claiming immunity is alleged to be guilty of this offence or where in fact he takes a test which is found to be over the limit the mission is advised and it is left for the mission to take what steps it feels desirable <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that in the past months nine members of overseas missions have in fact left the missions as a result of representations made by the foreign and commonwealth office to the heads of those missions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure the noble viscount is correct in that nevertheless perhaps it would be helpful if i reminded your lordships that in of convictions for excess levels of alcohol in blood over had an excess over milligrammes per millilitre which is something like one and a half times the minimum limit <e> <s> this is a very serious position <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first thank the noble lord lord hatch of lusby and indeed the noble lord lord ennals for their kind wishes to my noble friend lord skelmersdale whose apologies i do send to you <e>", "<cs> my lords after hearing the explanation of the noble lord <e> <s> lord walston and the acceptance in principle of the noble lord lord underhill i am quite sure that the house will agree that this is a useful measure of the type that all too often has to wait far too long before passing into statute <e> <s> the governments attitude to the main provision of the bill which is to empower harbour masters to exclude or remove very dangerous vessels from their harbours is straightforward <e> <s> if harbour authorities who are responsible for harbour safety consider that they need such a power we accept their judgment and for that reason we are prepared to look favourably upon the bill <e> <s> we shall however be putting down some amendments mainly of a drafting nature but i should make it clear that we have been fully consulted during the preparation of the bill and the main substance of the bill takes account of our comments <e>", "<cs> first i am obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> lord tordoff and my noble friend lord mottistone for the triangular discussions which have taken place since we had our second reading on this bill <e> <s> i share the concern of all noble lords the noble baroness lady wootton of abinger and my noble friend lady macleod who expressed their concern about ensuring that new drivers are properly taught <e> <s> i have had the opportunity to reflect on what was said at second reading <e> <s> i am happy to concede in principle that point which the noble lord <e> <s> lord tordoff is seeking to achieve in his amendment which is that there should be more than perhaps just supervision of licensed trainee instructors <e>", "<cs> my lords as my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord underhill with regard to his comments about the improved profitability which does credit to those concerned with the undertaking <e> <s> so far as his question with regard to the secretary of states direction is concerned the noble lord will recall that in the privatisation of some aspects of the british railways boards holdings was discussed and agreed with the board <e> <s> it is the board itself which has decided that now is the time to dispose of those assets <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much regret that i cannot do that my ability at mental arithmetic is not that good but i can certainly let the noble earl know that <e> <s> it may help him to know that in the british railways boards public relations press release of monday th march they said that at st december the net assets of sealink uk adjusted to reflect the valuation of sealink uks land buildings and fixed plant at th september amounted to million after adding to shareholders funds an amount due to the british railways board on inter-company account of million and million nominal of per cent <e> <s> unsecured loan stock of sealink uk held by the british railways board <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the leader of the opposition asks a number of questions <e> <s> i hope that i shall be able to deal with all of them in the order in which he asked them <e> <s> the motivation for the sale of sealink uk limited is that we believe that sealink will benefit from the stimulus of private sector status and access to private capital <e> <s> it will then be able to engage more effectively in the business in which it is engaged <e> <s> he suggested that there had been a lack of information <e> <s> i cannot agree with him in so far as there have been a number of reports and press releases from my department which have set out the intention to privatise an ugly word but one which we all understand sealink uk limited <e> <s> therefore there is no scandal and no question that information has not been made available <e>", "<cs> i repeat there is no scandal attached to the information which we have given with regard to the sale of sealink uk <e> <s> the noble lord asked me whether i would give an undertaking that the proposals for the sale should be made widely known <e> <s> i can give no greater undertaking than to answer his questions this afternoon <e> <s> i believe that that should be an undertaking on its own <e> <s> it will be sold <e>", "<cs> my lords within certain constraints that may be true but it is fair to say that since british railways have a particular interest in <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble viscounts three questions are hypothetical in so far as sealink is concerned <e> <s> i regret that i am not able to help him in answering them <e>", "<cs> my lords price will be an important factor in the sale of sealink but british rail also have in mind the continuing commercial links <e> <s> since the seven harbours which the company owns will need to be retained in order that the services which are undertaken by its ships are integral it seems hardly likely that bits will be chopped out otherwise the company would not be as viable as it now is <e>", "<cs> so far as the questions of my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls are concerned i think that the best i can do for your lordships is to say yes i agree with nearly all that he has suggested <e> <s> there is certainly room for improvement

i am grateful to my noble friend for that suggestion <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will not misunderstand me when i say that this is one of the matters that has been considered on more than one

understand what my noble friend has to say but in fact i said that it was a modest increase in the number of heavy goods vehicles <e>", "<cs> my lords i recall the exchanges with regard to the report of the civic trust <e> <s> if i remember correctly we said on that occasion and we say it again that we were obliged to the civic trust for the report <e> <s> we thought that it had underestimated the number of bypasses which had already been contructed and the effects that they were having but we nevertheless accepted some part of the criticism <e> <s> we invited the civic trust an invitation which it has since taken up to discuss with us the general matter to which the noble lord lord underhill refers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord <e> <s> lord paget will agree that that is a little way away from temple sowerby <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the pardon of the noble lord lord hunt but i did not hear the last part of his question <e> <s> perhaps he will repeat it <e>", "<cs> my lords i can say that consultation has taken place with all those in government departments of state who are interested <e> <s> but i think it might be more helpful if i responded a little differently to the noble lord and said that we regard this matter as of sufficient importance to have sent a team of officials who will be at temple sowerby to discuss matters with the local action group this very night <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept what the noble lord lord ferrier says about there being a link <e> <s> he will i think accept that that again is rather wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much accept what the noble lord lord henderson of brompton has said <e> <s> the more modest scheme to which he has referred which is currently costed at something just over million is one of the solutions which form part of the current studies <e> <s> it cannot be considered in isolation from others but it will certainly receive favourable consideration <e> <s> i have said and i repeat that these studies will be completed this summer <e> <s> my department will be taking an early decision on those studies which will include that which the noble lord has suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give my noble friend that assurance <e> <s> i hope he will accept that the answers i have given this afternoon have expressed a degree of urgency on the part of the government <e> <s> i repeat that that is one of the reasons why a team of officials from my department has gone to temple sowerby today <e> <s> we have no wish to distress the inhabitants of the village and would wish to find quick solutions to the problems which my noble friend has indicated <e>", "<cs> this might be a convenient moment to adjourn for dinner <e> <s> i beg to move that the committee stage be adjourned during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that london transport and the metropolitan police have recently launched a new campaign to step up the policing of londons buses and that this is showing some promising results <e> <s> my department is participating in the work of an inter-departmental committee convened by the health and safety executive to review what action might be taken by employers to guard against foreseeable violence <e> <s> as part of that committees work we are asking public transport operators trade unions and the police to help us get a better understanding of the nature of these assaults and the most effective counter-measures <e> <s> assaults on public transport staff are a matter of serious concern to the government and we are willing to examine any constructive proposals for reducing the number of incidents <e>", "<cs> my lords i should say at the outset that the government are concerned with and have knowledge of the anxieties of those people who suffer <e> <s> perhaps i should tell your lordships that in there was a fall in the number of assaults on london transport operatives and also a slight fall in the attacks on british rail staff <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to tell your lordships that the greatest number of assaults on bus crews occur in the late afternoons <e> <s> this is associated with school going-home time <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no personal knowledge of this matter but will certainly take account of it in reporting to officials in my department <e>", "<cs> my lords as i thought i indicated in an earlier answer to a supplementary question the victims are consulted by way of the transport and general workers union transport group membership of the sector working party which advises the health and safety executive inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i share with the noble lord lord underbill his early remarks with regard to the general content and the size of this bill and also if i observed any anxiety at all in his voice i share that anxiety over the number of amendments that are going to be placed before the committee over the next day or two <e> <s> i recall very well and ask the committee to recall the lengthy discussions that we had in but i have to repeat at the outset what my noble friend lord trefgarne had to say at second reading that we have to be quite clear in our minds that this bill is not dependent upon any other bill which may be laid before parliament <e> <s> that there may be references to other bills to be put before your lordships in due course is almost inevitable but this bill stands on its own merits <e>", "<cs> i <e>", "<cs> may i deal first with the remark of my noble friend lord hawke <e> <s> i hope he does not think and indeed i hope that noble lords opposite do not think that having got through only the first amendment i have been dictatorial <e> <s> i hope that will not appear to be the case as we go through the other -odd amendments in front of us <e> <s> may i say too that the bill is not meant to be a matter of dictation in any way at all <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord not agree that when we come to talk about the powers of the london regional passengers committee that might be the right time to discuss their powers and obligations <e> <s> what i have said is that that is the body which will be dealing directly with the complaints or the credits from the users as regards the service provided by lrt <e> <s> how lrt arrange their affairs with regard to matters with which we shall be dealing as we go through the bill such as contracts with outside agencies surely is a matter for the board <e> <s> i would not have thought that the board again i think it was my noble friend who mentioned this would have anything to do with whether or not the no <e> <s> bus runs on time <e> <s> surely that would be a matter for the passengers committee <e> <s> in any event the bill provides for consultation with local authorities for instance in their capacity as highway and traffic management authorities to which we shall come in clause <e>", "<cs> as a number of noble lords have raised certain points since i first replied it might be helpful to the committee if i commented on one or two of those points <e> <s> i totally underline what my noble friend lord plummer had to say and indeed most of what my noble friend lord peyton had to say <e> <s> my noble friend lord alport asked me a particular question relative to marks and spencer <e> <s> he asked to whom one should write should one write to the manager <e> <s> since there are london mps i have little doubt that whatever party those london members may belong to they will go to great lengths to ensure that their constituents are adequately served <e> <s> secondly i say to my noble friend that there is adequate opportunity to complain to the secretary of state again through the normal parliamentary procedures <e> <s> i have been at the receiving end of some of that in regard to some transport issues <e>", "<cs> both these amendments in the name of the noble lord lord underhill have produced the discussion which i would have expected a further discussion on another aspect of accountability in effect the ability of the press and the public to attend meetings of london regional transport and of the new consumer body the london regional passengers committee <e> <s> as the noble lord indicated my right honourable friend the secretary of state has said that the act will not apply to the proceedings of the passengers committee <e> <s> i shall return to that in a few moments <e>", "<cs> i note that the noble lord lord tordoff is also not wearing his national bus company tie <e>", "<cs> certainly the london country bus service is nbcs largest regional operating subsidiary <e> <s> in it had a million service <e> <s> it operates million bus miles <e> <s> it operates in the home counties around london serving harlow stevenage hatfield hemel hempstead crawley and places of that kind <e> <s> but there is no difference between whether london country bus is a subsidiary of national bus company or whether it is run by london regional transport itself <e> <s> again we envisage in the bill that london regional transport may very well break themselves into separate subsidiary operating companies of which london country bus might be one <e> <s> this is for nbc to determine <e> <s> they will no doubt determine that in the light of their contractual obligations with london regional transport <e> <s> london regional transport in its turn will be inviting tenders for one or more differing contracts of which national bus may be one participant <e> <s> they may do it centrally or through a subsidiary company <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord lord tordoff would not mind i am grateful to him for his suggestion <e> <s> i may have been remiss and perhaps not explained the matter as clearly as i might have done <e> <s> i wonder whether in that consideration he will take this into account <e>", "<cs> what i have been trying to say is that it is the responsibility of london regional transport to provide a service having due regard for the needs of the user <e> <s> on how they arrange it whether they arrange it with themselves as the running operator so to speak or whether they contract part of it with a different operator whether there is a transfer point on a longer route i cannot answer my noble friend <e> <s> this is exactly why london regional transports board has to have members who have the detailed kind of knowledge that enables them to come to the right solutions <e> <s> i very much regret to tell my noble friend that i do not have that detailed kind of knowledge <e>", "<cs> all these amendments concern the way in which the transport needs of londoners have to be taken into account by london regional transport as part of their general duty <e> <s> the bill uses the phrase have due regard to <e> <s> the noble lord lord tordoff responded to my noble friend lord plummer regarding the phrase for the time being and the inclusion of those words in the bill are almost identical <e> <s> my understanding is that for the time being in the bill means that london regional transport should be responsive to the needs of greater london at any particular time <e> <s> i interpret this to be exactly the same as the noble lords inclusion in his amendment <e> <s> the change we have made is quite deliberate and quite simple <e> <s> the wording in the act that of best meets the need really implies that london transport and its successor lrt has to meet every single transport need from wherever to wherever by whomsoever it is demanded <e> <s> i would find it hard to believe that london transport has been able to comply with that requirement <e> <s> indeed <e>", "<cs> of course i appreciate that but it does mean that every need has to be satisfied in one way or another as best meets <e> <s> that is how i interpreted what the noble lord suggested <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will let me finish because i was going on to say that the amount of money which the ratepayer and the taxpayer can afford and marshalling that together with the fare box contribution will determine the sort of service that we can have <e> <s> that does not mean that there shall not be regard to the needs of the travelling public and that is what the bill says <e>", "<cs> we are talking about the london regional transport bill that is before us not about any area that may come about by virtue of other legislation that is placed before us <e> <s> the bill states <e>", "<cs> i do not know where it says that <e> <s> but never mind what the government may do tomorrow what we are concerned with is what the government are doing today <e>", "<cs> i wish that somebody would tell me what integrated means <e> <s> i recall that in we had a debate in your lordships house about inland transport and that the noble lord lord tanlaw called for an integrated policy <e> <s> he was asked what he meant and he described what he meant by an integrated policy <e> <s> other speakers then described what they meant by an integrated policy <e> <s> the word integrated means many different things to many different people <e>", "<cs> there is no question here of disintegration <e> <s> in fact the word integrated has not been explained by anybody <e> <s> it means different things to different people <e> <s> the noble baroness lady gaitskell was quite right <e> <s> she said that she is confused by this and that explanation <e> <s> she is confused because none of us has a common understanding of the word integrated <e> <s> i cannot help noble lords and the fact that the government cannot help noble lords is one of the reasons why we have removed that word <e>", "<cs> the purpose of clause is to make it clear without ambiguity that the financial duty of lrt as set out in clauses and has primacy over their general duty <e> <s> the effect of the amendment would be to substitute for this a situation in which the relative priorities of the general and financial duties were much less clear <e>", "<cs> i have spoken on two separate occasions about the difficulties inherent in the concept of meeting needs <e> <s> this is essentially what the amendment seeks to alter <e> <s> may i therefore confine my remarks to the suggestion which the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove made so straight-forwardly that the purpose of the amendment is to impose an explicit duty upon the secretary of state to ensure that lrt meet their statutory duties <e> <s> however i cannot help thinking that such a provision would be rather confusing <e> <s> there can be no doubt that the bill gives my right honourable friend the secretary of state clear powers to give directions to lrt and to set financial and operational objectives for them <e> <s> in settling those financial objectives the financial limit the secretary of state has to take account of needs the plans and so on which are put before him by lrt <e>", "<cs> i can well understand the concern that all three noble lords have expressed on this subject <e> <s> it is obviously very important that london regional transport carry out their general duty and that the rights of individuals and organisations to bring challenges in the courts are not unreasonably limited <e> <s> but if i may say so i suggest that the criticisms which have been expressed in respect of the proposals in the bill have been somewhat overstated <e>", "<cs> the committee will probably be well aware that these matters were also debated in committee in another place when similar amendments were tabled <e> <s> although the amendments were not pressed to a vote my right honourable friend the secretary of state made it quite clear that the government do not believe that it would be appropri-ate in the statute to impose a duty on lrt to balance the interests of ratepayers and transport users <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend lady gardner of parkes for raising this point <e> <s> as was mentioned at second reading by the noble lord lord mountevans and by my noble friend lord teviot we had some inkling of what the noble baroness had in mind <e> <s> i do not wish to enter into a long debate tonight on identity cards <e> <s> it is the case that they have been frowned upon in this country <e> <s> however far we go on the question of fraud in this bill we shall not be proposing a requirement in any new clause for personal identity documents <e>", "<cs> i should like to give the noble lord the assurance that we have realised that there is a good deal of complexity within the problem <e> <s> bearing in mind that there are certain restrictions on the manner in which we conduct our business at report stage i would certainly not wish to impose on noble lords in any part of the committee a new and complicated clause only a matter of hours before it was to be debated <e> <s> i shall ensure that adequate notice is <e>", "<cs> these two amendments again bring us to the question of local authority representation and consultation <e> <s> although i do not wish to be forever disappointing your lordships i have to agree with the noble lord lord carmichael when he asks whether i think this is asking too much <e> <s> yes i am afraid that i do and i should like to say exactly why <e>", "<cs> i do not want to delay the proceedings of your lordships committee but it would be wrong of me if i were to offer to take this amendment back knowing that we would look at it and still not meet the fundamental point which the noble lord is asking for that is a local authority representation in some form or another <e>", "<cs> since both my noble friend and the noble lord lord tordoff have spoken to this amendment i think it might be helpful were i to put on record how we see it <e> <s> i will explain as briefly as i can what we are trying to do in clause and then go to subsection <e> <s> subsection gives lrt the power to enter into agreements with private operators under which those operators will provide the services <e> <s> thus lrt will in effect be buying in services <e> <s> the subsection can cover services of any kind cleaning catering garaging fuel supplies and the like <e> <s> it refers in particular to the provision of public passenger transport services and the most obvious relevance to the subsection will be for lrt to buy in bus services from private operators <e>", "<cs> when london transport was transferred to the care of the glc in the government of the day did not demand compensation for all the money it had invested in the system over the previous years <e> <s> my noble friend lady gardner makes that point without even a note in her hand <e> <s> in fact the figure was some million and the government have never sought compensation <e> <s> what was sauce for the goose at that time must be sauce for the gander now <e> <s> i can see no reason to compensate local authorities for the proceeds of sales of assets towards which they claim to have made a contribution any more than they compensated central government for the assets which they had bought <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for explaining so clearly the purpose of these amendments and my own reading of them coincides happily with his <e> <s> we have in the bill restricted the rather wide powers that the london transport executive currently have to manufacture vehicles and spare parts because we believe that lrts principal role is to run the buses and the trains not to make them <e> <s> the present management of the london transport executive have accepted the restriction written into the bill of their present manufacturing powers <e> <s> indeed most of their manufacturing activities are currently very limited despite their rather wide powers <e>", "<cs> frankly i am rather surprised that the noble lord lord tordoff thought it necessary to table these amendments <e> <s> they are identical to amendments tabled by his colleagues at committee stage in another place <e> <s> at that stage of course there may have been somewhat more justification for them since the provisions for the annual business plan did not at that time appear in the bill <e> <s> there is one very good and quite sufficient justification in my view for the retention of the word statement in describing the document to be prepared under this clause <e> <s> in this way we can distinguish quite clearly between what is required under this clause and the annual business plan which <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord lord underhill correct me if i have misunderstood him <e> <s> he would like to deal with amendments nos <e> <s> and together is that so <e>", "<cs> in fact that puts me in rather a difficulty because i intended during the course of any discussion on these three amendments to break the duck which the noble lord lord carmichael suggested was about time <e> <s> i cannot really go very far in helping the noble lord unless we actually get to the amendments <e>", "<cs> if i may draw the attention of the committee to amendment no <e> <s> there are two main obstacles to our accepting this amendment <e> <s> the first is that we feel it is better to avoid where possible providing in statute for details which ought to be matters either for the common sense of the parties concerned or for specific directions to the lrt board if necessary <e> <s> the more one tries to be specific the more of a straitjacket you provide for those trying to operate the business <e> <s> furthermore the more you seek to be specific and spell out everything that you expect to see in such a statement the more this calls into question the things that you have not seen fit to mention <e>", "<cs> as i see it the amendment seeks to transplant the relevant part of the transport act section into the bill <e> <s> as noble lords will remember the act was a highly complex set of provisions adapted to a particular set of circumstances <e> <s> the main purpose of that enactment was to set up a system in which there was a measure of control by the secretary of state of revenue subsidies to public transport executives but that control had to be exercised under a system in which the ptes and the lte were answerable to a local authority <e> <s> this was the reason why section enabled the executives to make some assumptions about the revenue support that they would be getting following the guidance that the secretary of state was to give them under section <e> <s> there is no reason to provide the same form of words in the circumstances of london regional transport <e> <s> clearly lrt will make assumptions about the levels of revenue subsidies which they can expect in the years ahead and the secretary of state will give them a good indication of what those levels are likely to be <e>", "<cs> i am sure i understand and i certainly sympathise with the motivation behind the amendment but i do not believe that it is absolutely necessary <e> <s> i think that we should rigorously avoid loading the bill which is already long and complicated with provisions that are not absolutely necessary <e> <s> the noble lord lord carmichael has been kind enough to spell out to the committee those bodies that lrt must consult in preparing its clause statement and i do not think i need repeat them <e> <s> but lrt is also required to consult such other persons if any as it may think fit <e>", "<cs> i can see no reason why the secretary of state should not be able to make observations on the clause statement when it has been submitted <e> <s> there is certainly no reason why lrt should not be obliged to take those observations into account in the exercise and performance of its functions <e> <s> i think the noble lord specifically asks about the words <e>", "<cs> i think that means probably that they have to weigh in the balance what he says and what they think about what he says <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord lord underhill will not take this remark amiss when i say that i really wondered when i saw the amendment whether the noble lord had in fact <e>", "<cs> it is inconceivable that lrt could prepare a statement of its strategic plans for the years ahead without those plans covering a period of at least three years <e> <s> indeed if it is to deal with lrts investment plans it will doubtless look a good deal further ahead than three years <e> <s> on the principle that the bill should not be weighted down with material that is unnecessary i hope that the noble lord will withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that i have understood the noble lord lord tordoff correctly <e> <s> all i can say is that the government have every intention subject to the agreement of both houses of parliament that this bill will come into effect in a matter of weeks rather than over the period of time that may be taken as regards any legislation that may be forthcoming <e> <s> i thought that i had made that reasonably clear in an earlier exchange on this very subject <e>", "<cs> my lords it is estimated that in the financial year per cent <e> <s> of expenditure by the department of trade and industry was on research and development compared with per cent <e> <s> in the financial year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his acceptance of my original answer <e> <s> it is not true however that a minimum figure of has to be found by an applicant <e> <s> the support-for-industry scheme is now currently under review and i would expect a statement on the whole programme to be made quite shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords not without notice <e> <s> i think that my noble friend will find the information that he seeks in the recently-published <e>", "<cs> my lords not on a constant basis but on a current basis <e> <s> in the dti share of per cent <e> <s> equalled million in per cent <e> <s> equated to million in again per cent but this time equating to million in per cent <e> <s> and million and in per cent <e> <s> equating to million <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not able to do that because the various bases used by government departments in overseas countries are rather different from our own <e> <s> the noble lord will probably recall that the adoption of the frascati definition which we are now using in our governments returns has only just started <e> <s> it will be two years before a direct comparison can be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i would expect a statement to be made in a matter of weeks <e> <s> therefore it will be less than six months and possibly more than one <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware of that <e> <s> a scheme was introduced a few months ago to encourage more designers particularly to go through the university system <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of what the noble lord has to say and will draw his remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not true <e> <s> the sfi rate of grant was raised to per cent <e> <s> in may for one year <e> <s> subsequently in the budget it was extended for a further year mainly to attract and this it has done most successfully more applications from companies which were engaged in the key technologies of the future including such things as biotechnology information technology fibre optics and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord underhill has reminded the committee this group of amendments deals essentially with two points <e> <s> the first relates to the powers of the greater london council to provide financial support for public passenger transport services and facilities <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and would add the glc to the list of local authorities set out in clause who will have powers to give financial support for services and facilities provided by lrt <e>", "<cs> indeed i am grateful to the noble lord for that confirmation <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is consequential and it reinstates the glcs powers to give capital grants for the provision improvement or development of public passenger transport services and facilities generally <e> <s> the bill proposes to repeal these powers which derive from section of the transport act <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i cannot help the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> i hope we are not going to get in a mix-up over this i suspect that we shall not as we move along <e> <s> let me say straight away to the noble lord lord underhill and indeed to the noble lord lord tordoff that this is a very important <e>", "<cs> i did not know not that it was very important at that particular stage that the noble lord was proposing to withdraw this series of amendments <e> <s> he says that he recalls the hours we spent on the act <e> <s> i thought i made it clear and if i did not i should like to try again that we really cannot compare the act with this present bill <e> <s> the act was designed for a very particular and specific purpose <e> <s> this bill is designed for a quite different purpose and so those hours that we may have spent in do not necessarily relate to what we are doing here <e>", "<cs> we return to matters of consultation <e> <s> this series of amendments would require consultation rather than the provision of information and would require lrt to take into consideration any representations received from the local authorities or the passengers committee <e> <s> i am sorry but we do not regard these amendments as workable <e> <s> we do not see it as practicable for lrt to have to consult the local authorities and the passengers committee each year about the matters dealt with in clause <e> <s> once again noble lords opposite are seeking to establish what i might call a whole new industry of consultation and i believe that if they were successful lrt would never emerge to get on with the job of running the buses and the trains <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great interest to what the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove has said about these three amendments <e> <s> i hope it will not come as too much of a shock to him when i say that i have some sympathy with the spirit of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this amendment would include service frequencies and routes among the matters about which lrt will be required to inform local authorities and the passengers committee <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord tordoff for explaining the purport of his amendment <e> <s> as he said it would require london regional transport to publish particulars of their current plans in respect of services and charges <e> <s> but london regional transport are already required to publish an annual business plan under clause and to publish a strategy statement at least every three years under clause <e> <s> both will deal with matters relating to fares and charges along with other matters <e> <s> i do not believe it is necessary to impose a further requirement to publish plans in yet another form and it would add a considerably heavy and additional burden to lrt <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord tordoff has on a couple of occasions used words relating to tone and attitude <e> <s> i hope he will not take it amiss if i say to him that i was rather surprised to see that this amendment had been tabled <e> <s> both of the amendments are the same in substance <e> <s> the first gives the london regional passengers committee a general right to information which would come to it from lrt <e> <s> in the second amendment the information would come from lrt british rail and the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful as i am sure will be the whole committee to the noble lord lord gallacher for his intervention with his very particular and extensive knowledge of consumer bodies <e> <s> i take very much to heart what he has had to say about the government taking an unconscionable length of time with regard to the review of consumer bodies particularly since as he may or may not know i was attached to the department of trade and industry only a week ago and therefore will have dealings with it on a rather more intimate basis than hitherto <e> <s> i shall certainly take that point back with me <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord underhill is so often very persuasive <e> <s> having listened carefully to both the noble lords speaking to the two amendments i have to say that they both miss the main purpose of clause <e> <s> this is not to secure the widest possible consultation on british rail fares and service provision within greater london but to ensure sensible co-operation between british rail and lrt on fares and services <e> <s> the requirement in this clause will serve to underpin the co-operation between lrt and british rail which is required under clause <e> <s> the equivalent provision in the act requires the railways board to consult the glc about the same matters <e> <s> this may have been appropriate while the glc has a strategic role in relation to londons public transport but it will no longer be appropriate in the new system which we propose <e>", "<cs> yes i would be happy to try to help the noble lord lord carmichael <e> <s> first perhaps i could say that we are talking here of powers which are very well precedented <e> <s> they exist in one form or another in all the nationalised industry legislation most notably in the transport act in relation to the transport boards which were set up in that act british rail london transport the british transport docks board and the british waterways board <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord teviot for bringing forward the amendment and equally grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for agreeing to take amendments nos <e> <s> and with my noble friends amendment <e> <s> it is helpful to talk about them together because there is a common theme <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord lord underhill mean another operator with a licence <e>", "<cs> may i just transfer hats because it is not customary for someone taking part in proceedings on a bill to move this motion <e> <s> i understand through the usual channels that we have arrived at the end of what has been agreed to so far as the bill is concerned and rather earlier than expected which i am sure the committee will appreciate <e> <s> therefore i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft stock exchange listing regulations be approved <e> <s> i can tell the house that these draft regulations have been considered by the joint committee on statutory instruments who have not called the attention of the house to any matter <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington and indeed to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for their receipt of these regulations <e> <s> i agree with them both that they are very important <e> <s> if i fail in their view to answer fairly their various and different questions i hope they will forgive me because it is a complicated matter <e> <s> both noble lords know that i am not as familiar as either of them with the detail of this measure <e> <s> therefore if i do not answer them adequately they can be quite sure i will seek further advice and communicate with them <e> <s> the noble lord sought a categorical assurance which i shall touch on later and i certainly understand that he may wish to give any response full publicity <e> <s> there would be no hedging the bets there <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will accept that i am not going to engage this morning in any exchange with so distinguished a member of the accounting profession as the noble lord <e> <s> may i take note of what he has said look at it and frankly be advised <e> <s> i can say this to the noble lord <e> <s> i do not know whether he is right but certainly there is no intention at all in these regulations to dilute in any way the very high standards that we in this country enjoy by virtue of the practices of the accounting profession and indeed the stock exchange which in my earlier remarks i said were somewhat superior in a number of respects to those in other markets <e>", "<cs> my lords between january and april <e> <s> miles of motorway and miles of other trunk roads have been completed in great britain <e>", "<cs> my lords not perhaps in those terms but in the financial years to <e> <s> million was spent on capital investment compared with million in the financial years to <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much regret to tell the noble lord <e> <s> lord underhill that i cannot answer his supplementary questions on local roads since the original question was on trunk roads and motorways <e>", "<cs> my lords the miles of m will be completed in at a total cost of million <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer my noble friend in terms of mileage but i can tell him that the older motorways those which are or years of age and notably the m are in need of renewal and repair <e> <s> there are no motorways that are considerably overladen that is past the forecast traffic figures that were projected at the time of construction <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as the figure of miles is concerned my noble friend will accept that there are changes in patterns of traffic and that no scheme outlined some years ago can remain absolute in all terms and conditions <e> <s> currently there are miles of motorway and miles of other trunk roads <e> <s> there is in the current plan a further -odd miles of motorway and some miles trunk road to be completed in the next few years <e> <s> as far as my noble friends question relating to the two-lane or three-lane approach to the dartford tunnel is concerned i can tell him that in our view the congestion currently occurring is not due to the narrowing of the traffic approaches but to the tollbooth numbers <e> <s> these are being increased on both sides of the river at departmental expense <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to agree or disagree with the noble baroness <e> <s> i am here as one of my noble friends said only last week to answer to the best of my ability the questions which the house puts to me <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another question but her majestys government have spent a good deal on providing for the homeless <e> <s> it is always as the noble lord will agree a question of balance <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether i can help the noble lord lord underhill but he will recall that the boroughs have always had the opportunity to support further schemes and the bill enables them to continue to do so <e> <s> whether or not they make a charge of pence or no charge at all is entirely up to the borough <e> <s> what we are talking about is the reserve scheme <e> <s> this is a basic scheme which is brought into being and was introduced into the bill very largely in response to requests by honourable members in another place in the event of the local boroughs failing to agree on a uniform scheme <e>", "<cs> as my right honourable friend the secretary of state said in another place the whole purpose of clause is to enable him to <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord carmichael for having explained the principle underlying this amendment <e> <s> when i looked at it i thought that the amendment would probably be more in the nature of an exploratory one <e> <s> as he will know a similar amendment was discussed during the committee stage proceedings in another <e>", "<cs> i shall be happy to give the noble lord lord underhill a reason but may i start by saying that i cannot agree with him that his amendment is a better way of doing what we intend <e> <s> as the noble lord has explained clause is concerned with transitional provisions which deal with rather exceptional circumstances <e> <s> normally on the creation of a new public body its board members would be newly appointed from scratch <e> <s> in this case however the london transport executive are not changing their legal persona they are simply continued under a new name and under a new constitution and their board members will continue in office as lrt board members on the appointed day <e> <s> but it is quite possibly the secretary of states single most important function in his relationship with lrt to make appointments to the board and he must have freedom to start lrt off as early as possible with a board which he regards as suitable for implementing his policies <e>", "<cs> i can quite understand what prompts the noble lord lord underhill to use some of the terminology that he did in moving his amendment but the logic behind the amendment appears to me to be that if the secretary of state is responsible for the terms of appointment of members of the board of lrt then he should be responsible for paying any compensation if they are removed from office <e>", "<cs> i beg to move amendments nos <e> <s> d and e <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord said in moving his amendment it is quite important <e> <s> indeed it is but i regret to say that we do not find the amendment acceptable <e> <s> the noble lord seeks to substitute in paragraph of schedule a reference to the appointed day in place of the reference to nd december which was the date when this bill was published <e> <s> that is germane he himself underlined it and i shall return to it in a moment <e> <s> that would allow the greater london council to enter into grant-making commitments with british rail and other people right up to the appointed day knowing that lrt would be obliged to take over and a considerable proportion of the costs would then fall to london regional transport <e>", "<cs> i never fail to be amazed at the imagination of the noble lord <e> <s> lord pitt of hampstead in these matters because in fact we are not really doing what he suggested we are doing <e> <s> we are not flouting the law of the land <e> <s> all we are saying in this schedule is that london regional transport should not be obliged to honour glc commitments entered into after the bill was published <e> <s> we said that right at the beginning <e> <s> if the bill fails <e> <s> the position remains as it was <e> <s> but we are dealing with exceptional circumstances <e> <s> some of the actions of the greater london council who are the masters of london transport have been to say the least somewhat unpredictable over this past months or so <e> <s> indeed if they want to continue financing capital projects the glc can so do but any contractor entering into agreements on such projects after nd december does so with his eyes open because when the bill was published we said what the intentions would be <e>", "<cs> as i understand it they have not <e> <s> i think that i have actually come to the end of what i had to say <e> <s> i was about to say that i cannot say any more and that i hope the explanation is acceptable to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend lord teviot for the explicit and very full way in which he has explained the reason for his amendment <e> <s> we have been listening to a noble lord who has some experience in this field and i accept most of what he said <e> <s> we all recognise the concern of london transport and the glc that there is insufficient kerbside space for potential operators of excursions and tours and we can see too that this causes a good deal of congestion in a number of places in central london <e>", "<cs> i regret that my noble friend has not found my explanation to be satisfactory <e> <s> i accept my noble friends description of the tourist season but the government see no point in duplicating identical legislation even though there may be a few months delay <e> <s> we believe that the clause which the noble lord seeks to insert into the bill is far better placed in the greater london council general powers bill <e> <s> however my noble friend is supported by the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> therefore without any commitment i am willing to have a further look at the matter in order to examine whether my explanation is totally satisfactory not only to my noble friend but also to the government <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord underhill will allow me to respond to that when we come to clause which may i think need further explanation <e> <s> although there is no amendment to clause we could perhaps go a little further into the clause when we reach it <e>", "<cs> in moving that clause does not stand part of the bill i should perhaps explain that the amendment effects a major simplification of the bill <e> <s> the clause which i propose should be deleted makes a harbour authority liable to pay compensation if the harbour master unreasonably excludes a vessel and loss or damage is suffered as a result <e> <s> however under the common law the harbour master and harbour authority would be liable for damages in the case of any negligent use of the powers or any action in excess of the powers for example where there was no grave or imminent danger or risk as provided in clause <e> <s> it seems unnecessary to supplement this common law liability with a specific clause in the bill <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> for the reasons that i have given i would ask that the committee does not insist upon clause standing part of the bill <e>", "<cs> earlier in our consideration the noble lord lord underhill raised a question about enforcement <e> <s> he reminded the committee that clause says <e>", "<cs> i shall be very pleased to take further advice <e> <s> probably it will be helpful to the <e>", "<cs> the crown vessel is exempt from the provisions of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords we had a lengthy exchange on this very same amendment at committee stage when i thought i made the governments position quite clear <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill indicated that he would go away and seek further advice on the meaning of the word integration <e> <s> he has today given us the benefit of his inquiries <e>", "<cs> my lords i was tempted when i first saw the amendment to think that this was one of the few unfamiliar amendments on the marshalled list but in fact we are really treading some rather well-trodden ground <e> <s> we have had discussions about planning and other requirements that are to be placed on london regional transport and the extent to which they should be required to estimate the benefits to users of their services <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord lord underhill for taking these two amendments together <e> <s> i have to say at the outset that while i have some sympathy with the spirit of the first hake not been able to find in what he has said to your lordships just now anything different from what he said during our earlier consideration of this matter apart from his critical comments upon the arguments i advanced during that stage <e> <s> i fear that i have no new arguments to offer so i will reiterate with a few embellishments those which i advanced before <e>", "<cs> my lords we discussed at the committee stage a very large group of amendments relating to the national bus company <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord tordoff for his opening remarks on this point <e> <s> i appreciate that he feels fairly strongly about the matter hence this amendment <e> <s> i shall try again to reassure the noble lord that the omission of a specific reference to the national bus company from the bill implied no adverse comment on the company or their operations or indeed their management <e> <s> the noble lord knows better than anybody else in your lordships house that i too know the chief executive and the chairman <e> <s> the noble lord has i feel slightly exaggerated the feelings of the management of the nbc about this matter <e> <s> our view is that the nbc should not be singled out for special reference from among other operators who may be either providing services on lrts behalf under agreement or independently of lrt under road service licences <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord tordoff for his explanation of the amendment <e> <s> he referred in particular to the london transport passengers committee having been in correspendence with my honourable friend the minister of state on the matter in connection with the discussions they were seeking on the no <e> <s> bus route which is supported by the london borough of hillingdon <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am obliged to the noble lord lord underhill for his explanation of this series of amendments and i am also grateful to him for taking them together <e> <s> i explained at some length in committee why we do not think it appropriate to superimpose on london regional transport the planning process laid down in the transport act <e> <s> the noble lord was good enough to acknowledge that <e> <s> from what he said i do not think it is necessary to go over that ground again except perhaps to remind your lordships that the act dealt with very different circumstances in which the secretary of state was obliged to assess the subsidy needs of london transport alongside those of the passenger transport executives <e> <s> it was clearly necessary in those circumstances to provide for a rather more elaborate system to ensure that they could be examined on a common basis <e>", "<cs> perhaps it may be helpful if i speak a little more slowly my lords <e> <s> in one important respect this amendment goes a little further than the proposal which was discussed at committee stage <e> <s> under our amendment lrt will be required to consult the passengers committee as well as the local authorities about withdrawals of bus services <e> <s> this will be a further enhancement of the committees powers as a result of the bill <e> <s> the amendment does not provide for any period of notice but in this respect it follows the arrangements already in clause <e> <s> in practice withdrawals of services are not proposed at short notice or in isolation and any withdrawal will normally he part of a package of proposals <e> <s> by their very nature changes of this sort do require some months of detailed preparation and they will in addition be foreshadowed in general terms in the information to be provided under clause <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord underhill has explained this amendment really would give preferential treatment to the passengers committee in respect of applications made to the traffic commissioners by independent operators for road service licences to operate london bus services <e> <s> the amendment would require copies of the application to be sent to the passengers committee and it would require the traffic commissioners to have regard in particular to representations received from the passengers committee <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank all noble lords and the noble baroness who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> perhaps i may say at the beginning that not particularly in response to the noble lord lord carmichael i would certainly not think that any of the questions or comments that have been raised this afternoon could possibly fall into the frivolous category <e> <s> these are very important matters <e> <s> again i have to apologise to your lordships for having brought such a complex series of amendments to your lordships at this particular stage <e> <s> i shall try to answer as many questions as i can <e> <s> those that i miss i will certainly answer in writing in the next or hours <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for explaining that to me <e> <s> the short answer is that i do not know and i might just as well say so here and now <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord will allow me i will look into the matter and i will be in touch with him within a day or two certainly before we return to the subject on third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for explaining that <e> <s> we must make sure that we do not provide as many opportunities as there are at present for people to avoid paying <e> <s> london regional transport regard the introduction of the penalty fares provision as an important step in their overall plans <e> <s> the noble lord asked specifically if other authorities want to introduce penalty fares what should they do <e> <s> the answer is that if they so wish it will be up to them to seek the necessary powers <e>", "<cs> no my lords there will not be one on every bus <e> <s> the present system that is used on buses is that inspectors make spot checks <e> <s> this is back-up by a small squad of plan clothes officials who are used among other things to follow passengers previously reported by staff as suspected of fare evasion <e> <s> on the underground the normal method of detecting fare evasion in through the use of traveling ticket inspectors checking passengers on trains and at barriers and plain cloths staff are also used there <e>", "<cs> yes i beg your lordships pardon it was the boble lord lord somers <e> <s> the noble lord said that people could not get past the driver <e> <s> it has not been unknown in the crush of people getting out for passengers to get in through the exit door when it is open <e> <s> so people can get on buses without going through the right door <e>", "<cs> my lords as indeed the noble lord lord carmichael said we had a lengthy debate on a similar amendment at the committee stage <e> <s> of course we have noted that the noble lords present amendment now provides for at least one-third of the board to comprise local authority nominees instead of at least two-thirds <e> <s> in no other respect is this amendment different <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell the noble baroness exactly what my brief says <e> <s> it says resist and that is what i shall do <e> <s> as the noble lord lord underhill said we considered the matter quite briefly at committee stage and i made our position quite clear <e> <s> i explained then and i repeat now that we regard london regional transports principal role as one of running buses and trains and not making them <e> <s> that is why we have deliberately narrowed down in the bill the wide powers which london transport have at present <e> <s> the powers in paragraph of schedule enable london regional transport to engage in any necessary manufacturing or repair activities for their own purposes short of actually being able to manufacture vehicles <e> <s> this will permit them to make sensible use of their resources to carry out repairs for third parties <e> <s> we believe that these powers are fully sufficient for lrt and quite consistent with their main function which as i say certainly is not to carry out manufacturing processes for themselves or for outsiders but is to get on with running their own services <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both the noble lords lord carmichael of kelvingrove and lord molloy for explaining their support for this amendment <e> <s> i am not surprised that we have had another debate under the general heading of accountability <e> <s> frankly there is little i can add to what i said at committee stage <e> <s> i explained at that time that schedule paragraph gives the passengers committee the power to determine its own procedure to enable it to decide whether and when to open its meetings to the public <e> <s> we regard this as the best way to proceed <e> <s> none of the nationalised industry consumer councils is covered incidentally by the act and we do not regard it as appropriate to impose a requirement on them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl lord attlee for moving this amendment because it gives me the opportunity to clarify the intentions of our own proposal <e> <s> paragraph of schedule makes it clear that lrt are to be required to take over certain commitments entered into by the glc for public transport investment with british rail or operators other than london transport <e> <s> it makes equally clear that the requirement is not to apply to commitments made by the glc after nd december that is after the publication of the bill <e> <s> i would emphasise that nothing in the paragraph has been intended to prevent the glc either from entering into new commitments after nd december or from making payments after that date whether under old or new commitments <e> <s> we are not in that sense constraining the glc in anticipation of parliaments approval to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords before i speak to my noble friends amendment i wonder whether your lordships will permit me since we are in report stage to correct something i said earlier in response to my noble friend lord teviot when we were discussing the manufacturing clauses <e> <s> i said if my memory serves me right that an example of lrts manufacturing allowance was spare parts and things of that nature <e> <s> i also suggested that the cream which they have manufactured for their own use would probably be allowed <e> <s> however i am advised that the type of things are certainly spare parts for buses but also things such as escalator chains as an example of an incidental item to the repair and service of their equipment because these are not normally made <e> <s> the narrower manufacturing powers which lrt will have will probably lead to the cessation of production of certain chemical products such as cleaning solvents which they manufacture and sell in small quantities at present <e> <s> i am afraid that i may very well have mislead my noble friend <e> <s> i would envisage of course that london regional transport will no doubt sell the manufacturing rights or patents to an outside body <e> <s> under the provisions in paragraph of the schedule lrt will be able to complete any contracts entered into by the executive <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure <e> <s> i understand that it has been agreed through the usual channels that we shall return to the earlier business at pm <e>", "<cs> my lords most traffic signs on main roads in the united kingdom comply with the standards recommended in the anderson report and the worboys report for motorways and all purpose roads respectively <e> <s> on minor rural roads a considerable number of old finger post type signs still exist <e> <s> also on some urban roads there are a number of directional signs that do not comply with modern requirements <e> <s> there are no centrally held records which would enable the cost of modernising them to be assessed <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport has no proposals for a general programme of modernisation of these signs <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will no doubt be aware that the department of transport are responsible for miles of motorway and miles of all-purpose trunk road <e> <s> the intersections to which he refers would fall to the responsibility of the local highway authority because there are a further miles in that classification <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with the earlier remarks of the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> the complete signposting of the m will not be accomplished until the road itself is finished in <e> <s> if the noble lord has any particular difficulty in any section which is now open of course i should like to know about it <e>", "<cs> my lords the signing regulations to which i have earlier referred were set in updated in and further updated in <e> <s> the traffic signs regulations do prescribe in general terms sign colours lighting or reflectorisation requirements <e> <s> these are dealt with under british standard no <e> <s> <e> <s> we feel that our signposting compares very favourably with that of other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords concerning my noble friends last question the advice that is given to local authorities is in a publication called <e>", "<cs> if noble lords from any part of the house have a particular problem again i should he delighted to know about it and draw it to the attention of the local authorities concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know <e> <s> i will certainly find out and ask my noble friend who is responsible for the prison service whether or not the noble lords suggestion could he adopted <e>", "<cs> my lords the motorway and primary route network signing is covered under the european rules concerning road traffic signs and signals <e> <s> it was published by the european conference of ministers of transport as recently as and it includes the conventions and agreements signed in vienna in geneva in and geneva in <e> <s> for those who may be unaware of how our signing and route signing systems work there is a very small booklet called <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord knows that the main primary road network signing includes directions in both english and welsh <e> <s> there is no suggestion that this should be discontinued in the event of any change in the signing in the principality <e>", "<cs> i expect it would my lords <e> <s> there is a question of cost benefit in this matter and since road signs cost between and each the noble baroness will understand that there is a problem here of considerable expense with a limited advantage in view <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of what my noble friend has said <e> <s> he underlines what other noble lords in all parts of the house have suggested in their response to my earlier answer <e> <s> as i say i take note of what my noble friend has said and i shall certainly draw it to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am sorry i just do not know that one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite happy to give my noble friend the reassurance she seeks <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord underhill said we debated an identical amendment at report stage <e> <s> i thought that i had then explained the governments position quite clearly <e> <s> we have now had a number of debates in which wet have explained why we see no grounds for giving the passengers committee a particular role in relation to independent operators <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would help my noble friend if she understood that in practice the noble lord <e> <s> lord underhill who is moving the amendment has the right of response at the end of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords it would seem to me that we are moving into a number of amendments all at once <e> <s> i think it might be better if i dealt just with this particular one at this stage <e> <s> as i made plain at the outset of the debate we are sympathetic to the underlying purpose <e> <s> the government accept that when a person becomes liable to a penalty fare he must be provided with information as to his rights and obligations <e> <s> the government have every intention of ensuring that this will be done <e>", "<cs> my lords it is page clause <e> <s> the authorised person is defined there <e> <s> it means that only one of these authorised persons who is a special inspector specially trained will have the authority of the provider of the service to <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not very surprised to see that the noble lord lord underhill has returned to this point <e> <s> however we have discussed it twice already in the house and i am just a little disappointed that he felt it necessary to raise it again particularly as he was not able to advance any new argument in support of his amendment <e> <s> therefore he will not be at all surprised to hear me say that our position remains completely unchanged <e> <s> we do not believe that lrt should have wide manufacturing powers either for themselves or for outsiders as these amendments propose <e> <s> i repeat what i have said on two if not three previous occasions <e> <s> the job of lrt is to run buses and trains and not to make them for themselves or for anybody else <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> we now approach the end of our deliberations on a very important bill <e> <s> first i should like to thank my noble friends lord avon and lord trefgarne for the very great contribution they have made to these debates on behalf of the government <e> <s> may i also thank the noble lords lord underhill and lord tordoff for the very courteous and constructive way in which they have spoken for the opposition parties <e> <s> let me not forget either the very substantial contribution made by the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove who i believe was speaking from the opposition front bench for the very first time on transport matters <e> <s> may i thank too all other noble lords and noble baronesses on all sides of the house who have taken part in our debates <e> <s> thirty-three of them have taken part in those debates during the last few weeks <e> <s> i am glad that we have been able to accept the spirit of at least some of their proposed changes and have thus improved the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the british railways board are currently discussing the sale of sealink with a number of potential purchasers and hope formally to invite bids soon <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the noble lords first two supplementary questions are concerned i gave his noble friend answers to precisely those two questions on rd april and those answers remain exactly the same <e> <s> so far as the container traffic is concerned that is progressing well <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that british rail are offering sealink for sale as an entity as a complete company <e>", "<cs> my lords the wage negotiations were the responsibility of the british railways board <e> <s> naturally the chairman kept my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport informed of the progress of the negotiations and in his turn my right honourable friend kept his colleagues informed <e> <s> this is because the government need to know and if necessary to comment on the implications of wage negotiations for the finances of <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first supplementary of the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe is concerned i would say that certainly there was an exchange of letters and this would not be unusual between ministers who have overlapping responsibilities in these matters <e> <s> i feel that the noble lords second supplementary is somewhat wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords i should hope that all of us in all quarters of the house would deplore and condemn the theft of documents and any breach of confidence between ministers and their officials <e> <s> those who leak papers such as those to which the noble lord refers must accept that they damage the reputation of the entire civil service and betray <e> <s> the trust they owe the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord jacques suggests in his question something which is slightly misleading <e> <s> he will recognise and i am sure all noble lords will recognise that her majestys government are accountable to parliament for the nationalised industries <e> <s> it stands to reason that they must provide those industries with a broad framework within which to work and that means discussing with them the implications of wider government policies <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly on th october last my right honourable friend the secretary of state set out objectives for british rail <e> <s> those objectives were accepted by the chairman mr bob reid <e> <s> i confirm the figure that my noble friend has quoted <e> <s> i should add that the government have also approved million-worth of investment in british rail since last october since those objectives were set down <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not agree with the noble lord lord ezra <e> <s> i do not think there is any confusion in the mind of the public <e> <s> i have stated quite clearly and on other occasions noble friends alongside me have stated the relationship between government and the nationalised industries <e> <s> i should have thought that the noble lord lord ezra himself would have full knowledge of what are those kind of relationships <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should thank the right reverend prelate for his comments <e>", "<cs> my lords the design and performance of seat-belts is under constant development and some potential improvements are being investigated by the transport and road research laboratory <e> <s> the government are considering possible requirements for the fitting of <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as coaches are concerned there are a number of very great technical difficulties involved in fitting either lap or lap and diagonal seat-belts in all the seating <e> <s> her majestys government have placed accent on the encouragement of further research with regard to the construction of coaches because the majority of accidents occur as a result of the roof crushing in <e> <s> within the united nations economic commission for europe the united kingdom has taken a lead in pressing for international agreements for new standards <e> <s> we are represented on that commission by my departments chief mechanical engineer <e> <s> some agreement has been reached and so results may be expected over the years in the course of new manufacture <e>", "<cs> my lords mercifully there are very few coach accidents in this country and indeed abroad <e> <s> in regretfully people were killed on buses or coaches and that total comprised drivers passenger occupants and passengers boarding or alighting from either a coach or a bus <e> <s> in the last five years the average fatality rate has been a year against in the previous five years <e> <s> so the record while nothing to be complacent about is not demonstrably very high <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated in my original answer my honourable friend the minister of state in the department of transport is giving consideration to possible requirements for the fitting of rear seat-belts <e> <s> i think that noble lords will accept that it would be unwise for us to draw any particular conclusion since the compulsory wearing of seat-belts in the front of cars is only months through the trial period <e> <s> it is being monitored and it would be unwise to draw any conclusions until the experimental period is completed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill he now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bruce of donington spent seven minutes of his speech describing how he did not like what i might call the domestic and other arrangements with regard to our business this afternoon <e> <s> he will accept that this is not within my province of responsibility but he will also accept that it is within the province of his noble friend who forms part of the usual channels <e> <s> i do not feel that his accusation was totally accurately directed when he asked me to draw my noble friends attention to it <e> <s> he suggested in a reference to yesterdays business that your lordships house should not be taken for granted nor indeed would we <e> <s> i can certainly assure the noble lord that i would never take him for granted <e>", "<cs> my lords considering that the farming community provide a very large amount of the foodstuffs that we consume in this country i should have thought it was a very genuine job <e> <s> i should not wish to debate this afternoon the amount of subsidy <e> <s> indeed it was the noble lord lord grimond who raised the question of the relativity of cda funding to agricultural grant a subject which perhaps i might be able to come to a little later <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that assurance and if i misunderstood him i am sure he will forgive me also <e> <s> he asked as did the noble lords lord mcintosh lord graham and lord bruce of donington where the savings are that we are talking about <e> <s> the savings indicated in the explanatory memorandum arise primarily from the exclusion of the replacement investment grant <e> <s> this is required by the european commission and in fact we are quite happy to comply with the commissions ruling <e> <s> this is not for the reasons which some noble lords may suspect but frankly we have belief that support for replacement investment is usually dead weight in that that investment will be going ahead anyway probably in the same place even without grant and the money could be better used elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i am sorry that i did not pick up the point properly before <e> <s> this is something that i knew about some years ago when i was dealing in particular with small firms <e> <s> my understanding is that the cda and the msc have put together a new package of training <e> <s> the provisions in the bill with regard to training will allow them to expand that activity for precisely the reason which the noble lord gave <e> <s> we have seen in recent years well-meaning well principled people joining together in co-operatives and two or three years later they have had to be abandoned because there was not the skill the expertise or the knowledge <e> <s> the cda will be looking at this in particular and that is why that extension is in the bill for giving assistance in that way <e> <s> i take the noble lords points on board <e> <s> i am sure that there are a number of points some of which are rather more major than others which i have not picked up <e> <s> if i have failed to reply to any of the points which have been made i can assure noble lords that before we reach the next stage i shall respond <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall attempt to find something with which to satisfy the noble lord before he puts down a probing amendment for our committee stage on th july <e> <s> i want to make only one other point <e> <s> even if the noble lord lord bruce of donington twits me that this is the prepared piece yes it is i shall tell him that <e> <s> but i have not given him the speech and he knows that also <e> <s> most people have accepted the cda provision in part i of the bill and i am grateful to them for that <e> <s> perhaps it is the more straightforward part of the bill but it is a no less important part for that <e>", "<cs> my lords a national maximum speed limit of miles per hour was introduced in the united states in january <e> <s> the number of road fatalities and injuries fell in by per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> respectively <e> <s> on inter-state rural roads the reduction in fatalities and injuries was per cent <e> <s> a large part of these reductions could be associated with the miles per hour limit <e> <s> united states casualty figures have been creeping up steadily since then <e> <s> it is extremely difficult to assess the benefit of the miles per hour limit because many other factors are known to have an effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his remarks with regard to the decision my right honourable friend announced on rd july so far as the miles an hour limit is concerned <e> <s> as regards minimum speed limits we have no current proposals to investigate this matter further <e> <s> this was done some years ago and did not find favour particularly for two reasons <e> <s> one was that it could in fact encourage higher speeds than would be safe in particularly bad conditions <e> <s> secondly there is no evidence that it would have a road safety benefit by producing a reduction in speed differentials over a shorter speed band <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have understood the noble lord lord underhill correctly my right honourable friend has made a decision that the limit for motor cars on motorways should remain at miles an hour <e> <s> as far as that answer is concerned there is no more to say on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be a factor <e> <s> certainly conditions in the united states of america vary so considerably from our own that as i suggested in my original answer their conditions have little relevance to our own <e>", "<cs> my lords i had known that there was this noticeable difference to which my noble friend refers <e>", "<cs> my lords no that is not so <e> <s> on their own speed limits are only a contributory factor towards accidents and as i suggested again in my original answer very many different factors have to be brought into account when assessing the relativity of road deaths and casualties <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no dispensation <e>

goods by rail is governed by british rails conditions of carriage and acceptance <e> <s> the transport by road of dangerous gases and chemicals in bulk is covered by regulations made in which cover the construction of the vehicles their labelling and the training of drivers <e> <s> earlier this year the health and safety commission published proposals to apply similar controls to the transport by road of dangerous substances in packages <e> <s> these will form part of a comprehensive system of controls under the health and safety at work etc <e> <s> act <e>", "<cs> my lords the million programme being conducted by the cegb in connection with the safety of the flasks for containing nuclear spent fuels is part of a programme to do just that which the noble viscount suggests <e> <s> there have been no accidents involving flasks and involving injury to persons certainly in the past years <e> <s> with regard to the carriage of dangerous gases by road tankers the noble viscount will know that lpg and petro-ethyl lead is covered by the road tanker regulations <e> <s> there are some million tanker journeys undertaken each year in this country and the only incident involving serious injury was in <e>", "<cs> my lords the occupation is unauthorised <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport as highway authority for the trunk road will take action if those concerned endanger road safety interrupt the flow of traffic or obstruct passage along the highway <e> <s> in another place yesterday my right honourable friend made clear that the department are considering an approach from the ministry of defence to acquire the land which is surplus to foreseeable highway requirements <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that early this morning two women presented themselves to ministry of defence police at raf greenham common claiming to have been camping within the base for a week <e> <s> the alleged camp site is in thick scrub on a steep slope in a corner of the base far removed form any sensitive areas <e> <s> there is no evidence to substantiate their allegation <e> <s> naturally the circumstances will be examined <e>", "<cs> my lords i

highway and provided that that is not impeded no offence will have taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg my noble friends pardon <e> <s> i understand that no arrests have been made since th june <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will recall that the noble lord lord jenkins of putney asked this precise question on th april <e> <s> in further response to my noble friends answer on that day i can say that the government are moving with caution and provided that no offence takes place my right honourable friend sees no point in furthering a prosecution <e> <s> while i am answering that question may i correct my previous answer to my noble friend lady sharples when i said that i understood that no arrests have taken place since th june <e> <s> in fact arrests have taken place since that date <e>", "<cs> my lords i answered my noble friend earlier in so far as the highway was concerned <e> <s> that there may be a question of trespass is probably very true but my right honourable friend feels that the practicalities of bringing an action for trespass would perhaps be counter to the spirit of allowing peaceful demonstrators to protest in a peaceful way <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>",

asked me whether these women were guilty of trespass even if they were not offending against the highways act and i answered that that may well be so <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with my noble friend that this is a disgrace to the whole country <e> <s> we in this country have a practice whereby demonstrators may demonstrate and protesters may protest <e> <s> that is exactly what is happening at greenham common <e>", "<cs> my lords although the greenham common ladies may have the courage of their own convictions there are nevertheless other ways of making their protests which would be more acceptable to the community at large <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i totally agree with the noble lord lord stewart of fulham <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the noble baroness she is suggesting that the government are not treating the greenham common ladies with decency <e> <s> if that is her suggestion i would reject it <e> <s> the greenham common ladies are being treated decently and fairly <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat in the form of a statement the answer which has been given to a private notice question in another place on the dock strike <e> <s> the answer is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most obliged to both noble lords for the way in which they have received this statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill made a number of interrogatory statements but his main point was when he asked whether the government would intervene in this dispute <e> <s> i must say that the government will not intervene <e> <s> it is for the industry to settle the dispute <e> <s> the national joint council meets today and as i said we would not want to say anything here which might prejudice its negotiations and efforts to get the dispute back to the proper procedures <e>", "<cs> my lords of course my noble friend lord renton is quite right to remind us of that <e> <s> perhaps i should also advise him that not only is the transport and general workers union involved here <e> <s> also involved is the general municipal boilermakers and allied trades union and some members of the dock industry belong to the national union of railwaymen <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord underhill has asked me a hypothetical question <e> <s> i do not know what the national joint council will discuss it is not for me to say what it will discuss <e> <s> if the noble lord wants me to give the governments view with regard to the dock labour scheme this afternoon i can only say that it remains exactly the same as was stated in a written answer in another place by my honourable friend the secretary of state for employment at col on nd july <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot contemplate the extension of this strike nor its continuation for any length of time <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot he drawn by my noble friend into discussing the dock labour scheme this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to the last question of the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe i do not know the split between the scheme and non-scheme ports <e> <s> so far as i am aware there is a procedure for abandoning the dock labour scheme provided that notice has been given and agreement reached <e> <s> as i understand it but i cannot be held to this because obviously i was not present no application for a departure from the scheme was made <e> <s> i do not know anything about the numbers involved in deciding to strike whether it was a majority or a minority <e>", "<cs> my lords of course my noble friend lord thorneycroft is quite right and i am glad to hear him say this <e> <s> while i am on my feet perhaps i may answer one of the questions which the noble lord lord taylor asked about volumes of traffic <e> <s> i understand that about a quarter of trade goes through non-scheme ports <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure <e> <s> i remind your lordships that we shall return to other matters at a quarter past eight <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first five months of this year there was a crude deficit of billion on our trade with the federal republic of germany <e> <s> exports and imports have been increasing at similar rates over the past months <e>", "<cs> my lords if i might perhaps correct the noble lord lord ezra my understanding is that the crude balance of trade deficit for with the federal republic of germany was in fact million and not million <e>", "<cs> billion <e> <s> noble lords will wish to know that the federal republic of germany take per cent <e> <s> of united kingdom exports and that is some seven and a half times larger by value than the level <e> <s> compared to world trade which was only five times larger it shows a healthy improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure for which the noble lord lord bruce of donington asks is in fact minus billion in manufactured goods <e> <s> i have answered i think what the government have done and i reiterate answers which i have given on other occasions stating that it is largely for british industry itself to accept those policies which would help it to become more competitive and more efficient in providing goods at the right kind of price and at the right kind of timing <e> <s> the federal republic of germany and indeed the world are desirous of buying from us <e> <s> as i have said the government have spent million in support of that endeavour <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure the government are well aware of what might have happened in the early part of the century i must confess to my noble friend that i am not <e> <s> i can say that it is the policy of the government to avoid protectionist policies we believe in free enterprise and free and fair competition across the world <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed i agree with the noble lord but since the original question was directed only to the federal republic of germany i felt obliged to answer it in those terms <e> <s> the noble lord is of course quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of that <e> <s> the noble lord lord beswick will appreciate that the rise in interest rates to which i think he refers reflects market pressures to which clearers have been obliged to respond <e> <s> base rates were last at per cent <e> <s> in july and the house will no doubt recall that by november of that year they were down again to per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i totally refute the allegation that the government are complacent <e> <s> since there have been surpluses in our balance of trade right across the world over the last four years <e> <s> i find the implication behind the noble lords question not proved <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord ezra needs no education his experience is too deep and too long for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought when the noble lord lord ezra put his first supplementary question that he and my noble friend were going to engage in a question and answer session <e> <s> since i understand that his last question was addressed to me i think i should say that the european trade committee have set up two special working parties to study particular aspects of our trade relationship in germany and i hope that that will give the noble lord lord ezra some encouragement in the underlying question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lord nugent of guildford because he does of course put his finger on the point <e> <s> i had avoided reciting again the policies of the government all of which have made their proper contribution to our economic improvement across the world <e> <s> of course i agree with my noble friend that the cessation of production of whatever it may be manufactured goods or indeed commodities for whatever reason does have a very adverse effect upon our trade with other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be for the convenience of the house if with permission i now repeat a statement which has just been made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport on the subject of public road transport <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords it is customary to thank noble lords on each of the main opposition benches for their response to a statement <e> <s> i very much regret that this afternoon i am not able to do that because i find that the response of the noble lord lord underhill was singularly hostile which demonstrates to me the inability of the opposition to meet challenge with change <e> <s> quite to the contrary of course the noble lord lord tordoff while recognising that the statement and the proposals so far as he has been able to see them are dramatic accepts some of the fundamental principles underlying the white paper and i am grateful to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend will allow me first to answer my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i am most grateful to my noble friend for his contribution <e> <s> of course noble lords will recall that my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter made such a distinguished contribution in the field of transport and of public transport not so very many years ago and the impact still remains <e> <s> i am aware of very many of the points which my noble friend made and of course i concur with him <e> <s> he is quite right in saying that this is an historic occasion <e> <s> this sets a new pattern a new train so to speak although we are talking about road transport in a system that has remained unaltered for years and it is to be welcomed <e> <s> since many of those in the road transport industry have great innovative and entrepreneurial skills i have little doubt that the rewards which we seek by the white paper will be achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am grateful to my noble friend lord peyton <e> <s> he too had a distinguished career as a minister in the department of transport and i accept what he says <e> <s> i can only underline what i said in my first response to the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> he appears to be staying years behind and i am very surprised and disappointed <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend has asked me four questions and i can deal with them quite shortly <e> <s> the user is particularly paramount in our consideration of bus policy and as he no doubt studies the white paper over the weekend or over the next weeks he will see that that is so <e> <s> it is the user then the operator and so on <e> <s> my noble friend asked whether there will be a maintenance of the quality of public transport services which we now enjoy <e> <s> i have to say to him that many do not enjoy it because they find it inadequate but i can see no reason why that minimal standard should not be maintained <e> <s> the whole object of the proposals in the white paper is to improve the quality of the service which users enjoy <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord lord bruce of donington the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran and my noble friend lord renton for their welcome to this measure <e> <s> may i also thank them for their response and for their very useful comments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for making his question quite clear to me <e> <s> it will rest upon its own feet but i could not possibly commit my right honourable friends in another place as to whether it will appear before christmas <e> <s> certainly it will be early in the session <e> <s> the noble lord asked me about consultation <e> <s> as your lordships will probably recall there was quite extensive consultation prior to the first report of the two law commissions which led to the first pre-consolidation amendment order earlier in the year <e> <s> as i indicated in my opening remarks the circumstances surrounding the second report and this order are different <e> <s> the two law commissions have had to act most expeditiously to produce the report in the time available and there was simply not time to undertake the normal type of consultation that we conducted previously <e> <s> however we have no reason to think that there is any disagreement with the proposals contained in the order <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the draft pedal bicycles safety amendment regulations <e> <s> these regulations have been laid in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord underhill and the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley for their comments in respect of this draft order <e> <s> i do not think that i need to make any response to the noble lord lord underhill whose experience of bicycling and bicycling matters enabled him notwithstanding his denial to understand the regulations exactly on first sight <e>", "<cs> my lords it certainly is a statement <e> <s> it does not say bs advise x y z or anything else <e> <s> it just says <e>", "<cs> my lords may be <e> <s> being a very simple reader of regulations i should myself have thought that this was a piece of advice proferred to those who manufacture bicycles to certain standards <e> <s> the noble lord reminded us that the pedestrians association and others were at one time opposed to mandatory requirements <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house it might be for the convenience of your lordships if i repeat a statement about sealink uk which is now being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill and the noble baroness lady seear for their acceptance of the statement which i have just repeated <e> <s> noble lords opposite may laugh when i say that i am grateful to them for their response but i repeat that <e> <s> i have little doubt that noble lords have a number of questions and i hope that i shall satisfy some of them <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill asked quite specifically how the sale price of million can be justified when he read in british rails annual report that the net assets stood on the books at million <e> <s> some million of those assets consist of leased assets but even allowing for that it is true that there is a discount on the asset value of the sale price <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps noble lords opposite will let me finish my answer to the noble lord lord underhill then they may have the opportunity of laughing or not laughing <e> <s> the value of the company is what the assets can be made to earn and the company has on average made a loss of million a year for some years <e> <s> it made profits in only and and then they were of only million and million <e> <s> against those facts we believe with the advice we have had that this is a fair price <e> <s> there is no question here of handing over profitable parts of british rail at a knock-down price <e> <s> i have said that sealink is not generally profitable and was the only profitable year in the last five <e> <s> i said that to the noble lord lord underhill in response to a question that he asked in your lordships house as recently as april this year <e> <s> in terms of the railway boards external financing limit which includes total investment in leased assets as well as cash requirements sealink has accounted for well over million since <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly the sale includes the harbours <e> <s> again as i said in april it was the intention of british rail to sell sealink as a complete unit and that of course includes the harbours <e> <s> sea containers limited is registered in bermuda but it has its group head office in london <e> <s> it has interests in hong kong and in new york <e> <s> the new company british ferries is however registered in london and therefore the subsidiary company operating sealink is london registered <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord mottistone for his acceptance of the statement <e> <s> we have always believed that to transfer sealink from british rail to the private sector would give sealink the advantage of freedom from certain elements of bureaucracy which of course occur in nationalised industries and i expect that the flexibility to which my noble friend referred will be evidenced very shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that the assets were worth half of what british rail stated in their accounts <e> <s> what i said was that market value judged them to be less than the amount which british rail had in their accounts <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the interest that the noble lord the leader of the opposition has in this matter particularly his interest in the principality <e> <s> i am quite sure that he will recall that he raised some of these questions before in april and he will no doubt also recall that there is no question of any acquiring company being able to dispose of the harbours <e> <s> all of the harbours are set up under statute and legislation would have to be enacted for the sale of the harbours <e> <s> there is no question therefore of the harbours being sold separately <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether i have understood correctly the question asked by the noble lord the leader of the opposition <e> <s> if i have not understood him correctly i hope he will interrupt me <e> <s> the whole of the group of seven harbours could be sold jointly but certainly not separately <e> <s> it would certainly be against the interests of any ferry-operating company to do so because of the long-term contracts and the legal obligations which hang upon the operation of those ports <e> <s> i hope my answer has made the position clear <e>", "<cs> my lords that is absolutely right <e>", "<cs> i believe i am right in saying that the provision would be written into a number of harbours acts <e> <s> if i am wrong i shall certainly write to the noble lord but if i am right i shall not <e>", "<cs> my lords the total value of imports of domestic electrical appliances from st january to st march was million <e> <s> the total value of imports of toys was million for the same period <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his reference to rospa and of course i am glad to confirm his interest in their work <e> <s> i am sorry i have no knowledge of the page item to which he referred but i shall look into it <e> <s> but i do have some knowledge of the rubber ring which was the subject of the thats life programme last weekend <e> <s> the departments safety unit has looked into this matter and we feel that there is no case here for banning that particular item <e> <s> however as regards all childrens toys particularly beach toys or toys that are used in swimming baths or in the sea one would look for a great deal of parental supervision <e>", "<cs> my lords toys and other electrical products come from countries right across the world <e> <s> it would be difficult to single out any particular one <e> <s> but the safety unit in the department is made aware of such cases and acts very quickly as of course do the trading standards officers who have the responsibility under the various consumer protection acts <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point that the noble lord lord mulley makes but i very much regret that i do not have those figures as the subject of the export of toys is rather wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the problem is urgent but as the noble lord lord ennals will know only a number of goods are regulated <e> <s> most of the goods to which my noble friends question refers are non-regulated goods <e> <s> therefore until we alter our regulations and that is the whole purpose of the white paper it is difficult to impose controls at the point of entry as distinct from the selling point which is the responsibility of the trading standards officers <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord leatherland will observe i have no knowledge of razors <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble baroness for that information <e> <s> i did not know of that particular factory but i am very glad to hear what she

this year compared with in april an increase of per cent <e> <s> in the first four months of there were visits per cent <e> <s> higher than in the same period last year <e>", "<cs> my lords because of the diversity of the tourist industry there are problems in establishing an accurate figure but it is estimated that tourism provides about million jobs some per cent <e> <s> more than the mechanical engineering sector and about the same as the construction industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly cannot agree with the noble lord in that assertion <e> <s> many factors affect the level of incoming visitors <e> <s> they include such factors as world economics and exchange rates but more particularly our ability to provide good value for money for the goods and services which the tourist wants to buy <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i have a breakdown of visitors <e> <s> in <e> <s> per cent <e> <s> came from north america per cent <e> <s> from the european community per cent <e> <s> from other western european states and from the rest of the world per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first four months of there were visits <e>", "<cs> my lords i would think that there would be a distinct difference and i cannot tell the noble lord what that difference might be <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be a refreshing change but one has to consider that tourism makes a considerable contribution to our balance of trade <e> <s> in fact billion were earned last year in tourism from foreign visitors <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> noble lords will of course realise that my noble friend being chairman of the historic buildings commission has himself made a great impact in the area of tourism <e> <s> in so far as his last point is concerned yes certainly there are fringe effects from tourism in regard to other jobs and job creation <e> <s> there are probably another half-a-million people employed in that kind of area <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i cannot tell the noble baroness in detail about amenities but the english tourist board take an interest in this area <e> <s> they have produced a number of books and booklets which have a wide distribution <e> <s> in addition both the english tourist board and the british tourist association support the holiday care service and they have also produced an information booklet which is distributed through the international offices of that organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords any exchange whether for holidays vacations or tourism that leads to a better understanding of the peoples of different nations must have an overall benefit <e> <s> i quite agree with the noble lord lord diamond <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer the first question of the noble lord lord ezra without notice but english tourism in great britain last year provided billion worth of revenue to the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be for the convenience of the house if with the leave of the house i now repeat a statement being

endorse the remarks of the noble lord lord taylor to my noble friend lord king and echo those remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft motor vehicles tyres safety regulations laid before the house on th june be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lords lord underhill and lord beaumont of whitley for their reception of these draft regulations <e> <s>

highways capital expenditure of more than local importance <e>", "<cs> my lords the association of county councils the association of metropolitan authorities the glc the london boroughs association

adjustment when tsg is related to capital only that is if the proposals contained in the white paper about which the consultations are currently taking place go ahead <e> <s> there will be an adjustment <e> <s> we can see no difficulty in working out an adequate formula for adjusting for both maintenance and other matters which would perhaps previously have been contained in tsg but will

grimond for so carefully and clearly describing the purpose of his amendment <e> <s> i do not think that the amendment is necessary and i will i hope be able briefly to suggest to him why it is not <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> the agencys functions under the act are specifically geared to cooperative activity <e> <s> the amendment which the noble lord lord grimond has explained to us would seriously widen those functions <e> <s> we should not like to see the agency operate in this way because the amendment would enable the agency to train persons not involved in the co-operative movement perhaps i could describe them as the maybes <e> <s> if the agency were given these powers they could we believe divert it very seriously from its main task of advising people directly concerned with the co-operative movement <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the three noble lords who have knocked on the door may find the door closed <e> <s> the government really cannot accept this amendment <e> <s> in the first place the amendment will allow the agency to carry out any commercial activity whatever <e> <s> i am advised that the power to carry out commercial activities would almost certainly be regarded by the courts as being limited to activities within the functions set out in section of the act <e> <s> this bill amends section of the act by removing the prohibitions on the agency undertaking commercial activity and forming partnerships <e> <s> but in doing that it omits sections and of that act <e> <s> section starts by saying <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for allowing me to intervene although of course we are in committee so that we can do all sorts of things that we all agree to do <e> <s> perhaps i have misled noble lords <e> <s> if i have then i of course apologise <e> <s> i do not think that i said that the agency would engage with the local authorities <e> <s> i do not think that the section point arises <e> <s> i will look at it as the noble lord will but if i did give that impression it was not my intention to do so <e> <s> perhaps i might have run other things together <e>", "<cs> yes but not any commercial activities <e>", "<cs> i think that i have described them as those that flow from the functions as distinct from for example operating a ferry-boat <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very interesting view but one with which of course i could not agree <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington would not expect me to agree <e> <s> let me say however that i do agree with the noble baroness lady nicol when she says that there was widespread support in this house for the cda <e> <s> there is widespread support for it in this house in this government and in the country at large <e> <s> of that we can be quite sure and it is for this reason it is for exactly the opposite reason to the one set out by the noble lord lord bruce of donington that under this bill we propose to allow the cda i have written down to grow up to throw off the shackles <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington laughs <e> <s> for the first time there are six years of continuity in the operations of the cda there are six years of funding there is the opportunity of commercial activity there is the freedom to engage in activities and to charge for them there is the freedom to charge for the services and there is the freedom to become self-supporting <e> <s> that is quite a release <e>", "<cs> when we look at <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wilson of langside may feel that this is an absurd notion it may be absurd to him this afternoon but it is an option which should never be ruled out <e> <s> may i however perhaps return a little more seriously to this matter <e> <s> i must emphasise that we have no plans to close down the agency <e> <s> i have said this in a variety of ways on a number of occasions during the progress of this bill <e> <s> we are anxious to give it time to get on with the job in hand because we recognise and i have admitted this to the noble lord lord graham on a number of occasions the importance of the job that they have to do <e> <s> we want to demonstrate to all concerned that it should be regarded as permanent and our commitment to funding for six years will give the agency a far longer period of security than it has previously enjoyed <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful again to the noble lord lord grimond for explaining his amendment <e> <s> i make just a brief apology to the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside as i inadvertently referred to him incorrectly when i addressed myself to his remarks on a previous amendment <e> <s> i apologise for that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is most generous <e>", "<cs> i understand what the noble lord lord grimond means when he refers to the term work in progress but as we see it the wording of the amendment again the noble lord said that he perhaps did not have it quite right as it appears on the marshalled list is <e>", "<cs> let me start by disabusing the noble baroness lady nicol <e> <s> there is no shadow hanging over the cda unless it is one that noble <e>", "<cs> of course i am going to be helpful <e> <s> i understand exactly what the noble lord lord graham and the noble baroness lady nicol say <e> <s> i appreciate that there are some very good cooperative homes for the surplus to go to <e> <s> however if you remove the discretion of the secretary of state which this amendment would do it would also remove his discretion to apply monies received from non-governmental origins for purposes corresponding with the agencys functions <e> <s> i do not believe that that is the intention of noble lords <e> <s> so i say which i believe is helpful and should be encouraging to the co-operative movement that the secretary of state has a discretion to apply non-governmental monies for purposes corresponding with the agencys functions <e> <s> if you accept the amendment you remove the secretary of states discretion <e>", "<cs> this evening we have had a very interesting debate on part ii of this bill <e> <s> it is quite obvious certainly to my noble friends and myself and i suspect to other members of your lordships committee that the intention of amendments nos <e> <s> and and the intention to oppose clause and schedule standing part of the bill is purely to wreck this part of the bill <e> <s> they are designed to do no more than ensure that the proposed rdg provisions cannot be implemented <e> <s> they are purely and simply a recipe for a maintenance of the present standpoint <e>", "<cs> i shall again try to do it briefly <e> <s> it contains of course the substance of the rdg provisions <e> <s> new paragraph in schedule puts the new rdg scheme on to a project basis <e> <s> at present rdg is solely as asset-based scheme my noble <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne has really made quite clear the purpose of his amendment <e> <s> it is to negate the assurance that the government have given in the white paper <e> <s> as i shall invite your lordships to reject the amendment i think that perhaps it would be as well if i gave some explanation as to why <e>", "<cs> i do not want to appear at all frivolous but i think that if i said to the noble lord lord grimond yes to the question contained in his first amendment plant includes vessels and yes to his second question that services are also included i would probably satisfy him <e> <s> i assure him that i would be quite happy to give all the information in a letter to him but as he did suggest that his amendment was a probing one then possibly the peripheral explanation as to how this comes about may not be necessary and he may possibly be happy <e>", "<cs> my lords when it is fully in operation in may of next year the consumer credit act will provide more comprehensive and effective protection than existing legislation in the whole field of consumer credit <e> <s> we cannot yet speak from experience of the operation of the act as a whole but we are satisfied that those provisions which have been in force for some time do provide more extensive protection than their counterparts in the moneylenders act <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed i am aware of the comments which the director general of fair trading has made in this connection <e> <s> however the problem is not one of inadequate legislative protection but rather that the victims of unscrupulous moneylenders have either been unaware of the protection available in law or unwilling to come forward and seek help <e> <s> the noble lord will probably be aware that the provisions that will come into force in may of next year include those on the form and content of documentation which provide for a number of matters to be included in the contract <e> <s> when that is done there will certainly be provision for a wrongful debt or interest charge to be set aside by the court <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no gap in the provision because until the other provisions of the consumer credit act come into force in may of next year those parts of the moneylenders act remain on the statute book <e> <s> but certainly we are quite sure that there will be greater protection when those remaining provisions come into force <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very well aware of what underlies the question of the noble lord lord molloy <e> <s> the director general of fair trading has in recent weeks given a good deal of publicity to this matter <e> <s> the greatest difficulty is really one of human nature <e> <s> the option open to a borrower not to pay the debt so that he is taken to court can plead his case and may have an unfair contract set aside is one which has very few attractions for most borrowers <e> <s> certainly i take the point that the noble lord makes with regard to publicity <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the weights and measures act miscellaneous foods order which was laid before your lordships house on th july be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon for his acceptance of these quite important orders <e> <s> i am glad to know that he can see no difficulty here <e> <s> i am also grateful to my noble friend lord mottistone whose interest in the food business when wearing another hat is well known to us all <e> <s> i had not realised that the right reverend prelate as the undissolved abbot of saint benets actually sailed down the river enjoying the biscuits the cheese and the other foodstuffs which are the subject-matter of the orders before us this evening <e> <s> equally of course i am grateful to him for his general support for them <e> <s> they are indeed important orders in that they regulate matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord stoddart for his reception of what i said about these regulations and for having given me notice that there were one or two issues which worried him <e> <s> he was worried about the authority which the trading standards officers have <e> <s> the restriction on the institution of proceedings in regulation applies only to prosecutions for breaches of regulation which provides that <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be happy to find out whether there are any statistics i confess that i do not have the answer at my fingertips and let the noble lord know <e> <s> let me end with this remark <e> <s> the home-based industry and all those who are engaged in this business have cooperated in helping us to formulate the regulations albeit they are based on european commission legislation <e> <s> whatever may perhaps have given rise to concern in the past will i hope not give rise to the same kind of concern in the future <e>", "<cs> it is not a ministerial responsibility to answer questions about donations to the conservative party <e> <s> information on any political donation of more than will be found in the directors report in the companys published accounts <e>", "<cs> further consultation is necessary before a decision is made on the question of remuneration for owners of copyright in material copied on cassettes <e> <s> the government are therefore now preparing a consultative document on the matter of a levy on blank video and audio tapes <e>", "<cs> my lords let me say at the outset that i do not think there is really any very great difference between the governments intentions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for making that clear <e> <s> i need not pursue that at all <e> <s> i recognise exactly the concern that the noble lord lord graham and others have expressed in support of the amendment <e> <s> but i think that all noble lords who have spoken harbour some doubts about the effect of the bill and its ability to empower the agency to carry out this commercial activity which we all so want and of course to apply its profit from such commercial activity towards any of its functions <e> <s> i believe that this concern is groundless <e> <s> i cannot emphasise enough that once this bill before us is enacted it will clearly empower the agency to act in a commercial manner if it so wishes but only in the course of carrying out its prime functions <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord graham would credit me with being less nave than to accept all he has carefully dressed up in the requote of what i said on earlier occasions <e> <s> he knows very well that this amendment will totally prevent the secretary of state or his appointed minister from using any winding up power <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understood it with the agreement of the noble lords opposite we are taking no <e> <s> and no <e> <s> together but no <e> <s> is not to be moved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am again grateful to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton for having explained so clearly the purpose of these amendments <e> <s> i am also grateful to him for agreeing to take nos <e> <s> and together <e> <s> it appears from what he has said that the basic design is to separate the agencys funds in the event of a winding up so that the moneys obtained by the agency other than grants from the secretary of state could only be used to meet liabilities entered into with respect to the moneys or for purposes corresponding with the functions of the agency <e> <s> i think this is probably a point introduced here to cover that which we discussed in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords if i did not know the noble lord lord bruce of donington better i might easily be prevailed upon to give the undertaking for which he asks but he does not expect me to do that and i think that his was a rhetorical question <e> <s> in his opening remarks that friday afternoon in the early summer when we had the second reading of this bill he asked me why it was necessary to have this bill why there was undue haste and why the matter was being debated on a friday <e> <s> i told him that it was because this bill provides for the detail of the new scheme to be set by order <e> <s> i explained that it was necessary to get this enabling legislation through so that funding for the agency could continue <e> <s> in fact it is only because officials in my department <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord grimond for his introduction of the amendment <e> <s> certainly i made it clear in committee that the term plant includes vessels <e> <s> therefore any vessels including coastal vessels can be eligible for grant if the other requirements of the scheme can be satisfied <e> <s> that perhaps is the stumbling block <e> <s> it is the other requirements which will determine whether or not a grant is payable <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e> <s> page leave out line and insert the date when expenditure was first defrayed on the provision of any asset comprised in the project <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot resist the temptation to respond to such a simple question <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will not press me too far when i say that the answer is later this year <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bruce of donington opened his remarks this evening by saying that he had a declaration to make <e> <s> it might be fair if i took a leaf out of that notebook and said that perhaps i should remind your lordships that for many years i was engaged in the motor industry <e> <s> it is some years since i was practising in the industry but it is only fair to remind your lordships of that fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that it will be open to the public on saturday <e> <s> there will be plenty of publicity about the number of cars per worker productivity and so on <e> <s> nevertheless may i remind your lordships that car production in the united kingdom across all the united kingdom manufacturers increased considerably by something approaching per cent <e> <s> last year and was at its highest level since <e> <s> those motor-cars designed and built in this country and those designed elsewhere and built in this country have received a far wider and greater acceptance than for many years <e> <s> given this improving performance it would be a very serious matter if the block exemption were to impose rigid price controls which created difficulties for british manufacturers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am inclined to say in reply to my noble friend lord bethell because there is honour among thieves <e> <s> why not <e> <s> seriously it is because the obligation of a manufacturer to his dealer and the commission recognises the value of the dealer-manufacturer relationship is to supply a motor-car to the order of a customer and not some spurious conjured-up customer who might become a customer <e> <s> that is why not <e> <s> in more serious terms <e> <s> as i say that is the manufacturers obligation <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not comment <e> <s> i took note <e> <s> indeed all noble lords in the house tonight would have taken note of what the noble lord lord bruce of donington said <e> <s> i did not feel that i could add anything to the motion before us in commenting upon that <e> <s> since the noble lord asks me specifically i certainly give him an undertaking and an assurance with regard to the first part of his twofold question that we shall take note of what he said and to see what should or could be done <e>", "<cs> my lords our understanding is that the dutch authorities are still considering support for the fokker bid for this contract but that it has not yet been offered <e> <s> i cannot accept that our inability to provide aid for the bae contract will necessarily make fewer jobs available as the success of the is manifest in orders from america and other places <e> <s> nor do i feel that there is necessarily any loss of prestige <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give no assurance that the government will look again at their decision in regard to this matter <e> <s> the noble lord should remember that in the event of fokker obtaining the contract there would be a considerable united kingdom element in the building of that aircraft in that rolls-royce provide the engines short brothers provide the wings and other united kingdom companies also provide parts of the aeroplane <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said that we are not prepared to reconsider this matter <e> <s> there is no question of matching or mismatching <e> <s> the application for support under the aid and trade provision has to satisfy various commercial industrial and developmental criteria <e> <s> in this case the costs of support and competing claims on funds made it impossible for my right honourable friend the minister to agree that this was a right and proper use of those funds <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand what the noble lord has said although i do not know whether i would quite agree with all the inferences contained in his remarks <e> <s> but certainly he will recall that since april we have pledged an allocation of some million worth of developmental assistance to that country with which we have good relations <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for this government to tell the zimbabwean government exactly how it should attend to its internal affairs <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am not saying that <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend will recall british aerospace was returned to the private sector in <e> <s> it has continued to be a very highly successful company in world aerospace markets and in part that is no doubt due to attending to those matters to which my noble friend has drawn attention <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i do not deny the substance of what the noble lord says but in this instance the government did not consider that the likely commercial and developmental benefits justified the aid that was sought <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had explained this matter <e> <s> indeed the letter which my right honourable friend the minister of state wrote to the noble lord lord hatch of lusby on nd october stated that very careful consideration was being given to this application by all departments of state <e> <s> i said quite clearly that on this occasion my right honourable friend the minister had not found sufficient evidence to justify that expenditure being made <e> <s> i do not accept that the repercussions which the noble lord lord hatch of lusby puts forward are in fact as obvious as he would perhaps make out <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to respond to the noble baroness and indeed to the noble lord lord beswick <e> <s> i can only say again and this must be the fifth or sixth time that i have sought to reassure your lordships on the intention of the government with regard to the co-operative development agency that we have provided funding for six years we have recently appointed a new board and we have sought to meet the requirements of the agency in opening its functions and its activities <e>", "<cs> my lords i know of nothing in the bill that gives any kind of direction to the agency as to what they shall include in their report <e> <s> if we accept the amendment then we impose upon them an obligation to do certain things <e> <s> it is an obligation which they may not wish under certain circumstances <e> <s> i have sought to describe one of them the property deal <e> <s> i think that the noble baroness and her noble friends are being unduly sensitive about this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that i should respond very briefly <e> <s> i am obliged to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe for his comments particularly on part i of the bill <e> <s> the government firmly believe that the co-operative form of enterprise has a potential and will contribute quite significantly to the creation of new businesses and jobs <e> <s> we recognise the important role of the cda and i can say no more about that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by congratulating the noble lord lord obrien and indeed the select committee as a whole on the wealth of information they have managed to pack into what is as the noble lord lord bruce of donington has said a most interesting and informative report <e> <s> at this time perhaps i may also thank all noble lords who have taken part in the debate this afternoon which has made it most interesting <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell my noble friend that i am not aware of the anomaly with regard to the french to which he drew my attention <e> <s> the arrangements in force under the berne union of export credit insurers as with the oecd sector agreements ensure that there are similar if not totally equal credit terms throughout the community <e> <s> as for my noble friends question about the french sale of grain i am sure that he knows better than i do that this years record grain surplus in the united kingdom has posed a totally new problem <e> <s> i can say that her majestys government are looking at that problem in isolation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure whether the noble lord is referring to export licences or to acceptance of credit loan arrangements through the ecgd <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the timescale that the noble lord has instanced is the exception rather than the rule <e> <s> but if he has in mind a particular example i should be happy to look into it for him <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord possibly misunderstood me <e> <s> grain exports are normally guaranteed to a length of days <e> <s> there have been exceptions to that for example the two-year term which was given in the case of a shipment of grain to morocco <e> <s> normally other hard goods if i may call them that qualify for longer periods of credit <e>", "<cs> my lords the likely saving of such storage costs is one factor which the government are taking into account in considering the representations which have been made and to which i alluded in my earlier answer with regard to the exceptional surplus this season <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i cannot leave aside the agricultural issue since that is exactly the question on the order paper <e> <s> it is a connected question about the export credits and ensuring that british agricultural exports are not disadvantaged so i cannot leave that aside <e> <s> i would however remind the noble lord that the ecgd is required to operate on a commercial basis <e> <s> consequently ordinary commercial considerations have to be taken into account <e> <s> on his last point i fear that i cannot agree with his suggestion that the ecgds attitude leaves something to be desired <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the government have any misunderstanding as to what is the problem <e> <s> the government and my department are of course always happy to discuss with anybody whether an agricultural union the nfu or engineering businesses any problems that they may have over exports <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his intervention <e> <s> i think that the house would expect me to say that of course i broadly agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords in my answer earlier i said that there were a series of understandings within the berne union <e> <s> i did not say that there were laws or rules <e> <s> there are understandings and notices given with regard to terms as between one partner and another but the general criteria remain basically the same <e> <s> in so far as the export of aeroplanes to zimbabwe is concerned i think that i answered that question a short while ago <e> <s> concerning the other export matter of british aerospace s i very much regret to have to tell the noble lord that i cannot help him this afternoon <e>", "<cs> in monetary terms my lords no <e> <s> the export of agricultural products is around million <e> <s> it is a very small percentage less than per cent <e> <s> of our total exports in hard goods <e>", "<cs> my lords the policy with regard to support given by ecgd remains broadly the same as it has done for a number of years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for drawing the attention of the house to this matter of french beef exports <e> <s> what i can say is that through the association we have with our partners in europe to which i have earlier referred i will certainly cause investigation to be made <e> <s> obviously i cannot prejudge the result of such an investigation but if i may i will take the opportunity of writing to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords what i am saying and confirm to the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos is that through the understandings which we have through the berne union and through other organisations to which i have referred there is parity there is agreement as to the credit terms and charges that are generally levied as between one and another <e> <s> having said that there is also an understanding that where one country departs from the strict criteria notice is usually given <e> <s> we have no knowledge that a departure from the agreed terms has occurred in recent times in relation either to grain or to beef <e> <s> however i have given an assurance that we will look at the specific point that my noble friend raised in his supplementary question a moment or two ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my original reply gave an answer to the question which the noble lord originally asked which was about goods and services i gave the latest available figures for goods and services <e> <s> for goods alone there is an estimated deficit of million for the current account as a whole <e> <s> that represents a million deficit on our trade in goods <e> <s> it would be wrong to take one month in isolation from others <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat that in his original question the noble lord asked about the trade balance in goods and services for september <e> <s> i will repeat my original answer <e> <s> the latest estimate of our trade balance in goods and services is for the second quarter of this year when there was a deficit of million <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord beswick may recall that in the autumn statement my right honourable friend the chancellor <e>", "<cs> no my lords that is not the position <e> <s> all our exports contribute to the overall balance <e> <s> last year billion worth that is two-thirds of all visible exports were in manufactured goods <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hatch of lusby quite wrongly accuses me of trying to dodge the question <e> <s> i do not believe that the noble lord could ever justly accuse me of attempting to dodge any question he may address to me <e> <s> the large deficit exceptional for the month of september is due in the main to two reasons <e> <s> first there was the bringing forward of imports to beat the november accelerated vat deadline which had a lot to do with it <e> <s> secondly there was the impact of the miners strike <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the noble lord himself who is confusing the issue <e> <s> he speaks of goods and services and then moves on to talk about the current account as a whole <e> <s> the current account as a whole is projected to have been in deficit by million in september <e> <s> that is represented by a million planned deficit on trade in goods and a projected i say projected million surplus on invisible transactions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lord peyton <e> <s> having suffered at the hands of adversaries in the past perhaps he recognises the experience very sharply <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend and i sought to explain that point in my earlier answers to supplementary questions <e> <s> nevertheless as my noble friend will be aware there has been a significant increase in our exports of manufactures over the past to months <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to have been able to thank the noble lord <e> <s> lord bruce for his acceptance of the statement that i have just read but i can perhaps thank him for the latter part of his remarks <e> <s> i thank the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe for his reception of the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for his welcome for this statement <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to him for pointing out that now there is a much greater element of selectivity which should enable those astute enough to read the rule book as it were greatly to benefit <e> <s> that selectivity will <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i thank the noble lord lord sefton for his contribution <e> <s> i agree that one part of regional grant policy was to equalise particularly job opportunities <e> <s> we think that in this plan we are in fact going to do just that <e> <s> since the unemployment rates for the new map as at july just a few months ago were produced the new development areas have within them a per cent <e> <s> unemployment factor <e> <s> the intermediate areas have a per cent <e> <s> unemployment factor as against great britain as a whole with an unemployment factor of per cent <e> <s> the noble lord will see that on the map the merseyside area is in the main in most of the ttwas designated a development area <e> <s> one would certainly expect industry to take advantage of the opportunities that are open to them under the new regional policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i understood the noble lord lord sefton <e> <s> however as he has repeated his question i must say to him that i do not accept that the regional policies over the past years have failed to achieve their objective <e> <s> but i am prepared to accept that they have not been per cent <e> <s> plus successful <e> <s> i thought that when i answered him previously i gave the noble lord the assurance for which he asked <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i recognise the concern of the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos for the situation in the principality <e> <s> but i have to tell him that the coverage of the new map really is quite fair as between the different parts of great britain <e> <s> it would be wrong to attempt to compare the new map with the old map because that really is another matter <e> <s> the noble lord asked me how we could contemplate cutting million from regional aid at this time <e> <s> i must tell him that we are not cutting as at this time million from the aid programme that is the anticipated saving as at because those savings which we hope to achieve will come about as the scheme gets under way <e> <s> the transitional provisions until really mean that a good deal more money will be spent because both the old scheme and the new one will overlap <e> <s> we believe that even at that time million of regional aid more properly distributed and spread and becoming more cost-effective will mean that we are more likely to achieve that which we have set out than would have been the case under the old scheme which was costing some million <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i had better amplify what i said with regard to the per cent <e> <s> and the per cent <e> <s> the capital grant rate remains at per cent <e> <s> in the development areas although of course having reduced the scheme from a three-tier scheme to a two-tier scheme we have taken off the special development area <e> <s> it was only the special development area which enjoyed the per cent <e> <s> rate <e>", "<cs> my lords no i am not aware of that and i think that the noble lord is rather misrepresenting either what my officials said or what i have said <e> <s> i wonder whether the house will forgive me if i correct one part of the answer which i gave to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter when he asked me about hotels and tourism receiving grants <e> <s> the hotel industry would not normally receive grant through the regional development grant programme but it does benefit from section of the tourism act <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that in fact the noble lord lord wade is quite wrong this has nothing whatever to do with equality of suffering <e> <s> this is a redistribution of funds to place those funds where in the light of that suffering it is thought best that aid could be given <e> <s> it provides much greater opportunity for industry both manufacturing and the service industries to locate in areas where there is the greatest suffering <e> <s> there is a capital

answer questions and i shall answer the question asked by the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> i do not accept anything that the noble lord lord diamond has said <e> <s> last tuesday night i was in helsinki speaking to a group of scandinavian bankers and top businessmen about the investment opportunities in the united kingdom <e> <s> i was able to tell them something about the plans which were outlined in the white paper <e> <s> from their reception of my remarks i received very great encouragement <e> <s> i do not believe that this policy will be reflected in any reduction in inward

aspect <e> <s> this point has been made on numerous occasions <e> <s> when my noble friend lord swinton replied in march of last year to a debate in your lordships house he spoke of the importance for

baroness for that information <e> <s> the council will have to send me a copy of those figures because i can assure her i do not have them <e> <s> we are quite optimistic about continuing improvements

looking ahead if they can contain costs and make savings in certain areas caretaking and cleaning are two that quickly come to mind then there is scope within the governments plans for local authority expenditure on education in for more to be spent on books per pupil compared with even the levels <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall come to the price of books and i believe that i shall be able to contain the question asked by the noble lord in my comments then <e> <s> i was going on to say that it had to be seen also against a background of the libraries purchasing power due to the relatively high level of inflation in book prices compared with the general retail price index <e> <s> this has been particularly noticeable in the case of some very specialised material <e>", "<cs> my lords let me give my noble friend a double assurance <e> <s> both my right honourable friends will be made aware of the noble lords feelings in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the interchange of question and answer between the noble baroness and my noble friend <e> <s> i do not think that i can agree with her that no progress has been made <e> <s> for example progress was made on advertising <e> <s> some progress has been made on doorstep selling although some matters are still outstanding <e> <s> the noble baroness is more aware than perhaps i am because with a number of countries involved these matters take what appears to us to be a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords since the fixing of a meeting is for the presidency and as i do not have the ear of the presidency i am unable to answer that question <e>", "<cs> my lords the draft directive on misleading advertising was adopted on th september <e> <s> member states have until st october to implement this directive <e> <s> my right honourable friend is having consultations with interested parties in relation to the method whereby the united kingdom will implement the directive <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that it is intended that this shall be by giving the director-general of fair trading further powers <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i am not being obtuse but so far as i am aware we have one directive and that is the directive on misleading advertising <e> <s> it may have a longer title such as unfair and misleading but i know of no other draft directive on the subject matter of advertising <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not contest the figures of the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> i did not know that there were that many draft directives on innumerable affairs since the original question was on consumer affairs <e> <s> i regret that i cannot make further comment on the others <e> <s> as for drawing the attention of my right honourable friend the prime minister to this matter i have no doubt that her private office will have their attention drawn to it by virtue of the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords may i start by echoing what other noble lords and noble and learned lords have said in their remarks this evening and congratulate the noble and learned lord lord scarman and his committee on the preparation of this report <e> <s> the noble and learned lord introduced the

which the noble lord has addressed to me <e> <s> he also spent some minutes describing to your lordships how he saw the case and the proceedings <e> <s> although he told me that he was going to bring this matter up i certainly do not think it is my function to stand on the opposite side of the chamber and make detailed comments on what he was told and on what papers were put before him that have not been before me <e> <s> i am not a lawyer and i do not feel that your lordships house tonight debating a motion to accept a report of a select committee is the vehicle in which the hasselblad case should be discussed <e> <s> if the noble lord will just let me finish i shall be happy to give way i do not think that this is either the time or the place <e> <s> i do not think that in this debate we should discuss hasselblad the commission and the european court within the context of this motion <e> <s> if the noble lord will permit and i say this with great deference and if he is desirous of

donington <e> <s> let me say straight away that i would be the last to suggest that anybody should have the right to speak in your lordships house removed other than of course for a breach of our conventions <e> <s> i made my remarks within the context of my answer to the noble lord lord shackleton who asked me why not <e> <s> and i gave him the reasons why i was not prepared <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not in fact say that <e> <s> what i did say was that as to whether there were some questionable features about the commissions handling of the competition case we are considering whether to make representations to them <e> <s> that is what i said <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it would be helpful to the house if i said that that recommendation has not been fully implemented although a hearing officer is now required to hear all oral evidence in cases <e> <s> that will ensure that the rights of defendants if i may use that expression are properly heard <e> <s> it does not go all the way to the recommendation but certainly it is a move in the right direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords who have responded to the repetition of the statement <e> <s> i shall first deal with the point made by the noble lord lord bruce of donington who suggested that the shares had been under-priced <e> <s> i make three points in reply to that charge <e> <s> the house will recognise that there is likely to be a great difference between the price at which a holding of shares can be sold and the price at which a substantial shareholding can be sold <e> <s> the noble lord would be mistaken if he assumed that todays premium whatever that premium might be would be obtainable to all sellers if a great number of shares were on the market <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lord nugent of guildford for those very encouraging words <e> <s> i thank him very much for them <e> <s> we totally endorse what he says <e> <s> we believe this to be a very satisfactory launch and it is the biggest of its kind in the world <e> <s> it is interesting to note that the bulk of the applicants about two-thirds of them have opted to take the bonus share

further wider ownership of shares by individuals <e> <s> that is part of our policy <e> <s> we believe that when people have a stake in various companies particularly in those in which they work those companies will be viable and prosper more quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i have answered the noble lords question generally <e> <s> i take his first point of course that the price of the shares can go up or it can go down <e> <s> we believe that british telecom has a very fine future in front of it <e> <s> with per cent <e> <s> of its employees making their own contribution to their

pounc figures from which the noble baroness probably reaches her conclusion refer to august and september of this year where certainly the performance was below the target which the post office itself sets <e> <s> i can tell the noble lady that between october and november of this year the figures are impressively better and fall very little short of the target of per cent <e> <s> delivery on

cnd have cooperated with the post office in investigating their complaint and have found that while the service was not all that could be desired there was nothing wrongful in the terms in which the noble lord posed his question <e>", "<cs> my lords there are mechanical letter offices in use now <e> <s> it is hoped that the remaining number of will be in use by the end of <e> <s> it is estimated that then there will be an improvement to the target that the post office have set <e> <s> however i should remind my noble friend that there are some million letters sent per year something like to million per day <e> <s> to achieve a delivery rate figure of per cent <e> <s> of the target is quite a considerable achievement <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot tell the noble viscount lord hanworth exactly why but i understand there are certain security constrictions with regard to what goes into telephone directories <e>", "<cs> my lords the checking is done by sampling methods <e>", "<cs> my lords the misdirection and loss of mail is ofter caused by undecipherable writing on envelopes and packages <e> <s> there are postmen who have the job of reading these <e> <s> it is perhaps no more than a matter of <e>", "<cs> my lords this is entirely a matter for the post office who run the operation <e> <s> i understand that information with regard to compensation is available in leaflet form

down a specific question i shall be in a position to reply to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the feeling that i think lies behind the question of the noble lord lord shinwell <e> <s> i very much share his sentiments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for that question <e> <s> i endorse what he says <e> <s> in answer specifically to his question yes we do have a postal service which by international comparative standards is extremely high on the list although the noble lord will appreciate that comparisons are not always exact <e> <s> the post office will have an enormous task in the next few weeks <e> <s> i am glad that the noble lord gives me the opportunity to express the hope that those who serve us most days in snow ice fog and all inclement weather as well as in the sunshine are also able to do their job satisfactorily and to get away to their families to enjoy a happy christmas <e>", "<cs> my lords the government acknowledge that the results of the embargo are perhaps less than perfect but we must avoid setting precedents which would inevitably lead to the embargo being undermined <e> <s> such action would not assist in any way the governments primary objective of securing a fully reciprocal lifting of all remaining commercial and economic sanctions <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly was not aware of the matter raised in the first part of lord shinwells question <e> <s> the reality of the matter is that the falkland islands were invaded <e> <s> we wish to move to more normal relations with the argentine but we and the people of the falklands are entitled first to have it made clear that there is no further intention of hostilities <e> <s> we have made a number of efforts at reconciliation with regard to trade but the argentine have consistently and explicitly refused to give the confirmation for which we ask over that first matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not seen the letter to which the noble lord lord strabolgi refers <e> <s> but there is no question of growing up or not growing up <e> <s> students university and higher educational libraries have established direct import links with booksellers in the argentine and they are not affected by any embargo <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very well aware of the figures pertaining to our trade with the argentine before the outbreak of hostilities to which my noble friend lord montgomery refers <e> <s> so far as financial matters are concerned we have made some relaxation in order that the argentines debt rescheduling programme required by the imf may be encouraged and that thereby their own economy will also be encouraged <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble lord that the present arrangements have exactly the opposite effect to that which is intended <e> <s> unless i have misunderstood the noble lord the argentines may export individual books magazines and other publications to this country provided that they are not imported into this country for resale or trade or redistribution <e> <s> so there is no disadvantage to students and other institutions <e>", "<cs> my lords there is certainly a disadvantage to british booksellers but we also have to look at the wider aspects of our trade and while the argentine prohibits the import from the united kingdom of products other than those which they specifically need for their own national interest it would not be right that we should put our own people at a serious disadvantage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that my noble friend will take note of the exchanges that have occurred in the house this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i can understand the noble baronesss feelings with regard to the timescale in these matters <e> <s> perhaps to an extent i share them <e> <s> but of course it is important that the councils and the industries reach agreement because their togetherness as it were will enable the councils to work more profitably <e> <s> to that extent i can tell the noble baroness that we shall be urging both the councils and the industries to bring their discussions to an early conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is perhaps under a misapprehension in that the gas board has not yet announced any price changes <e> <s> i think the noble baroness is perhaps referring to newspaper reports both yesterday and today <e> <s> certainly the consumer councils will have been consulted with regard to price increases <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the grounds are quite simple the need to bring all prices particularly of public sector utilities into line with contemporary pricing and contemporary pricing is lying at about per cent <e> <s> of an inflation element <e> <s> that is the justification that i give the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e>", "<cs> my lords were we having a debate on this matter i could of course go further into it <e> <s> in fact the governments policies for containing subsidy and government expenditure recognise that prices in the public utilities which are in the public sector have to keep pace with other and general expenditures <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord lord bruce of donington rather stretches the imagination of most of your lordships <e> <s> the government do have a responsibility in respect of public sector companies in relation to general expenditure and to the levels of taxation that can be made <e> <s> as a result the government do fix rates of return borrowing limits and other matters which are in the public interest <e> <s> those matters are only one of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord lauderdale for his question <e> <s> i agree with him because that is one of the factors that have to be taken into consideration when fixing prices <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i misunderstood the noble baroness on that matter <e> <s> i understand the gas board are to make an announcement tomorrow <e> <s> but no announcement has so far been made so that any figure which may be in either the noble baronesss mind or noble lords minds is possibly derived from press reports <e> <s> i am not able to comment upon what announcement the board may make tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i answered that specific point in one of my earlier answers to the noble baronesss supplementary questions when i said that the council would have been consulted in regard to this matter as is normal for the consumers councils of these two industries <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is moving quite a long way from the noble baronesss original question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord lord winstanley has quite mis-interpreted what i said <e> <s> but as the noble lord knows only too well any matter for debate is a matter for the usual channels not for myself <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the noble lords first supplementary is concerned yes this was a precedent but mr macgregor was appointed because he was considered to be the best man for the job and the government see no reason to alter that view <e> <s> with regard to his chairmanship of british steel when he arrived there was a million loss for the year <e> <s> the preliminary results for that corporation for this first half year show a million profit <e> <s> that is indeed a success <e> <s> with regard to the point that the noble lord makes about this giving rise to conflict i have to tell him that we do not believe this to be so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord understands correctly <e> <s> there were no performance requirements in this appointment <e> <s> the million to which i referred was a once-and-for-all payment <e> <s> i understand that the then secretary of state for energy did not consider it appropriate that there should be performance criteria added <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lord nugent of guildford for putting so succintly in a series of questions to me exactly what the position is <e> <s> this damaging dispute has been sought and provoked by the leadership of the num who have imposed their will upon their membership without any ballot <e> <s> there is no justification whatsoever for the strike <e> <s> the present chairman of the national coal board has supervised <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with the noble lord in his reading of the situation <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that the leadership of the national union of mineworkers have said and they are on record as saying that they have no intention of coming to the negotiating table <e> <s> until such time as they do it would be quite wrong to put on the situation the connotation which the noble lord does in so far as mr macgregors leadership of that industry is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept for one moment that mr ian macgregor crucified the steel industry <e> <s> he brought the steel industry into profit and even in these difficult times the industry is producing all the steel that our home market requires <e> <s> so far as splitting mining communities is concerned it is not mr macgregor but their own leadership who have split those communities <e>", "<cs> my lords on the number of supplementary questions which the noble lord addressed to me may i remind him that successive select committees in another place have accepted that there had to be a per cent <e> <s> reduction in coal output <e> <s> mr macgregor was appointed to bring the industry into long-term future viability <e> <s> his plans for so doing would have given that opportunity <e> <s> the miners have had an extraordinary and unprecedented offer as i have said in terms of wages conditions redundancy and so on <e> <s> there has been no challenge whatsoever by mr macgregor to the procedures <e> <s> the challenge of course was through the leadership of the national union of mineworkers in that they did not ballot their members before declaring this strike <e> <s> that was the breach of procedure <e> <s> there is no truth whatsoever that mr macgregor undermined the potential negotiations which took place on th december when the trades union congress met my right honourable friend the secretary of state for energy <e> <s> there is no question either of the government being on any high horse <e> <s> the government remain <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in fact answering four questions <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state remains available to take part in any talks when the leadership of the national union of mineworkers come to the table with the realistic prospect of a successful negotiation and not the total denial which they have shown hitherto <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first of all to thank the nobe lord lord lloyd of hampstead for introducing this subject and remind the house that the noble lord was the moving force behind the establishment of the national film and television school and is of course one of its governors and also a member of the interim action committee on the film industry which is chaired as noble lords have pointed out by the noble lord lord wilson <e> <s> i have little doubt that his influence will still be felt

acceptance of my explanation and of course of the regulations before your lordships <e> <s> i appreciate and i am sure the house also appreciates the work which the noble and learned lord lord brightman does in regard to the joint committee on consolidation bills <e> <s> may i thank the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for his very kind remarks and say that i appreciate the point that he has raised because it was only late yesterday that the joint committee agreed that the new provision could be inserted into the consolidation bill provided of course that your lordships approve and i am quite optimistic that your lordships will these regulations <e> <s> in that case the regulations will become effective when they have received the approval of both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the noble lord lord kennet left out one figure and that was that over were found unmanned <e> <s> if the noble lord will allow me to continue i have something further to say about actually catching people <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the law no prosecution for aiding and abetting has ever been successful until the principal offence has been prosecuted and a conviction obtained <e> <s> when that offence is proven then the aiding and abetting can possibly be proved but until the principal case is charged and proved there is no possibility of aiding and abetting <e>", "<cs> my lords no i am not saying that there are no measures open to the government for taking the principal offender to court <e> <s> that has been done in a number of instances with land-based stations <e> <s> it is an impracticability to take an offshore station outside territorial waters to court <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington and the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe for their reception of the statement which i have just repeated <e> <s> there is no panic in the governments announcement <e> <s> we have as a matter of policy made it clear

days it was decided to make the statement today <e> <s> it is intended that the sale will probably be effected in the late spring or early summer that is very much dependent upon the market <e>",

is where the blocking mechanism would apply <e> <s> as regards the underlining of lord taylors question i understand that the chairman of british aerospace probably released a statement a short while ago in which he said that the company in seeking to raise further equity on the market is not intending to expand the equity capital by more than per cent <e> <s> of course i think one must accept that the amount of shares that the company offer and it will be a joint offer with our own as well is for the commercial consideration of the company <e> <s> it is a matter of convenience both to the company and indeed to the government that the sale of both those shares and the governments holding should be at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord morris for his questions <e> <s> in general yes the decision to dispose of the governments interests in the company accords with our general philosophy in that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord diamond has asked a number of questions <e> <s> first it is not necessary as i think my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter spelled out to control the company by necessarily having per cent <e> <s> of the shares

have not expressed myself very well <e> <s> what i am saying is that a director of a company which goes into voluntary liquidation does not necessarily escape the penalties that the director of a company going into compulsory liquidation or compulsory wind-up may face <e> <s> we may debate this further later but i hope that on reading what i have said the noble lord will appreciate the difference <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may start by thanking the noble lords lord bruce of donington and lord taylor of gryfe and my noble friend lord polwarth for their contributions to this rather short debate this evening <e> <s> i would endorse very much what my noble friend lord polwarth said in the early part of his remarks in consideration of what the noble lord lord bruce of

he does not wish to be persuaded <e> <s> in fact he has turned the argument completely round the wrong way to suit his own particular question <e> <s> i am resisting the temptation to debate that with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that anyone would quarrel with that <e> <s> my question perhaps a rhetorical one was rather more narrowly drawn <e> <s> the noble lord lord taylor said that if the convention did not apply he might seek to change the course of events this evening <e> <s> he said however that he was sorry <e> <s> i give the noble lord as i give my noble friend lord polwarth

administered in the past <e> <s> at present almost anyone can act as liquidator of a company or trustee of an individual <e> <s> being unqualified in an accountancy or legal profession or being even a convicted criminal holds no bar to these offices <e> <s> it is proposed that in future any person who acts as an insolvency practitioner must be qualified to act in accordance with the provisions contained in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee will recognise that it is desirable that the public should have trust in those who handle insolvencies and the proposed clause provides that a person is not qualified to act as an insolvency practitioner unless he has a certificate issued under clause authorising him to act <e> <s> however that is not sufficient in itself <e> <s> it is also essential that there are provisions to prohibit persons who are closely connected with a debtor or a company from acting as an insolvency practitioner <e> <s> accordingly clause provides that a person is not qualified to act as an insolvency practitioner in relation to a particular person if he or an associate of his and i am sure the noble lord accepts that he also means she is an associate of that person or is connected with that person in one way or another <e>", "<cs> notwithstanding the opening remarks of the noble lord lord prys-davies i am quite sure that the committee will enjoy the benefit of his experience over a wide field <e> <s> the noble lord will of course understand that i have not been and have never been involved in the legal profession and this afternoon i do not propose to debate with him the lineal descent point which he has outlined <e> <s> nor i must confess have i come prepared to debate clause which seemed to me to be about three or four days away from us this afternoon <e> <s> however as both the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran and the noble lord opposite have made the point quite forcefully i add to my earlier assurance a second assurance that at the same time we shall have a look at clause so that when we reach it we can find a larger measure of agreement than is obvious this afternoon <e>", "<cs> since an insolvency practitioner will be required to be licensed generally under the bill it would seem odd were a person who had been convicted of a serious fraud to find himself able to meet the fitness to practise conditions that would apply in the case of a licence <e> <s> i would suspect that there is provision to debar minors and those people of unsound mind although i understand that the law is not absolutely clear on this latter point <e> <s> however i shall be quite happy in the consideration of the detailed point which i have undertaken to give to consider the wider points <e>", "<cs> i do not think that this amendment is in fact necessary <e> <s> the clause applies when an unregistered company is wound up if it is unable to pay its debts that is in subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be for the convenience of the house if with the permission of the house i repeat a statement on financial services which is now being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful yes i am grateful to both the noble lord lord bruce of donington and the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe for their reception of the statement i have just repeated <e> <s> i find the noble lord lord bruce of donington extremely difficult to please would that i could please him more often <e> <s> he complains on the one hand that my noble friend the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster is too brief and he complains on the other that i was too painstaking in my reading of the statement <e> <s> it was a complex statement and i believed that it should be read carefully not only for the benefit of noble lords who have knowledge of these matters but also for the benefit of those outside your lordships house who may wish to read about the governments intentions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for his question <e> <s> i of course endorse his sentiments on the preservation and development of city financial institutions <e> <s> it is very important that these financial services and other service industries are developed because they are continuing to take a large share of our <e>", "<cs> as the change in the order in which we shall proceed has been agreed by the committee perhaps i may intervene at this stage <e> <s> at the outset i should like to say that i am quite willing to accept that the government may not have got this clause completely right <e> <s> it is controversial <e> <s> that controversy has been broadcast around your lordships house and in other places over the past days to a fortnight <e> <s> therefore i should like noble lords to appreciate that i accept that not as a charge but as a simple statement <e>", "<cs> we have had a very long deep serious and to me most instructive debate this evening over what is probably one of the most important parts of the bill before us <e> <s> with due respect to the noble lord lord benson and others may i separate the two issues that of disqualification and that of wrongful trading because i believe that most of this afternoon or this evening we have concerned ourselves with the aspect of disqualification <e>", "<cs> perhaps i wrongly inferred that <e> <s> if the noble lord will forgive me i shall certainly read exactly what he said <e> <s> he said that very frequently what one wants is time <e> <s> if one does apply for the administrator procedure one receives time it is a period of months <e> <s> if there is not a pull-round in months i fear that there is little that anybody could do <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord benson will forgive me <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee for being a little premature <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord lord benson will allow me <e>", "<cs> the events of a short while ago have thrown me anyway into a certain amount of confusion <e> <s> my understanding is that this amendment is unnecessary because it would only be applicable if the court had made a provisional disqualification order <e> <s> since the committee adopted the version of clause proposed by the noble lord lord benson which does not provide for this provisional disqualification order what is before us now becomes unnecessary <e> <s> that is my understanding of the position at the moment <e> <s> i think that the best i can offer the committee is that if they will accept that that is the understanding which i now have if i find that my understanding is not totally correct then of course we shall find a means to bring it back at a later stage <e>", "<cs> again i am in some little difficulty in that we are talking about successful applications under the new clause <e> <s> as far as the cost of any application is concerned subsection provides for the costs of the successful applicant to be borne by the crown and not only that but the crown itself would be unable to recover its costs until all the creditors had been paid in full and liabilities discharged <e> <s> this goes far beyond any benefits available under legal aid <e> <s> i think that i should have had some sympathy with the provision had it been restricted to applications for a disqualification order because that is effectively the position today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble baronesss arithmetic is absolutely correct <e> <s> as the noble baroness is aware the decision to hold or not to hold particular council of ministers meetings lies in the hands of the presidency <e> <s> the italians as she will know have recently taken the chair <e> <s> although no firm arrangements have been made for a consumer affairs council i understand that consumer affairs items may again be put on the agenda of the internal market discussions on th february <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> she is certainly right <e> <s> the government recorded their wish to see a consumer affairs council as long ago as <e> <s> she will recognise of course that this matter is not entirely in our hands <e> <s> we are in favour of the directives particularly in the two areas that the noble baroness mentioned <e> <s> we shall certainly be doing our utmost to pursue these to a successful conclusion during this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what my noble friend says <e> <s> i do not think that i can agree with his general criticism <e> <s> what is an undue delay to some people may not be so to others <e> <s> however my noble friend will know that since the previous commission completed its term mr stanley clinton davis has taken over responsibility for consumer protection and some consumer affairs <e> <s> it is possible that he will make a statement of policy at the meeting of the internal market and consumer affairs council on th february <e> <s> i look forward as indeed i am sure my noble friend does to that statement of intent <e>", "<cs> my lords we consider that such a defence as that to which the noble lord has referred is essential in order to protect manufacturers from liability for totally unforeseeable risks <e> <s> we do not believe that there is no prospect of getting agreement with our partners <e> <s> until we are totally satisfied that that prospect has disappeared we are most reluctant to take any other course of action <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very fair question to which i do not have an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords on unit pricing progress is being made albeit slowly <e> <s> there are continuing discussions and indeed i was involved in some about days ago <e> <s> a number of areas have to be examined <e> <s> it is only right and fair that progress should be made slowly <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft regulations laid before the house on th december be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not going to resist the temptation to thank both noble lords for their warm welcome for the order <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe for explaining so clearly the reasons behind this amendment <e> <s> he has taken me a little off balance in suggesting that we deal with his amendment no <e> <s> a at the same time <e> <s> but with respect to him i think that these two amendments are really rather different in that the one we have before us now is dealing with powers of the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> as i said at the outset the government have exactly the sympathy that the noble lord lord mishcon sought because people are taken unawares <e> <s> what we are talking about here is something rather different in that if there were an intent to get monies by way of deposit or prepayment knowing full well that the company was insolvent then that would in itself be an offence and i believe that the protection the consumer deserves is in penalising in some way or certainly in bringing to book those who allow that situation to arise <e> <s> the position with hire-purchase is different in that the person has the goods <e> <s> in most instances the instalment situation is a little different in that the person has the goods before all the payments are made <e>", "<cs> i do not know why the noble lord lord bruce of donington should adopt that stance in demanding an assurance from me because it was only last week when he and i were dealing with the statement on financial services that i told him quite directly that the government had through my department instituted the new fraud investigation group <e> <s> that was in january <e> <s> if that is not a demonstration of the governments intent to pursue fraud and to assist the fraud squad itself which has acknowledged the setting up of the fig and the help that it will provide i do not know what is <e>", "<cs> i have no learned note in front of me <e> <s> i view this particular section of the bill on administration orders in a rather more bread and butter way <e> <s> it seems to me that some of the points which the noble lord lord mishcon has presented are not relative to a court agreeing with a company that they should seek an administrative order which does of course provide for other things <e> <s> nevertheless having said that and particularly in response to the noble lords opening remarks i am very happy to listen to what he has to say in terms of the advice he has in front of him <e> <s> i am happy to give what consideration i can to these matters and let him have the benefit of our observations <e> <s> i say that without committing myself my department or the government to any further action than just that <e> <s> if the noble lord is happy with that assurance then i am happy for him to make the points he wishes to make and i will respond if i can <e> <s> if i cannot respond then the noble lord will accept that i will do just that <e>", "<cs> i start by briefly explaining the reasons for the inclusion of a blocking power <e> <s> we think that it is essential to avoid disturbing too severely the existing commercial lending practice in the united kingdom and the power is one of a series of checks and balances included in the procedure to avoid undermining the relative positions of creditors <e>", "<cs> no i cannot say that <e> <s> in responding to the remarks of the noble lord lord mishcon may i say that i wished no discourtesy in my earlier remarks <e> <s> we want to consider all representations from wherever they come in order to get the bill right <e> <s> i have not been able to identify the document to which he refers in a box full of documents on the bill that has been sent to my department <e> <s> it is not perhaps so very important this afternoon that i should be able to identify it particularly in the light of the remarks that he made <e> <s> i suspect that probably before the end of todays proceedings we shall have acquired a copy but i have no trace of the particular document to which he refers <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for explaining the purpose that lies behind the amendment <e> <s> i rather imagined that that was the case <e> <s> in fact his amendment will not do that <e> <s> clause currently provides that once the application for an administration order is made no winding-up order may be made <e> <s> if we accepted the amendment it would allow the court to wind up a company notwithstanding the fact that a meritorious administration order application were pending <e> <s> if it did so no administration order could be made as clause <e>", "<cs> yes certainly <e> <s> let me have the opportunity of considering the merits of the proposal <e> <s> i will see if it is necessary to do anything to protect the position which the noble lord has envisaged <e>", "<cs> i mean no discourtesy to the noble lord lord bruce of donington when i say that unfortunately the amendment as drafted does not quite achieve the purpose <e> <s> also it does not cope with situations where there are two or more charges of differing seniorities <e> <s> in considering the amendment we identified the reason lying behind it and the spirit of lord bruce of doningtons amendment <e> <s> therefore in accepting the general tenor of what he says i wonder whether we could have another look at this with a view to bringing forward something rather more appropriate to meet the point <e>", "<cs> of course on the face of it this sounds reasonable <e> <s> in practical terms i wonder just how it can be done <e> <s> that is because not all the creditors would necessarily be known particularly in some cases of companies who are less than careful in their record-keeping or are so at that particular time <e> <s> but let us give the consideration which the point deserves <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i did misunderstand <e> <s> however the same remark applies let us have a look at the point <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord will just give way <e>", "<cs> i have a feeling that the noble lord has gone a little further ahead than he intended <e> <s> i do not think he is wrong but my understanding is that we should be talking in the second amendment to page line <e> <s> the relative paragraphs are <e>", "<cs> i too will speak to this amendment amendment no <e> <s> and also to amendments nos <e> <s> and standing in the name of the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> all three amendments deal with the position of the receiver who is displaced by an administrator <e> <s> i am particularly grateful that the noble lord should draw attention to the potential problems with such transitions <e> <s> our original view was that problems were unlikely to arise but in considering the amendments i think further thought is required and certainly i agree that potential <e>", "<cs> amendments nos <e> <s> and as we see them stand alone and on their own merits since amendment no <e> <s> is closely associated <e>", "<cs> i can only again repeat the assurance that i have given to the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i readily understand his final point and with that i must agree <e> <s> as regards the other points which the noble lord has made i hope that he will allow us to give them consideration and to give our observations a little later <e>", "<cs> i do of course accept the last point that the noble lord has made <e> <s> certainly if at the report stage there were a great number of probing amendments they would take up possibly a good deal of unnecessary time <e> <s> i understand that the noble lord lord mishcon has said that most of these matters are very legal and in some cases extremely technical <e> <s> obviously if they can be resolved without resort to amendments we would wish to do so and we would wish to do so as soon as we possibly can <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington for accepting that we should group this fairly considerable number of amendments to clause and <e> <s> with the leave of the committee i shall also speak to the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord meston because this whole package of amendments concerns much the same area <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord meston <e>", "<cs> i can only repeat what i said before with regard to the points of noble lord lord mishcon on clause stand part i will give them the consideration he asked for <e>", "<cs> the difficulty with the noble lords proposals is that they assume that reservation of title agreements are of a similar nature to fixed charges and hire purchase leases and other similar agreements <e> <s> but on reflection i think that he will agree that they are not because the fixed charges and the other agreements covered by clauses and are concerned with the provision of large sums of finance in return for security in one form or another <e> <s> reservation of title agreements on the other hand where they form part of a sale agreement are part and parcel of the provision of short-term trade credit <e> <s> i think that then it is quite inappropriate to seek to provide for compensation for lost reservation-of-title grants within the context of clauses and which deal with the long-term financial arrangements <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord lord mishcon will not misunderstand me or accuse me of any lack of courtesy when i tell him that these clauses have received a good deal of consideration many of them go back over months now in drafting in discussion and in consultation <e> <s> so i really must rebut the suggestion that the officials in my department have not given the proper consideration to the matters before us which they might have done <e> <s> the question whether they are complicated and whether there may be one part of a very learned profession which seeks to disagree with what the bill provides or indeed how it might provide it are different matters <e> <s> of course i shall give further consideration to these matters as indeed i promised i would <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord selkirk and to the noble lord lord mishcon for underlining what is worrying them <e> <s> if the creditors accept the adminstrators proposal they are entitled to form a committee as my noble friend has suggested to oversee the progress of the administration to receive information from time to time to raise questions and to receive answers <e> <s> i accept what both noble lords have said with regard to their understanding of the words supervise supervisory or supervision and i can promise that we will see whether we can find a more explanatory word to describe the activity of that committee <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord expects me to respond in the only way in which i can respond i must tell him that i do not know <e> <s> but i will find out and let him know <e>", "<cs> all i can say is that my noble and learned friend the lord advocate my noble friend lord brabazon and i are entirely in the hands of the committee <e> <s> we shall respond to the committee as <e>", "<cs> i would not wish to usurp the position of my noble friend the chief whip in arranging the business of your lordships house but my understanding is that report stage will be reached in the first days of march which gives some time <e> <s> some noble lords will have heard from the noble lord lord mishcon the basis of some of his inquiries and unless a particular matter is debated in this chamber at a later stage such noble lords will not have the benefit of knowing the governments response <e> <s> perhaps it will satisfy all parties concerned if when i respond to the noble lord lord mishcon i place a copy of my response in the library so that other noble lords will be able to know the other view <e>", "<cs> i beg the noble lords pardon but i believe that the deputy chairman of committees has not in fact cleared amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> draws attention to the drafting of the clause <e> <s> it is not our intention in this clause to create enhanced priority where the creditor himself sells the assets or goods returned to him <e> <s> i should like to give further consideration to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if it is considered desirable then we will put down an appropriate amendment at a later stage <e>", "<cs> paragraph provides the administrative receiver with the power to use the common seal of the company <e> <s> the amendment of the noble lord lord bruce of donington affects the paragraph in two ways <e> <s> it suggests that the word use is insufficient in itself and that attest and affix are also necessary <e> <s> i hear what the noble and learned lord lord denning said but i should have thought that the word use on its own would have been quite sufficient <e> <s> i think that at the end of the day we shall have to leave this to the draftsmen <e>", "<cs> i had meant the former and not the latter but since the noble lord tempts me may i give him the assurance on both <e>", "<cs> having started the backward trend on schedule which i hope i shall finish i mean by that the backward trend it seems to me right to give proper and full consideration to all matters that noble lords have raised on schedule and this i undertake to do <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has been very brief <e> <s> perhaps i should be brief too and tell him that i cannot possibly accept amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i think that they are undesirable <e> <s> if he is agreeable i shall deal with amendment no <e> <s> separately <e> <s> the important amendment in the group is amendment no <e> <s> which would give the administrative receiver the power to compel the sale of goods subject to hire-purchase and other agreements <e> <s> however the administrative receiver unlike the administrator does not have the protection of a statutory moratorium on creditors rights of enforcement of their security or repossession of their goods <e> <s> he would be unable therefore to prevent the owners of such goods from repossessing their property <e> <s> in these circumstances the power to sell property free from the security or agreements would be both worthless since they would be unable to retain them <e> <s> it would also be oppressive since there can be no justice in allowing an administrative receiver to sell goods no longer in his possession and over which the owner has the sole right of sale <e> <s> it would also be unjust to the owners of such goods if a receiver was allowed to deprive them of their assets by compulsory sale when the company itself would have no such power and there was no moratorium to justify it <e>", "<cs> i am saying just that <e> <s> the noble lord has identified a problem <e> <s> we can talk about it and bring forward an amendment to meet what lies behind his point <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> would have much the same effect by way of eliminating the need for personal liability as those we <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i will resort to the tactic often used at question time and say not without notice <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord donaldson <e> <s> i confirm that i said i would take that back as i shall also take back the reference in this clause <e> <s> when we find if we can the right kind of words we can also find exactly the definition which we are going to attach to this advisory committee <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure where the noble lord lord bruce of donington is going to end this debate on the series of amendments <e> <s> however it might be helpful if i put the governments point of view at this stage <e> <s> i share the concern expressed by the noble lord that the liquidator in a members voluntary winding up as in all liquidations must act responsibly <e> <s> it is vital that the interests of creditors be safeguarded <e> <s> if the company is insolvent then the liquidator must be bound to take the necessary steps to call a meeting of the creditors so that the winding up is converted to a creditors winding up <e>", "<cs> i had not in fact added amendment no <e> <s> to the series <e> <s> i share with the noble lord a concern that liquidators acting in a members voluntary winding-up act responsibly at all times <e> <s> the bill requires such a liquidator to be a qualified insolvency practitioner under the terms of part i i think that the amendment will place an impossibly high duty on liquidators <e> <s> under clause as drafted a meeting of creditors must be called if the liquidator thinks the company will be unable to meet its debts <e> <s> this is only right and indeed is exactly as the law is at the moment <e> <s> changing that word will to may will in effect mean that unless at all times he the liquidator thinks that the company will definitely be able to pay its debts the liquidator must call a meeting <e>", "<cs> when it comes to discussing words of this nature such as for example shall may will must and so on i always experience a great deal of difficulty because different people interpret such words in different ways <e> <s> as i read the amendment the purpose is to require a liquidator in a members voluntary winding-up to call a meeting of creditors if he is of the opinion that the company may be unable to pay its debts <e> <s> but under the clause as drafted he is under such an obligation only if he is of the opinion that the company will be unable to pay its debts <e> <s> as regards the clause as drafted i draw the noble lords attention to page line where it says <e>", "<cs> of course i shall be very happy to consider the suggestion that the noble lord lord mishcon is making <e> <s> at this moment i cannot say whether such an inclusion would be helpful because i should have to look at the various strands of interest that flow from that <e> <s> but of course i shall be very pleased to look at it and to let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> we have discussed this matter <e> <s> it was in our first amendment this afternoon <e> <s> i want to say two things apart from saying that the noble lord lord meston is quite right when he surmises that we should not be able to accept his amendment <e> <s> i want to reiterate what the cork committee had to say <e> <s> they said that they had looked at this issue of consumer prepayments and deposits and had reached the view that it would be unjust as the noble and learned lord lord denning again reminds us to single out this group of creditors for enhanced priority <e>", "<cs> of course i am here in conformity with the undertaking that i and my noble and learned friend gave during the course of earlier proceedings that we shall look very carefully at any matters that are raised under the general clause stand part debate <e> <s> this is one of those <e> <s> i wonder whether i may just put on record a few observations in that the provisions that we have in clause which deals with the power to disclaim onerous property relating to winding up are different from those relating to bankruptcy under section of the bankruptcy act principally in so far as in a winding up the leave of the court must always be obtained whereas in bankruptcy this is so only in a limited area <e> <s> the bankruptcy provisions contained in clauses and of the bill are themselves being modified so that the leave of the court is not required in any case <e> <s> the court has an involvement in certain disclaimers largely to protect the rights of third parties <e> <s> the principal use of the disclaimer provision is in relation to the disposal of leases which cannot be assigned either for financial or for legal reasons <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord meston for describing the purpose of his two amendments nos <e> <s> b and c <e> <s> as i see it these amendments have the effect of deferring certain debts and liabilities owed to persons who were connected with the company at the date of the commencement of its liquidation or were perhaps connected at any time within the months before that date if the company was insolvent at the time <e> <s> even with the exceptions provided for in subsection of the proposed new clause it seems to me that the amendment is undesirable in that it treats connected persons unduly harshly and would have the effect of discouraging those who run businesses and those who are connected with them <e> <s> i am thinking here particularly of small and medium-sized companies and also those who are investing in them <e> <s> it would remove from these companies essential flexibility in arranging their affairs companies in financial difficulties which are nevertheless capable of being pulled around with additional finance particularly if that finance can be supplied at low cost <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington for the way he has explained the purpose of his amendment <e> <s> it does of course seek to make void the forfeiture provision in a tenancy or lease <e> <s> i do appreciate that a provision such as is proposed in the amendment has the virtue of making it clear by statute that a liquidator administrator or receiver would be able to deal without hindrance with a tenancy or lease relating to an insolvent company <e> <s> but at the same time it is necessary to weigh up very carefully whether such interference is justified in the interests of the main body of creditors as against the interests of the individual who would be the lessor or the beneficial owner <e>", "<cs> i understand what the noble lord says <e> <s> nevertheless i am not convinced by that argument <e> <s> perhaps this would be the right time to suggest to the committee a number of other reasons why we cannot accept the amendment <e> <s> i admit that they are technical and i was not proposing to advance them but it may be helpful if i do and then the noble <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord lord monson for his explanation of this amendment but i am afraid i have to tell him now that while having sympathy with what he hopes to achieve i am not able to accept it <e> <s> i think it will be helpful if i explain in some detail exactly why not <e> <s> that would be only fair especially since my noble friend lord mottistone has given support and the noble lord lord meston has given support in principle <e> <s> so i should like to set out exactly why we do not wish to pursue the line of argument of the noble lord lord monson <e>", "<cs> i really am sorry to tell the noble lord lord monson that there is no possibility <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord meston for bringing forward this amendment on a point to which he referred during the second reading of the bill <e> <s> i am grateful to him also for attaching with this amendment that which he wishes to say to amendment no <e> <s> a in clause <e> <s> the amendment to clause is the bankruptcy counterpart of this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord is right <e> <s> the provisions are indeed derived from provisions contained in the consumer credit act and we agree with the principle behind the proposed amendment namely that the onus of proof should be on the creditor to show that the transaction was not extortionate <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the noble lords amendment is to implement the recommendation of the review committee to which he referred in relation to floating charges that providers of credit should not be able to convert unsecured debt into debt secured by a floating charge where liquidation takes place within months of the taking out of that charge <e> <s> the point at issue here is whether providers of credit should be able to obtain effective floating charge security for advances originally made on unsecured terms where liquidation takes place within months of the creation of the charge <e>", "<cs> this is a very important debate <e> <s> i wonder whether the committee will agree with me on this <e> <s> my noble friend the leader of the house is to make a statement and he has other pressing matters to deal with <e> <s> rather than crowd the debate on this amendment does the committee agree that we should take the statement now and then return to my response to the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what has been said but i regret that neither the cork report nor your lordships have convinced me of the wisdom of accepting the amendment <e> <s> as noble lords will recall the proposals of the cork committee were not totally unanimous <e> <s> indeed since the matter came to the notice of followers of this measure there has been quite a response <e> <s> i would suggest to the committee that most of it has been emotive in nature and largely engendered by the fact that unsecured creditors are always at the greatest risk of losing money as a result of receivership or indeed as a result of insolvency <e>", "<cs> i have only two things to say <e> <s> the first is that i know the difference between a fixed and a floating charge <e> <s> the second thing i have to say is that the noble lord lord bruce of donington has over-exaggerated the effect that this amendment would have upon the bill <e> <s> it is not the core of the bill at all and he very well knows it <e> <s> this bill is about saving businesses and looking after the interests of creditors <e> <s> in no way at all does per cent <e> <s> of nothing secure any greater help for unsecured creditors <e> <s> there are indeed almost unsurmountable problems associated with an amendment of this nature <e> <s> i invite the committee to reject the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> indeed i now have the document to which he referred earlier <e> <s> it is an interesting document and i am quite sure that many of the points raised in it can be dealt with by discussion with the interested parties <e> <s> where there may possibly be a difference the remedy of course is to bring the matter before your lordships house <e> <s> therefore i repeat the undertaking which i gave not only to give consideration to the points which the noble lord raised in our earlier proceedings but to study the points raised in the document <e> <s> our observations will be made clear <e> <s> again i remind the committee that i gave an undertaking that a copy of anything written in response to that which was raised in committee will be put in the library <e>", "<cs> i regret that i cannot deal with that question because i do not know the answer <e>", "<cs> in response to the point raised by the noble lord lord mishcon in regard to the clause standing part the answer lies in the review committees report in that no recommendation was made with regard to services <e> <s> therefore the government felt that this was not a matter which needed to appear within the bill <e> <s> but in principle we have no objection to looking at the matter <e> <s> i imagine that his question arises very much out of the document to which he has referred <e> <s> if i am right in that regard then our review of that point will take place when we look at the document <e>", "<cs> i am very happy to give my noble friend that assurance <e>", "<cs> i take note of the manner in which the noble lord lord bruce has moved this amendment <e> <s> i do not want to discuss the technical effect unless he particularly wants me to do so because there are some defects which i do not think would arise anyway and he is really talking about the principle here <e> <s> my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor explained during the course of the second reading debate on the bill that the plain fact is that there is no ideal time for the consolidation of companies legislation <e> <s> company law is not static and if consolidation were to wait until all the measures in the pipeline at that time were enacted it would be delayed almost indefinitely <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for explaining his amendment <e> <s> as i understand it the amendment seeks to do two things <e> <s> first it applies the definition of shadow director which is found in clause of the companies bill to the term shadow director as it appears in part ii of the bill <e> <s> to that extent the amendment is not necessary since clause of this bill provides that part ii is to be construed as one with what is at present the companies bill <e> <s> therefore shadow director will bear the same meaning in this bill as in the companies bill <e>", "<cs> if that was so yes i would find it unsatisfactory <e> <s> but as i understand it the reference to the shadow director can easily be found in this bill since in the earlier stages there is the reference to the companies act <e> <s> however if on reflection we find that that is too burdensome a job then i should be quite happy to see what i could do to find a place for that definition within the bill <e>", "<cs> the purpose of clause is to provide a simple drafting formula to provide a global term for the date on which a company either has a winding-up order made against it or passes a resolution for voluntary winding-up <e> <s> this is to avoid the necessity of having to repeat a phrase such as where a winding-up order has been made against a company or it has passed a resolution for voluntary winding-up each time such a situation arises <e>", "<cs> i am advised that this is the case rather than being able to tell my noble friend from personal knowledge <e> <s> perhaps i might add to be rather more helpful that i shall find the exact reference and let him have it <e>", "<cs> the reference is clause of the companies bill <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i can help my noble friend <e> <s> the inclusion of this brief description of the contents of schedule is meant only to be helpful to the reader <e> <s> its deletion would have no effect other than to make the bill more difficult to follow <e> <s> i do not mind <e> <s> its inclusion at this time is to be helpful <e> <s> if the noble lord would sooner have it deleted i would not resist him <e>", "<cs> we intend to review clause because a number of representations have been made from outside your lordships committee <e> <s> we have had representations from the revenue and also from members of the insolvency rules advisory committee that the clause is over-restrictive <e> <s> we were thinking about whether to reintroduce domicile into clause <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord meston for putting down the amendment <e> <s> now that he has put his views we should certainly like to consider whether the approach that he suggests may not be more favourable <e> <s> i am grateful also to the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for explaining the purpose of his amendments <e> <s> the series of amendments seeks to modify the provisions of the bill as regards the discharge of an individual who is bankrupt <e> <s> i very much regret that i shall have to speak at some length to these amendments <e> <s> the bill introduces a new system for the discharge of bankrupts and i think it would be helpful to the committee if i were to set out the reasoning behind the provisions in the bill which give rise to my invitation to the noble lord to withdraw most of his amendments <e> <s> however there is one in particular to which i shall come shortly which we believe has great merit and which we should like to adopt in principle <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i shall speak to amendment no <e> <s> f and also to amendment no <e> <s> za which has much the same effect <e>", "<cs> i had intended to say something about the points which the noble lord lord meston raised when introduing this amendment <e> <s> of course he raised the matter on second reading and he has enlarged in this evenings committee stage on his feelings as expressed then <e> <s> i think that what the committee really want to hear is yes the government are generally sympathetic to the principle that lies behind the amendment <e> <s> but having said that i should not like the committee to go away feeling that we would in any way lose sight of the rights of the creditors <e> <s> inevitably of course a postponement of the sale of any asset of a bankrupt means that creditors may have to wait longer for their money <e> <s> it is really a question of weighing up the various factors so that one gets an equitable basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much regret that i have to tell the noble lord that i am not really prepared to do as he asks since the british high commission in ottawa which pays close attention to the oil industry including offshore will assume responsibility for commercial coverage of the atlantic provinces <e> <s> the consul in halifax is being transferred to ottawa and we see no diminution in the opportunities available to our industries by virtue of that closure <e>", "<cs> my lords we are continuing through a number of offices to support our drive to export more of our manufactured invisibles <e>", "<cs> my lords the british overseas trade board an arm of my own department gives assistance to a number of overseas missions that <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that british manufacturing industry is aware of some deficiencies that have occurred in recent years and is making great strides to close the gap between effectiveness and opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords that information is available through the british overseas trade board and other agencies <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly draw to the attention of my right honourable and learned friend the comments that the noble lord makes but i have to remind him that halifax is but one and a half hours away from ottawa where there is adequate coverage <e> <s> the inclusion of the consul from halifax in the commission at ottawa will certainly strengthen that representation <e> <s> i find it odd that the noble lord the leader of the opposition should talk in this vein when my right honourable and learned friend has announced the closure of ten of the smaller missions whereas his own administration closed in a shorter period <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord hatch of lusby for his first comment <e> <s> however the european commission favoured at the time the offer was made to liat the franco-italian atr machine <e> <s> the decision was of course entirely within

noble lord lord hatch the decision which the commission made was entirely within their competence <e> <s> it is not for us in that respect to question that competence because as i said we did concur <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord beswick knows full well that the commission have their criteria to meet in granting aid under edf <e> <s> we of course are party to agreeing to those criteria <e> <s> the criteria were met according to the commission and they agreed that the offer should be made in terms of the franco-italian atr <e>", "<cs> my lords again the noble lord lord bruce of donington having been in europe himself knows and i merely confirm that it is for the commission to determine with the benefit of advice from independent consultants and in accordance with their obligations under the lom convention which aircraft represented the most economically advantageous solution <e>", "<cs> my lords the leeward islands air transport organisation made it quite clear as to what aeroplanes they would prefer it was in fact the bae <e> <s> super <e> <s> however the commission offered money and they offered it under the conditions which i have described <e> <s> this was not acceptable to the leeward islands air transport organisation who separately bought two aeroplanes <e> <s> they rejected the commission which they have a right to do <e> <s> they bought two bae <e> <s> s from us and are currently negotiating with us for two more aeroplanes <e> <s> meanwhile they are considering a canadian offer <e> <s> but i repeat that because the aeroplanes were not acceptable to liat they refused the community ec offer <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord that assurance <e> <s> i am not quite sure this afternoon exactly what are the conventions with regard to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for reminding me and indeed your lordships of that point <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government have no intention of being a supine puppy dog in any international affairs <e> <s> neither are they prepared to adopt a dictatorial attitude towards our colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords liat quite clearly favoured the procurement of four new super s which could be delivered quickly and would not involve the cost and risks of introducing a new or different aircraft <e> <s> that the commission made an offer which liat did not find acceptable is a matter between liat and the commission <e> <s> liat subsequently entered into negotiation with the canadians and into negotiation with ourselves <e> <s> it was at that time that her majestys government had a standing <e> <s> they had no individual standing in the matter while the commission were dealing with liat <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already explained the negotiations between liat and the commission did not involve ourselves <e> <s> naturally we should prefer to supply aircraft made by ourselves and that is the standing which we had at that time <e>

have described and liat have accepted in principle those provisions and have bought already two s and are currently in negotiation on the second two s <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be read a second time <e> <s> since the english industrial estates corporation has concentrated on providing accommodation for small businesses and for high technology and service industries <e> <s>

additionally money is now available from the european regional development fund to help united kingdom companies provide these services for small businesses <e> <s> the changes need to be accommodated in the english industrial estates corporation act which is the legislation that controls eiecs activities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lords lord bruce of donington and lord rochester for their acceptance of this bill <e> <s> i am sorry if noble lords feel that i was a little too brief in my explanation <e> <s> i was trying to set the scene of what we are trying to do in what is after all a very modest bill <e> <s> perhaps i can say this in terms of fleshing out as well as answering some of the questions <e> <s> in recent years a number of leading experts in the field of property development have been appointed to the board of the english industrial estates corporation <e> <s> i think we are particularly fortunate now in having mr christopher wates as chairman <e> <s> let me say straight away that the government value greatly the commercial realism which mr wates and his colleagues have brought to the corporations development programme <e> <s> under their guidance in recent years there has been a very much marked improvement in the corporations financial performance <e> <s> it has managed to let on fair market rentals an increasing number of factory units over the past four years <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going on to say marketing to explore market potential regionally nationally and for export of existing products and new products processes and indeed services <e> <s> the fourth heading would cover innovation to support feasibility studies on new projects which may lead to the development of new products and processes <e> <s> each of those four headings is available for erdf support <e> <s> that support varies from between per cent and per cent <e> <s> but in addition it is a condition of that erdf support that the beneficiary meets per

now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not take quite the same view as the noble lord lord graham took in his opening remarks because i have not regarded this evening as at all hostile i have found it extremely interesting <e> <s> but i have to say that some five hours ago i heard a number of noble lords talking about another industry precariously balanced between survival and extinction <e> <s> that is what i have heard <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know why the noble lord should tax me with that <e> <s> i have been in commerce long enough to know the advantage of bulk

earlier we had an export business worth million and they had an export business worth million a year <e> <s> there is therefore grave damage to the economies of both countries and we have sought through successive rounds of negotiation to bridge that gap <e> <s> there is no way in which the government can make a general exclusion for the commercial trade in books i have to make that clear <e>", "<cs> my lords the united kingdoms import penetration in the united states represented some per cent <e> <s> of all united kingdom exports <e> <s> last year the british overseas trade board

questions that my noble friend lord orr-ewing put to me <e> <s> on the noble lords second point he will recognise as i do that the major shift as between the dollar and sterling occurred in january of this year <e> <s> he i am sure will accept that it is a little too early to see the dramatic increase that can he measured <e> <s> it is significant to say that the penetration of british manufactured goods has improved markedly in the last months when oil was only per cent <e> <s> of all british exports to the united states <e> <s> as regards the point on after-sales service and the faults of british management i think that that is something of a generalisation and i should be unwise to embark on any deep answer to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not seek to mislead either the house or the noble lord lord beswick <e> <s> i explained to the noble lord lord diamond that i did not have the answer in the same terms as those in which he asked his question <e> <s> i gave the nearest to it that i had available <e>", "<cs> my lords the chemical industry in regard to both organic and inorganic materials has had a very significant impact in the united states in the last or months <e>",

<e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords the question which is down for today surely concerns the statement on the development of the communitys consumer protection policy which i believe i have answered <e>", "<cs> my lords i have answered the question on the order paper that is concerning the statement made by the commission on th december <e> <s> i said that the statement to which the noble baroness refers was made by herr narjes the outgoing commissioner <e> <s> i answered the question quite fully in my original answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i can and i will do that <e> <s> the progress on the product liability directive has been slow <e> <s> discussions at the last two internal market councils have

lord that i take note of what he has said in that regard <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall confine my response to the first supplementary question that the noble lord lord paget asked would we reconsider

noble friend made as these are hypothetical i regret that i cannot give him an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords that really is rather wide of the question <e> <s> if i could keep my answer more in line with the original question there is no suggestion at this moment of time that increased and/or additional car manufacturing plants are to be erected in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington for his question because it enables me to say that so far as we are aware the land at swindon is to be used for buildings which will enable the pre-delivery inspection of the cowley-produced honda version of the xx car pre-delivery inspections for their motor cars currently <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed we are immensely concerned with the employment of people in this country <e> <s> if hondas activities in swindon which i have just outlined encourage some employment however small then they would be welcome to us <e>", "<cs> my lords again i have to

may i start by congratulating my noble friend lord mersey on the first occasion on which he has moved an amendment <e> <s> he moved it with a good deal of eloquence <e> <s> i suspect that he has perhaps rehearsed his explanation of the amendment on a number of occasions <e> <s> i should not want to quarrel very much with him about some of the figures in his speech nor do i want as the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead suggested i might to argue about the inadequacies omissions or technical deficiencies of the two amendments before us <e> <s> i say two amendments because it was agreed that we were to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and together since essentially they fall into the same subject area <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i did not say that <e> <s> i said that across all the channels feature films accounted for between and per cent <e> <s> of programming time and that that share of programming time was decreasing <e> <s> it follows because the viewer does not particularly want that kind of programme across his television screen <e>", "<cs> <e> <s> i am most grateful to my noble friend lord auckland for his explanation of the amendment but i must say at the outset that the principle behind the amendment is practically the same as that which we have spent most of the afternoon discussing in amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> it proposes again a redistributive levy the proceeds of which would be directed towards british film production <e> <s> the target of the levy in this case is different pre-recorded video cassettes rather than television <e> <s> therefore this amendment raises a number of different though in some respects similar aspects which are equally important i suspect to my noble friend and his supporters <e>", "<cs> it really is not a dead end <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord massereene and ferrard asked what the government were doing <e> <s> i would hardly call the governments contribution of million plus from the portfolio plus additional support to the school guaranteed over the next five years a dead end <e> <s> that is a considerable amount of money <e> <s> it is in excess of what the eady levy has produced in recent years <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham shakes his head <e>", "<cs> he must agree that the facts which i have laid before the committee are correct <e> <s> if he and my noble friend want to argue that million is not very much even when multiplied five times that is totally different but it is an argument which i do not believe holds too much water <e>", "<cs> the noble lord suggests that i pull out selective figures <e> <s> the example that he gave is even more selective <e> <s> there is no comparison whatsoever between cinema and television <e> <s> the noble viscount lord falkland made the point the two cannot be compared <e> <s> one involves an entire outing <e> <s> a seat in the cinema may cost or whatever but it is a total experience <e> <s> one may be watching a film on the screen in both cases but going to the cinema is a totally different experience from watching a film on television at home <e>", "<cs> i believe i answered most of the noble lords comments earlier <e> <s> i find it extraordinary that the immediate call of any industry whether films shipbuilding motor cars or whatever is for more taxpayers money <e> <s> we have put up some money <e> <s> as i sought to explain at second reading we have set an environment in which the industry can help itself <e> <s> the film industry is buoyant as those in it have admitted <e>

debate on this group of amendments is how much common ground there is between us particularly when we come to discuss the successor organisation to nffc that is the consortium a word which the noble viscount does not like <e> <s> the full title is the british screen finance consortium but i shall refer to it as the bsfc <e> <s> frankly it is the formation and the future of that consortium that should concern us <e> <s> i believe that the fears expressed that it may act in a way which does not principally benefit the film industry and that the government may not have sufficient control are not justified <e>", "<cs> i return to the box somewhat warily because i am reluctant to refuse the invitation of the noble lord lord willis <e> <s> however i am just wondering where he will lead me if i say yes <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will allow me to think about his invitation between now and the next stage <e> <s> if i have anything further to say to him i can either get in touch with him

grateful to him for the manner in which he did that and of course i am sorry that he deprived me of a little fun i was going to have at his expense <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington for having given me notice of these two questions <e> <s> he is quite right these matters are of great complexity <e> <s> the government expect to lay amendments in the printed paper office this week probably on thursday <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe i can have that statement repeated in <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be so but i am sure the noble baroness will recognise that there are some differing views among members of the community <e> <s> it is our desire that all those views should be reconciled before directives are made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord peyton but i think he will recall that there are only two member states who have specific consumer ministers <e> <s> therefore matters of consumer interest being referred to the commission come from ministers of a wider variety <e> <s> as regards the amount of paper work i think commissioner clinton daviss statement makes it clear that he is interested in achieving unanimity of approach which should in fact reduce the amount of paper work <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be very pleased to do so but i think it would weary the house during questions if i were to embark upon it understanding the conventions that apply <e> <s> may i briefly say that the united kingdom have been represented at ministerial level at all meetings which is perhaps a little more than i can say for some other member states <e> <s> from that i believe our input into the discussions has been considerable <e> <s> i should perhaps remind your lordships that we in this country enjoy a very high standard of consumer protection a high profile on consumer affairs and many of the communitys directives are culled from our own domestic legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise my noble friends assiduous attention to these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first of all assure the noble lord that her majestys government will take note of the report of the select committee to which he referred <e> <s> we have some reservations about unit pricing <e> <s> we believe that it is better to complete agreement on package sizing before we move to unit pricing <e> <s> as soon as we have achieved unanimity in that area there may be some further point in moving towards unit pricing as we now understand the commissions reading of that term <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington for his welcome of the order which i have moved this evening <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord i am nearly always grateful to him particularly on two counts <e> <s> perhaps i may endorse his remarks with regard to the work that the committee on statutory instruments performs <e> <s> indeed it saves us all a great deal of time and looks into some of the intricacies with which perhaps we are not quite so familiar <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lord for his acceptance of the provisions that have been added by virtue of the order <e>", "<cs> my lords in regard to the delivery rate in inner london the post office quarterly statistics report indicated that for the quarter ending december per cent <e> <s> of first-class mail was delivered by the first working day after collection <e> <s> over the year the percentage was <e> <s> the target is per cent <e> <s> so some slight increase has been shown in the last quarter <e> <s> in regard to wrong deliveries we have some problems about the inward sorting arrangements <e>

second-class mail <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that her majestys government wish to protest but the governments view with regard to the unsatisfactory state of the service as set down by the board of the post office has been made abundantly clear to the board on a number of occasions recently <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand what the noble lord implies in his question <e> <s> certainly the post office board has introduced what i can best describe as sector activities but the delivery of the mails receives its full and proper attention <e> <s> in regard to price it is interesting that the increase in first-class mail in april was the first since <e> <s> in fact in real terms a first-class stamp is about per cent <e> <s> cheaper than it was four years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords the introduction of the universal post code has been delayed as i and noble friends behind me have said on a number of occasions due to the inability of the post office to agree with the unions with regard to the mechanisation of letter offices <e> <s> there are still yet to be mechanised <e> <s> there has been a voluntary improvement of per cent <e> <s> in post code usage in the last months

as compared with turnover <e> <s> i am not able to take on board the series of figures that he introduced in his first supplementary question but i suspect that he is probably right <e>", "<cs> my lords whenever one decides to set targets in whatever sphere it is surely better to set a target that is a agreed by the operatives and b reasonably achievable <e> <s> my noble friend will accept that a target of per cent <e> <s> would not be achievable <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that there has been a deterioration in the service <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord diamond has asked me to look into a number of points which he raised in an interrogatory manner <e> <s> i can assure him that the points that he made will be taken on board by the new and very vigorous efficiency audit team of inspectors that the post office has introduced in recent weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord beswick <e> <s> he is obviously a very popular man to have such a large and increasing volume of mail delivered to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that <e> <s> if my noble friend would let me have the envelope if he still retains it we might be able to investigate what caused the delay <e>", "<cs> my lords all the collection post offices are as important to the post office as they are to the senders and the recipients of mail <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into a committee upon the bill in respect of clauses to and paragraphs to of schedule <e>", "<cs> in moving the proposition standing in my name on the marshalled list that of having given notice of my intention to oppose the question that clause stand part of the bill i think the committee will have realised from all the amendments tabled in my name that the government have decided not to pursue their proposals to disqualify automatically the directors of companies which are wound up compulsorily by the court and it follows therefore that they intend no longer to seek to make a distinction between voluntary and compulsory liquidation <e>", "<cs> my lords this clause now serves no purpose <e> <s> its original purpose of course was <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington the noble lord lord meston and my noble friend lord mottistone for their acceptance in principle of the series of amendments to which i have spoken <e> <s> i want to deal with as many as i can of the points that have been raised during this short debate <e> <s> in the light of what the noble lord lord bruce said during the earlier part of our proceedings this evening namely you aint seen nothing to what you are going to see on report i should prefer to clear as many points as i can now even at the risk of detaining the committee <e>", "<cs> i recall on a number of occasions on different bills and from a different position in your lordships chamber asking exactly the same kind of question <e> <s> perhaps i have never been totally happy about it <e> <s> i should like to look at this matter in the light of the bill but also in relation to the custom that has evolved which of course the parliamentary draftsmen are rather more responsible for than i am <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend lord mottistone for the courteous way in which he moved these amendments <e> <s> i am rather sorry that he was not totally persuaded by what i said during our debate on the deletion of clause <e> <s> i invite him if i may i believe he made the offer to study carefully what i said because i feel that the substance of what he is asking for was met in my earlier contribution <e>", "<cs> if i have misunderstood the noble lord lord benson i apologise <e> <s> i think i shall have to take another note of what he has been suggesting and perhaps i could pick up that point a little later <e>", "<cs> i do not think i said exactly that <e> <s> i am not a legal man but my understanding is that if one puts it into law that certain criteria shall be for the consideration of a court it can be held that by virtue of that other criteria are excluded <e> <s> now i <e>", "<cs> i do not think the noble lord lord meston is totally correct <e> <s> as i have <e>", "<cs> i listen very carefully to what the noble lord lord benson says on these matters <e> <s> i am not totally sure that i agree with him <e> <s> i think i prefer to let my argument rest where it is underlining it with the assurance i gave him that i shall consider very carefully what he has said in relation to the amendments to which my noble friend has spoken which are in his name and in that of the noble lord and see whether there is anything in my amendments and in his where we can find some more common ground <e>", "<cs> i am listening to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord benson is quite correct <e> <s> since clause has been deleted from the bill applications under this clause would be the responsibility of the secretary of state and the cost of these applications would therefore not be a charge against the assets of the company <e> <s> therefore the first part of the amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> i explained when we were dealing with clause why it is inappropriate for the crown or the taxpayer to have to bear the costs of collecting on behalf of the creditors of a company a debt arising from a declaration of personal liability <e> <s> i do not think it would assist the committee for me to repeat those arguments but i think that my first response meets the point that the noble lord was seeking <e>", "<cs> i beg the noble lords pardon <e> <s> the purpose of amendment no <e> <s> is to make it clear that a person who is responsible for a companys wrongful trading is personally liable to make such contribution as the court thinks proper to the companys assets <e> <s> these amendments are intended certainly in part to satisfy demands that the wording be simplified <e> <s> there are some technical amendments to the clause mainly to remove the reference to shadow directors to which i have just referred <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the point made by the noble lord <e> <s> i felt that it might be rather more helpful to the committee if i explained the purpose and effect of the amendments in my name as it had a bearing in relation to what cork suggested <e> <s> it follows therefore that i am obliged to discuss in part the amendment of the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> i shall also have something further to say after i have heard his remarks <e>", "<cs> i am greatly obliged to the noble lord lord meston who really has answered my noble friend <e> <s> i listened carefully to what my noble friend lord noel-buxton had to say about this series of amendments but i really cannot see how the amendments would improve the clause as drafted <e> <s> i shall not repeat the point which the noble lord lord meston made with such clarity <e>", "<cs> in answer to the question which the noble lord lord bruce of donington raised in his opening remarks as to whether the whole of his new clause would appear in <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first echo the remarks of the noble viscount lord falkland in reminding the house this evening of the awards which the british film industry the actors and those involved in the industry won yesterday <e> <s> that merely suggests to me that the industry is in fine fettle in good heart and has the approbation of its peers <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead that i have listened very carefully and i have no wish whatsoever to brush this issue aside <e> <s> the government are well aware of the excellence of the national film and television school as they are extremely well aware of the excellence of the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead who moved the amendment because it is he who has brought the school into the very high esteem in which it is held <e> <s> there is no doubt that its reputation for producing highly skilled film and television personnel is acknowledged across the film-making world <e> <s> we said this in our white paper on film policy <e>", "<cs> sympathy thank you for the way in which accepting his great knowledge the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead has put forward this proposal recommend your lordships to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord mersey for the way in which he re-introduced his amendment that we discussed at some length during the committee stage only a short while ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i

goods advertise on television <e> <s> he therefore buys that element because he cannot tell me that he does not buy some goods that are advertised on television <e> <s> he pays and all of us who watch television pay <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey for his very lucid explanation of the amendments standing in his name on the marshalled list <e> <s> i am also grateful to him for coupling amendments nos <e> <s> and together which i am sure is helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i did not say anything about that because i thought it was fairly obvious to those of common sense in your lordships house the noble lord himself referred to it that two wrongs have never made a right <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend in the first part of his supplementary and would merely add that the implementation by british shipbuilders of their new merchant ship product strategy backed by the considerations which my noble friend mentioned has also been a contributing factor <e> <s> while both japan and korea continue to take a very much higher share of the world market our own efforts have to be doubled and redoubled <e>", "<cs> my lords while what the noble lord lord shinwell says may be true and i must say to him that i rather doubt it i believe that where british ships are sold whether they are flag in or out has very little to do with the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the orders referred to in my original answer the ships totalling compensated gross tonnes i believe that they are all for united kingdom operators <e> <s> united kingdom shipbuilders took some per cent <e> <s> of world new orders in the first nine months of <e> <s> with regard to the final part of the noble lords supplementary the question of unfair competition is one that continually engages her majestys government <e> <s> we are presently negotiating <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe and i am glad to confirm that in most instances the influence of the finance markets of which he has a great deal of knowledge is an important factor in tendering for new ships <e> <s> i have to confess that not always is the competition truly fair or our arrangements competitive <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble lord lord greenway says may well be true but as it has not yet happened one can only take note of developments <e> <s> in truth it is the finns who have risen to third place in world shipbuilding capacity <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he talked about the power delegated to the lord chancellor <e> <s> he will not forget i am quite sure that that power is concurrent with that of the secretary of state so it is not such an isolated provision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord benson for the manner in which he introduced his series of amendments <e> <s> however i take issue with him when he said in his opening remarks that the bill already places a heavy burden on a director and that were a director declared unfit it would be a stigma upon him for life and he would not be able to work again <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord was exaggerating somewhat and that he has perhaps put behind him one of the main purposes of the bill that is to make directors more aware of their responsibilities in the management of companies particularly in relation to the effect of failure of that company on the creditors <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i answer three questions that have been raised <e> <s> the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran spoke about the company doctor and the discouragement to the company doctor that this bill would have <e> <s> i cannot possibly accept that for one moment <e> <s> one calls in a company doctor as a man of great experience who can help a company in difficulties <e> <s> if he does that job properly there can be no way under this bill that he could be declared unfit <e> <s> that he might possibly stray into the area of fraud is a different matter and i am sure that the noble lord did not mean that at all <e>", "<cs> my lords until this very moment no case had been brought before your lordships house to substantiate the argument that the words in the act ought not to prevail in this act <e> <s> this is the first time we have heard it <e> <s> that suggests to me that they are not bearing great weight on the potential company doctors <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house since my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls has specifically invited me so to do i should like to say that i have little doubt that a court would take an opposite view to that of my department when the noble lord brought his particular problem with regard to the potential insolvency or rescue of the company of which he spoke <e> <s> that is exactly the action of a responsible director <e> <s> he has made the case for me <e> <s> i would remind him that i gave an assurance that the government were giving consideration to the worthwhileness or otherwise of guidelines for the benefit of directors <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not like it thought that i am unsympathetic or indeed that the government are unsympathetic to the hardships that are suffered by some consumer creditors when a company goes into liquidation when the creditors have made advance payments and then are not able to recover their money <e> <s> having said that i do not think that including this particular test of unfitness in the bill would prove to be any answer <e> <s> perhaps one or two people may be caught but that is about all <e> <s> it seems to me that the far more likely effect would be for a company to curtail their activities because the directors of such a company would not know how a court would be likely to determine what they might have done <e>", "<cs> my lords i was glad to hear from the noble lord lord bruce of donington that he was making an exploration here and it was interesting in the light of that exploration to hear what the noble and learned lord lord denning had to say about it <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord bruce of donington that it is right that a director should be protected wherever he can be from unauthorised disclosure about himself or his companys affairs <e> <s> however the new clause goes a little too far because any matter under subsection of clause includes anything relating to the conduct of the director and the liquidator can disclose information relating to such conduct only to the secretary of state or the official receiver or for the purposes of the prevention or detection of crime or for criminal proceedings <e> <s> any other disclosure needs the consent of the court <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bruce of donington is right in his suspicions <e> <s> i commend him for his zeal because it is right that where there is doubt these matters should be confirmed and i am obliged to the noble and learned lord lord denning for his intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened very carefully to what the noble lord lord benson had to say as i did to the noble lord lord bruce of donington and to my noble friend <e> <s> but in my view this series of amendments is a further attempt by noble lords to weaken the wrongful trading clause <e> <s> i am not convinced that these three amendments will assist the operation of the clause as it is in any way at all <e> <s> to restrict the period of wrongful trading to two years prior to the commencement of the winding up will certainly give directors some comfort but it could lead and i believe would lead to creditors being seriously disadvantaged <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bruce gave me the opportunity which i accept of again setting down why the government do not feel that his proposed new clause is right and proper for inclusion in the bill <e> <s> on recommitment i described what we felt was wrong with the cork draft <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord mottistone for his support of the governments position and nothing i have heard this afternoon has made me feel any different <e> <s> i know that this proposed new clause is not an exact copy of the cork clause but there is still too much of the original left to make it a workable alternative to the provision that the government have down <e>", "<cs> my lords amendments nos <e> <s> and in the name of the noble lord would have a very similar effect to the amendment which was moved by the noble lord lord meston during our consideration in committee of what was then clause of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington and to my noble friend lord selkirk <e> <s> little did he realise neither did i when i gave the undertaking to him that it would result in such a raft of amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to say that i am not able to accept the amendment to clause or indeed the identical amendment to clause <e> <s> i should perhaps say that the noble lord has rather caught me on the wrong foot because i was not prepared at this moment to speak to the other group of amendments amendments nos <e> <s> and with the consequential amendments amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> however i shall do the best i can <e> <s> in fact the basic argument is the same overall <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i say that since the noble and learned lord lord denning is the only other noble lord who has added a voice to this series of amendments and in view of what the noble lord lord bruce of donington has said i should like to assure him that i have no reason to be nor was my purpose to be frivolous about this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords let me say straight away that i am able to accept the principle of these amendments <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington for bringing them forward although as i will explain i do not think as indeed the noble and learned lord lord denning does not that they are necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords just before the noble lord seeks the leave of the house i think that i have to protest also because he has made some very powerful statements <e> <s> i want to remind him of one thing <e> <s> under the present law rules relating to insolvency are made by the lord chancellor and they are laid before parliament after they have been made <e> <s> this bill introduces in clause and clause an element of parliamentary control which is not available at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not able to enlarge very much further than my memory serves me and that means calling into sharp relief discussions which i believe we had at the end of january or in early february when we were discussing the early part of the bill and the new arrangements with which it would be necessary for insolvency practitioners to comply <e> <s> clause of the bill deals with the qualification of practitioners <e> <s> the noble lord will see that clause b says that an individual will have to provide <e>", "<cs> no my lords they are not rules <e> <s> the situation is put quite clearly in clause <e> <s> that gives in effect the bonding requirements <e> <s> my answer to the noble lords question has been put together a little from memory and with a little help from my noble and learned friend and i hope that that satisfies the noble lord opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may say that the noble lord is not doing himself justice when he argues this way <e> <s> practitioners have always had bonding arrangements <e> <s> those arrangements have not been set down in statute <e> <s> they have been practice and practice evolved through the application of rules <e> <s> there is nothing very new here <e> <s> i have a little suspicion that the noble lord lord bruce of donington is being perhaps a little frivolous on this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e>", "<cs> my lords these two amendments are of course identical to those tabled by the noble lord lord meston at the committee stage of the bill and are as the noble lord lord bruce of donington said taken virtually out of the cork report <e> <s> i said in committee that our objection to the proposed new clause is that it treats connected persons unduly harshly particularly when considered with other provisions of the bill <e> <s> i shall say a little more about that in a moment <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords the noble lord lord bruce of donington has put forward the amendments in a temperate and very sympathetic way but the house will probably recall that the noble lord lord meston and the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe introduced similar amendments in committee which i resisted at that time <e> <s> i resisted them successfully <e>", "<cs> my lords by way of introduction i have to say that the government are not able to accept this series of amendments and before i finish my remarks i shall ask the noble lord lord bruce of donington to withdraw them <e>

specifically to the noble lord lord bruce because he asked as did the noble and learned lord lord denning if i would set out the governments view <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i touched upon this during our short discussion on the previous amendment <e> <s> i said that we had carefully considered an amendment put down at committee stage which was identical to this <e> <s> we concluded that the reintroduction of the domicile ground now achieved by amendment no <e> <s> that had been removed from the bill by virtue of the repeal of the bankruptcy act would be sufficient to restore the scope of that bill to the present legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i was preparing to respond to the noble lord lord bruce with regard to this series of amendments by inviting your lordships to consider at the same time my own amendments nos <e> <s> to since there is a relationship here <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry that i cannot tell my noble friend lord campbell of alloway the answer to that just at the moment anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords during the debate at committee stage it was said that legal and professional privilege should be removed only for the most compelling reasons <e> <s> in our view such reasons exist where the official receiver and the bankrupts trustees are carrying out their duties <e> <s> it is vital that the official receiver has access to all documents and matters relevant to a bankrupts affairs for the purpose of his investigation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in fact going to ask the noble lord lord bruce of donington to withdraw his amendments and i shall explain why <e> <s> it is not purely because they are drafting amendments and i think that when i have given an explanation he will probably accede to my wish in this matter <e> <s> your lordships will probably remember that these amendments are similar in substance to those that were moved in committee and your lordships will probably recall that in committee i expressed sympathy with the aims of those amendments <e> <s> indeed i appreciate very much the terms in which the noble lord lord bruce of donington has moved his amendments this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am very willing to clear up the question which my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter has put to me <e> <s> perhaps i may say that there is no feeling of the eleventh-and-a-half hour on the part of the government <e> <s> i gave an undertaking during the committee stage when these matters were put fairly forcefully by the noble lord lord meston <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington for explaining so explicitly the purpose behind his amendments <e> <s> while i am not unsympathetic to the position in which the undischarged bankrupt may find

<e> <s> but certainly the local authorities were consulted with regard to the draft licences as were other boards and interested bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it these are proposals and they are subject to planning requirements <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter for further consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords schedule to the draft licences provides a code of practice and there are specific requirements in regard to sites of special beauty protected buildings and such like <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is a further expression of the concern of the noble lord lord bruce of donington to ensure the confidentiality of the report to be made by the liquidator to the secretary of state a concern which i indicated at report stage that the government share <e> <s> as on that

the beginning of this month oecd ministers meeting in paris agreed that a new round should begin as soon as possible <e> <s> negotiations to that end are now in hand <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords if there were to be any legislation in regard to nationalised industries it would fall to my department <e>", "<cs> my lords a cut in monetary terms does not mean necessarily that any less endeavour in the promotion of exports takes place <e>", "<cs> my lords i really feel that the bosporus bridge and the financing arrangements undertaken by the japanese are extraordinarily wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i can confirm that the amounts and the methods by which we aid overseas trade effort are broadly the same <e> <s> i discussed this with the german minister responsible only three weeks ago and she confirmed that broadly we were in accord <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are concerned at the deficit <e> <s> we think that at the end of this year we shall on current account be in balance <e> <s> that the value of the british overseas trade boards allotment of governmental funds is going to be less in real terms does not mean that this is the only figure that the noble lord should take into account <e> <s> as the noble lord will recall when my noble friend lord jellicoe chairman of the british overseas trade board gave evidence to the select committee on overseas trade of your lordships house under my noble friend lord aldington that was the answer to the direct question which the noble lord lord hatch of lusby has now asked <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite correct <e> <s> they are at an all-time record <e> <s> it would be unfair of me however if i did not add that so also are our imports <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure whether the noble lord on the cross-benches wanted to refer to manufactured goods or to total goods <e> <s> the fact is that excluding oil exports our manufactured goods are at an all-time record across the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i came this afternoon to the debate in the happy knowledge and certainly with the happy thought that i would respond to a debate about an endeavour <e> <s> however i find myself instead in part having to respond to what some noble lords have used as an attack upon the policies of the government in the area of industry and industrial relations which i personally should have thought better placed on another occasion <e> <s> i shall during the course of my remarks respond because the invitation has been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall return to what i was going to say to the right reverend prelate because i am particularly glad that the christian churches are fully involved in industry year <e> <s> the churchs response was the subject as he reminded us of a st georges house consultation last september <e> <s> it resulted in the formation of the churches working group on which he remarked <e> <s> historically the church has celebrated agriculture and farming particularly through the harvest festival <e> <s> industry year provides a further opportunity to celebrate and affirm gods providence through nature technology and human enterprise <e> <s> the working group is encouraging churches to have special services on rogation day to lay emphasis on the importance of industry and the people who work in it <e> <s> as he reminded us there is to be a national interdenominational service in st pauls <e>", "<cs> my lords it is hoped that parliamentary time will be found in the time i have indicated <e> <s> with that i ask all noble lords to support the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords had the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead been in your lordships house on friday last when we were <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed it is an offence <e> <s> it is of course not for me to give a view on what the court of appeal decided <e> <s> their decision is fully reported in <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord lord graham of edmonton has quite the wrong understanding <e> <s> my understanding is that the film industry are particularly pleased with the effects that the legislation has had <e> <s> i would again refer to <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can add anything more to that which i have already said in this regard <e>", "<cs> i cannot answer the noble lord but my understanding is that even if they were referred the events took place before the enactment of the copyright amendment act <e> <s> therefore the case was heard under the theft act <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not quarrel with the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> if that is his understanding again i would not quarrel <e> <s> i have to say that i do not have an understanding one way or another of what was drawn to the noble and learned lords attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the law report as printed in <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house and for your lordships convenience i should like to repeat a statement on british aerospace which is being made in another place by my honourable friend the minister of state for industry and information technology <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord bruce of donington and lord diamond for their reception of this statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i was aware of some of the points he made but i am most grateful to him for informing me of others <e> <s> certainly the over-subscription particularly by the general public indicates that the public have great confidence in the company <e> <s> indeed it indicates that the general public are following the governments philosophy of wider share ownership <e> <s> it is of course a great pity that there could not have been made available even more shares to satisfy that market <e>", "<cs> my lords i had no wish to mislead the noble lord lord beswick nor indeed the house <e> <s> i was merely illustrating a set of figures which is available in the report and accounts of the company showing what has happened since and what happened in <e> <s> i accept of course as will anybody who has any knowledge of business that there is a long lead time from an investment and a design concept into profitability <e> <s> i was seeking to establish that the company has gone along very successfully <e> <s> there has been no drop in its endeavours its sales its exports or its profitability since it was announced that the company was to be privatised <e> <s> if this proposal had been anathema to the stockholders the employees and management one might have expected a drop but there has not been such a drop <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly scrutiny has taken place to ensure that no improper applications have been made or been improperly dealt with <e> <s> if we subsequently find that such improprieties have taken place no doubt the normal course will prevail <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with the noble lord lord molloy <e> <s> he turns things round and has not asked a question <e> <s> he has made a statement with which i thoroughly disagree <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot confirm that because i do not have the necessary figures to do the arithmetic <e> <s> if the noble lords figures are correct i can see nothing wrong with either of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons reason be now considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mcintosh for the brevity with which he introduced his amendment <e> <s> i am not going to get myself involved this evening in constitutional issues because they are well understood by all members of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcintosh reads out part of the letter <e> <s> i think i have made my point <e>", "<cs> i have a rather different letter my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a letter no it really is not good enough for the noble lord lord mishcon to sit there arms folded and say oh please <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite happy to go along with that <e> <s> it was not i who raised the question of what my noble friend lord mersey said <e> <s> it was the noble lord lord mcintosh who said and <e>", "<cs> well my lords it was the noble lord lord mcintosh who brought up what my noble friend said and my noble friend is not here <e> <s> because he is my noble friend i felt that it was not unreasonable for me to give my understanding of what he felt about this matter <e> <s> i am quite prepared to leave what my noble friend lord mersey had to say because he is not here to speak for himself <e> <s> but having dealt with that perhaps i may say in response to the noble viscount lord falkland and the noble lord lord jenkins of putney that the other place has discussed the principle underlying paragraphs <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with the noble lord lord beswick in relation to his first supplementary that this money has financed tax concessions <e> <s> this money has gone into the kitty as he puts it from which government programmes in all are funded <e> <s> so far as appreciation is concerned that is as a result of the very nature of the success of the company since its privatisation <e> <s> i can see no danger inflationary or otherwise in that success <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i understand what lies behind the question of my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls <e> <s> it is of course for your lordships to decide whether or not this is an abuse <e> <s> i find the question of the noble lord lord beswick interesting and i think i could possibly answer him better in a couple of years time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord shinwell raises a number of points <e> <s> i could specify the yts programme which goes towards job creation <e> <s> that is one of the programmes financed by the government from the monies that are available to them <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the question of the noble lord lord oram is quite simply as was announced in another place a short while ago that per cent <e> <s> of those who originally invested in bt are still shareholders today that is to say they were a fortnight ago <e>", "<cs> really my lords <e> <s> four questions have been raised by the noble lord lord bruce of donington in a somewhat rhetorical way and i do not think i can agree with any one of them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the leader of the opposition knows very well it is not a practice to hypothecate taxation or governmental receipts <e> <s> that has never been the practice of any government and we are not going to alter that practice <e> <s> he will also know and the house will recognise that government expenditure is always the subject of a white paper which sets out the programmes upon which the government are going to embark <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> that has been tried before and it has not succeeded <e> <s> indeed i am quite sure that had we hypothecated it in that way the noble lord opposite would have asked me why i had not done exactly the opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord cockfield has answered this question about selling the silver in order to buy the groceries <e> <s> it is a non-question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord gisborough <e> <s> of course he is absolutely right <e> <s> the return on that investment in training will be seen over the forthcoming years <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the governments policy to sell their remaining shareholdings in privatised companies as the circumstances of the companies the prospectus undertakings and market conditions permit <e> <s> british aerospace has been operating successfully in the private sector since and the sale of the governments remaining shares was in the interests both of the taxpayer and of the company <e>", "<cs> my lords the pledge to which the noble lord referred was as i explained yesterday afternoon to protect the company in the national interest particularly from a foreign takeover <e> <s> that pledge has been implemented by virtue of the special share <e> <s> i spelt that out yesterday afternoon and i know that the noble lord took note of what we discussed <e> <s> the foreseeable future which was mentioned at that time lasted for some years <e> <s> circumstances change <e> <s> so far as the moneys are concerned i think i replied on that point in the earlier answers that i gave the noble lord with regard to the sale of british telecom shares <e> <s> as regards the third question about the workforce i think that the companys results speak for themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords there were million shares taken up in this last isssue by employees of british aerospace in addition to those that they had some years ago <e> <s> until the share register is made up it is quite impossible for me to answer the second question <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i do not misunderstand the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran but the company itself issued one-third of the total share issue <e> <s> we sold our remaining shares <e> <s> i do not see how that affects in any way the intellectual holding within the company which would of course be protected by the company <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i put the word intellectual in the wrong place <e>", "<cs> not normally my lords sometimes perhaps <e> <s> the sale of shares does not affect an intellectual holding that a company may have in its patents its copyrights and so on <e> <s> those holdings are reflected in the value of the shares that it offers for sale <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord beswick who had such a distinguished career in the late seventies and early eighties as chairman of the organisation knows that i meant no such thing at all <e> <s> indeed much of his work in those early days before privatisation has resulted in the current success <e> <s> our endeavours in this direction will add to his own endeavours <e>", "<cs> my lords i really am sorry that the noble baroness finds it impossible to obtain a clear picture <e> <s> i have tried to paint it as clearly as possible <e> <s> there is a satisfactory outcome in prospect in that as i understand it two of the items which have been on the agenda for some little time are again to <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly the directive on misleading advertising was adopted in september last year <e> <s> that is at least one of a number of items that have been successfully brought to fruition <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand what my noble friend says in regard to frustration but one must realise that we are in a community and that we have to carry our partners and i am sure our partners sometimes say that of us <e> <s> when you have as large a number of people each with various and different domestic issues to be considered at the same time as community issues it is not always the easiest task to reach amicable conclusions in the short time that i fear some noble lords might wish <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what question the noble lord lord bruce of donington was addressing to me <e> <s> on his latter point i think that it is a little wide <e> <s> on his former point he will appreciate with his past connections in europe that it is of course for the presidency of the day to determine exactly what the agenda should be when the council of ministers meets <e>", "<cs> my lords i advocate no particular procedure <e> <s> i outline the facts as they are <e> <s> her majestys government are not happy at the idea that consumer councils or any other council of a particular nomenclature should automatically have a place <e> <s> we believe that when consumer matters come to a relevant point that needs discussion a meeting should be held <e> <s> that again as i said is up to the presidency <e> <s> i have indicated that there is to be a meeting on st may at which some consumer affairs matters will be discussed <e> <s> how far down the agenda the meeting gets i should not like to say <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords i was aware of the interest of the noble lord lord kennet in this matter <e> <s> i wonder whether had the rapporteur set out the case more quickly we might have arrived at a decision more quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the first part of my noble friends question <e> <s> i do not believe that there is any lack of co-ordination on the part of government departments in so far as the department of trade and industry has given support to westlands in terms of the w and w and the eh <e> <s> in so far as other departments are concerned their strategic demands are met by the company as and when those demands arise <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be aware that it is the governments general policy to offer contracts in as open and competitive a way as possible <e> <s> whether or not overseas countries win such contracts is another matter <e> <s> in so far as the helicopter industry is concerned westlands has done extremely well with government contracts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether i am really able to answer on what is the best weapon in a certain circumstance <e> <s> i leave that to my colleagues in the ministry of defence <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the short answer is yes indeed <e> <s> the eh -seater civil military and naval aircraft is being developed with million-worth of department of trade and industry launch-aid which is an expression of our belief in exactly what the noble lord just said <e>", "<cs> no my lords i regret that i cannot confirm that there will be a commitment by the ministry of defence to buy this aircraft <e> <s> it will depend entirely on the circumstances at the time the aircraft is ready and the demands of the services regarding procurements <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for her first remark <e> <s> it is always a pleasure to respond to her questions <e> <s> i cannot agree with her that the treasury proposals are catastrophic but i can well understand that they may have received criticism <e> <s> secondly so far as salvage is concerned only six items have been left outstanding because under the aegis of the national consumer council and in view of the progress being made with guidelines the nationalised industry consumer councils have made great progress themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the noble lords first question i do not think it would be appropriate to undertake to publish a paper <e> <s> no doubt if either he or his noble friend cares to write to me i can give what he is asking for in a written response rather than publishing a paper <e> <s> with regard to his last question fortunately we are blessed with a lot of wisdom which does not include making u-turns <e>", "<cs> my lords no to the first question and no to the second one <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> since i introduced this bill earlier this year it has passed through all its stages in the other place where the government introduced amendments <e> <s> these amendments were technical or procedural and they do not alter the nature or effect of this legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as doorstep selling is concerned some members of the community have domestic difficulties which they have yet to reconcile <e> <s> having said that indication was given that a reconciliation is probable <e> <s> on the consumer credit angle all ministers representing their countries expressed some reservations about the commissions current proposals and have asked the commission to rethink those proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that the noble lord lord bruce of donington is referring to the product liability discussions <e> <s> there are no basic differences of principle <e> <s> i am optimistic that given <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that the ultimate conclusion of these discussions will necessarily be a compromise neither is there any weakness in it <e> <s> the development defence which is causing some difficulties with some countries is likely to be resolved though it is true that certain derogations may apply leaving individual countries particular options over a number of years <e> <s> it is the matter of detail as to the number of years which is currently being discussed <e> <s> however i do not accept that our citizens will become anybodys guinea-pigs at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept what the noble lord says that to is in some lights a very long time <e> <s> i should not like to hazard a guess as to when there might be a successful outcome <e> <s> however i said originally that i was encouraged by the discussions to believe that the outcome is that much nearer than i felt it was when last i reported to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not a fact at this moment in time <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to my noble friend lord campbell of alloway we are not really in favour of separating product liability as between one subject area and another <e>", "<cs> my lords i used that expression to the noble lord rather than saying that his question was hypothetical because the outcome of our discussions is some little way away <e> <s> when we are in complete agreement and it is the intention the hope and the work of the presidency of the council to get complete agreement throughout the whole range of subjects i can give the noble lord a far more accurate answer <e>", "<cs> my lords the permanent representatives are meeting to discuss this subject on th june they having been given three weeks since the last meeting to consult with their governments in an endeavour to find a satisfactory outcome <e> <s> there is obviously some degree of flexibility evident in all countries and i would anticipate that at about a fortnight from that date ministers will meet again <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls with his experience of european matters for his supplementary question with which i can only say that i am in complete agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords it is because we believe in the principle of product liability whatever the product may be <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the minister for trade has recently returned from czechoslovakia where he followed up points made by my right honourable friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary in april and endorsed the efforts of british firms trying to win business <e> <s> a representative team of united kingdom industrialists and bankers will participate in the th annual united kingdom/czechoslovak joint commission to be held in london

matters and trade generally with czechoslovakia for which we are grateful <e> <s> i confirm that chemical materials and products are in fact one of the most important of our exports to czechoslovakia

government <e>", "<cs> my lords i confirm to the noble lord lord bruce of donington that there was a balance of trade in favour of czechoslovakia <e> <s> i confirm also that most of the top ten exports to czechoslavakia have some relevance to the work of my department and by the two methods which i described in my earlier answers we are encouraging the promotion of further business in those areas <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i remember the noble lord lord bottomley having trade talks when he was in another place <e> <s> i fear however that i cannot remember the balance of trade figures at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to both the noble lord lord bruce of donington and the noble lord lord banks for their reception of this bill <e> <s> i have no great peroration to make in replying this morning <e> <s> perhaps the best i can do for your lordships is to respond positively to the very few points that have been raised <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for underlining that <e> <s> i take note of what he says but i do not think that he would expect me to prejudge any action or date of action by the dpp <e> <s> certainly he will be aware that my honourable friend the minister for corporate and consumer affairs in the framework of the financial services bill has matters of this kind very much in the forefront of his mind <e> <s> i should imagine that if there was any necessity in the light of what has been going on in recent months to revise the advice or the regulatory functions of lloyds an opportunity would then be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend asks me so many questions that the best i can do is pick out what i think is the most pertinent one <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt if the noble lord opposite does not find the answer convenient he will ask me another question <e> <s> my noble friend quotes a number of figures <e> <s> the truth of the matter is that the orders for system y which bt have placed represent over two years per cent <e> <s> of its main switching requirement <e> <s> of its total procurement of some million in and something in excess of that for the switching gear accounts for about one-quarter of the total procurement <e> <s> therefore taking all those figures together not one of the figures to which my noble friend refers is incorrect within its own context <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that the noble lord lord bruce of donington referred to what he said were assurances given by my noble friend lord cockfield some months ago <e> <s> as my noble friend lord brabazon of tara explained when replying to a similar question in march this year my noble friend lord cockfield gave no such assurances <e> <s> if noble lords refer to <e>", "<cs> my lords the

such that it is unlikely that the production of major switchboard gear to which the question really refers will employ more people <e> <s> it is the application of that switchboard gear which will provide the employment for those who service it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not government considerations that matter <e> <s> it is the commercial decisions of the companies concerned <e> <s> the american company at t has a turnover of billion dollars the canadian firm of northern telecom has a turnover of billion dollars and siemens of west germany has a turnover of billion dollars <e> <s> the combined telecommunications turnover of gec and plessey is but billion dollars <e>", "<cs> my lords it would appear to me that they are fairly low in the international league <e> <s> that is what i said <e> <s> i have no reason to suppose that i should reconsider what i said <e>", "<cs> my lords let me put it to the noble lord lord cledwyn this way <e> <s> i gave an international ranking in monetary terms related to turnover <e> <s> why is it that west germanys telecommunication system has a per cent <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not denigrating i am stating facts <e> <s> the facts and figures speak for themselves <e> <s> the government have released british telecom from the public sector <e> <s> they therefore have enabled worldwide suppliers gec and plessey included to compete for that business <e> <s> but that amount of business is small in world terms <e> <s> there is an overcapacity of telecommunications production and gec-plessey with a very good product have to find their way into the international market to survive <e> <s> no governmental interference will help that one <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend underlines exactly what i sought to do to list in an order some rankings <e> <s> the product is good but those two very good companies with a very good product cannot rely on the small united kingdom market <e> <s> it represents about half of what they need <e> <s> they will have to go into the export market <e> <s> they are then in a highly competitive business <e>", "<cs> my lords i have sought to answer every question that your lordships have put to me <e> <s> i have sought to do that in commercial terms in number terms <e> <s> your lordships have not invited me and nor have i sought to introduce as the noble lord suggests government policy <e> <s> he knows full well that government policy is designed to encourage our home-based manufacturing industry <e> <s> we do that in a number of ways both at home and overseas in export markets <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may in conformity with our usual practice answer the main opposition speakers comments and in doing so perhaps i may thank them both for their reception of this important statement <e> <s> first i wish to deal with the points made with regard to the financial arrangements and say that british leyland themselves have not asked for any additional moneys and are anticipating that their forward investment programme which has been agreed with the government can be funded from self-generated profits <e>", "<cs> my lords the engine programme of british leyland the a-series the s o and v-series is continuing <e> <s> as i understand it the k-series which is to replace the a-series which is now fitted to all the metros some maestros and some montegos is to be further developed by british leyland <e> <s> with regard to a collaborative motor car the rover and the xx various engine options will in all probability be

think it would be premature of me to suggest to british leyland or to honda which engine should be fitted and where it should be made <e> <s> i do not think that either of the two companies has come down firmly on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept that a motor car which is built as a result of collaboration would be not british <e> <s> if one accepts a substantial local content

into the catering industry is a very valuable thing to do <e> <s> it is a valuable occupation and serves a wide variety of people both home and overseas visitors <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> the house will probably recall that in an article in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much regret that i cannot break down that figure as the noble lord lord dean of beswick asks <e> <s> across the world it is generally thought that our hotel prices are very much in line and i do not think that the noble lord opposite should think only in terms of perhaps the park lane hotels because there are many other lower-priced hotels in our capital city <e>", "<cs> my lords again i understand what my noble friend has said <e> <s> many english students take vacation work throughout the country in the tourist and the catering industry <e> <s> your lordships house will be aware that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment is currently considering the role of the wages councils and their future <e> <s> as i said in answer to an earlier supplementary question so also is my noble friend the minister without portfolio currently considering the restraints to further employment that now occur <e> <s> the wages councils are perhaps one of them <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a misconception as to how many visitors remain in london for their entire stay in this country <e> <s> tourists spread widely across the country into scotland wales and the west country <e> <s> they do not all stay in london <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i agree with the noble noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> as i said in my original answer it is essential that everybody working within the tourist industry should continue to provide good value-for-money services <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the best way that i can reply is to say that i totally agree with my noble friend in his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i was aware of that convention <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede <e> <s> he will know that many of those american families coming to this country are staying in a variety of hotels in and around london at varying price levels to satisfy their own need <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to the noble lords first supplementary question i am afraid that i do not recall nor do i have a note of what the noble lord described as a scandal <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said but if it is a scandal then events which are now under investigation will prove whether or not that is in fact a scandal <e> <s> to turn to the review of sections to again until the investigations by my departments inspectors and investigations by the police are completed and have been reviewed it would be premature for me to suggest or even agree that those sections should be reviewed <e> <s> in regard to the price waterhouse report it is not yet available although i confirm that my department are in touch with price waterhouse and have knowledge of what they have been investigating <e> <s> however until all those investigations have been completed by the various agencies i feel it would be premature of me to give any further judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords no i could not agree with the latter suggestion of the noble lord <e> <s> these matters are for lloyds and lloyds members and their agents to resolve <e> <s> it was for exactly that reason that lloyds came to parliament in asking for additional powers <e> <s> parliament gave those powers to them and they became effective at the beginning of <e> <s> that of course is the consequence of self-regulation <e> <s> it is for lloyds and i know that lloyds are seized of both their responsibilities and their obligations under the powers which were given to them by parliament in the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i gladly confirm what my noble friend lord mowbray and stourton has said <e> <s> lloyds have implemented a great number of the powers for which they asked in a private members bill in <e> <s> they are pursuing even further those remaining powers <e> <s> it is in the interests of lloyds of the members and of others connected with them to ensure that the conduct of the market is satisfactory in all respects <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i can give the noble lord lord ezra an assurance that those dealing on behalf of the small investor will be under an obligation to point out his rights <e> <s> exactly how it will be done i do not know but i think that the noble lord may rest assured on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have a fairly open mind still as to whether there should be one or two <e> <s> one has to remember this is not to prejudge any issue that the chairman of sib is on the miboc and vice versa <e> <s> there is a lot of cross-fertilisation <e> <s> the chief executive and the secretariat serve both boards <e> <s> in effect one might say there is one <e> <s> if as we go along in these next few months both boards decide that the functions could better be arranged and undertaken under a single named board the government would be quite sympathetic to any suggestion put to them <e>", "<cs> my lords is a long time ago to have put down a question <e> <s> i think that my noble friends and i have answered questions fairly regularly and we have now arrived at a situation where three of the consumer councils have agreed their guidelines <e> <s> there are as it were only two to go and i do not think it is unreasonable in such a complex matter that these discussions should take that length of time <e> <s> the guidelines will act as a framework for any of <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the concern my noble friend expresses <e> <s> i have said in answer to an earlier supplementary that the councils would regard their present guidelines as a useful reference point for their contribution to discussion of any regulatory arrangements particularly for the gas industry after privatisation <e> <s> as regards a debate on the consumer councils i am sure my noble friend will recognise that that is a matter for the usual channels and not for me <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can only reply to the noble lord lord bruce of donington in the same way in which i replied to my noble friend <e> <s> if any of your lordships wish to have a debate on consumer councils at any particular time it is open to noble lords to make representations through the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly had no wish to mislead the noble baroness <e> <s> i am quite sure i gave no guarantee at all nor am i able to do so <e> <s> i would repeat that the national gas consumers council itself regards its guidelines as a useful reference point for its contribution to discussion of any regulatory arrangements <e> <s> as i have said there will be room for consumer representation <e> <s> on the noble baronesss latter point i can only repeat that a debate even at the top of the list is not a matter for me <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is somewhat debatable <e> <s> i am quite confident that the nationalised industries do in fact listen and respond to their consumer council representations <e>", "<cs> my lords the guidelines are available from the councils directly and if noble lords make representations to the council they will then be able to obtain their own individual copy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton who indicated to me the area of his concern <e> <s> i should perhaps remind the noble lord that negotiations in gatt are usually aimed at reducing rather than increasing barriers to imports <e> <s> in the particular case which he instances i am not aware that the british film processing laboratories regard imports of used film print as a problem <e> <s> certainly no representations have been made to my department <e> <s> however if the noble lord knows of a specific instance and will inform me of it i shall be very glad to look into it <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will of course recall the interest of the noble lord in this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount for reminding the house of the upsurge in the film industrys business <e> <s> however i have to say that her majestys government are opposed to any protectionist measures <e> <s> we

to give ground <e> <s> the forthcoming gatt round will undoubtedly be concentrating on some of the matters that the noble lord raises <e>", "<cs> my lords in isolation the matter of levies is not attractive to us <e> <s> in regard to the second point made by the noble lord of course i should be very glad to meet them and to do what i can to help if the problem can be clearly identified <e>",

"<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington on two counts first for having given me notice of his intention to use the committee stage this morning as an opportunity to probe a little further into our second reading debate earlier in the month and secondly for his explanation this morning of what gives rise to this probing <e> <s> in the light of this prior notice i have had the opoportunity to prepare a somewhat lengthy reply which i think may be of benefit to the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not able to comment on newspaper reports <e> <s> perhaps i may remind the noble lord that my noble friend the leader of the house will be making a statement later this afternoon with regard to the council meeting in milan over the weekend in which i would suspect the noble lords question will probably be answered <e>", "<cs> my lords in particular the government are pleased to note the proposals with regard to a common market for services including financial services and transport <e> <s> as to the remainder of the noble lords many questions again many of those may very well be answered when as i suggested my noble friend the leader of the house repeats a statement later this afternoon <e> <s> the noble lord would not expect me to pre-empt that statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be better if that question were addressed to my noble friend later this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend with whose comments i agree <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed i also share the regrets of the noble baroness at this position <e> <s> there are no identifiable difficulties <e> <s> one will have to wait for consideration by the scrutiny committee in the other place to see what emerges there <e> <s> however so far there have been no other members states which have raised any objections to the proposals now on the table <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to accept any congratulations from my noble friends behind me on whatever occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to be able to give that information to the noble lord indeed i should like to know myself but until the consideration by the scrutiny committee in the other place is completed i cannot say when the matter will again come before the council of ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale is quite correct in reminding the house that the germans do in fact treat drugs separately <e> <s> while i recognise that they may be seen as perhaps different to other manufactured products i believe that the system of strict liability which is in the current proposals more than adequately deals with this type of product <e> <s> we do not foresee any risk of this country being used as the noble lord suggests for experimental purposes in that regard <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the proposals before the community we do not feel that this is an unhappy position to be in in so far as we were looking towards a completely harmonised system <e> <s> this has not proved practical over the years of negotiation <e> <s> we believe that a partially harmonised system is better than no system at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be quite happy to discuss this matter with my right honourable friend the secretary of state in the hope that i shall be able to expand a little further on the brief reply that i gave the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is quite right <e> <s> the commission first proposed the directive in <e> <s> the matter was debated in part of the pearson report in and again in and by both houses <e> <s> if there is any news that i can impart to your lordships before the summer recess i shall be pleased to advise the noble baroness in order that we can find the opportunity for me to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords since the capacity of undersea cables has increased dramatically <e> <s> the introduction of telecommunication satellites in offered an alternative channel of power <e> <s> costs to the telephone user have accordingly reduced as overall available capacity has been increased <e> <s> in so far as my noble friends second supplementary is concerned the pricing of international telecommunication services is of course a commercial matter for the companies involved but i would expect the current trend to be continued <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot see a politically dangerous situation arising out of my noble friends question which merely sought information <e> <s> he probably put it down in the form in which he thought i might understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords the government did not in fact assist in the setting up of this charitable educational advisory body <e> <s> they made a subscription for one year of which they continued for a second year and then for a third and then gave notice of their intention not to continue <e> <s> it is not a question of selling the computer industrys products <e> <s> a comparison with either france or japan is not fair or true because international comparisons of this nature do not start from the same base <e> <s> secondly the noble lord opposite fails to recognise the considerable aid given to the industry through other sources notably the british council and our foreign posts overseas <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not reconsider my answer to the noble lord lord hatch of lusby <e> <s> that is the truthful answer to his perfectly proper question <e> <s> i remind your lordships that the dti alone gives over million worth of assistance to the it industry <e>", "<cs> my lords that really is a very different question but both the government and the industry are in very close collaborative contact with other firms in that industry in europe and elsewhere in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hatch of lusby asks exactly the same question but in a different way <e> <s> i do think that i have answered his question <e>", "<cs> my lords like a number of noble lords particularly those coming from an engineering background <e> <s> i rather regret that we are spending a beautiful sunny afternoon in july in discussing such an important subject because the importance of industry is in no doubt at all <e> <s> despite the hour and the number of contributors to our short debate this afternoon its importance is in no way undermined <e> <s> a number of speakers have mentioned the importance of industry as part of our economic stability and also its importance in other areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not seek to equate anything at all <e> <s> what i sought to underline was the importance of the service industries and there is no doubt that modern technology the making of things in fact may be assisted with such programmes as cadcam <e> <s> cadcam needs servicing telecommunications need servicing need selling need financing <e> <s> these are the service industries <e> <s> to an extent they go hand in hand <e> <s> there is certainly no equating nor equalising <e> <s> but when we talk of industry as the question does i seek not to draw a blind across the importance of the service industries and their contribution to our economic strength <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend will allow me to say that her congratulations to me are misplaced <e> <s> the congratulations are due to the industry which have done so well <e>", "<cs> my lords yes it was in the region of <e>", "<cs> no my lords since the original question refers to new products <e>", "<cs> my lords there are certain problems with regard to non-tariff barriers <e> <s> but it is not totally true to say that all south american states prohibit the import of our tractors <e> <s> for example mexico took of our tractors last year <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it is <e> <s> of the notable commonwealth countries australia took <e> <s> we then find ourselves with rather lower figures which account for around per cent <e> <s> some of which went to commonwealth countries in varying and different numbers <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a very large volume of used-tractor exports <e> <s> it is a matter which is valuable to the new tractor industry <e> <s> it is one which is encouraged through various agencies and something which we hope will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the figures which the noble lord lord rochester gave when opening his supplementary question but the noble lord will probably recall that it was only three years ago that parliament decided to replace out of the industrial training boards with voluntary arrangements <e> <s> our present view remains that a national training levy such as the noble lord suggests is not necessarily the best way to achieve effective employer investment in training <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his question <e> <s> it certainly is not exhortation <e> <s> it remains part of the campaign that we have started to raise the profile of the need for training which is to the benefit of the employer as well as the nation <e>", "<cs> my lords i recall that the noble baroness raised exactly that point some years ago when we discussed industrial training boards <e> <s> what she said may be so to some extent but british industry spends only per employee on training whereas our competitors both in europe and america spend considerably more three times as much and sometimes seven times as much to their benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the noble lords invitation not to go into specific figures <e> <s> i agree that we spend considerably less than our competitors on training <e> <s> for the government have a planned spending programme of billion <e> <s> we expect to be able to help people with training and retraining which is double the number we helped in <e> <s> i think that that will go a good deal of the way towards helping to improve skills in certain industries <e>", "<cs> no my lords they do not show that <e> <s> we should like to step it up and we have commissioned a report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful again to my noble friend she is right <e> <s> it is invidious to draw comparisons because they are not totally adequate <e> <s> our adult training programme offers grants to help employers with the cost of training <e> <s> some million has been spent and people have been helped this year through this scheme alone <e> <s> there is to be a further expansion and employers can utilise the services of the msc to great advantage to themselves and to the nation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked me a number of questions <e> <s> i can best answer him by again saying that we are drawing the attention of employers to the survey <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord trenchard is probably quite right <e> <s> i do not think that i can agree with him that the reasons he puts forward are the only reasons <e> <s> i am grateful to him for his second supplementary question because i hope that this exchange of question and answer will be widely reported and that british industry will appreciate that the government are giving considerable support but cannot do the whole job on their own and that it is in the interests of british industry itself to invest perhaps something in the order of or per cent <e> <s> of payroll not the per cent <e> <s> of turnover currently invested which will return to them a dividend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that the noble lord lord davies of leek is right <e> <s> there are some sectors of british industry where training is of a continuing high standard there are other sectors where it lags behind <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the great concern expressed by the rhetorical question of the noble lord lord jacques and i take note of all that he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the disappointment of the noble baroness who has worked so very hard over the years to bring this matter to a satisfactory conclusion as the house will recall <e> <s> so far as the decision is concerned i am afraid that i am not really able to say yea or nay to that because if the brussels conversations go on through the night and into tomorrow obviously there will not be an answer forthcoming this afternoon <e> <s> i can give the house an assurance that if the opportunity arises i shall see that it is informed of any decision though of course exactly by what means is not within my province <e>", "<cs> my lords whether the council of ministers will sit further into today or later this week or next week is a matter for them and one can foresee though i hope that this will not happen that the matter may be deferred <e> <s> as regards the latter question of the noble baroness i can only repeat that as soon as a decision is reached i shall seek to inform the house of that decision <e> <s> however it is not in my province to determine the method by which such information will reach your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the concern of the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale in this matter <e> <s> as he acknowledges i sent him a fairly full letter a copy of which i placed in the library <e> <s> it may be argued that the development risk defence does to some extent emasculate the directives provision for strict liability in respect of drugs and in particular that it might let off the hook the producer of a modern-day thalidomide disaster <e> <s> but i think it must be remembered that the test of the state of scientific and technological knowledge of the time is a very tough and dynamic test and i do not foresee the difficulties that the noble lord is suggesting <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord broxbourne for his question <e> <s> certainly the adoption of the directive will bring direct benefits to consumers <e> <s> we also believe that it will bring direct benefit to producers in that though it will not be a complete harmonisation to a great extent it will be a removal of a barrier to free international trade which is one of our aims in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the letter sets out fairly lengthily the position with regard to the supply or the manufacture of drugs in other european countries <e> <s> we do not foresee that a patient in this country will be at any disadvantage as to the source of the manufactured drug since in this country we have of course the act on the protection of medicines which should give total protection to any patient here <e>", "<cs> my lords again i promise the noble baroness that i really appreciate what she is asking but i have to say that i shall inform the house as to the outcome of this afternoons discussions in brussels in the best way that i can <e> <s> i shall certainly be seeking the advice of my noble friend the chief whip who no doubt will discuss through the usual channels with the chief whip of the opposition the best way in which this may be done <e>", "<cs> my lords in not agreeing with the noble lord i think that that question is very wide of the matter before us this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell my noble friend that the united states of america continued to be the largest inward investor to the united kingdom followed by west germany and then switzerland <e> <s> about per cent <e> <s> of employment is represented by inward investment decisions taken last year <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand what the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe is speaking about <e> <s> i was discussing this matter with the scottish development agency only about days ago <e> <s> i have formed the view from information i received there and also from my overseas visits that regional grants are not the prime consideration of overseas companies considering investment in the country <e> <s> prime considerations rather than grants are the stability of labour and the stability of our financial systems <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord bruce of donington that a number of inward investment decisions are certainly based on the confidence that manufacturers have in our labour force <e> <s> so far as the rather involved sums that the noble lord has offered me i can answer him by saying yes as he asked me i will convey that information to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed my noble friend is quite right and that comes over frequently when one is abroad talking to potential investors <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i have not got a breakdown across the country of where these jobs have been created <e> <s> i shall certainly let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be so <e> <s> i do not have those figures since the question on the order paper does not refer to that but to inward investment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not prepared to comment upon that <e>", "<cs> my lords of course cash incentive is an important factor <e> <s> it is not however the most important factor taken by companies considering investment in this country <e> <s> at the end of the day we have to say that the competition across europe indeed across the world to encourage investment from other countries which advances so much in technology management techniques and so on is something we have to fight very hard <e> <s> but this investment is of great economic and social benefit to this country and is to be further encouraged <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can see what lies behind that question which is so very wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be a sad thing in the case of a country such as ours operating in the competitive way that exists if there was not a transference of funds as between one country and another <e> <s> other countries encourage funds from this country and we derive considerable benefit from the dividends of those investments <e> <s> similarly we encourage inward investment to the benefit of those countries which can buy our products <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very important factor and it has given rise to great opportunities which have proved to be very beneficial and which help our competitive edge in world markets <e>", "<cs> my lords we estimate from the surveys which the department makes that a number of jobs have been retained but in new jobs will have been created and will be taken up when those companies come on stream <e>", "<cs> my lords as i explained to the noble baroness on th june the government are carefully studying the director generals report <e> <s> his recommendations have significant implications which are being considered by the several departments concerned and the government will make a further statement as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i recall what i said on th june because i looked it up again last night <e> <s> it certainly would not be right for the government to act on one of the director generals individual recommendations before making a clear assessment of the overall report <e> <s> as i said in reply to the noble baroness on th june this crosses departmental frontiers and it will be some little while before a full assessment of the director generals report has been made <e> <s> we can then give advice <e>", "<cs> my lords even were we to do such as the noble lord suggests it would in fact serve no useful purpose at all because the boards send their bills to landlords and not to tenants <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that <e> <s> what i said was that we do not think it right to pick out of a very complicated report one particular item and deal with it <e> <s> we have to take the report in its entirety <e> <s> i think however that the noble baroness should be aware indeed i feel very sure that she is aware that generally each area board prepares an explanatory leaflet in consultation with the local electricity consultative council and that a leaflet is usually available free from showrooms in the boards area <e> <s> there are a number of boards and somewhat different practices in each board area but generally that information is available <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are not without courage as they have demonstrated in a number of measures over the last few years to the great benefit of everybody <e> <s> secondly the noble baroness will be aware that an aggrieved individual has recourse through the courts and should take the action which is available to him and not always rely upon government to fish him out <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave it may be for the convenience of your lordships if i now make a statement on the european community directive on product liability <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington and to the noble baroness for their reception of the statement i have just made <e> <s> may i also endorse the remarks of the noble lord lord bruce of donington with regard to the noble baroness <e> <s> i hope that this afternoon she will feel that the efforts she has made over a number of years in poking and prodding a number of ministers on this side of the house have borne fruit and that her hopes have been largely realised by the adoption of the directive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for his acceptance <e> <s> i would say to him that we have three years in which to enact legislation to conform to the directive <e> <s> of course until such legislation has been passed the solutions that the directive contains would not be applicable <e> <s> i would not expect us however to wait three years before we enact legislation <e> <s> i should hope that we would get our consultations under way shortly <e> <s> but i am sure that the noble lord will appreciate as the house will appreciate that i cannot determine here and now when legislation will be brought forward <e> <s> i hope that it will not take three years <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it is illogical <e> <s> as i said it was necessary to agree with our partners so that we could move this matter forward <e> <s> my noble friend lord belstead has written to the noble lord i think he has received this letter explaining that the producer of processed food products will be liable under the terms of the directive for any defect in his products so even in the absence of express terms in the contract to supply the supplier remains strictly liable for the consequences of supplying a product which is not fit for its purpose <e> <s> i do not believe therefore that the consumer will be under any disadvantage at all <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of wearying your lordships on this particular point i answered the noble lord lord allen last week <e> <s> an argument has been put forward that the development risk defence emasculates the directives provision for strict liability in respect of drugs <e> <s> in particular it is held that it would let a modern-day thalidomide off the hook <e> <s> but we do not believe that is so because it must be remembered that the test of the state of scientific and technological knowledge at the time is a very tough and dynamic factor <e> <s> we would therefore not agree with what the noble lord is in part suggesting <e> <s> i am sorry that i did not quite understand the drift of his second question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lady hooper for her reception of this statement <e> <s> of course i appreciate that her knowledge of european matters is much greater than my own <e> <s> she will know that all the european directives are reported upon at the fifth year and in my statement i referred to the review which will take place at years <e> <s> so far as the united kingdom is concerned we are continually in touch with both consumer organisations and producer organisations and i have little doubt that they will make their feelings abundantly clear as soon as the legislation is enacted <e> <s> we do not share some of the fears expressed by industry which have recently been reported <e> <s> we believe that this is a good measure which will aid both consumer and producer <e>", "<cs> my lords there have over the years nine years i think it is been consultations with a wide variety of bodies trade bodies and their views have been represented <e> <s> it has been said that over those nine years their views have changed considerably <e> <s> some were in favour at the beginning but were not so much in favour at the end of the day and vice versa <e> <s> i attended with my honourable friend the minister responsible for corporate affairs meetings with the cbi and was somewhat disappointed that they shifted their ground on a number of occasions <e> <s> we do not accept some of the objections which they put forward and which they included in a round robin letter to members of parliament and indeed to members of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much regret that i cannot go further this afternoon on that matter since i have had available only since last week the general text and not the definitive text <e> <s> so i have not yet had the opportunity of making the comparison that the noble lord asks of me <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> there is no intention to impose compulsory insurance <e> <s> indeed the remedy that the noble lord suggests is available to people today under the law of contract

understanding is that all businesses carry a product liability insurance <e> <s> most retailers carry a civil liability insurance and there is cover there <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the

bruce of donington put to me in his opening remarks <e> <s> at the risk of upsetting the order of our proceedings i should perhaps do that now <e> <s> he asked me when we were anticipating bringing into effect this bill when enacted <e> <s> the greater part of the bill is designed to be brought into effect at the same time but some of the provisions are free-standing such as those related to the disqualification of directors and the attachment of personal liability for wrongful trading <e> <s> others such as the provisions for licensing of insolvency practitioners will need to be brought into force in advance of the main procedural provisions to ensure that they are in existence at the time that the practitioners who are then duly authorised are likely to undertake insolvency work <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly not the intention of the government to have an amending bill before this bill when hopefully it becomes an act comes into operation <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord selkirk asked a number of questions with regard to the authorised insolvency practitioner whether or not he is acting in a liquidation <e> <s> the purpose of requiring that in all such companies receiving the services of a liquidator he shall be a licensed liquidator is precisely that which the noble lord lord meston set out in his remarks <e> <s> one is not here concerned with as it were the competence or incompetence but with the regulation of someone who sets out to practise as an insolvency practitioner whether he be an accountant a lawyer or some other kind of person <e> <s> those persons will have to <e>", "<cs> my lords because at that stage there may not be a question of insolvency and only a licensed practitioner should determine whether or not the company is insolvent <e>

properly and professionally the circumstances of the company <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg formally to move that this house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> to which i have spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington for explaining the purport of his three amendments and the worries that perhaps lie behind the setting down of them <e> <s> i have to say here and i do this with great sincerity that throughout the last ten or eleven months i have come very much to admire the tenacity with which the noble lord opposite applies himself to this bill and have come very much to hold in high regard his not inconsiderable experience in this field which noble lords will recognise is not shared by me <e> <s> however i think that perhaps on this occasion he has perhaps got this one a little wrong and i shall invite your lordships to reject his invitation to accept these three amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord lord bruce asked a specific question <e> <s> i feel bound to respond by underlining what the noble lord lord benson has so adequately said which is really what i wanted to say in response <e> <s> there is one particular point which was mentioned by the noble lord lord benson <e> <s> he asked how i felt the department of trade and industrys service was going to be able to cope with this and whether we in fact had the expertise <e> <s> i assure your lordships that in the insolvency service we have a considerable amount of expertise in these matters <e> <s> i am equally sure that that decision will take on board any experience any advice and any guidance which is given by the recognised bodies arising out of these consultations <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not really think that i can make further comment <e> <s> i think that in fact i really have covered everything that can be said in answer to these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can add anything new <e> <s> i

lord for his explanation <e> <s> indeed i should like to take this opportunity to set out clearly why these two amendments are not necessary <e> <s> directors of companies being capable of being wound up under part of the act are already covered by the clause <e> <s> this is because clause provides that section of the companies act applies for the purposes of sections and of this bill <e> <s> that ensures that section of the act which defines company as including any company which may be wound up under that part of the act to which i have referred operates to apply the same definition of

experience gained from the operation of this bill and obviously to reflect the evolution of commercial practice and standards <e> <s> that is the very point to which the noble lord referred in dealing with the companies act <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has followed every single word that has been said on the bill in this house <e> <s> i am surprised that he should think that we would depart from what is absolutely fundamental <e> <s> why should he bring forward at this stage a hypothetical situation which indeed might apply to his own side <e> <s> he shakes his head i shake mine also <e>

amendment <e> <s> he will recall that he and i discussed this matter when he expressed his fears that the practitioner might be put in a disadvantageous position <e> <s> the noble lord is proposing in his amendment that special deposits should not be required as a condition of supply to a practitioner what one might call a re-supply <e> <s> however it seems to us quite reasonable and quite legitimate for an industry to require a deposit where there might be some concern about a customers ability to pay <e> <s> it is therefore perhaps not unjust that the same principle should apply in the case of an insolvency practitioner seeking a supply as would apply in the case of any other new customer <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel i ought to respond <e> <s> in attempting to make our feeling clear i seem to have clouded the issue <e> <s> we are not looking for special deposits <e> <s> we are suggesting that where a supply has been curtailed by virtue of a companys failure to pay and the administrator asks for a reconnection he is to be treated by the utility the supplying company as dealing with a new customer <e> <s> in the position of a new customer the supplier has properly i suggest to take into account any factors relevant to the supply of that product <e> <s> if he says you are a new customer i want a quarters assessed payment that is not unreasonable <e> <s> but the bill provides that in no way can a special deposit be charged nor a special tariff rate which in any way suggests that there can be by virtue of that a recoupment of amounts previously owing <e> <s> i do not think that the analogy i drew is so very different from the real situation which the noble lord suggested <e>", "<cs> no my lords i did not <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the house that we have perfect clues as to what the noble lord is talking about <e> <s> i suspect that wittingly or unwittingly the noble lord seeks to turn my own words upon myself because when i was referring to special deposits i did not say that the bill provides for special deposits <e> <s> in fact i have sought to explain that special payments cannot be levied <e> <s> if the administrator is a new customer then those charges which it is the practice of the supplying company to levy can be levied in this case <e> <s> i then said that any special tariff or special charge is not allowed by the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will turn to page of the marshalled list under amendment no <e> <s> as i sought to describe in introducing this amendment after clause we have to insert a new clause <e> <s>

with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this amendment was made in order to provide a defence in circumstances where a transaction was at an undervalue but was nevertheless in the best interests of the company <e> <s> for instance as part of a rescue operation a company might sell off surplus stock more cheaply than usual because it is more important to the company at that time to obtain cash quickly than to realise the maximum price over an extended period <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the remarks of the noble lord lord mischon <e> <s> certainly the law society

regard to the increasing opportunity for competition in this field of activity <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept what the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe says with regard to the entry of mercury <e> <s> this is the start of a competitive process which will help british telecom to maintain sensible prices <e> <s> on the pricing structure perhaps i may commend to your lordships a careful study which shows that although some prices have been increased there are additional advantages being offered in that price structure <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord hankey who has put the position quite succinctly <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friend lord campbell of alloway the government certainly have no cause to complain about the way in which the director general of oftel undertakes his duties which have been shown quite specifically in his recent report as being fair and reasonable in accordance with the act <e>", "<cs> my lords the rpi minus formula covers across-the-board charges and is designed to ensure that over the first five years british telecoms charges fall in real terms <e> <s> on the second question raised by my noble friend yes certainly every endeavour will be made by my secretary of state and by the director general to promote further competition in this exciting new field of technology <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks essentially three supplementary questions <e> <s> i answer them in this order <e> <s> there was no question whatsoever of a pre-emptive strike <e> <s> it is entirely up to the noble lord opposite and others what interpretation they place on the report <e> <s> lastly the governments policies have enabled us to improve manufacturing output investment and productivity and to realise record levels of manufactured exports <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my answer is satisfactory in that it is the answer to the question on the order paper <e> <s> i recognise as will all your lordships that a select committee of your lordships house chaired by such an eminent person as my noble friend lord aldington is important <e> <s> there is no irregularity in what the government did <e> <s> the chairman of the committee released the report at the time that he did <e> <s> he released his own press statement at one minute past midnight <e> <s> in that statement he called for interviews which could be held all day tuesday and for a press conference to be held at <e> <s> it was therefore not unreasonable that my right honourable friend the secretary of state should respond at the same time as the report was made public <e>", "<cs> my lords there was no irregularity <e> <s> if the noble lord refers to erskine may on parliamentary practice th edition page he will find that there was no irregularity <e> <s> the press statement made by my noble friend lord aldington was widely available <e> <s> it is my understanding that members of all parties had access to that wide circulation <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend the leader of the house has just suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords one great trouble is that the noble lord frequently takes selected passages from a report to suit his argument <e> <s> i am suggesting to your lordships house that the report in <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend felt that it was necessary to make the statement so that the report could be set in the total perspective <e> <s> otherwise it might have produced a biased and misleading view of the performance and prospects of the economy which i repeat i outined in an earlier answer and which are satisfactory and improving <e>", "<cs> my lords i am merely repeating the fact as the noble lord knows full well because he has read the press notice issued by my secretary of state that the report needs to be set in perspective <e> <s> otherwise on a first reading someone might have had a biased and misleading view of the performance and prospects of the economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat again that manufacturing output since the trough of recession in the early s has risen by per cent <e> <s> investment by per cent <e> <s> and manufacturing productivity by per cent <e> <s> and the volume of our manufactured exports is at a record level <e> <s> that is an improving position which is what i said <e>", "<cs> my lords since the question is related entirely to this report i am not prepared to be drawn upon that question this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble baroness feels that that answer is a better one <e> <s> however she will recall that on the th june and the th july i answered a question similar to her last supplementary <e> <s> the matter is complex and the director general of fair trading has raised a number of points which have cross-departmental frontiers <e> <s> in fact it is the necessarily detailed consultations and conversations which are to some extent delaying the governments full response to all the recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords as i explained we are disinclined to take in isolation one recommendation out of a series <e> <s> perhaps i could remind the noble baroness that the department of energy has produced a leaflet called <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed that the noble baroness finds no satisfaction in this series of answers <e> <s> i can add nothing further to that which i have already said <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the leaflet to which i referred is available in citizens advice bureaux and from supply showrooms <e> <s> the noble baroness will know that pricing structures are shown on the back of bills and accounts <e> <s> she will also recall that the accounts are sent to landlords that is the first buyer of the supply rather than to the tenants <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble baroness says but of course i cannot dictate to the post office what should be disseminated through their offices <e> <s> i shall certainly see that both the department of energy and the post office are made aware of the request of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been advertisements in journals and newspapers as well as on the radio and television <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly under the terms of the act the director general of oftel has the opportunity to say whether or not he thinks his functions and duties are sufficient <e> <s> if they are not he may make a reference to the mmc which will then give consideration to the licence conditions <e> <s> i have <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend did not in fact do as the noble lord suggests <e> <s> may i draw to the attention of the noble lord opposite the conclusion in paragraph in which the director general says <e>", "<cs> my lords the advisory committee on telecommunications which has taken over substantially the role of pounc acts on behalf of consumers and advises the director general of oftel in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first question is concerned the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe will recall that he addressed the same question to my noble friend lord brabazon of tara about a fortnight ago <e> <s> my noble friend answered saying that the redundancies to which the noble lord referred are only in small part due to this <e> <s> the reason is the running down of that existing factory in scotland and the products which that factory made <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not allow my imagination to run riot as perhaps the noble lord opposite does <e>", "<cs> my lords on the point about taking the advice of the cbi perhaps i may say that the cbi continually puts submissions to us and they are considered by my department <e> <s> in regard to subsidy i am not able to comment on what it is reputed that others do <e> <s> i can say that the government stand with all the support services that are available not only for the telecommunications industry but all industry in the furtherance of their activities particularly in overseas countries <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord opposite will recall that parliament decided during the passage of the telecommunications bill which effectively brought about privatisation that the government should stand apart from the activities of that company unless the national security or international events forced the secretary of state to take powers <e> <s> those duties are set out in part i of the bill <e> <s> parts ii and iii of the bill leave the director general of oftel with the functions that he should undertake and parliament gave him those functions <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact of the matter is that a reducing number of exporters have taken advantage of the scheme <e> <s> in for example were using the facilities <e> <s> the current figure is down to <e> <s> in addition the service is losing money <e> <s> as a result of the consultations which took place earlier this year we were satisfied that there was an availability of finance through the normal banking channels to satisfy the needs of small and other exporters <e>", "<cs> my lords the policies of her majestys government have improved our exporting performance quite considerably over a number of years <e> <s> secondly i can give the noble lord opposite the assurance that any matters concerning industry and particularly exporting are discussed with all relevant ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords my honourable friend the minister of trade and industry announced on th october this year the finishing of this particular facility concerning the ecgd but it will not finish completely for two years so enabling exporters to make alternative arrangements which as i have already said the banking channels are ready and able to deal with <e>", "<cs> my lords in general terms i think that we would probably agree with my noble friend but certainly decisions on overseas investments are best left to the commercial judgment of the companies concerned and that investment in south africa is making a contribution to the economy of that country <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have on a number of occasions made quite clear their abhorrence of the regime in force in south africa <e> <s> but we do not believe that the withdrawal of our investment or of our economic activity which employs so many of the population of south africa is the best way to ensure change <e>", "<cs> my lords since my noble friends question addresses the position in south africa i would prefer not to be drawn on the rest of africa <e> <s> there is no doubt in the governments mind that sound investment in south africa is one of the best ways of ensuring and aiding change in the direction to which i think we would all wish that regime to go <e>", "<cs> my lords in general terms of course i would agree with the noble lord lord monson <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact that some companies may have withdrawn their investments is a commercial decision for them <e> <s> i do not believe that it bears at all upon the underlying reference in the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot <e> <s> since there have been exchange rate changes in recent weeks i have not made the calculation <e> <s> it would be dangerous for me to give a view on valuations by commercial companies of their assets <e> <s> i do not think they would thank me and nor do i think my noble friend would do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that what the noble lord has said is in fact correct nor is it indeed true <e> <s> again it is for the individual companies to make their investment decisions <e> <s> we believe that investing in south africa and the benefits that accrue to south africans of all races by virtue of that investment is the best way of helping to make the change which both the people in south africa and ourselves would wish to see <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bruce of donington is trying to mislead either me or your lordships house <e> <s> the investment is a result of the decisions of individual companies <e> <s> it represents their commercial decision <e> <s> it is not a matter in which the british government can or will issue directions <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be quite wrong for us to encourage the removal of british investment in south africa <e> <s> that investment is the largest foreign investment in south africa <e> <s> it has made a contribution and continues to make a contribution to the wellbeing of that country <e> <s> were that investment to be removed there would be i suggest something approaching economic chaos in that country in which then no progress along the direction which the noble lord seeks could ever possibly be made <e>", "<cs> my lords long-term unemployment was one of the criteria used by the government when redrawing the assisted area map during the review of regional industrial policy which took place last year <e> <s> i would refer the noble lord to the recent statement of my noble friend the secretary of state for employment which gave further recognition to the problems of the long-term unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords i remind the noble lord again of the statement made by my noble friend the secretary of state for employment on th november in which he outlined two initiatives which were about to take place <e> <s> my noble friend will be announcing very shortly full details of the pilot scheme in assisted areas <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord would not expect me to pick out one specific area <e> <s> as the noble lord mentioned in his original question a number of areas are suffering from excessively high unemployment <e> <s> the government have spent more than billion in attracting new industry and other enterprises <e> <s> the noble lord will know that the change in the regional policy through both grant and selective assistance was designed to encourage jobs <e> <s> although that scheme has been operating for only a year there is already evidence that it is working and that jobs are being created particularly for example in the west midlands <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said originally the pilot scheme areas will be announced by my noble friend quite shortly although it is true that these will include assisted areas and areas outside so that a comparative figure may be allowed <e> <s> there are of course other initiatives already taking place with a view to alleviating the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords at the end of the day more than million will be spent in regional assistance <e> <s> we believe that although there has been a cut that money can be very much more effectively used as it is directed towards job creation rather than capital investment <e> <s> one should bear in mind a significant series of figures one of which is the fact that in the united kingdom per cent <e> <s> of the working population are in work <e> <s> that figure is some percentage points higher than the average across oecd countries <e>", "<cs> my lords no i am afraid i cannot add anything to answer the question of the noble lord lord diamond other than to repeat that my noble friend the secretary of state for employment will be announcing quite shortly full details of the pilot scheme arrangement <e> <s> i will ensure that his attention is drawn to that question so that he may take care of it in the presentation of that detail <e>", "<cs> my lords the grant money in the assisted areas is devoted to any new industry or any existing industry that creates new jobs rather than transfers jobs from another area <e> <s> in addition selective assistance is available under certain criteria for both new industry and existing industry development again with the accent being upon the creation of new or the perpetuation of existing jobs <e>", "<cs> oh dear <e> <s> my lords i am so sorry for the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that he should make such a series of wild allegations <e>", "<cs> my lords let me give the noble lord an example of where the governments regional policy has worked extremely well <e> <s> the west midlands became an intermediate area last november <e> <s> more than million of grant and more than million of total investment has been put into that area since that time and jobs have been created or safeguarded <e> <s> our policies do work and i refute the allegation which the noble lord makes <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments economic and employment policies most particularly those which have resulted in improved productivity competitiveness and investment in british industry are all designed to have the result of improving our general commercial position and they have achieved that <e> <s> it is as a result of those policies that further long-term jobs will be created and maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords in essence i should like to say yes but i think the noble lord will recognise that no invitations have yet been issued for self-regulatory organisations to register <e> <s> this will of course come about when the bill is published at the end of this year <e> <s> but certainly i am grateful to the noble lord for his question this afternoon because any self-regulatory organisation so applying will have to ensure that its rules conform with the proposed legislation and that membership is sufficiently controlled to meet the requirements that will be set down in the proposed legislation to which i hope your lordships house and the other place will agree in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord will agree that i cannot pre-judge the outcome of the proposed legislation <e> <s> but the principle in this is that the self-regulation will be within a statutory framework and therefore enforceable <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage i can assure your lordships house that we are well prepared to receive any representations about any point that might be part of the measure that we envisage <e>", "<cs> my lords no i cannot and i am not going to do so because the noble lord lord bruce of donington knows very well that we are not talking about a project we are talking about a dimension <e> <s> esprit is a new dimension <e> <s> it is but two years old <e> <s> it is a dimension in which collaboration will enable the united kingdom together with european partners to become a competitive force in world <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i congratulate the noble lord lord williams of elvel on his appearance on the front bench opposite <e> <s> i am sorry as i think he is that on his first appearance on that bench he should have to raise a question of such delicacy yet at the same time such importance <e> <s> in answering him this evening and i should like to assure all noble lords of this i recognise the experience and eminence in the field of banking of the noble lord lord williams and indeed his experience in matters pertaining to the london metal exchange <e> <s> of course i noted from the order paper his call for inquiries into some aspects of this question <e> <s> i shall try to attempt to answer his points but i must make it clear from the outset that the governments overriding concern is to restore orderly trading in tin <e> <s> this of course implies agreement between the international tin council and its creditors on a way of settling the councils outstanding obligations <e> <s> her majestys government are involved in discussions with all interested parties <e> <s> i feel quite sure your lordships will understand our concern that these discussions are not in any way prejudiced by what is said here today <e> <s> i shall therefore note most carefully all the points that <e>", "<cs> my lords once these negotiations are completed and there is a return to orderly trading we shall then have the benefit of the advice of the board and its committee and can make a judgment on that question at that time <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot because we do not monitor to that fineness of date <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord opposite will recognise that we have of course other international obligations to which we have to give consideration before we can reach a decision with regard to the banning or otherwise of krugerrands <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the actions of other commonwealth countries will have a bearing upon our consideration of the matters to which the question refers <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer for the impressions that may have been accepted by other people <e> <s> the communique is quite clear <e> <s> paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord opposite appreciates that i cannot put a timescale on the consideration of this matter since we are in touch with our commonwealth colleagues <e> <s> we also have to consider as i suggested earlier our international obligations <e> <s> one cannot transcend the other <e> <s> as regards the noble lords last point there is no question of her majestys government wriggling out of any obligation which they have entered into <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not know at this moment whether it is impossible consistent with our international obligations <e>", "<cs> my lords the machinery for regulating anti-competitive practices has generally worked well <e> <s> because it operates on a discretionary basis it is flexible enough to take account of developments in the market place and of the special circumstances of particular cases <e> <s> nevertheless the government keep the effectiveness of all their policies under regular review and my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry intends to give attention to this important area in the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend asks a number of questions <e> <s> if he is suggesting that the number of bodies responsible for competitive policy is too great all i can say is that in many instances it is rather better to have an overlap at the margins than to have loopholes <e> <s> the legislation gives specific functions to each authority <e> <s> broadly speaking the director-general of fair trading has powers of investigation and referral to the monopolies and mergers commission and the commission reports where the public interest lies <e> <s> the secretary of state has powers of remedial action where appropriate <e> <s> in that way we feel that the interests of all the bodies to which my noble friend refers are well served <e>", "<cs> my lords three acts essentially take care of nearly all that the noble lord speaks of the restrictive trade practices act the fair trading act and the competition act <e> <s> the introduction of a right of private action would involve the fundamental innovation of the statutory prohibition of certain kinds of behaviour which i think would sit uneasily with the discretionary nature of the rest of united kingdom competition legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his earlier remarks <e> <s> the government look at the effectiveness of their policies and in this regard i have already said that my right honourable friend is to do so <e> <s> legislation in this field particularly is complex <e> <s> with regard to the time procedures most references to the monopolies and mergers commission have a statutory time limit which is typically nine months <e> <s> if my noble friend will forgive me i feel that self-regulation is a little wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel sure that the noble lord will have taken account of my main answer in which i said that my right honourable friend is to pay attention to that matter shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> he will recall that measure because he had an important part to play in it <e> <s> the division between the restrictive practices court and the monopolies and mergers commission has proved extremely effective in dealing with a number of the problems that arise <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls reads <e>", "<cs> my lords the latter position does not arise <e> <s> as to the first question that the noble lord asks parliament has given the director-general of oftel the necessary powers to look into matters concerning british telecommunications <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i accept what my noble friend lord renton says with regard to the commision and the court of justice of the european communities in so far as competition law is concerned as between one member state and another <e> <s> so far as there being one single body is concerned this is a point to which i shall draw the attention of my right honourable friend <e> <s> i have indicated however that we feel that the three arms that we have are a better way of attending to all the <e>", "<cs> my lords i have replied to the noble lord lord molloy in an earlier answer <e> <s> i did say that the introduction of a right of private action would involve fundamental innovation of the statutory prohibition of certain kinds of behaviour <e> <s> this would sit somewhat unhappily alongside the present discretionary nature of our procedures <e> <s> nevertheless i take the point that the noble lord makes <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not dispute the first two figures the noble lord has given but he above many other people will realise the great difficulty there is in bringing to court a prosecution that succeeds <e> <s> there is no lack of effort put into the investigations which take on average over a year to come to any conclusion as to whether there is a prospect of a prosecution <e>", "<cs> my lords of course it is not only the dpp who brings prosecutions <e> <s> they are also brought by my department <e> <s> however as my right honourable friend the prime minister stated in response to the chairman of the stock exchange the government are committed to pursuing financial fraud vigorously and effectively <e> <s> we have already taken steps to make prosecutions more effective <e> <s> in that response my right honourable friend the prime minister said that the government accepted the importance of ensuring that resources for investigating fraud were adequate <e> <s> those resources are now under review <e>", "<cs> my lords prosecutions are brought where there is a probability of securing a conviction <e> <s> that does not depend upon the number of staff <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand that reference it had to do with matters concerning lloyds whereas the question on the order paper this afternoon really deals with insider dealings <e> <s> i think the noble lords question is a little wide of the original one <e>", "<cs> my lords the fraud investigation group which was set up in january of this year was in part set up to deal with this growing problem <e> <s> it is staffed by about people <e> <s> altogether there are about people involved in investigation of fraud in various and different areas <e> <s> it would not be possible for me to itemise exactly how many personnel are engaged at any one time on one specific aspect <e> <s> however i repeat that we are undertaking a review of the resources available in this area <e> <s> those resources will be made adequate to attend to this growing problem highlighted by noble lords this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether it is by three <e> <s> i said that the resources available were being reviewed <e> <s> i am afraid i cannot guess at the outcome of that review <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is for me to determine whether a statement should be made <e> <s> however i feel quite confident that if the noble and learned lord any of his colleagues or any other noble lord were in perhaps some weeks time to put down a question inquiring of the progress of this survey i may be able to give him further information and would be delighted so to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington and to the noble lord lord kennet for their reception of the statement which i have just repeated <e> <s> i do not want to enter into debate with the noble lord opposite on the points he made in his statement but he asked a number of specific questions <e> <s> he asked first whether the company had discussed this matter with the government <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that discussions between westland plc and the government are on a continuing basis <e> <s> we were aware and have been aware for some time of the difficulties facing the company <e> <s> that the company has decided the matter is of some urgency this relates to the noble lords second question is entirely something for the commercial judgment of the company <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord molloy for his three questions <e> <s> in answer to the first question both westland and sikorsky believe that there is a substantial market for the blackhawk helicopter both in europe and in many other parts of the world <e> <s> as regards procurement by the ministry of defence the noble lord will appreciate that i cannot answer for that ministrys future procurement programmes <e> <s> i should think it would obviously be in the best interests of the ministry of defence to procure where the product is the most efficient and the most economic in all the circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the leader of the opposition <e> <s> of course the government are involved in so far as our leading industrial companies do have discussions with government departments from time to time so the government were aware of the difficulties of westland plc <e> <s> however it is not for the government either to advise or to support one proposition against another <e> <s> indeed both my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence and my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry have never disagreed that in the last resort the decision is one for the company <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most interested in what my noble friend lord harmar-nicolls has to say about this matter <e> <s> of course he is quite right to underline the fact that at the end of the day it is a matter for the commercial judgment of the company <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had made it quite clear in answer to an earlier supplementary question that the interests of ministers of the government were the same as those of the two departments concerned notably the ministry of defence and the department of trade and industry in that ministers have never disagreed that in the last resort the decision is one for the company concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not know what the deciding factor or factors were <e> <s> the company has not made that information public <e> <s> it has <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a little difficult for me to commit the commision to making public all the matters that are put before it <e> <s> i suggest that the noble baroness herself with her knowledge of consumer matters might be a better way of ensuring that the public are made aware of concerns in that regard <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i recognise the noble lords concern in this matter <e> <s> the measures that are proposed in our white paper on the suspension of supply powers of seizure and cooperation of the enforcement authorities with customs and excise should go a long way to prevent dangerous goods from reaching the shops <e> <s> it is certainly our intention to stiffen up the enforcement procedures <e>", "<cs> my lords progress is very far advanced in that regard <e> <s> one or two member states still have some reservations on points of detail and on the financial implications which still have to be sorted out <e> <s> we hope to be able to secure agreement on a system before very much longer <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington for his reception of this order <e> <s> of course i appreciate that we are dealing this afternoon with the order as it stands without prejudice to any current or forthcoming legislation <e> <s> that takes me very neatly into being able to thank the noble lord very much for his kind good wishes for christmas which of course i reciprocate <e> <s> as for the new year shall i say that he and i will both enjoy debating because that is what he and i do those measures and those matters upon which we do not always have total agreement <e> <s> but we have never failed to come to some kind of agreement at the end of those debates and i shall look forward as he does to next year <e>", "<cs> my lords encapsulating my noble friends questions which i am sure derive <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not believe that in making a new multi-fibre arrangement the textile industry of this country will be disadvantaged <e> <s> the intention in coming to a new arrangement is to ensure that there is sufficient time for that industry to meet the increasing competition that there is across the world <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not an agreement but an arrangement <e> <s> the arrangement is unduly expensive towards the consumer <e> <s> as i said earlier a new arrangement will seek to ensure that the trade is liberalised so that the consumer will be advantaged but not to the gross disadvantage of the industry which has been singularly successful in recent years <e>", "<cs> my lords as i explained earlier we are anticipating through the new gatt round a better arrangement of responsibilities and obligations <e> <s> it will be under that umbrella of increased and improved responsibilities and obligations that a new multi-fibre arrangement can be negotiated <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i answered that question when i said that the new <e>", "<cs> my lords i do indeed recognise the vulnerability of the industry <e> <s> however let me remind your lordships that in the first nine months of the textile and clothing industry exports to the united states were over per cent <e> <s> higher than in the same period the previous year <e> <s> that is indeed a successful counter to the implied criticism which the noble lord makes <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord it is lord williams in case the noble lord thought that i had failed to remember his name will recall that our interests in these matters are conducted with us by our community partners <e> <s> our community policies will be determined in europe by ourselves and not by washington <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his question and i think i am in broad agreement with him <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think your lordships will know the hong kong market is the most liberal of all markets and one must ensure that that remains so <e> <s> it may be necessary of course to ensure that we make our markets as liberal as we can to those who respond with us in matters of this nature <e>", "<cs> my lords in the six years to the fall was as i have described <e> <s> there was a trough in <e> <s> since manufacturing output has been increasing steadily <e> <s> your lordships will recall that the world recession in trade occurred at about that time <e> <s> if one looks at a similar graph for the community as a whole or indeed france or west germany one will see very similar patterns <e> <s> the figures may be slightly different <e> <s> there was a depression in in both france and germany <e> <s> an increase occurred in and is continuing <e>", "<cs> my lords the government support for employment covers other areas than just manufacturing <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend will appreciate that <e> <s> however in some million worth of expenditure on employment services and training schemes is anticipated with a further increase during and <e> <s> but that is of course across the range of employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord ezra because he is quite right <e> <s> the policies of the government particularly financial policies have led to a much fitter industrial industry which is more able to compete with the overseas markets <e> <s> one recognises that in many of the traditional industries there is still a decline <e> <s> nevertheless the policies concerning company taxation employment insurance surcharges and lifting burdens on business and others are all designed to stimulate and are having the effect of stimulating industry to better performance both at home and abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept the first part of the supplementary question of the noble lord <e> <s> the decline in the manufacturing figures after was in part due to the policies of the preceding administration added to the consequence of a world recession brought about by the second oil crisis <e> <s> this recession hit an industry already suffering from poor competitiveness following the years of very high inflation which again are attributable to the administration of which the noble lord was a part <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be so but let me make it quite clear that manufacturing industries are participating in a growth and that output is well into its fifth year of growth it is now per cent <e> <s> above the first quarter trough <e> <s> the indications are that it will continue in that direction <e> <s> the cbi forecasts and others indicate that it is on a growth pattern <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hatch of lusby has taken and i do not object to it the two years and which he knows because he has read the graph are the worst in our history for many years <e> <s> although we came into office in at a time of world recession and started implementing our policies by those policies and the general upturn which those policies were designed to assist had shown that manufacturing production was increasing and it has steadily increased in the last five years <e> <s> investment in british industry is now at a record level and is continuing and so is productivity profitability the creation of wealth and employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble earl lord halsbury for those comments with which i of course agree <e> <s> in looking forward as this administration does if we continue our policies we shall end in a stronger position than was the case in and <e> <s> over the rest of this decade we look forward to improving that position even further <e>", "<cs> my lords we can all learn lessons from the past and i think that the electorate of this country in fact learned that at the last election <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is that last year investment was at an all-time record and it is increasing <e> <s> the prosperity of our nation will lie in further and greater investment in our industries as a whole <e> <s> that is happening <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington and the noble baroness lady seear for their receipt of the statement which i have just repeated <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in this short debate <e> <s> since my noble friend lord campbell of alloway has not addressed any questions to me perhaps i may first respond to him and thank him very much for his support and for the explanations that he has given to the course of action the government have taken <e> <s> as this was largely at his instigation in as i said earlier i did not suppose that my noble friend would greatly object to what has now come out <e>", "<cs> my lords my reference to the white paper was that there is to be a white paper on intellectual property which will also include suggestions with regard to the recently announced decision to free the patent office from the constraints of the traditional civil service framework <e> <s> while not pre-empting what is in the white paper it will explain the creation or re-creation of the patent office as a body more responsive to the needs of its customers <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that there are in a number of industries skill shortages not totally related to the recession <e> <s> one of the objectives of industry year is to stimulate engineers and other entrants into industry <e> <s> with regard to the noble lords second question perhaps i may remind him of the reply i gave last month to the noble lord lord hatch of lusby when i said that was the trough of the recession <e> <s> industry has steadily been moving out of that trough and signs are very encouraging <e>", "<cs> my lords it may very well be in the long term a significant contribution to sustaining an industry and those who work in it rather than letting it proceed in the manner in which it is now proceeding <e>", "<cs> my lords it is extremely unfortunate that any authority or institution should take such a narrow viewpoint when one recognises as i am sure your lordships recognise that industry is a great contributor not only to the nations profitability but also to the wealth and wellbeing of the country as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the noble lords first comment when he expressed his gratitude for the initiative <e> <s> so far as his second point is concerned manufacturing industry is participating in the recovery <e> <s> output is well into its fifth year of growth and is now per cent <e> <s> above the first-quarter trough <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat the first-quarter trough <e> <s> as the noble lord will know interest rates are but one of a number of factors with which industry has to contend <e> <s> the governments policies are working as my remarks have demonstrated <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> the initiative that the rsa has taken in launching industry year is to draw attention to the opportunities and the need for industry <e> <s> it is accepted certainly by industrialists with whom i have spoken that it is the start of an ongoing campaign <e>", "<cs> my lords industry embraces all people whether they are in management or are workers <e> <s> design of course makes an important contribution <e> <s> i can tell noble lords that my right honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state in the department of trade and industry opened the design commitment conference a few days ago on th january to draw attention to the importance of design in industry <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lords question seems to centre on comments that were made in your lordships house yesterday i can only add that at this time no decision has been taken by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry <e> <s> i thought that i had made that point clear yesterday afternoon <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the initiative is designed specifically to draw schools education and industry more closely together <e> <s> it is the aim of the royal society of arts supported by the department of trade and industry to encourage schools interest in industry <e> <s> that is being done by the mini enterprise project in schools whereby we hope to operate a mini commercial or industrial enterprise in every secondary school before this year is out <e> <s> there has been much success already in that area of activity <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington and indeed to the noble lord lord kennet for their genuine and broad welcome to this measure which has been introduced in your lordships house tonight <e> <s> i did not realise that the noble lord lord bruce of donington was a consultant in this area <e> <s> i know him to be a man with diverse and different interests <e> <s> i find it encouraging that he is particularly interested in this measure which no doubt will enable the house to get through it with the least possible delay <e>", "<cs> well it may be the next <e> <s> the liability insurance involved in the bill would we believe represent only a very small proportion of the total cost of the operation unlike the insurance of a satellite and a launcher which of course are insured <e> <s> in any case the state itself is liable for damage under the liability convention <e> <s> as a result of the introduction of this bill i shall probably have more detailed information on that at a later stage that i could communicate <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that we have already ratified it <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot tell the noble lord that but i shall do so in the fullness of time <e> <s> i do not know <e> <s> the bill before us is purely to bring into force the convention that is our treaty obligations which we signed whenever it was i mentioned it in my opening remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> in january we signed the treaty which is the ratification <e>", "<cs> my lords if i am wrong then i shall ensure that that s corrected <e> <s> if i have this wrong i shall return to it but i am fairly confident that we have ratified these conventions <e> <s> the noble lord asked me particularly about clause the description of prescribed <e> <s> it means prescription by regulations made by the secretary of state under the powers given in clause <e> <s> clause provides for the transfer of a licence from one licensee to another <e> <s> that might be desired if for example a satellite is to be sold while in orbit <e> <s> transfer will normally require the written consent of the secretary of state <e> <s> that gives him the opportunity to reassess the situation if that is necessary <e> <s> however if with experience of administering the bill it appears that there are commonly occurring situations in which consent for a transfer is granted then the secretary of state can make regulations avoiding the need for written consent <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am grateful to the noble lord opposite <e> <s> i thought i was right but i could not recall exactly when it was done <e>", "<cs> my lords i acknowledge the receipt of this statement by the noble lord lord bruce of donington and the noble viscount lord chandos <e> <s> i think that there is very little to which i have to respond and perhaps i shall do it best by saying that the government have responded quickly to both public and parliamentary opinion as expressed yesterday as properly they should and have come to the houses of parliament with the conclusion of that decision <e> <s> i am surprised that there should be any criticism of the government on that score <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the right reverend prelate for his contribution and indeed for his questions <e> <s> as i explained on monday and i thought this afternoon the leyland trucks land rover and general motors negotiations are at an advanced stage <e> <s> i think that the house will agree that it would be wrong of me to pre-empt the result <e> <s> however we believe that an arrangement between two of the largest truck makers in the united kingdom would be in the best long-term interests of the people employed in the truck industry <e> <s> across europe that industry is in decline and there is massive over-capacityto join the activities of those two important companies would be in the best interests of the industry <e> <s> it would make it better able to compete in the european and the world markets to the long-term advantage of those employed in that sector <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking from a fairly reliable memory i can tell my noble friend that the austin rover group has per cent <e> <s> of the united kingdom domestic car market and a rather small share of the european market but one hopes that it is expanding <e> <s> if my memory serves me right it has per cent <e> <s> of the truck market in the united kingdom <e> <s> the government stand behind the so-called varley-marshall arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a position either to agree with the noble lord or disagree <e> <s> i have said that the leyland-general motors negotiations are in an advanced stage but the detailed arrangements as to how they may be completed and put together have not been arrived at <e> <s> the laird group discussions are not at such an advanced stage <e> <s> i should certainly not wish in either case to prejudice the negotiators particularly those of british leyland in suggesting in any way from this dispatch box how they should proceed or what should be the outcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for his questions <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships will share my admiration for his great knowledge not only of parliamentary affairs but of business and commence <e> <s> it is in the light of that experience that he asks such apposite questions <e> <s> there is a great danger to jobs if we fail to recognise the importance of investment both internal and from overseas in our industries <e> <s> the investment comes not only with money but with technical expertise and a whole range of other advantages to our industry <e>", "<cs> my lords really i am so surprised at the noble lord lord hatch of lusby <e> <s> i made clear in repeating the statement that the government would have much preferred to have waited until the exploratory talks had clarified the difficulties and the opportunities that a merger might have created <e> <s> then we could have taken a decision in principle and discussed it on the basis of a considered analysis <e> <s> however because certain events took place i have little doubt in an endeavour to embarrass the government speculation surrounding those talks rose and gave great uncertainty both to the public and indeed to the two companies <e> <s> this was explored during the debate yesterday in another place <e> <s> as a result of public expression and as a result of parliamentary expression my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry and colleagues decided that no useful purpose to the two companies would be served if a decision was prolonged <e> <s> i have made that clear in the statement <e> <s> as to the question of what would have happened had this matter not been raised on monday since the matter was raised and since things did happen i can see no profit in speculation <e>", "<cs> my lords in fact i did not say that general motors had per cent <e> <s> united kingdom content or indeed local content <e> <s> what i did say was that we had received assurances that local content of gms products across the range would reach per cent <e> <s> in <e> <s> on monday i said in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord diamond can press me as much as he likes <e> <s> i have said all i am able or willing to say about that matter other than repeating that the negotiations are aimed at securing a viable truck industry in this country and securing the long-term employment prospects of those engaged in it <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i recognise my noble friends great interest in this industry in which he has played an important part as principal of a component manufacturer <e> <s> i would not wish this afternoon to comment in detail upon his remarks other than to say that nothing stands still least of all the motor industry <e> <s> it would be wrong for me to commit any company into an action several years hence <e> <s> i repeat however that general motors have demonstrated over many years very good faith in the united kingdom particularly in the truck industry <e> <s> we have no feeling that they would change course from that which they have employed over so many years <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with the noble lord lord williams in the first part of his supplementary question <e> <s> in response to the second part we believe that the provisions of the companies act are quite sufficient to establish those facts where necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bruce of donington has asked me the very wide question did any member of the government know <e> <s> i do not know my lords <e> <s> i have not discussed with all members of the government so i would not know <e> <s> however certainly the information given by the stock exchange on th february provided the principal disclosed shareholdings in westland and at the extraordinary meeting of shareholders on th february sir john cuckney announced that there were holdings by nominees <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord marsh for posing that question <e> <s> as the house will know it is part of the governments policy to enlarge the shareholding and particularly worker participation in all private companies <e> <s> it is also encouraged in nationalised companies where they are returned to the private sector and is to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that my noble friend misled the noble lord <e> <s> on th february sir john cuckney issued a notice under section of the companies act which is to require an investigation by a company of interests in shares <e> <s> the noble lord will know that that act provides for there to be a period of response of five days <e> <s> at the same time sir john cuckney said that he would make that knowledge public when it was available to him <e> <s> the company having taken that action there was no point in the government taking similar action <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the question of defence interests is a little wide of the question on the order paper which concerns beneficial ownership <e> <s> i think that my noble friend the minister of state at the ministry of defence answered that aspect quite adequately last week <e>", "<cs> my lords at all times the government have consideration of the defence of the nation very much in the forefront of their mind <e> <s> when giving consideration to matters of shares we believe that the provisions of the companies act the fair trading act and the industry act are sufficient in this regard <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think i agree with my noble friends thinking in this matter that the workpeople in all our companies are interested in their own companies and their own companies massive contribution to the well-being of the economy of this country of which they are members <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter of the noble lords conversion is i think more of a matter for him than for me <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be for the convenience of the house if i repeat in the form of a statement an answer being made in another place in relation to british leyland <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement which i have made is as i am sure noble lords will appreciate in response to a private notice question <e> <s> it was as i said earlier this month the intention of the secretary of state for trade and industry to make available to parliament any new issues that arose and that is exactly what my right honourable friend has done <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for her views which i do not share since a number of different views emanate from the west midlands <e> <s> people there know very well the grave danger which the industry is in at the present time particularly with over-capacity throughout europe <e> <s> the fact that the west midlands find themselves in a difficult position again is unfortunate and regrettable <e> <s> it is certainly a result of the world and more particularly the european position <e> <s> i should perhaps say that industry year is of course an initiative by the royal society of arts and not of the government <e> <s> in fact it is an awareness campaign rather than a direct campaign <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend who puts the matter so much more succinctly than i was able to do so in my earlier remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that the government have no intention of abandoning any stance least of all that of procuring for the british-based motor manufacturing industry a continuity of production a continuity of employment a continuity of competitiveness in the european and world markets <e> <s> it is those interests which are in the forefront of our minds not necessarily the highest bidder <e>", "<cs> my lords in the past years some billion of public money has been put into british leyland through all its companies <e> <s> guarantees of loans under the varley marshall understanding amount to another billion which is not an inconsiderable amount of money to support a british-based industry <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord shepherd asks a number of questions <e> <s> it is for the board of british leyland to consider what is in the best interests of its company and recommend to the government who are after all on behalf of the taxpayer the principal shareholder what it thinks is in that companys best interests <e> <s> it is for the government as trustees to ensure that the best interest of the country the employees and indeed the future is taken account of in reaching a decision <e> <s> noble lords will i hope forgive me for repeating this but in the case of the proposals of general motors one would be looking for the satisfaction of a number of assurances with regard to those matters and others before the government gave any approval <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble lord lord williams of elvel that there was a zero figure attached <e> <s> general motors and british leyland joined together in discussions to ensure the viability of a commercial truck industry <e> <s> in those discussions british leyland made it clear that the long-term interests were served by the proposals which have been made fairly clear and fairly clear publicly <e> <s> i am not i regret to say able to answer the noble lords other question purely and simply because i do not know the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not prepared this afternoon to look back over years <e>", "<cs> my lords because i do not believe that looking back over years as to the reasons why british leyland required the support of the taxpayer through government funding would be very helpful in meeting the challenge of the mid-s and s <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had answered the noble lord lord diamond last week but i am happy to repeat that general motors truck production has something of the order of per cent <e>

does trespass <e> <s> he is putting words into my mouth <e> <s> i answered my noble friend properly and fully in complimenting british leyland on its recent success but at the same time saying that it has a long way to go in what is a hard and very competitive industry <e> <s> i do not think that i should alter what i said earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for his reception of this information <e> <s> we shall certainly take every opportunity to ensure that the public at large as well as industry itself appreciate the great strides that have been made in all directions since <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the first question of the noble lord lord hatch of lusby perhaps i may say that i believe that i answered him quite fully on st january when he posed a very similar question <e> <s> dealing with investment it is perfectly true that investment is at a lower level than it was in <e> <s> however there has been a per cent <e> <s> growth per year since which i think to some extent redresses the unfair balance which the noble lord is trying to indicate <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will appreciate that the point he makes is but one factor in a whole range which manufacturing industry has to take into account <e> <s> yes to some extent they will improve hut not of course to an extreme extent <e>", "<cs> my lords not precisely <e> <s> i regret to tell the noble lord lord diamond that without notice i cannot do that <e> <s> however i can tell him as i stated on st january that in general terms if one drew a graph industrial production in the united kingdom would look very similar to that in france and west germany <e> <s> but this afternoon i do not have figures for the united states of america <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the fall has been more startling if one takes into account the fact that in we started from a very much lower base <e> <s> the noble lord himself will probably recall that in british manufacturing industry was overmanned to such an extent that productivity was totally uncompetitive compared to <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the figures <e> <s> i do not think that that

"<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bruce of donington asks a number of questions <e> <s> so far as investment is concerned there has been as i have said a per cent <e> <s> growth in investment a year since which is quite considerable and is reflected in the greater competitiveness of our manufactured products which achieved a record volume of exports last year <e> <s> if the noble lord as he has on more than one occasion seeks to take out of the current account and the trade deficit isolated instances of course he will get the kind of figure that he mentions <e> <s> we tend to look at the whole position with regard to our trade both at home and overseas which on current balance is in credit again <e>", "<cs> my lords in answering my noble friend lord orr-ewing i said that output per head was per cent <e> <s> higher in that it was in i think that demonstrates the better competitiveness of industry which has resulted in an export performance of the nature i have given <e> <s> if we had stayed with the figures of employment and overmanning which obtained in our manufacturing industry would not be in the very healthy state it is today <e> <s> it is due to this governments <e>", "<cs> my lords i saw most of the panorama programme and i believe that my right honourable friend the prime minister gave a very true and very encouraging account of the state of the nation as it is today <e>", "<cs> my lords of course my noble friends point will be made to the chairman and the board of the post office but the post office consulted widely across the metropolitan counties and with pounc and there was no concrete and firm expresssion of a change being necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has indeed anticipated my response <e> <s> i fear that stamps are a little too

conclusion in this matter it will have something to discuss with the workforce <e> <s> at the moment albeit that negotiations are at an advanced stage with one company there is nothing to discuss in detail with the workforce <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> as my honourable friend the minister of state said in another place the negotiations with general motors are a long way down the track <e> <s> that has not precluded other people over many months putting proposals to british leyland since it was a declared objective of the government to return british leyland

suggestion having been made on the th february that there should be an extension and the return to the original date of th february i repeat my lords the original date there is no new date i do not think that would have inhibited any serious bidder <e> <s> i think i can give the noble lord the assurance he is seeking that the return to the original date will not inhibit any serious bidder <e>", "<cs> my lords it only recently became clear that negotiations between the ministry of defence and vickers shipbuilding and engineering would not be complete before the date set by british shipbuilders for the sale of the company that is that the th february should be the deadline for bids <e> <s> it might have been of mutal advantage to run the two competitions simultaneously but that did not prove to be possible <e> <s> the original timetable therefore is acceptable to all those concerned in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that in principle her majestys government do encourage the widest possible ownership of shares in all british industry <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to dictate to british shipbuilders and vickers themselves as to the weighting that they give to the respective elements that would be contained in any bid <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that a prospectus was issued <e> <s> all i can say to the noble lord lord taylor is that the information that that contains will be taken into account in assessing the relativities of the various bids that have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that the noble lord lord bruce of donington will have at the back of his mind the announcement that was made to parliament on th july by my right honourable friend the then secretary of state for trade and industry who announced at that time that it was the intention to sell the warship yards by st march <e> <s> in subsequent debates the reasons for doing so were given to parliament and were accepted by parliament at those times <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that my noble friend had made such a sound judgment neither was i aware that his sound judgment at that time was so well rewarded <e> <s> i hope that those who have the responsibility of assessing the relative bids will take my noble friends point into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that and that was not the question that was addressed to me <e> <s> the question addressed to me was whether i could give an assurance that the yard would not fall into foreign hands <e> <s> i said that i could give that assurance and i repeat that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords since the yard is one of the defence contractors and there are implications on defence issues and national security the government through the ministry of defence have assured themselves that the yard will not fall into foreign ownership <e>", "<cs> how my lords <e> <s> when the bids are assessed in the light of what i have said some may be disregarded because that criterion has not been met <e> <s> so far as the second question of the noble lord lord diamond is concerned he will i think appreciate that it is a little wide of that which is on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in much the same way that we can ensure it through the companies act the fair trading act and another act whose name escapes me for the moment <e> <s> we have sufficient powers under those acts to ensure that that does not happen <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of a golden share occurs from time to time <e> <s> at this present time it would be wrong for me while the various bids are being assessed to speculate as to the necessity or otherwise of using that device <e>", "<cs> my lords i do know and i have given assurances that regard will be taken of that point <e> <s> i very much regret that i forgot for the moment that the other act is the industry act which gives us power to assure those things which we wish to assure which goes alongside the assurance that i gave to the noble lord sitting on the cross-benches <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not so <e> <s> i fear that the noble lord has misunderstood <e> <s> the government can use powers under the companies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite prepared to draw my right honourable friends attention to the point that the noble lord the leader of the opposition makes <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as the exchange between the noble lord and my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords as the house will probably be aware on th february as a result of the companys th february issue of notices there was a press statement which showed in actraint no <e> <s> that the company of canberra held per cent <e> <s> of total equity sterling trust geneva on behalf of nominees held per cent <e> <s> rothschild rank zurich on the same basis per cent <e> <s> bank of dreyfus switzerland per cent <e> <s> gulf occidental per cent <e> <s> and the bank of dreyfus with others per cent <e> <s> the company then issued further notices under section again to ascertain further the beneficial owners <e> <s> the company is continuing its investigations <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already said it is because the company is energetically continuing investigations <e> <s> until those investigations are completed there is no point nor necessity for the government to embark upon another series of investigations <e>", "<cs> my lords the investigations were first announced by westland on <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know that i waited for any particular period of time <e> <s> i always and at all times try to answer to the best of my ability questions put to me by noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly what the company is attempting to do <e> <s> at the same time the stock exchange is carrying out its own investigations to ensure that there has been no breach of its regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord tordoff must in his own mind distinguish between there being minority shareholders who perhaps do not reside in this country and control of a company which has defence interests changing hands <e> <s> in the latter case we are quite satisfied that the government have ample powers to deal with that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords this particular phase the pre-feasibility study will take two to three years <e> <s> if there is further progress then that will probably take another seven years <e> <s> therefore one is perhaps looking towards the end of this century or the beginning of the next century before one sees effective use made of it <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government are in no embarrassing position whatsoever <e> <s> it is the governments policy to support innovation in industry and that is what is being done <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sufficiently optimistic about industrys endeavours in this matter and indeed about the longevity of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones to assure him that he is likely to see much progress <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very interesting point and i shall draw it to the attention of my right honourable friends <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend will recognise that we are at this time at a very early stage of development <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government believe in a property-owning democracy in the widest sense <e> <s> ownership of shares is an effective mechanism available to spread ownership of economic activities and the rewards of economic success hence the governments privatisation programme and the special measures they have taken in pursuing it to favour employees and small investors <e> <s> the members of the stock exchange have a crucial part to play in the process of spreading share ownership <e>", "<cs> my lords the other place is currently considering legislation through the financial services bill and also the building societies bill both of which are in part designed to strengthen investor protection and knowledge and thereby to <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bruce of donington reminds me of what my honourable friend said in another place <e> <s> i know what my honourable friend said in another place and the million-plus figure that he mentioned represents per cent <e> <s> of listed equities directly owned by individuals which is a reversal of the position that obtained in the s <e> <s> as regards the owners of shares selling in a bull market that is exactly what the marketplace is about <e> <s> i do not know why the noble lord should mention it in such a condemnatory manner <e> <s> however in relation to his last point i think it is interesting to appreciate that of the applicants for bt shares there are today of the original shareholders and they represent some of the people who are not normally known to be dealing in shares and who have small stakes which i think knocks on the head the inference contained in the noble lords last point <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i have made it quite clear on a number of occasions that the government welcome the participation of management and workers in all of industry as they encourage wider share ownership throughout industry <e>", "<cs> my lords of course my noble friend is concerned in this matter which is indeed why he put down his question <e> <s> i believe that my original answer and indeed my answer to my noble friends supplementary question explain some of the measures which the government have taken <e> <s> to elaborate perhaps i may add that over the years we have taken a number of very important fiscal measures for example the abolition of the investment surcharge in the finance act the continued uplifting of the capital gains tax threshold the indexation provisions the business expansion scheme through the finance act and the stamp duty reduction to per cent <e> <s> all of these measures have made the ownership of shares easier in both a financial and a mechanical manner <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> he will appreciate that a number of members of the stock exchange have changed the method by which they sell and deal <e> <s> there is a growth in out-of-london membership and an increase in the number of what i might call share shops in departmental stores being opened by some of the leading stockbroking companies <e> <s> one anticipates that the practice will gather momentum <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a lot of sympathy for my noble friend <e> <s> i think that the provisions in the financial services legislation on advising potential buyers will undoubtedly underline the losses as well as the profits that may accrue through dealing in shares <e>", "<cs> my lords the country is not declining in the export of manufactured goods <e> <s> total exports of manufactured goods in are at a record high and they are growing month by month <e>", "<cs> my lords it may now be for the convenience of the house if i repeat a statement now being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry on british leyland <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of points have been made by both noble lords which i shall endeavour to answer <e> <s> let me say straightaway that the noble lord lord bruce of donington is wrong in his suggestion that there is a destruction of an integrated business because the business of british leyland is divided into four quite separate businesses although they are subsidiaries of one holding company <e> <s> both noble lords raised the matter of the timescale <e> <s> the governments intentions were well known as far back as <e> <s> there has been widespread reporting over many months about the interests of general motors and others <e> <s> to suggest that days has been allowed that is from th february until th march is something of a travesty of the truth <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first answer the noble lord lord somers <e> <s> when i said that we have as one of the fundamental points in front of us the interests of the british-based motor industry and the nation i meant exactly that <e> <s> the point is that land rover and range rover have lost their predominance in world markets <e> <s> the japanese have encroached with about five different products <e> <s> we have no united states representation of land rover and range rover at the present moment and that is the fastest growing market for -by- vehicles <e> <s> there is nothing wrong with the attraction of foreign investment to enhance our own capability in manufacturing in technology and in the marketing of products made in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be delighted to answer the noble lord lord shepherd in due course <e> <s> i am grateful to the right reverend prelate the bishop of birmingham knowing as i well do of his deep and important interest in this area <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend the deputy chief whip also recognises that <e> <s> let me say to him as i said to him once before that the governments long-term interest is and i use this phrase again the long-term viability of a commercial vehicle industry based in this country and with that the long-term security of employment <e> <s> i stress the long-term security of employment <e> <s> but i have to say to the right reverend prelate that he is not right when he suggests that land rover on its own has enjoyed a predominant world position in recent years <e> <s> it is a fact that it is necessary to find further and very large investment in new models productive capacity and the marketing network and that a private sector involvement is paramount <e> <s> that in its turn will lead to the security in the long term of jobs within that important industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite happy to assure the noble lord lord ezra that the list of criteria he has just read out will be among those to which the board of british leyland will be giving the most careful consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will forgive me i am not quite sure whether i could agree entirely with his first comments although i have some sympathy with him <e> <s> let me again repeat that it is the british leyland board together with the government who have the consideration to make and we will make our decision against the background which i have now i think given on five separate <e>", "<cs> my lords on the noble baronesss first point i believe that i did answer her during our exchange at question time earlier this afternoon <e> <s> i can only repeat that it is for british leyland to assess all the points that the noble baroness has made together with many many others when they come to consider these four particular bids <e> <s> but i do have to remind the noble baroness that british leyland trucks have lost money over a number of years and continue so to do <e> <s> leyland buses have lost money over a number of years and continue so to do <e> <s> the land rover group have lost money up to this year when i say this year i mean the financial year when it is now anticipated they will turn in a modest profit <e> <s> none of that is commensurate in any way whatsoever with a fair return on the capital that has been invested in those companies by the british taxpayer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure i could agree with my noble friend lord trenchard in the sense of what he is saying <e> <s> this is a worldwide industry and it requires tremendous investment <e> <s> the government have never sought to suggest that overseas investment in this industry as in others is not welcome <e> <s> there is no doubt that overseas investment in our industry has been to the great benefit of this country and those who work in the various industries <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that one should lose sight of the fact that billion and billion of guarantees has gone to british leyland <e> <s> in addition million has been provided for example for the development and marketing of electric commercial vehicles and there is a million programme to help develop a quiet heavy vehicle engine <e> <s> there are a number of other but somewhat smaller amounts that have been made available through a variety of sources to the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords we have always thought that support for british industry is a proper part of government function up to a point and that point is reached in a number of areas when industry is able to take on board and develop more profitably and more effectively the industries which the government have helped through subsidy of one kind or another <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to note that the noble lord lord molloy recognises the great value to employment of the british motor industry <e> <s> i presume he means the british-based motor manufacturing industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i wonder whether the noble lord lord somers would repeat the end of his question as i did not quite catch it <e>", "<cs> my lords government support for the united kingdom motor industry would go on and indeed it has because we have for example provided an amount of support money for the ford motor companys engine plant in south wales and also for general motors diesel engine production in the united kingdom <e> <s> we have provided million-worth of support through the regional support system for nissan at its new plant at washington <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i cannot give the noble lord lord hatch of lusby that information because we are not able to gather from foreign countries accurate figures which would make any comparision worthwhile <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the last set of figures is necessarily correct <e> <s> however i could agree with the noble lord that british leyland together with the ford motor company general motors and all the other companies that produce motor vehicles in this country and export them make significant contributions to the economy of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i would dearly like to debate that point with the noble lord <e> <s> lord mellish but i fear that his question is a little wide of that on the order paper <e> <s> in the last few days i have frequently discussed with noble lords this general position of inward investment into the british motor industry and thereby the long-term benefits for the industry and those who work in it <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of post code usage is essentially a matter for the post office board <e> <s> however i understand that the latest figures available show that in january of this year per cent <e> <s> of all mail was postcoded <e> <s> this compares well with the figure of per cent <e> <s> in january <e>", "<cs> my lords post codes enable the post office to make the fullest use of its investment in sorting machinery and thus to accelerate the handling of letters and of course to hold the tariffs <e> <s> the post office now has a network of mechanised sorting offices <e> <s> that network was completed at the end of last year and i have no doubt that some of the rewards will be seen on our doorsteps as weeks and months go by <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obviously disappointed to hear what the noble lord has to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that my noble friends question is meant to be serious although it invoked laughter <e> <s> on a sample taken last year the percentage of first-class deliveries by the first working day following collection was per cent <e> <s> against a target figure of <e> <s> that compared with per cent <e> <s> in the previous year <e> <s> i think my noble friend will agree that it is always the percentage that is not delivered particularly to an individual that causes annoyance and disappointment and attention is not drawn to the per cent <e> <s> of mail that is delivered <e>", "<cs> my lords no is the short answer <e> <s> that is not a responsibility of government it is a responsibility of the post office and british telecom and essentially a commercial matter for bt <e> <s> it should be remembered that the primary use of a telephone directory is to assist telephone users and not postal users <e> <s> but much has been done to encourage the use of post codes <e> <s> press radio and television advertising and posters on vans have been used to encourage members of the public to pass on their post codes <e> <s> there was a year-long trial scheme in darlington whereby members of the public could obtain information through the freephone facility <e> <s> the results of that trial showed that the freephone is not a cost-effective way to encourage post code usage <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i should make it clear i obviously did not in my earlier answer that per cent <e> <s> of all mail is post coded <e> <s> i was not talking about the percentage of people posting letters <e> <s> that may be my fault <e> <s> about two-thirds of the mail is now automatically sorted <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the utmost admiration for the postal service particularly the postmen <e> <s> it amazes me how good they are at finding people and delivering letters sometimes with only a name and a town let alone a post code <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that per cent <e> <s> usage of post codes would stop that <e> <s> although they help in mechanised sorting i am sure that my noble friend will appreciate that many odd-sized packages are not suitable for mechanised handling and post codes will not speed up their delivery <e> <s> people have great affection for hefts bucks and berks <e> <s> one would not wish to legislate against people using favourite forms of addressing letters to for example loved ones or indeed to business acquaintances <e>", "<cs> my lords on this occasion i am most happy to agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i have no doubt that my noble friend has heard what the noble lord has said and i gladly endorse it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend will accept that whichever way i or indeed any of your lordships present figures another picture could be painted by somebody else <e> <s> in an earlier answer i used the phrase from collection <e> <s> i take note of what lies behind my noble friends question and will draw it to the attention of the chairman of the post office board <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think i said and certainly as a number of my noble friends who have had responsibility for answering questions on this point have said legibility is one of the great difficulties for both sorters and deliverers of mail <e> <s> the wide use of what is popularly known as the ball-point pen does not help <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the first point that the noble lord makes but i do not think that i could possibly agree with the inference behind the second part of his question <e>", "<cs> my lords as long as one knows the address one can ask the post office <e> <s> alternatively the next time that you write to the person you can ask him to let you have the code by reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords a reference to the mmc comes about as a result of a preliminary review by the director general of fair trading who would take into account all the issues and they include the public interest and regional policy <e> <s> i feel that there is ample opportunity for various expressions to be made to the director general who in turn will report to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> he then has the task of evaluating that advice with a view to a reference to the mmc <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble lord says is perfectly fair and is certainly one factor <e> <s> i believe that it is the publicity given to a number of the more esoteric if i may use that word bids that prompts that question <e> <s> in the main most mergers and bids are agreed and certainly those below million <e> <s> in others where they are contested or where there are issues that involve the public interest or some of the other factors that i have mentioned it is reasonable for a reference to be made and that is consistent with the governments policy <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend will be well aware new techniques are being developed because we live in a fast-moving and changing society <e> <s> it is as a result of some of the techniques which are now being adopted none of which i might add are unlawful that my right honourable friend the secretary of state has announced that later this year a detailed review of competition policy will be undertaken <e> <s> i assure my noble friend that the point he makes will be taken account of in that review <e>", "<cs> my lords i too anticipate with some pleasure the debate that the noble lord is initiating on th march when no doubt he will deploy at greater length some of the points that he has made this afternoon <e> <s> i accept neither of the two points that he made in the middle of his supplementaries but i shall certainly ask my right honourable friend the secretary of state to take account of the last point <e>", "<cs> my lords it would not be for me i do not believe that my noble friend lord ferrers would expect this of me to say whether i think that bid is good or bad <e> <s> it is for the reason that my noble friend gives that of a leverage takeover that the reference has been made to the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> it is therefore for the commission to consider the public interest in a bid of that nature <e> <s> like my noble friend i look forward in due course to hearing its views <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no inconsistency whatever in the governments policy with regard to mergers <e> <s> as to the reference made by the noble lord to what i said in june last year i can do no better than refer him to the relevant columns in <e>", "<cs> my lords the government regret that the protracted negotiations between the international tin council and its bank and broker creditors broke down last week <e> <s> it seems unlikely that a settlement can be reached which would secure a return to orderly trading in tin although if a substantial number of other itc countries were willing to make a new effort the united kingdom would of course be willing to join in the discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that the bank of england and indeed the department of trade and industry were becoming increasingly worried about the position in tin some months before october of last year when the arrangements broke down <e> <s> with regard to the legal advice received i do not think that the noble lord lord williams would expect me to describe in any form at all the advice which my department has had with regard to the position of the united kingdom government in so far as their obligations to the itc are concerned <e> <s> a number of authoritative persons have given different views as to where the legal responsibility may lie whether in the united kingdom courts or since the arrangement is under a treaty through the united nations in the international courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that my noble friend is as worried as we are as to the position for the tin mining companies i think in fact that he meant in cornwall <e> <s> what i can say to your lordships this afternoon is that we look very sympathetically at the problem which is about to arise in cornwall in the event of there being no orderly <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that my noble friend would expect me to answer questions on morality <e>", "<cs> my lords i am able to confirm that her majestys government have behaved with leadership and honour in this matter in that we have from the outset that is from october of last year said that we are prepared to meet our obligations which amounted to per cent <e> <s> and that during the course of negotiations have offered a further million of taxpayers money to help a return to orderly trading <e> <s> that some other countries have not seen fit to honour as we see it their obligations and have allowed the tin market to collapse is i believe quite regrettable <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that this was a question of overheating or speculation <e> <s> however i agree with my noble friend that there comes a limit when the government on behalf of the taxpayers have to call a halt <e> <s> we believe that the offer we made of million which would have represented the vast bulk of the net consumer countries indebtedness to the itc was a very significant and important offer <e> <s> it is disappointing to us that other countries could not come alongside and <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know that i can go totally along with the noble lord <e> <s> i think in more simple terms what i would say consistent with government policy is that an artificial interference in the market place where different nations are concerned and where their manager is in the difficult position of having to meet his obligations to the member countries on the one hand and on the other to deal with a certain amount of secrecy in the deals that he does so that none of the countries can take advantage poses great difficulties <e> <s> had the market forces been able to prevail then i doubt very much whether the current position would have occurred <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord lord williams will not get very much more out of me than i have answered already <e> <s> he mentioned a number of figures on which i am not prepared to comment <e> <s> those are his views <e> <s> it is not the practice of the government to divulge the advice that they receive in regard to legal matters <e> <s> it would not be my intention this afternoon to do that either <e> <s> it is sufficient to say that we are receiving advice and that it is being evaluated <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would provide a technical analysis instead of making a political attack i should be delighted to deal with it because in the earlier part of his speech he spoke about the greed i think that he spoke of the city and other issues that was demonstrated and fortified by the speech of my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer in another place last night <e> <s> my noble friend opposite has worked extremely hard and we have been right through <e>", "<cs> my lords most certainly the attention of the chairman of the post office board will be drawn to the noble baronesss question <e> <s> for some years it has been the practice of the post office board to produce only four stamps as a special issue <e> <s> they range across the main price usages p for the inland first class stamp p for the european stamp a p airmail stamp for zone b the americas india and south east asia and a p airmail stamp for zone c australia japan and china <e> <s> the christmas edition has always been a particular one because the volume of second class mail increases quite significantly at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords in particular there are design implications for the special issue celebrating her majestys birthday in that the stamp is based on six photographs of her majesty one from each decade of her life <e> <s> it is an essential part of the design that the stamps are produced in attached <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much regret that i am unable to help the noble baroness any further <e> <s> it is a complex subject which requires very careful consideration <e> <s> following the noble baronesss question in june the director general decided to convene a seminar on the topic which was held later that year <e> <s> he is now in the process of evaluating all that he has learnt <e> <s> regarding the second question i understand that the paper will review relevant areas of law and the experience of the office of fair trading on codes of practice <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do not find themselves in any difficulties whatsoever in this matter <e> <s> the director general of fair trading has authority under the fair trading act to attend to those matters <e> <s> it is for him not for government to set the time scales <e> <s> i understand that the paper is well advanced and i expect that the noble lord opposite will not have to wait too much longer before it is published <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble baroness needs advice from me as to when she should put down a question <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry on the subject of british leyland <e> <s> the statement is

<e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter asks a specific question are the government going to pour more taxpayers money into the company <e> <s> since the british leyland hoard have not asked the government for any more money i think that the question and i say this with great respect to my noble friend is a little hypothetical <e> <s> we seek with the british leyland board to find an alternative solution that of returning the various businesses to the private sector where one would anticipate the buyers and particularly the companies who are already discussing the various businesses would provide the requisite capital to further the interest which i have just described <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i prefer my description <e> <s> certainly i think that my noble friend was referring to pouring money into a business which has not been able to fulfil at this time anyway its best ambitions that of a larger car share <e> <s> although the truck business has a per cent <e> <s> share of the united kingdom market it has a very small share of the european market <e> <s> it is a share of a market which has been fast declining <e>", "<cs> my lords i endorse what the noble lord lord shepherd said about the huge advance that both the management and workforce of british leyand have made in recent years <e> <s> nevertheless the fact remains that both the bus and truck businesses have not made any profit whatever for the past or years and as i suggested in this intensely fierce international market they are unlikely so to do despite the fact that the product is better particularly the trucks and despite the fact that they now command per cent <e> <s> of the united kingdom market <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it it was during the course of negotiations that the assurances which we sought were made very clear <e> <s> various options were looked at a number of which have been reported in the press <e> <s> however finally i think it was st march when we found that the gap was too wide <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that there was a particular breaking point <e> <s> the matters were discussed and pieces were left over <e> <s> i do not believe that one can say that at any one time there was a conversation which could be constructed to mean a breaking point <e> <s> on st march general motors felt that there was no further room for negotiation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have told the house the reasons for general motors and the government breaking off discussions <e> <s> the reasons which i shall repeat were that the assurances which we sought regarding ownership and an element of united kingdom control and united kingdom management were matters with which general motors was unable to agree and we decided mutually that there was no point in continuing <e> <s> exactly on which date or day that happened i am afraid i do not know <e> <s> your lordships will appreciate that i was not party to the discussions myself <e> <s>

no point in continuing with the negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand what my noble friend says <e> <s> i would not like to <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend lord soames was dissatisfied with my answer to his question he no doubt would have made that abundantly clear to me <e> <s> on the other hand i have explained to the house quite clearly and honestly the circumstances which arose concerning the ending of discussions between the government and general motors <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a view shared by a number of people <e> <s> what we remain concerned about is that there should be a strong manufacturing presence in the united kingdom employing i think it is people directly and several thousand others in the supply industries and that is what both the british leyland board and ourselves seek to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer that question and i do not believe that anybody else can because various options on the various assurances which we sought were discussed over a period of many months <e> <s> as i have said three <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that the negotiations would have broken down at the start <e> <s> in any kind of negotiation and the noble lord the leader of the opposition knows this very well one puts on the table the optimum and one moves around making adjustments to what one ideally would like and what is pragmatic <e> <s> in the end as i have said none of the options available to us or to general motors was considered suitable and this was decided on st march <e>", "<cs> my lords fuel accounts for per cent <e> <s> of the total manufacturing costs that is fuel both bought from abroad and home produced <e>", "<cs> my lords investment in british manufacturing industry has improved by per cent <e> <s> in the past months and is on course to continue this increase <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much regret that i cannot give my noble friend an answer to that question since it is a little wide of the original question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that there are considerable stocks of refined products particularly in the united kingdom which are still awaiting disposal it is a little early for me to anticipate any kind of answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly cannot give any kind of forecast but there have been marked reductions in the retail prices of refined oil throughout the country <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot tell the noble lord lord diamond what information was available to my right honourable friends at the time they made their statement <e> <s> i was asked whether i could forecast <e> <s> i cannot forecast neither can i comment on the policies of the individual oil companies <e>", "<cs> my lords there are lower prices than that around the country <e> <s> it depends on the arrangements between the supplying company and the retailing company <e> <s> i was asked whether i could forecast <e> <s> i cannot forecast but i can anticipate like other noble lords in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords i do not have the complete breakdown <e> <s> however i remember seeing a graph in one of the weekend newspapers which showed that from i think pence there was pence retail profit with per cent <e> <s> distribution costs and pence in taxation and the remainder was crude oil costs <e>", "<cs> my lords the date i gave was the end of february on the end of february <e>", "<cs> my lords in fact output costs for the months ending february on february declined by per cent <e> <s> that is they were per cent <e> <s> in and per cent <e> <s> in <e> <s> the large majority of the difference is made up in earnings which rose by per cent <e> <s> though the output per unit rose by only per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords there are some shops and hotels which currently sell stamps in addition to the network of post offices that are supplemented by stamp vending machines <e> <s> so there is a reasonable -hour service across the country <e>", "<cs> my lords it is attractive to some shops and hotels <e> <s> the post office does not however discount its sales <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the latter part of the noble lords supplementary question is no <e> <s> questions about individual post offices are operational ones for the post office <e> <s> the government have no power and indeed no wish to intervene <e> <s> the main criterion for the post office in <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not a matter for the government <e> <s> if retailers of postcards or those running any other shop wish to sell stamps they are at liberty to do so <e> <s> they are also at liberty to charge what they wish for those stamps since no resale price maintenance is in force <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i have already given a reply relating to the general principle of post office closures <e> <s> i do not believe that i can go further <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for reminding us of the practice in france <e> <s> there is no difficulty over the purchase and resale of stamps in this country <e> <s> it is entirely a matter for retailers to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords the hours that post offices open are an operational matter for the post office itself <e> <s> it has no bearing on the hypothetical question that the noble lord asks <e>", "<cs> my lords given the legislation that currently exists and also any local by-laws that may obtain in so far as the sale of goods is concerned shops hotels bars and so on may sell stamps if they so wish <e>", "<cs> my lords since this afternoon i am dealing with the question of the resale of postage stamps i regret that i cannot answer the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am flattered by the belief of the noble lord lord walston in my powers of persuasion <e> <s> the post office practice has been to avoid giving discounts since it is judged that this would not increase overall the stamp sales but instead would take away business from post offices the overheads of which would remain the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am most obliged to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for explaining the purpose of his amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i think that i am right in saying that he was at the same time speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> his explanation is eminently satisfactory <e> <s> we have no hesitation in accepting both these amendments and thank the noble lord for putting them forward <e>", "<cs> in responding to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran it may be helpful for me to remind the committee that when i spoke during the second reading debate on the bill i indicated that one reason the provisions relating to the registers were being amended was to free the patent office of the requirement to keep the registers at a particular place and thus a computerised register could be kept wherever was most convenient to the patent office <e> <s> therefore it would clearly not be appropriate to replace that with an obligation to maintain a computer in sheffield <e>", "<cs> this might be the appropriate time for me to flesh out a little the point which i was trying to make <e> <s> i am obliged to my noble friend lord mottistone who so succinctly put his finger on the major point namely that in this modern technological age flexibility is the prime concern <e> <s> it may be of interest to the committee to know that the repeal of the sheffield marks provision was originally put on the cards prior to the act <e>", "<cs> may i thank the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for the remarks he made in connection with officials in my department <e> <s> i am most grateful to him <e> <s> i apologise to the noble lord that i was not in the country at the time to discuss this matter with him <e>", "<cs> it is not for me to come between the noble lord lord northfield and any of his colleagues <e> <s> i resist the temptation tonight <e> <s> i have some sympathy with what underlies the remarks of the noble lord lord northfield he was kind enough to discuss this with me a week or so ago and i shall study carefully what he said about this matter in as well as this evening <e> <s> on the other hand the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran had this about right <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington expresses instincts which suggest to me that we might enter into a controversial area <e>", "<cs> i am informed that in another place an announcement is being made today i think in answer to a written question that a white paper is to be published tomorrow <e> <s> i think this may help noble lords <e>", "<cs> i was fairly happy when the noble lord lord lloyd in moving the amendment opined that his luck might have run out but i am not quite so confident in the light of the remarks made by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> i shall in fact have to resist this amendment for these reasons notwithstanding that i recognise the importance of members of the profession <e>", "<cs> i assume that the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran is speaking at one and the same time to amendments nos <e> <s> and of this grouping <e>", "<cs> in that case i would have wished that the noble lord could have advised me when we sent our traditional conventional note out with regard to groupings <e> <s> however i will do the best i can <e> <s> perhaps before moving to this particular amendment i may make a comment on the matter that we were discussing with regard to the institute of trade mark agents during the passage of the last amendment because the noble lord made a specific point <e> <s> it is true of course as he pointed out that the institute of trade mark agents has articles and so on and has control over membership but in fact that control is not statutory <e> <s> the responsibility to which i was referring was a statutory responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords my advice comes directly from the chairmans office of westland plc <e> <s> the company has satisfied itself in accordance with the requirements of the companies act after exhaustive inquiries and the use of law firms in california uruguay and australia <e> <s> the advice of the company to me is that there is no reason to suppose that these nominees have acted in breach of the companies act <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have indicated the company has made its investigations and has satisfied itself that all these five owners are owners in their own right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord i think it was perhaps a slip of the tongue <e> <s> they are the beneficial owners <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> there is no dispute between the government and the noble lord as to what section a which is being inserted in the trade marks act is intended to mean <e> <s> the earlier act has some rather unfortunate wording and as the whole measure is before your lordships for consideration it would be appropriate for me to make it clear that the interpretation which the noble lord lord lloyd seeks is the correct one <e>", "<cs> let me say at the outset that there is no objection in principle to the changes which the noble lords amendment seeks to achieve <e> <s> but i have to say to him that it would not he practicable to implement them at short notice <e> <s> one has to assume that the noble lord might envisage that if the amendment were accepted proprietors would pay lower renewal fees and presumably higher initial regisration fees than at present <e> <s> while it might be a relatively straightforward matter to adjust so that the patent offices income measured over a long period remained the same such adjustment would produce considerable fluctuations in income in the short term <e>", "<cs> i studied this amendment carefully and additionally i listened carefully to what the noble lord said but i have to say to him first and i do this with the greatest courtesy that the amendment is not sufficient to achieve the intended purpose <e> <s> i do not refer here at all to any defect in drafting because we know that we can always cover that <e> <s> the bill as it stands will have no effect whatsoever on existing certification trade marks but it is not possible to make sense of the relevant provisions and in particular subsection of section of the act merely by substituting services for goods <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble lord i am reminded by my noble friend that he said earlier that he was not going to move amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if the noble lord will perhaps deal with it formally we can get on to amendment no <e> <s> which is the last of his amendments <e>", "<cs> i am quite happy to be even more than sympathetic to the noble lord and to say without further ado that the government are very happy to accept this amendment <e> <s> i thank the noble lord very much for drawing our attention to it <e>", "<cs> it was the noble lord lord northfield who raised the point <e> <s> it was the noble lord himself who spoke to it <e> <s> the noble lord recognised that the government had accepted in principle the argument he had put forward <e> <s> he had himself accepted the undertaking which i had given prior to the committee and during the discussion we had that the government would take the earliest opportunity to introduce legislation to meet the point which he and the noble lord lord northfield were making earlier <e> <s> i want to leave the committee this evening with that clear understanding and assurance <e> <s> if i have done that i thank the committee <e> <s> i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> to which i have already spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords the truth of the matter is that over the three years which the noble lord mentioned both our penetration of the german market and the volume of our non-oil exports that is our manufactured exports have shown increases and the federal republic now takes per cent <e> <s> of our worldwide exports which is an increase of over the figure <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a question of being pleased or displeased <e> <s> the net result of the current rate is that it puts our exporters in a more competitive position a position of which i would hope they would take full advantage <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what my noble friend is saying <e> <s> certainly it is largely for industry to take advantage of the market places but the government through the british overseas trade board spend some million annually <e> <s> we also have staff in london to support those exporters and six foreign and commonwealth office posts in the federal republic to aid and assist those industrialists who take advantage of the position open to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will agree with me that that question is a little wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords manufactured exports from the united kingdom to the federal republic of germany in real cash terms in were million in million in million in million <e> <s> that shows an increase of per cent in over <e>", "<cs> the answer is no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of factors which influence the competitiveness or otherwise of our exporting industrialists and currency fluctation is but one <e> <s> however it is one that is widely recognised by her majestys government <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to respond on behalf of my noble friend the chief whip who because of matters of state is not able to be in your lordships house <e> <s> i do hope that no noble lord will see in his absence any discourtesy whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords i am repeating the first thing that i said that we would introduce legislation having that effect <e> <s> columns and must be read together <e> <s> i do not think that there is any disagreement between any of us on that matter <e> <s> we have given an undertaking to legislate on the licences of right issues at the earliest opportunity <e> <s> we see that within the context of the forthcoming implementation by legislation of the white paper <e> <s> that should leave this bill without the controversy great length and complexity that the amendments in the name of the noble lord lord northfield cause <e> <s> i ask your lordships to consider the report of this bill and reject the amendment to that motion tabled by the noble lord lord northfield <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord northfield for the way in which he has put forward his points <e> <s> perhaps i may make it quite clear to your lordships that we regard the pharmaceutical industry as one of our major industries <e> <s> the noble lord is quite correct <e> <s> the industry exports about one-third of its manufactured products and earns for this country between billion and billion each year <e> <s> it is not an industry that should be trifled with nor would i wish to trifle with it over this matter because broadly speaking we agree with the noble lord in his summary of the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for explaining his amendment so <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may say that my noble friend beside me has reminded me that in giving an explanation as to why i wanted to change what was on the marshalled list in relation to amendment no <e> <s> i said page <e> <s> of course i should have said that the amendment should read page line at end insert <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a principle with which the government can continue as it is a matter entirely for the post office to deal with in <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no policy to close rural post offices <e> <s> rural post offices do close usually when a sub-postmaster retires or resigns and the post office cannot find a suitable replacement to take on the office <e> <s> of the rural post offices there have therefore been some closures and some openings <e> <s> in the past six years the result is a net figure in closures <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the leader of the opposition raises a number of points <e> <s> the house will know that the post office is under a statutory duty to provide its services economically and efficiently while having regard to the social needs of the united kingdom <e> <s> that i am quite sure the board of the post office has in mind <e> <s> we as well as the post office are aware of the impact that the loss of a village sub-post office has on a rural community <e> <s> nevertheless there are some post offices in rural areas <e> <s> with regard to the death or retirement of a postmaster while the post office may very well wish to maintain the service in that area it depends upon a suitable postmaster or postmistress coming forward to take up the vacancy <e>", "<cs> my lords the post office has on a number of occasions reviewed the opportunities that there may be first for opening on a part-time or limited basis and secondly for operating a mobile post office <e> <s> such matters are given consideration on appropriate occasions <e>", "<cs> not on this occasion my lords as the matter is wide of the original question on the order paper <e> <s> in an earlier answer i may have said that there are rural post offices in operation i should have said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not able with my knowledge of the board of the post office to agree with the noble lords suggestion <e> <s> nevertheless i give an assurance that i shall draw his comments to the attention of the chairman of the board <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to acknowledge the response of the noble lord lord bruce of donington to the statement that i have just made <e> <s> but his response raised no questions for me to answer <e> <s> the noble lord lord diamond asked me a question why have we entered into negotiations that have now been abandoned <e> <s> the reason as i have oft repeated in your lordships house is that it is the governments intention to return british leyland to the private sector because we believe that the company and its subsidiary companies would be better able to function in the private sector <e> <s> that we still believe <e> <s> it has been our intention in pursuing that aim to ensure long-term future viability particularly of the truck industry to which land rover and range rover were attached at the outset <e> <s> unless some rationalisation takes place we believed at that time and believe today that that future is in some jeopardy <e>", "<cs> my lords i say this within the context of the statement that is land rover and range rover <e> <s> there is no doubt that the management through their rationalisation of assembly plants into one establishment that of solihull the past years improvement in profitability which was marginally better than the previous year and which brought that subsidiary company from loss to profit and the plans for wider international distribution of the product which is gaining a more favourable acceptance give us reason to suppose that the company may very well prosper <e> <s> we have faith in the company in pursuing their policies <e> <s> that will <e>", "<cs> my lords because the management buy-out the conditions attached and so on and so forth when set against the option of leaving the company within british leyland for a future date were not considered as attractive <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to be pedantic but when the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran refers to british leyland we are talking about only one aspect of british leyland that of land rover-freight rover <e> <s> so far as the timing is concerned it is frankly very difficult to tell when a more propitious moment may arrive <e> <s> we would seek to identify that moment in concert with the british leyland board and then pursue the objective which i have described <e> <s> with regard to trade union consultation my honourable friend the minister for industry and my right honourable friend the secretary of state have received every delegation from the trade unions who have asked for consultation <e> <s> indeed my right honourable friend the secretary of state has made himself available to mr todd who has declined to accept the invitation to discuss these matters with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord mcintosh and the noble lord lord mcnair for their consideration of these regulations <e> <s> i should like to add to what i said earlier with regard to the noble lord lord ennals and to the packaging industry which has borne the burden of the report that has resulted in these regulations <e> <s> without their help we should not have been able to get so far as we have <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords but i am sure the noble lord will accept the point i made <e> <s> accepting what he said takes me on to his second point about which i should like to say this <e> <s> first we are immensely grateful to the manufacturing <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends to some extent on what my noble friend means by late <e> <s> for example in urban areas the first delivery should be made between am and am <e> <s> the rural areas normally receive one delivery each day and this can continue until lunchtime or even the early afternoon <e> <s> there are social consequences for post office staff in altering that <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that local monitoring is undertaken as an integral part <e>", "<cs> my lords the post office is as the house will know a body set up by statute whose operational matters are within the control of the board <e> <s> i can certainly give my noble friend and all noble lords an assurance that the expressions of disquiet that your lordships have made on three occasions in the past six weeks will be conveyed to the chairman of the board of the post office <e>", "<cs> my lords that of course is quite right <e> <s> the matter raised by my noble friend lord pender is as i suggested in my earlier answer an operational matter for the post office <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no imprecision as between the government and the post office in this matter <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> it is the governments policy to return to the private sector all those businesses that are currently in the public sector where such opportunity arises since we believe that they can operate rather more efficiently in that climate than they can otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend because i can confirm that that is the case <e> <s> at the same time i remind your lordships that the real cost of mails and other postal services is lower than it was years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for retailing his experience which i confirm <e> <s> in most postal areas postmasters and their staffs are as helpful as they can be <e> <s> in particular the mail service has increased by per cent <e> <s> i think in three years <e> <s> a huge amount of business is being done the vast bulk of it to the satisfaction of the consumer <e>", "<cs> no my lords i was not aware of those two facts <e> <s> i envy the noble lord having two deliveries in a day even if they happen to cross <e>", "<cs> my lords in most respects i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> the post office has been at pains not to increase the cost of services and your lordships will recall that the cost of second-class mail was reduced <e> <s> it is a question of cost-effectiveness <e> <s> although mail deliveries are nearly reaching the performance target set by the post office board which i think your lordships will find acceptable one has to bear in mind the cost to the consumer in providing not only statistics but additional services <e>", "<cs> not without notice my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords as hosts to the international tin council the united kingdom is bound by the headquarters agreement to accord the immunities set out in that agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with interest to the comments that the noble lord lord bruce of donington made <e> <s> in answer to the questions that he asked i would say first that the government are not satisfied on the basis of breach of the tin agreement or otherwise that there is any legal justification for withdrawing the immunities <e> <s> secondly that there may have been arrangements between the itc and some creditors is a matter between the itc and those creditors <e> <s> it is certainly not one for her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord should i think address the first part of his question to me when i answer the second question on the order paper in the name of the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> as to the wider issue it was certainly regrettable that some itc countries refused to participate in the proposed settlement made in march <e> <s> that is a matter of some regret to ourselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret very much that i cannot answer the question of the noble lord lord williams with regard to joint and/or joint and several responsibility since the various advices that her majestys government have had are not totally in accord <e> <s> there are different views with regard to that point <e> <s> the governments liability is restricted under the agreement to per cent <e> <s> of the amount involved <e> <s> again at this stage i am not able to tell the house what those liabilities may total since all claims have not yet been registered <e>", "<cs> my lords in when we entered into the sixth agreement it seemed the right and proper thing to do <e> <s> i do not think that it would be helpful were i with hindsight to suggest what we might or might not have done because events themselves have dictated this position <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that discussions through diplomatic channels continue in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the determination of the machinery is in the hands of the litigants <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have made clear that they are willing to consider applications for assistance towards the cost of projects which will make the mines competitive in a free market for tin <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry the noble lord thinks that my original answer will bring small comfort to the tin mining industry in cornwall <e> <s> i repeat because i should not like anybody to misunderstand that we are willing to consider any application for assistance which will make the mines competitive in a free market for tin <e> <s> i do not want to bandy numbers with the noble lord opposite but the figure of people to which he refers is quite different from what the industry has indicated to my department <e> <s> it is more likely to be miners plus people in peripheral activities and some hundreds in associated areas <e> <s> that is a long way short of the figure given by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the question of the noble lord lord molloy boils down simply to this what shall we do when we find that an international agreement is not supported by other countries which are signatories to it <e> <s> this is a matter to which we shall have to give most careful consideration in the light of events and then take what steps we feel are necessary with regard to international commodity agreements <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage all i would be prepared to say in answer is that this is a very complex matter <e> <s> a number of issues are involved <e> <s> one which the noble lord mentions is important but it is by no means unique in terms of the collapse of the tin councils operations <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord cledwyn asks a hypothetical question <e>", "<cs> my lords since we have not yet received claims for assistance though we understand some are on the way it would be wrong for me to suggest the outcome of those applications <e> <s> when the claims have been dealt with might be the right time for the noble lord opposite to raise his question <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i agree with my noble friend lord campbell of alloway that this is a very grave situation <e> <s> it arose in october of last year and came to a head in march of this year <e> <s> other industries have faced what my noble friend describes as emergency circumstances <e> <s> the government will do what they can to resolve those circumstances with the tools which are at their disposal <e> <s> i do not think that there can be any question this afternoon of seeking derogation of our international responsibilities in a matter of this nature <e>", "<cs> my lords in general terms i would agree with what the noble lord says <e> <s> i would refer him to my original answer which was that the government have made it quite clear that they are willing to consider applications for assistance towards the cost of projects which will make the mines competitive in a free market for tin <e> <s> i do not think that i can say any more than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for his remarks <e> <s> i am sure that the house will join me when i say that the joint effort on the part of the noble lord and the government has produced this reasonably satisfactory solution this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington for his remarks and i am grateful to him for what he was able to do during the passage of this bill which he suggested himself on second reading might be controversial <e> <s> undoubtedly its passage was due to his assistance in moving that controversy into an area with which we shall deal much much later <e>", "<cs> my lords the post office has made a number of changes to alleviate the problem which the noble lord raises <e> <s> for example from october pensioners have been given monday in addition to thursday as a payment day <e> <s> child benefits are paid on tuesdays and the bulk of unemployment benefit payments are made on fridays and saturdays <e> <s> the post office has put to the post office unions a package of measures to improve the flexibility of both full-time and part-time staff <e> <s> these matters are under discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships also will be aware the post office has to deal with some million pensioners each week throughout their post offices <e> <s> suggestions as to how the perceived queueing time can be reduced are continually given consideration <e> <s> i have told the house what is in progress between the board and the unions and i look forward as noble lords look forward to a successful outcome of those negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords while the subject of postage stamps is very wide of the question that the noble lord has put down on the order paper may i remind the noble lord lord strabolgi of the answer that i gave to your lordships on th april at col of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure how i should answer the noble lord in response to his first supplementary question other than to say that what he introduced into the post office has been adapted as conditions have changed <e> <s> the second question that he raises i cannot accept because what he is saying does not follow <e> <s> what we have to make sure of and what the post office is trying to do is to ensure that there is the highest possible standard among those who serve behind the counters that as many people are able to be dealt with as possible and that the negotiations which are now in place with the post office unions with regard to the flexibility of existing staff and with the employment of part-time staff to even out the peaks and the troughs remain one of the best chances that the post office has of meeting the surges in demand <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for that observation <e> <s> she is of course quite right <e> <s> matters are devolved to the local management to achieve the best possible service in each locality <e> <s> there can be no overall system imposed because conditions vary quite considerably <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a question of shortage of staff at all <e> <s> i have said on three occasions this afternoon that the post office are in negotiation with the unions to employ more flexibly their existing staff and to employ part-time staff to even out the peaks <e> <s> it is the wish of all those involved in serving the post offices customers to give a good and adequate service as it is equally the responsibility of the board to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to be unkind to my noble friend but the question of deliveries is a little different from the original question <e> <s> i repeat that the post office management are trying to secure with the unions agreements which will ensure greater flexibility in the use of existing staff in various duties and the addition of part-time staff <e> <s> i look forward to the post office and the unions coming to a satisfactory agreement on these matters which i have little doubt will alleviate the conditions which noble lords have described to me this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i think your lordships should be aware that the post office offers throughout its offices some different product transactions <e> <s> pensions though accounting for payments to some people are just one of the <e> <s> the government have certain overall duties in regard to the post office which itself has a statutory duty to provide its services economically and efficiently while having regard to the social needs of the united kingdom <e> <s> it is for the management of the post office to deal with wages and other attendant costs <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not true <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> the provision of telephone directories is a commercial matter between the post office and british telecommunications plc and i understand that neither organisation is under any obligation to make them available in this particular way <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend asks me a number of questions <e> <s> although i accept that perhaps his memory goes back a little further than does my own he will recall that since british telecom was split off from the post office under the act different responsibilities accrue to each of those two entities <e> <s> while the telephone directory is provided by british telecom and it is obliged under its licence conditions to make it available to anyone who requests a directory it can of course make a charge <e> <s> the telephone directory is primarily for those seeking to use the telephone services rather than for use as an address service <e> <s> if the post office wished to provide additional services to its customers it would of course have to pay british telecom for the books though the charge is nominal <e> <s> there are some principal offices most of which have telephone directories <e> <s> the post office is of course under an obligation to ensure that it is cost-effective and meets its customers needs rather than the needs of other services customers <e>", "<cs> my lords that is really not worthy of the noble baroness since i said that the primary role of the telephone directory is for the users of telephones and not the general public who can go to the public libraries if they wish to use other services contained in the directory <e> <s> there is no contractual obligation upon the post office to provide that service <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no disadvantage whatsoever in the privatisation of british telecom which is bringing a wider number of products to the benefit of both commercial and private consumers <e> <s> so far as the post office is concerned it is serving a wider number of customers and delivering larger amounts of mail at very good rates commensurate with anything that can be found in europe <e> <s> the benefits are plain for all to see <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no dog in the manger attitude on the port of either of those two organisations <e> <s> in response to an earlier question this afternoon and again on th april and rd april i reminded your lordships of the statutory duties of the post office one of which is to take care of social needs <e> <s> so far as british telecom is concerned there is the director-general of oftel <e> <s> there are also the consumer advisory committees to safeguard exactly the things of which the noble lord is speaking <e> <s> these matters are dealt with through those channels and have not given rise to undue difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords the addresses of the organisations to which i have referred are available very widely through a number of agencies including citizens advice bureaux public libraries post offices telephone offices and indeed my own department <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords last question following his statement of how he sees various things across the world is not really correct <e> <s> telephone directories are provided <e> <s> were some of the public less inclined to vandalism more copies of telephone directories would still be in the places where the post office provides them at moderate cost to itself with the help of british telecom <e>", "<cs> my lords if one <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe and i think that most of your lordships believe if you look into your heart of hearts that both the post office with its staff and all the staff of british telecom seek to do exactly that and to satisfy their customers <e>", "<cs> my lords united kingdom car exporters will benefit from the <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed the noble lord lord somers is quite correct and of course that argument prevails elsewhere in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords the british overseas trade board had nine separate missions seminars or conferences in spain during <e> <s> there were seminars in the united kingdom advising about potential exporters of the opportunities and the work continues into <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to all three noble lords for their reception of the order which i have put before your lordships house this evening <e> <s> i do not quarrel with the fact that we have in this last minutes or so moved into some rather wider areas but i think that noble lords will not expect me to pick up every single point as perhaps one should like to do in a debate on training in industry <e> <s> however there are a number of points on which i think the house would wish me to comment <e>", "<cs> my lords i said per cent <e> <s> i have to say also that against that fact in the engineering trades and industries manufacturing output investment profits and indeed exports are all increasing <e> <s> output itself was some per cent <e> <s> higher than in <e> <s> in mechanical engineering there has been the highest annual growth since <e> <s> so i think it is not unreasonable to suggest that the industry is doing well and making its contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord lord bruce if i did not answer specifically a number of his detailed points <e> <s> i shall look through <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for the first part of her supplementary question and i shall certainly be pleased to pass her gratitude on to the chairman and the board of the post office <e> <s> as regards the second part of her supplementary question i have to confess that <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said originally i shall convey the gratitude of the noble baroness to the chairman and the board of the post office adding to it of course the governments thanks <e> <s> on the second point i can offer no hope because the post office board has indicated as i have done to your lordships house that there were problems associated with pence stamp issues on other occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill now be read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i was glad to hear from the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey that he does not intend to oppose the bill <e> <s> indeed that would show a vindictiveness which i do not believe that he personally feels towards this government nor do i believe that he can possibly sustain the accusation that the government are vindictive towards the shipbuilding industry <e>", "<cs> my lords my answer was very much in line with that which i gave to my noble friend lord gainford also on th march <e> <s> these are matters for the commercial judgment of the company and the cost to which the noble lord lord annan refers is something like million <e> <s> it would also mean books some per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> bigger and thicker than they are now <e> <s> these are not considered by british telecom as being necessary for it to discharge its obligations to telephone users <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that would be for production costs alone <e> <s> a similar sum would be spent on completing and correcting post codes on the computer files so we are talking in terms of something like million all of which of course would have to be borne by the users of the telephone service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that my noble friend lord nugent of guildford should consider this to be a non-answer <e> <s> it is a practical and commercial answer which i feel quite sure he will understand very well indeed <e> <s> there are two separate businesses <e> <s> both of them have to fulfil under statute different roles <e> <s> both of them have to provide profit <e> <s> it is for their commercial decision as to where they spend their money in the provision of those services <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord marsh for that very pragmatic and helpful suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has misunderstood me <e> <s> i did refer to commercial advantages and i think that if he looks at <e>", "<cs> my lords this is absolutely a matter between the post office and british <e>", "<cs> my lords i explained that post code directories are available at the crown offices some urban offices and some rural offices <e>", "<cs> my lords the information is available for the whole of the country across the country through crown offices and some other offices <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that the exchange of views expressed by your lordships this afternoon will by virtue of <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lady i have very little time spending most of it in the service of your lordships <e> <s> however i satisfy myself that those people with whom i wish to communicate advise me of their post code <e> <s> there are a number of ways in which they can do that <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do not have a responsibility in so far as british telecom is concerned as regards the printing <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lady gardner of parkes for having taken up the cause of consumer safety in introducing this bill to your lordships this evening <e> <s> let me say straight away that this measure though not a government bill has the full support of the government <e> <s> it seeks to implement in part some of the proposals we put foward in july in our white paper on the safety of goods <e> <s> these are important proposals to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the enforcement of existing safety regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i took note of what the noble lord lord bruce of donington said in the earlier part of his response over which i shall also <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord molloy for his question <e> <s> i can tell him that some million is spent through the yts scheme particularly in this sector of the industry <e> <s> there are students in non-advanced courses <e> <s> four universities and polytechnics are providing degree and diploma courses <e> <s> it might be of interest to your lordships to know that my noble friend lord forte is chairman of the hotel management committee at surrey university <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for my noble friends first question <e> <s> on the second point i did not know that he had made the visit <e> <s> as to his third question i can confirm that some people are undertaking occupational training in hotel and catering trades through the job training scheme <e> <s> some occupational trainees are undergoing other training schemes and there are trainees on small business courses <e> <s> there are nationwide centres to analyse training needs which will continue to be an important part of the work of the manpower services commission <e>", "<cs> my lords the number of employed people in this sector is increasing <e> <s> there has been an increase of about per cent <e> <s> this year <e> <s> job centres were able to fill per cent <e> <s> of the vacancies advertised last year <e> <s> that is i believe quite a good record <e> <s> as to conditions in an analysis of people employed in the catering industry only per cent <e> <s> were found to be receiving wages below the agreed levels <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel quite sure that the industry itself is extremely aware of the necessity to maintain and to improve high standards in kitchens and throughout the entire range of staff who serve in this industry including receptionists clerks and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather resent the implication of the question of the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> i can perhaps answer him best by saying that my middle son is engaged in this industry <e> <s> it is something that we discuss from time to time at home <e> <s> i do not believe from the evidence that i have that the practice is at all widespread <e> <s> i can certainly assure your lordships house that we have no intention of legislating in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords i resent the question in that it implied i think that it went further than an implication that the hotel and catering industry cheat <e> <s> i do not believe that they cheat <e>", "<cs> my lords there are various arrangements in most catering establishments with regard to the disposal or disbursement of gratuities <e> <s> different establishments operate different schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know because i do not know the precise arrangements that operate in individual establishments <e> <s> if the noble lord opposite or the noble lord lord monson has a specific instance i should be pleased to look into it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether it is in breach <e> <s> i should like to see precisely what the customer is being invited to pay for and whether that invitation makes clear what he is being invited to pay for <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for the industry itself to regulate its own matters <e> <s> as i have said different practices occur in different establishments <e> <s> i believe that the industry will be interested in the exchange of views and will take note of what noble lords have said on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord heard me correctly <e> <s> i said that in all wages council industries of all workers where pay was checked only per cent <e> <s> were found to be underpaid <e>", "<cs> my lords there is an inspectorate <e> <s> it is the job of the inspectorate to establish those facts and take the appropriate measures <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord rightly reminds me that the wages council bill committee stage is in your lordships house next week no doubt noble lords will take the advantage of raising that during that stage <e> <s> i take note of what the noble lord has to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite confident that if the industry wished to discuss any points with my right honourable and noble friends or indeed my honourable friends in the department such a meeting could probably be arranged <e>", "<cs> my lords i said all wages council industries <e> <s> i did not select any particular sector <e> <s> i am afraid therefore that i cannot divide that figure over all the wages council industries <e>", "<cs> my lords i have noticed and indeed my noble friend draws the attention of the house to this the consideration that the post office is giving to the question of cost but that is very much a commercial matter for the post office as indeed are charges by british telecommunications a commercial matter for that company <e> <s> the director general of oftel has an input into that area <e> <s> so far as the governments role is concerned perhaps i may assure my noble friend that i shall be happy to talk with the director general of oftel about matters which concern your lordships as i would take an early opportunity to discuss with the post office also matters which concern your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords meetings in public are fine and if the noble lord wishes to have a meeting in public with either of those two bodies that is entirely up to him <e> <s> i have to remind your lordships that the government have no <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as british telecommunications is concerned the privatisation of that service has been of great benefit to the telephone user the public at large and indeed industry at large and is a singular success in privatisation <e> <s> so far as the post office is concerned in it was removed as a separate corporation and is making strenuous efforts particularly by virtue of its recent agreements to improve its services both to its employees and to its consumers <e>", "<cs> yes my lords many <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to find that notwithstanding a certain lack of advertising there is one of your lordships who finds the collaborative service between the post office and british telecommunications of some great benefit and i shall be delighted to pass on that message to both those bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that that is an area in which british telecommunications are engaged and i am sure that the advancing <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that my answer to my noble friend lord beloffs supplementary question expressed the interest of her majestys government <e> <s> i repeat that i shall discuss with the director general of oftel in whom parliament has placed the responsibility for meeting the public interest and i shall take an opportunity of discussing separately with the post office those matters which your lordships have drawn to the attention of both and indeed the house in the four questions in the last three months that i have had the privilege of answering <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the noble lords first supplementary question is concerned i can tell him that there was a meeting between the office of fair trading british telecom and my honourable friend the minister responsible in the department of trade for the regulation of telephone services to deal with offensive telephone services which i think embraces the one that the noble lord mentioned <e> <s> on th june british telecom issued a press notice saying that it was setting up a meeting with providers of these services so that a code of practice so far as content was concerned could be determined <e> <s> as regards the noble lords second question about the m rate of p per minute which is charged in eight second slots the director general of oftel has in his press release of th june said that he intends taking up this question with british telecom so that the charges are better understood and realised by the users of the telephone services <e>", "<cs> my lords a supercall is one of a number of premium products of british telecom <e> <s> for example there is a direct line for ones fortune to be told there is a direct line for city news and so on <e> <s> these are not regulated in terms of price a free market obtains <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not like the house to believe that british telecoms premium product service is concerned only with pornography <e> <s> a number of users require additional <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly check the <e>", "<cs> my lords the privatisation of british telecom has been a great success <e> <s> the company is profitable the workpeople are largely shareholders and the general public have benefited from it <e> <s> it is an example of what this government are intending to do to other businesses in the public sector for the benefit of the workpeople the nation at large and the public <e>", "<cs> my lords i do indeed recall the exchange way back in june <e> <s> although i do not know the total content of the paper i understand that it will review relevant areas of law and the experience of the office of fair trading with codes of practice <e> <s> the paper will also consider parallels for a general duty both in domestic and overseas legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point i have explained that i do not know entirely what the paper will contain and since it is to be published next month it is a little late for me to direct the attention of the director general of fair trading to the point raised by the noble baroness this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say to my noble friend that i do not know exactly what is contained in the paper <e> <s> it is a paper on fair trading <e> <s> it is certainly not a paper on consumer safety so i imagine that the safety elements will not be included <e> <s> the paper is about fair trading and about codes of practice <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the first question from the noble lord i said to the noble baroness lady burton on th march this year that the director general of fair trading has needed a lot of time and has devoted a considerable amount of time to studying what he felt was a very complex matter <e> <s> there were consultations with many interested parties <e> <s> i do not believe that there has been any delay that could have been avoided in the director generals consideration <e> <s> as regards the noble lords second question i am afraid that i cannot tell him any more than next month <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not seen the report <e> <s> i cannot tell the noble baroness what is in the report <e> <s> my noble friend lord belstead may very well have said that <e> <s> i have a copy <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding the first part of the noble lords supplementary question we have over diplomatic and senior commercial officers serving throughout tropical africa <e> <s> when these posts are inspected the level of commercial activity is measured and changes are made to meet the criteria <e> <s> as regards support the british overseas trade board has a tropical africa advisory group and that is comprised of businessmen active in the markets concerned <e> <s> they provide the botb with advice on strategy for overseas trade and the botb directs and develops the export promotion services on behalf of the department alongside that advice <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that copies of the london chamber of commerce and industrys questionnaire were sent out <e> <s> there were responses of which only were usable <e>", "<cs> i am very well aware of the importance of the london chamber of commerce and industry and i believe that in my original answer i said that we were following up those points which have been made to us <e> <s> this week my honourable friend the minister for trade discussed the content of the survey with the chamber <e> <s> as i said we are following up the points made <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has introduced a subject very much wider than that covered by the original question <e> <s> we are talking about promotion services and trade aid to tropical africa <e> <s> as i have said we continually review the amounts of money that we spend in this area <e> <s> the government attempt to have a balanced programme for public expenditure and trade support in its variety of forms is contained within our continuing survey of this kind of expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that of the responses seven were so to speak spoiled papers and contained no information that could usefully be used by the statisticians <e>", "<cs> my lords staff resources are limited and they have to be deployed to the best effect <e> <s> in spite of cuts tropical africa is still better served in its ratio of commercial manpower to exports than any other area in the world except latin america and the caribbean <e> <s> generous tribute was paid to the overseas commercial posts and those who serve in them in written evidence including evidence from the london chamber to the foreign affairs committee in another place on the foreign office vote and also in your lordships select committee report on the decline in trade of manufactured goods <e> <s> both paid tribute to the work being done and the success of our commercial officers abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear that mergers and restrictive practices legislation are the areas that at present are of most concern and it is right that the review should concentrate on these particularly regarding the definition of public policy <e>", "<cs> my lords it is in the areas of mergers and restrictive trade practices legislation that the definition of public interest is causing the most concern <e> <s> as regards special arrangements for regulating privatised areas i think that at the moment it would be inadvisable to disturb those arrangements since the regulations are so newly in force <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have sought to explain it is the areas of mergers and restrictive practices that are giving the most cause for concern <e> <s> therefore it is right that the review should concentrate on these areas <e> <s> if anything should follow from that of course it will be dealt with <e> <s> i can give my noble friend the assurance that i shall do more than hint to my right honourable friend <e> <s> i shall certainly convey to my right honourable friend the concern that my noble friend and others have in this regard <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the company holds licences but i would not regard normal commercial relations between two companies as necessarily being immoral <e> <s> with regard to military equipment we have taken advice and i understand that the equipment that is being made does not contravene any of our national or international obligations <e> <s> therefore there is no question that the company to which the noble lord refers is in breach of any obligation <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that companies house have not suggested that there is anything irregular whatsoever with the company its registrations or its returns to companies house <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no evidence that milcolm electronics has acted illegally <e> <s> if the noble lord has any evidence to the contrary then i shall certainly consider looking further into the matter <e> <s> otherwise i shall not <e>", "<cs> my lords i know it because the import and export licensing procedures would have revealed such evidence <e> <s> none such has been revealed <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should best answer that by saying that the significance or insignificance is relative to the point of view that one takes <e> <s> there are those who differ with the noble lord <e> <s> the idea is that there will not be an elephantine bureaucratic set up because that is the very nature of the self-regulating process contained in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords let me put it this way <e> <s> i have set out our current thinking and it would need a good deal of very powerful persuasion to make us change our currently held view <e> <s> nevertheless i should not say that the door was closed but nor should i say that it was open <e> <s> it is nominally ajar <e> <s> if the matter would like to creep through one afternoon i shall be happy to help <e>", "<cs> my lords there is indeed a greater degree of activity in the chinese market <e> <s> the british overseas trade board have responded to this by sponsoring joint ventures missions and six seminars in china for the year <e> <s> one has to recall that british overseas trade board funds are to an extent limited and we have to respond to all the world markets in giving support <e>", "<cs> my lords the government of course will support where they can any scheme for the furtherance of trade with overseas countries <e> <s> my understanding is that the trade and cultural centre is a private enterprise operation in conjunction with one of the municipal states of china <e> <s> i am sure that whatever help can be given through the normal channels would be given to a private enterprise effort of that nature <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lords question could be directed to a number of countries <e>

requires any defence that they cannot exhibit at every single fair right across the world <e> <s> the botb through sponsor divisions offer the opportunity <e> <s> if industry fails to take it up then i might suggest that that is to that industrys disadvantage <e> <s> certainly in these instances it is rather like leading a horse to water and you cannot actually make it drink when you get it there <e>", "<cs> my lords five projects have been agreed with the chinese for consideration under the million development loan facility <e> <s> these involve a power station a tractor factory a stainless steel tube mill a fibre optics transmission equipment facility and two specialised container ships <e> <s> all these matters are under discussion with the chinese authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords without wishing in any way to be condemnatory of the chinese theirs is of course a relatively poor country and their conservation of hard currency shows a certain prudence but there is no doubt that politically and commercially they have declared an interest in buying more from the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will know this is essentially a matter for the european commission <e> <s> we shall give what support we can in the consultations that the community ourselves and china have on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly not for the government to support or in any way interfere with the individual twinning arrangements that towns and cities in this country have with towns and cities in any other country <e> <s> certainly we support joint and collaborative arrangements between our business houses and business houses in other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendments <e> <s>

lord hacking for explaining the purpose of his amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i am also very glad he acknowledges that there are a great number of difficulties in getting this absolutely right <e> <s> perhaps i may say this to the noble lord <e> <s> we have been aware of the concerns that have been expressed by the law society and the association of corporate treasurers about the use of the word activity <e> <s> it has been suggested that this might mean that a person could be regarded as carrying on investment business in the united kingdom if by way of business he carried out a single transaction within part ii of schedule to which the exclusions in parts iii and iv do not apply <e> <s> that is certainly not the intended effect of the bill nor do we think that it is the actual effect <e>", "<cs> i shall resist the temptation that my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne offers me to speculate on my feet <e> <s> i hoped to satisfy the noble lord lord hacking with the description i gave of how we saw the word engages <e> <s> he however is not satisfied <e> <s> i also hoped that he might have come up with an alternative but he has not done so this evening <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord hacking described his amendment as being purist <e> <s> for myself i cannot see any difference in substance between what is in the bill and the noble lords amendment but if the noble lord believes that his words express the intention behind the paragraph more clearly i am quite happy to accept his amendment <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i shall move amendments nos <e> <s> and and speak to amendments nos and <e>", "<cs> i think i said that i would speak to it <e> <s> perhaps it may be more helpful to the committee if i took the other group that is the amendments beginning with amendment no <e> <s> a little later on and now merely dispense with amendments nos <e> <s> and which are a straight-forward pair of amendments <e> <s> paragraph of schedule as drafted was considered to be wide enough to include such documents as proxy forms and that certainly was not our intention <e> <s> these amendments nos <e> <s> and narrow the definition accordingly <e> <s> if the committee agrees perhaps it would be best if i just move amendments nos <e> <s> and at this stage <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that it does <e> <s> if by any chance i am wrong then i shall correct it <e>", "<cs> i think i was right first time in that i am advised that futures on any metal or other commodity are within the ambit of the bill but options on metals other than gold and silver are out <e> <s> this amendment seeks to extend the definition to include options on gold and silver <e> <s> i do not think the advice i have given the noble lord is any different <e>", "<cs> i must say yes to the noble lord because i can think of no very good reason for saying no <e> <s> we shall certainly give consideration to what he has said <e>", "<cs> i assume that the noble lord wished to deal with amendment no <e> <s> at the same time since they deal with much the same problem that of overlaps <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> refers to page line and is concerned with much the same problem of overlap <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for raising the matter <e>", "<cs> i am glad that my noble friend lord boardman has explained so clearly what is worrying him <e> <s> however the proposed amendment would exempt futures contracts for currency whenever one of the parties was a bank or licensed institution irrespective of the customer and irrespective of the size of the transaction <e> <s> i think this goes much too far <e> <s> it appears to me that the amendment proposes to remove from the protection offered to the investor by this bill any futures contracts in currency entered into by a bank or a licensed deposit taking institution <e> <s> if they make contracts with private investors there will be no statutory protection of any kind <e> <s> as i have said this goes too far i think there is a difference because the intention of the bill is not to interfere with genuine commercial contracts in the normal sense of a commercial contract which has no investment purpose <e>", "<cs> as i understand it there are already provisions with regard to the beneficiaries and i believe they are covered under another act so far as the transfer of their interests is concerned where a company or an occupational pension scheme is in force <e> <s> i do not see that there is any difficulty there <e> <s> the interest merely transfers because they have the right which is set up i think under one of the investment protection acts or it may be in one of the company pension and investment acts <e> <s> it escapes my mind which act it is but i recall that there is provision which determines the various interests of people such as the noble lord has described <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord ezra and the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe for their explanation and i am sorry that just before dinner i should perhaps strike a jarring note because i am in fact going to advise the committee to reject this amendment <e>", "<cs> three points have been made <e> <s> the noble lord lord morton of shuna is quite correct in his first point <e> <s> there is a typographical error <e> <s> the line should read <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> this is a matter of grouping and we can return to the noble lords amendment at the appropriate time <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord hacking <e> <s> i shall in fact move the <e>", "<cs> the noble lord may quite easily have suggested a number of exemptions from the definition of investment advice additional to <e>", "<cs> not amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i wish first to apologise to the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e> <s> it is obvious now that the introductory speech that i made was far too brief <e> <s> i shall therefore go back and speak in a little more detail <e> <s> this might remove some of the noble lords doubts and also i think answer most of his questions and probably those too of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord is quite right and since i agreed to look at this matter and consider what we mean by engages of course we will take that point on board <e>", "<cs> it is proposed to add a new clause after clause <e> <s> that is amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i was apologising for the lateness of tabling the new clause <e> <s> that was due to last minute comments which necessitated further drafting changes <e> <s> i was going to say that it was a further demonstration of the flexibility of the government in these matters <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend advises me that i used the shorthand term <e> <s> they are bodies corporate in the same group or they are participators in a joint enterprise who enter into a transaction for the purpose of that enterprise <e> <s> i hope that that helps the noble lord <e>", "<cs> on page of the bill in clause which is the interpretation clause at line the noble lord will find <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether i can really help the noble lord any further <e> <s> so far as this schedule is concerned we find on the marshalled list that there is an interpretation of what a joint enterprise means <e> <s> it means <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could start by reminding the committee of what the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe said <e> <s> he asked us to be very careful about excluding newspapers <e> <s> i should like to suggest to the committee that we should be very careful before approving a statutory requirement for newspapers to obtain authorisation before they can publish a city column <e> <s> such authorisation would make them subject to the conduct of business rules <e>", "<cs> it is for the secretary of state to make the decision as to whether the publication should be certificated <e> <s> that is a natural piece of protection <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord is quite right <e>", "<cs> the undertaking i gave earlier in discussing amendment no <e> <s> applies in this case as well and i shall consider between now and report stage what amendments are necessary to remove the undesirable overlap between the paragraphs in part i of the schedule <e> <s> i must say however that i certainly do not extend at this stage such consideration to any other overlaps so far as <e>", "<cs> whether it is line or line i do not think matters too much this evening <e> <s> in principle i am quite content to accept the proposal that underlines these amendments <e> <s> it would certainly be quite sensible to add a reference to debenture warrants <e> <s> with regard to convertible debentures i am not sure about that <e>", "<cs> the answer to both questions in short is no i cannot <e> <s> but i shall do so <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord graham for putting his points so succinctly <e> <s> i can confirm and am glad to confirm that his understanding on all three points is correct <e> <s> the co-operative funds the industrial and provident societies shares are not covered by the definition of investments and therefore do not come within the scope of the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord hacking is right <e> <s> the definition of futures in the bill in paragraph on pages and is difficult <e> <s> my honourable friend the under-secretary of state in another place during committee on th january acknowledged the possibility of improving upon that definition <e> <s> we have approached in a constructive frame of mind various proposals that we have received <e> <s> for example it is sensible to distinguish between futures contracts and spot contracts where delivery is immediate or follows within a few days <e>", "<cs> i am responding i hope quite rightly and the noble lord lord hacking will correct me if i am wrong to amendment no <e> <s> and amendment no <e> <s> since amendment no <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that it is the government of india act that might possibly be the most adequate precedent but i do not think that we will get too far tonight by pursuing that <e>", "<cs> i have frequently from this bench and even more frequently when i was sitting on that side of the chamber argued the various cases for affirmative or negative resolution <e> <s> i accept that there are difficulties but with all the difficulties of the practices which your lordships have applied for some long time i would suggest to the committee that on balance the system works really quite well <e>", "<cs> i really am most grateful to the noble lord lord williams for the manner in which he has explained to the committee what lies behind his amendments <e> <s> certainly if by his amendment he intended to emphasise that there must be regulatory provision to ensure that a business authorised to give investment advice does not improperly use its position to influence customers to use its other services then i do not think that i would dissent from that objective <e> <s> there should be proper regulatory provision for preventing conflicts of interest and we believe that clause provides just that regulatory provision <e>", "<cs> then i think that i have understood the noble and learned lord aright because the conduct of business rules and this can be found in paragraph of schedule must make provision for subordination of the authorised persons interests to those of the client <e> <s> i do not believe that of itself separate ownership does not guarantee that conflicts of interest can be avoided <e> <s> an unscrupulous operator and i think that the noble lord lord tryon said this could easily arrange for the business to be conducted separately and yet in such a way that those separate businesses could work together to the detriment of clients <e> <s> i welcomed what the noble lord lord tryon said <e>", "<cs> i think i heard the noble lord aright nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for making it clear that he is seeking further information <e> <s> certainly we envisage that the sros will <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i misunderstood the noble lord <e> <s> perhaps i can make it a little clearer by saying that the noble lords second amendment deletes the reference in the definition of an sros rules and changes it to refer to rules laid down other than by the organisation itself <e> <s> that reflects the fact that sros may incorporate into their rulebooks rules made by another body in which case of course they then enforce their own rules <e> <s> some may wish to incorporate into their rules accountancy standards or other kinds of rules <e> <s> the clause as drafted makes clear that if they do so those standards and those rules become part of the sros rules for the purposes of the bill <e>", "<cs> in fact that is exactly the point <e> <s> it is the rules that could be laid down by the secretary of state or the designated agency as for example in clause which we will come to dealing with clients money <e> <s> i am very sorry that i did not make it abundantly clear <e>", "<cs> the point we have in mind here is that guidance may not be issued only in a written document <e> <s> with modern technology guidance may be stored on computers with the facility to call it up on a screen when it is necessary to refer to it <e> <s> we did not find it very easy to find the right words to explain the concept and perhaps the words we have chosen are not altogether satisfactory <e> <s> however i think they convey the intention clearly enough at least i hope they do <e>", "<cs> if memory serves me right i think we embraced this form only a few weeks ago when we were discussing the patents designs and marks bill because of the change in technology which was envisaged in that area <e> <s> we were talking at that time about a register <e> <s> the old statute implied a register which was in a book that could be looked at and photocopied <e> <s> during the passage of that bill we enlarged it so as to include a computer printout so i think that there is already a precedent accepted <e>", "<cs> a number of suggestions have been made <e> <s> as i said i am not sure that we actually found the right wording <e> <s> i think the intention is quite clear to the committee <e> <s> suppose i invite the committee to accept that intention <e> <s> of course we will look to see whether we can find a better word but i have a suspicion that at the end of the day we will find another word and then some other member of the committee will find that objectionable and suggest yet another one <e> <s> that sort of thing frequently happens in this kind of area <e>", "<cs> one would expect because of the very nature of the arrangements one envisages for sros that word of mouth would not transmit easily <e> <s> mistakes are made and if sros are going to do their job properly one would expect them to put in some kind of documentary form or legible form which can be referred to and not easily forgotten <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord boardman <e> <s> as i said earlier we shall have another think about it but i believe that the intention is quite clear <e>", "<cs> it is envisaged that there will probably be five or six sros <e> <s> this depends entirely on the range of products that each organisation is intending to cover <e> <s> it may be that an sro will deal with a very narrow band of products which do not encompass all the activities of one of its members in which case yes certainly a member may have to join more than one <e> <s> it is designed in that way so that the sros can properly enforce the area which they have chosen to represent as an organisation <e>", "<cs> i readily accept and i have sought to demonstrate our acceptance the desirability of keeping the number of sros to the minimum but it has to be consistent with the effective regulation of the whole range of investment business <e> <s> the purpose of clause is to allow the secretary of state or the designated agency to refuse recognition on the grounds that there is no need for it having regard to the existence of other organisations which are or are likely to be recognised <e> <s> we have always expected that one of the factors to be taken into account is the desirability of keeping the numbers down though there will also be other factors <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord colville for grouping his amendments <e> <s> he asked me particularly to give two answers <e> <s> i am delighted to do so <e> <s> the first answer is yes and the second answer is no <e> <s> perhaps i could be a little more helpful <e> <s> what i mean is that yes i am happy to accept my noble friends first amendment because it really is a helpful clarification and i am grateful to him for it <e>", "<cs> i recall the noble lord lord bruce raising this point by way of a parliamentary question a few weeks ago <e> <s> i said at that time that every person would have to be authorised <e> <s> a person may be in a recognised professional body today which might offer automaticity <e> <s> such a person may apply to a self-regulating organisation on his own account or he may seek direct authorisation <e> <s> whichever route the person takes and even if he is an existing member of for example a recognised professional body it will be for that recognised professional body to satisfy itself that newcomers and all those in existing membership have the right qualities and qualifications <e>", "<cs> the sros can alter their own rules and provided any alteration makes a provision over and above the designated agencys rules then of course everything is perfectly all right <e> <s> it is for the sib as the regulatory authority to advise the secretary of state of the acceptance of a self-regulatory organisation <e> <s> it is not for the secretary of state so to do <e> <s> it will be for the sro to satisfy the sib in the event of there being no sib rule to which the sros new rule can be compared <e> <s> it will not be able to bring it into force until it has the necessary authority which may well mean the sib having to change its rules <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee if i have not made myself clear and it is obvious that i have not done so <e> <s> provided an sro makes rules in addition to and over and above the basic ones contained in the sib rules it can do so without let or hindrance <e> <s> therefore the sros have the flexibility which i think my noble friend is seeking <e>", "<cs> when i said that i intended to speak to these amendments i rather wanted to suggest to the committee that we resist these three amendments but i thought that it might be preferable for the noble lord to explain what he had in mind before i over-guessed him perhaps <e> <s> these three amendments would permit the enforcement as well as the monitoring function of recognised self-regulating organisations to be delegated to another body <e> <s> i can see the force of the argument that these sros in the absence of any other pressures might in some cases at least tend to be too lenient toward their own members in the interests of good relations <e> <s> but in fact the bill contains safeguards which are designed to prevent this <e> <s> for instance the governing body will have to include a significant independent element if it is to satisfy the requirements of paragraph of schedule <e> <s> that in itself should help to prevent any drift toward leniency <e>", "<cs> i can respond to the noble lords invitation only perhaps by saying that i am quite prepared to have a look at the suggestion <e> <s> i should like to do this with more advice to hand than i have this afternoon though i do not believe that this amendment is at all necessary because anybody can now carry out this function <e> <s> however i shall of course have a look at it with the best will in the world <e>", "<cs> frankly i do not think i can go any further than my original remarks <e> <s> i said then that it had become very clear to us that it would be very difficult for monitoring to be delegated to persons not on a list for example in the case of a foreign business <e> <s> because things are changing so fast it seems totally undesirable to have a firm list which would then have to be altered <e> <s> it is far better in the case <e>", "<cs> i accept fully what the noble viscount and the noble lord say about the importance of having effective independent representation on the governing bodies of sros to help to prevent them from becoming cosy clubs which i think is an expression that has crept into our discussions and to ensure that proper account is taken of the interests of users and of the public <e> <s> paragraph of schedule seeks to achieve that objective by making it clear that effective independent representation will be required while leaving it open to individual sros to decide the detailed composition of their governing bodies <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is right <e> <s> i was merely quoting the noble viscount who said that there was no great magic about a third <e> <s> i agree <e> <s> as a general statement i would not differ from the proposi-tion that something like a third of the members should be independent <e> <s> the sib has said that if powers to recognise sros are transferred to it it will expect them to have a number of independent individuals of high standing in appropriate positions on their governing bodies <e> <s> it has explained that it is thinking in terms of about one-quarter to one-third of the members of the governing body being independent of the organisation <e> <s> i welcome that statement <e> <s> i think that the committee will probably welcome it also <e>", "<cs> before the noble viscount whose amendments we are discussing replies would it be helpful if i responded to the points which have been put to me <e> <s> i understand what the noble lord lord graham wishes to get on the record <e> <s> equally i appreciate what the noble lord lord obrien had to say <e> <s> i do not think that there is any difference <e> <s> in the bill we are not seeking in any shape or form to introduce any point about industrial relations <e> <s> i think that the noble lord wanted to make the point so that sros and others can take note of what he feels about the matter <e> <s> there is no doubt that this little debate on that point will bring it to their attention without in any way upsetting the position that the noble lord lord obrien puts to us <e>", "<cs> the only addition that i can offer the committee is to reiterate that it has always been the intention that governing bodies should include a significant independent element <e> <s> frankly we believed that this was implicit in paragraph <e> <s> at committee stage in another place a large number of amendments was proposed all seeking to set a precise formula for the constitution and all including an explicit reference to independent members <e> <s> in response to pressure on this point we inserted paragraph which we believed brought out much more explicitly the requirement for independent members <e>", "<cs> i am quite sure that the noble and learned lord opposite will appreciate that in legal matters i certainly do not have any of the knowledge or indeed wealth of experience that he has but i shall do my best to explain our intention in these arrangements <e> <s> perhaps i may turn in my explanation to the noble lords first amendment in the group <e> <s> it might be helpful were i to say that the powers of the court under clause already allow it to give a direction of the kind specified in the noble lords amendment <e> <s> therefore i do not think that anything is to be gained here <e>", "<cs> i shall do my best to give the noble lord some explanation because i fear that the amendments are based on a misunderstanding about how the insurance companies and the friendly societies are treated under the bill <e> <s> both these organisations the insurance companies and the friendly societies are already subject to statutory systems of authorisation and regulation <e> <s> these are designed to protect the policyholders from the risk of their insolvency <e> <s> clearly there will continue to be a need for such regulation after the regulatory system in this bill has come into effect <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i suggest to him that since there is an amendment down in my name no <e> <s> which puts forward proposals for dealing with the way in which insurance companies manage their funds it might be better if we were to discuss the particular point which the noble lord lord williams is now raising when we come to my amendment rather than connect it with the way in which insurance companies and friendly societies generally are dealt with in the bill which is really what his amendment seeks to do <e>", "<cs> no it is to deal only with insurance companies <e>", "<cs> i would prefer to take this point on board when we discuss the insurance companies purely and simply because i think there will have to be much greater consideration of the need for similar provisions for friendly societies <e> <s> up to now we have not thought that the need was similar to that of insurance companies <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams makes the point that in his view there is an equal need <e> <s> i will just have to take that on board and give further consideration to it <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord graham for indicating his intention to raise this point about the impact which the provisions of this bill in particular clause will have purely on the relationship between the central office and the branches of orders of friendly societies <e> <s> it is not the intention that this provision should alter that relationship <e> <s> i think all that the noble lord lord graham wants from me is that assurance which i gladly give <e>", "<cs> i shall try to help the noble lord <e> <s> this clause is essential to give effect to our obligations under the undertakings for collective investment in the transferable securities directive <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> yes he can do those things provided as i have already said that it is part of the scheme <e> <s> it has to be related to that <e> <s> i do not think i can expand any further because one would have to find a situation where the activity was conducted away from the scheme in which case the person would not be able to operate <e> <s> he can do all the things that the noble lord suggests provided that it is in connection with the scheme <e>", "<cs> my noble friend may be absolutely right but i fear that i did not quite manage to put the two together <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams is not correct in his understanding <e> <s> the case that he quoted could not benefit from clause because it is not part of the undertakings for the collective investment and transferable securities scheme itself <e> <s> i am given to understand that they dc not belong <e>", "<cs> i have given four supporting answers <e> <s> it is no use the noble lord lord bruce laughing like that <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams has raised a number of issues and i have given him answers to each of them <e> <s> i suggest to the noble lord that he has not made his point clear enough for me to give the answer which he is seeking <e>", "<cs> perhaps at the outset i may clear up something that may have been my misunderstanding <e> <s> i said that the government would be publishing a consultative document about their future regulation in the autumn <e> <s> if the committee will be kind enough to check <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend how this proposed transaction will be covered <e> <s> the monetary limits are only relevant to the first deal with the wholesale counter-party <e> <s> it is unlikely that any person advising others will confine himself to advice on these instruments <e> <s> in practice we think there is no problem <e> <s> if my noble friend can see a problem as i said in my opening remarks we should be very glad to talk further about it because as the noble viscount acknowledged we want to get this huge improvement as correct as we possibly can <e> <s> i should be only too happy to engage in discussions between now and report if that would help any member of the committee <e>", "<cs> simple the amendment may be but i have to confess to questioning whether it is necessary because the clause as it stands covers arrangements with a recognised investment exchange for transactions effected on the exchange <e> <s> i realise that there is a type of transaction in colloquial parlance off exchange dealing which takes place outside normal trading hours for example <e> <s> but on a well-run exchange here i pause for a moment because i remind the committee if i may that all recognised exchanges will be required to be well run there are rules on reporting clearing and so on which apply to such deals <e> <s> i suggest therefore that the existence of <e>", "<cs> the last time that i had the pleasure of commending one of the amendments of the noble lord lord hacking he accused me of being a little churlish <e> <s> may i say how warmly i welcome his amendment which fills a technical omission <e> <s> i commend it to the committee <e>", "<cs> may i quickly respond to the noble lord <e> <s> the first answer is yes i shall be very happy to talk about this and i shall make myself as available as one reasonably can at this time of the year <e> <s> secondly i mentioned those three exchanges only because they have had special status <e> <s> other exchanges have not necessarily had that status and i should like to give the noble lord the assurance that he seeks <e> <s> we would want to make sure whether the laws in an overseas country in which an exchange has its head office or the regulatory authorities in that country might prevent an exchange from complying fully with each and every requirement of schedule and whether there might be some restriction on the showing of information <e> <s> notwithstanding that the rules and the practices of the exchange taken together with the overseas countrys laws must afford to investors in the uk equivalent protection to that afforded by our own <e> <s> so i can give the noble lord that assurance quite categorically <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord colville for the way in which he put his amendment to the committee <e> <s> as i am sure the committee appreciate he knows that this is a subject which has been considered and is indeed still being considered most carefully by me and my honourable friend in another place the parliamentary under-secretary of state for corporate and consumer affairs <e> <s> we also discussed this matter quite fully during our second reading debate on lth july when the noble viscount lord chandos the noble lords lord roll of ipsden and lord williams of elvel in fact noble lords of all shades of opinion and from all sides of the house spoke in favour of an amendment to permit lawful stabilisation of price not only of course of eurobonds which was then the example taken but also of stocks and shares which may be bought and sold by the wider public <e>", "<cs> i take the point that both my noble friends have made <e> <s> i am always reluctant to make promises particularly late at night when i am not totally sure that i can keep them <e> <s> we should want to consult before we put down an amendment for consideration <e> <s> i should not like to say what form that will take whether it will be a text a piece of paper or consultation in the more popular way <e> <s> i take on board the valid points that both my noble friends have made and will seek to meet them <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that there is anything to be gained by these amendments which perhaps in any case do not express exactly the intentions behind them <e> <s> we can all agree i believe that it is important that the investor should be given sufficient information about investments on offer to enable him to make an informed decision about where to put his money and indeed whether to invest at all <e>", "<cs> if i could come straight to the heart of the matter the safeguards in subsection mean that the rules cannot be altered in this way unless they are unduly burdensome and the alteration does not expose investors to undue risk <e> <s> if the amendment which the noble lord is proposing were made it could mean that the rules might be altered so as to put investors at risk <e> <s> the onus to make a case for alteration will at all times lie with the person making the application and i think that is really quite important <e>", "<cs> i think we have first to be quite clear that the powers in clause are there to be used <e> <s> the expectation is that it will be the sib which will wield these powers <e> <s> before the sib can have the powers transferred to it it will have to show that its rules and regulations will comply with clause <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord mcintosh for the brevity of his proposal <e> <s> i fear that i cannot copy him however because there is and always has been wide concern within the accountancy profession over the word verify <e> <s> we think that the concern is misplaced <e>", "<cs> before i reply in detail to the noble lord lord mcintosh i may give him an indication that we shall want to consider this matter further <e> <s> i shall return to some of his arguments but first i want to address much the same point to my noble friend lord limerick <e> <s> i may say to him that we should like to consider what we understand to be the purport of his amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> perhaps the committee to save time will allow my noble friend to speak to his amendment <e> <s> i could then draw the two together otherwise i shall have to make virtually the same reply to both <e>", "<cs> i am greatly obliged to the noble lord lord mcintosh and to my noble friend lord limerick for explaining to the committee the purpose behind these two amendments <e> <s> let me say straight away that it is important that we get these compensation arrangements right <e> <s> they are an important part of the framework of the bill and it is right that we should give the matter careful thought <e>", "<cs> let me just nail that one <e> <s> that is a disgraceful way to answer what i hoped was a helpful response <e> <s> my noble and learned friend made it abundantly clear at second reading and we have both made it abundantly clear during the course of this committee that we and my honourable friend in another place the minister responsible remain ready and willing to listen to anything that anybody wishes to represent and to embrace it in the bill where we can <e> <s> it is not a question of making up the bill as we go along <e> <s> we are responding to the representations made to us <e>", "<cs> the intention of this amendment that clause should allow regulations to be made concerning the keeping of accounts and records of the interest on clients funds held by an authorised person is already achieved by the current drafting <e> <s> amendments introduced in another place made clear that the list of powers in subsection is without prejudice to the generality of the power in subsection to make regulations with respect to money held in the circumstances specified in the regulations <e>", "<cs> it is always difficult when noble friends behind one put forward such a persuasive case in defence of what in particular my noble friend lord boardman declares as a particular interest but i have to say that there is on behalf of both my noble friends an element of exaggeration <e>", "<cs> i must say i am very disappointed at my noble friend lord boardman <e> <s> with all the technology available today in his own bank and in the whole of the banking system with all the technology employed for the transmission of documents of money of information and with all the technology that is employed to persuade us to buy different products from the bank the fact that the banks cannot devise a system that would give them a reasonable broad check on an account which shows a variation just staggers me <e>", "<cs> i think i could find a solution for my noble friend <e> <s> i do not believe that it is beyond the bounds of possibility given the other side being enjoined in it <e> <s> i do not believe that the enormous manpower problem that my noble friend lord colville raised is at all a reasonable argument <e> <s> when one looks around some of the institutions that have for years been labour intensive and have now gone on to machinery and high technology i think it is unfair of him to suggest that to me <e>", "<cs> no that is not the crucial consideration at all <e> <s> the crucial consideration is the protection of the clients money <e> <s> i shall resist the invitation that my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne makes <e> <s> i do not believe it is for officials in my department to work out the costs <e> <s> i believe that if the banks want to advance the argument that this will be a crippling expense then it is for them to produce the figures to advance that argument not for my department <e>", "<cs> i should say at the outset that i am very sympathetic to the concerns which have given rise to this amendment particularly in the case of bank managers and others who are worried about what subjects they may or may not raise when a client visits them or indeed approaches them <e> <s> there is certainly no wish on the governments part to fetter unreasonably the advice which an authorised business may give to a client who approaches it <e> <s> i know of course that sib share that view <e>", "<cs> i cannot help the noble lord very much <e> <s> the rules were available and published in may <e> <s> they are already being redrafted in the light of the comments made <e> <s> i must say that i am extremely surprised to learn that the noble lord has not been advised of that situation and has not had an opportunity to make a study of the rules <e> <s> what procedure the noble lord adopts at report stage is absolutely in his hands <e> <s> i should not like to advise him at all <e>", "<cs> may i at the outset apologise to the noble lord lord williams of elvel and to the committee for the fact that some of the amendments that the government tabled were tabled late last week <e> <s> in fact only four of those involved substantive change and all but one were tabled by wednesday <e> <s> the other one was tabled on thursday <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord would let me finish perhaps i could complete the answer <e> <s> the exemption for time-sharing arrangements will apply only if the predominant purpose of a scheme is the personal use or enjoyment of the property <e> <s> if the rights in a time-sharing scheme are sold as an investment they most certainly will have to be included in the bill <e>", "<cs> what i said was that the exemption for time sharing will apply only if the predominant purpose of a scheme is personal use or the enjoyment of the property whether it be a house a boat a flat or whatever it may be <e> <s> if the rights in the time-sharing arrangement are sold as an investment they will be included in the bill <e> <s> it is quite simple <e> <s> it depends upon what product is sold <e> <s> if the time-sharing scheme is sold as an investment it is included in the bill <e> <s> if the scheme is sold as the right to enjoy for a week or a fortnight the boat in the med or the cabin in the cotswolds it will be excluded <e> <s> if the noble lord lord mcintosh wishes to address a question to me on that i shall be quite happy to give way presumably he does not <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness does this by way of business it most certainly is <e> <s> on the other hand she may do it out of the goodness of her heart <e> <s> the noble baroness may be in the business of doing this regularly we discussed all this very much earlier when we debated the phrase by way of business but if it is a one-off or an occasional occurrence it cannot be considered to be by way of business <e> <s> in other words if the noble baroness owns a number of cottages and does this regularly engaging in a business of letting to her friends who can then enjoy a variety of benefits then it is a business and then it is regulated by this bill <e>", "<cs> no it does not <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i did not give an answer to the noble lord lord tryon <e> <s> no they are not included <e>", "<cs> perhaps it is a longstop <e>", "<cs> the noble lords understanding is quite correct under regulations in clause <e>", "<cs> all these amendments relate to the criteria for the authorisation of unit trust schemes and i regret that i shall have to resist all three but perhaps the explanations might help the noble lord lord williams to accept my suggestion <e>", "<cs> the department will be publishing within the next two weeks or so a document inviting views on the scope and nature of the regulations governing authorised unit trust schemes which would be made under this clause <e> <s> it will need to take into account the provisions of the ucits directive and the consultative document will also seek views on the various options available under the directive <e> <s> a number of regulations will be covered in practice but on that to which the noble lord refers specifically the answer is no <e>", "<cs> there has been no indication given to us until the noble lord mentioned it that this area should be looked at <e> <s> i can only repeat that it still is not our intention so to do <e>", "<cs> in answering specifically the noble lord lord monson i recognise what he says <e> <s> matters of this kind will be subject to the conduct of rules as of course will every other organisation <e>", "<cs> i understand that that would be so <e>", "<cs> if the committee accepted this amendment it would limit unnecessarily the activities that the manager of an authorised trust scheme could carry on <e> <s> clause gives effect to a provision of the ucits directive which places limits on the activities that a manager of a unit trust may undertake <e> <s> the aim of that provision is to try to ensure that all the activities of the manager are regulated in some way <e> <s> that is a common provision in such directives certainly in the absence of a wider harmonised regulatory framework at community level <e>", "<cs> i suggest to the noble lord that such a situation will be regulated by the conduct of business rules <e> <s> that is where we rest on that aspect <e> <s> there will be no more concrete a rule <e> <s> we discussed that matter when the noble lord lord obrien participated in our debate when the noble lord opposite spoke earlier to clause <e> <s> we felt then and we still feel that the conduct of business rules will provide a sufficiently robust barrier to ensure that the various interests are not in conflict <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment would be directly contrary to our obligations under the ucits directive which this clause seeks to implement <e> <s> under that directive a ucits authorised in any member state in accordance with the directive is free to market its units in any of the other member states <e> <s> we are not allowed to make a second judgment as to the protection which the schemes offers to investors <e> <s> the only ground for refusing to allow a ucits which wishes to market in the united kingdom to do so is that the proposed method of marketing appears to contravene united kingdom marketing laws <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> the amendments draw attention fairly sharply to a change of some significance which the bill makes <e> <s> although the noble lord asks whether there can be a health warning i think that because of this significant change i should reply at some length so that there is no misunderstanding <e>", "<cs> the purpose is to make clear first in what circumstances the secretary of state may publish a report made by an inspector who has investigated the affairs of a collective investment scheme or its manager operator or the trustee <e> <s> the effect is that the <e>", "<cs> i have to confess that i am not able to give the noble lord an answer <e> <s> i had noted that the noble lord had already spoken to this and dealt with it on an earlier amendment <e> <s> i had assumed that this amendment was not going to be moved <e> <s> i just wonder how i can deal with it other than to say that i had better give due consideration to what the noble lord has said in this matter <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord lord morton for my confusion a few moments ago <e> <s> may i say formally that we shall give consideration to what he said about amendment no <e> <s> and take amendments nos <e> <s> and and it i may i shall write to him in full on how we feel about them <e>", "<cs> i know that i spoke to this with amendment no <e> <s> in relation to clause when we were dealing with much the same point <e> <s> i can offer the noble lord opposite nothing more than i offered then and that was of course to stick to the words which we felt put the position rather more clearly <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord diamond for putting his question so simply <e> <s> may i preface my answer by reminding the committee that the provisions we are discussing now are concerned with very carefully defined circumstances <e> <s> this is not a general reporting duty <e> <s> the business will be aware of what the auditor should report and only the business which is behaving improperly need worry <e> <s> against that background i have to tell the noble lord and the committee that we had very very extensive discussions over a number of months with all the bodies concerned and those extensive consultations going over many many months did include matters dealing with disclosure of information <e> <s> my understanding is that generally the profession appreciates that there is a responsibility upon them <e> <s> i understand that generally they accept that responsibility naturally they wish to make sure that it is not a general reporting duty <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord for his explanation of this rather long list of amendments <e> <s> i wonder whether i may start by saying and i may actually repeat it that we are not talking here about a quango <e> <s> we have made it quite clear that this is to be a private sector body <e> <s> if we were to accept any of the amendments the noble and learned lord has proposed it would remove an important element of the flexibility in the provisions for transferring functions to a designated agency or whatever particular name or set of initials we use for it at this time <e> <s> if the amendments were accepted they would make it quite impossible for the secretary of state to give to the agency some functions relating to a class of persons while retaining for himself others relating to those persons <e>", "<cs> that may well be so but i was merely suggesting that the takeover panel today derives its authority from the commitment of its practitioners those who set it up largely and who continue to operate it <e>", "<cs> i am quite happy to do that <e> <s> i used the quotation to illustrate the curiosity of the argument that is before us now that this regulatory authority should have a governmental or a quango element as the noble and learned lord suggested it should be <e>", "<cs> both noble lords have said exactly the same thing twice over <e> <s> when the noble and learned lord lord silkin was speaking to us earlier he said that he saw this as a quango <e> <s> i wrote down no it is not a quango it is a private sector body <e> <s> that is how we see the operation quite distinct from the way the noble and learned lord apparently sees it <e>", "<cs> for example am change in clause which defines investments will have to be approved by the secretary of state and will have to be put before parliament <e> <s> other matters that we have been discussing would have to come before parliament by way of both affirmative and negative resolutions <e> <s> the appointments to the body are made by the secretary of state and by the governor of the bank of england which will give one arm of authority <e> <s> there will be a requirement to provide an annual report and that will have to be laid before parliament and could of course be debated in the usual way <e> <s> there will be power for the secretary of state to remove all functions or blocks of functions under clause which we shall be reaching shortly <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to those noble lords who have agreed to and spoken to amendments and <e> <s> however i regret to say that i am going to ask the committee to resist these amendments however attractive they may seem <e> <s> indeed we have had this matter before us on another occasion although in perhaps a different sense <e>", "<cs> may i respond to the noble lord <e> <s> lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> he makes his points succinctly and i should like to recognise here in the committee that his voice is always worth listening to <e> <s> i do not want to get involved in a discussion of the status of an employed person in the year or any other year for that matter except that it has changed and all for the good and i am happy about that as he is <e> <s> i am glad that he finds my argument consistent because the argument has to be consistent <e>", "<cs> may i again thank the three noble lords for putting their views so succinctly <e> <s> i start by agreeing that the provision of adequate arrangements for handling complaints about the conduct of investment business is a vital safeguard for investors and especially for small investors in pursuing claims against investment businesses <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord grimond for giving me a further opportunity <e> <s> i hope to be persuasive <e> <s> because i had been extolling as it were the virtues of an ombudsman system he asked me why i would not put it in the bill <e> <s> the reason is quite simply this <e> <s> while i think that the system is very good it may not be appropriate in all cases and it would be quite wrong to impose upon an sro or any other regulatory organisation a system an ombudsman which does not totally meet their requirements <e> <s> i accept from the noble lord that an ombudsman is external from the organisation but so also can be an arbitrator <e> <s> equally we find in the bill that an agency can devolve its responsibilities for monitoring the effectiveness of its rules to another body if that body is suitable willing and able and equally they may find it better to devolve the responsibility of complaints settlement to another body <e>", "<cs> it is not for me to read the rule book <e> <s> i am not quite sure whether in the absence of the leader of the house or the deputy leader i am the person to rule on the committees procedure <e> <s> seeing the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos i wonder whether with his great experience he can help me but i should have thought that as the lord chairman of committees had called the amendment and it was not moved and we had already moved on to the next amendment the committee would be right if it denied the noble lord lord hacking what he is asking for <e> <s> but it is very much as i think the noble lord will agree for the committee <e> <s> that is how i would read the rule book <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving us the benefit of his observations <e> <s> i understand that it is in fact the law society which inspired the thought which has been transmitted to the committee this evening <e> <s> it put great faith in the effect achieved by the inclusion of the phrase due precedence in the wording <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord will allow me to answer <e> <s> if i heard him correctly he asked whether the matters contained in this chapter have already been referred to the committee of inquiry <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord be good enough to repeat the question for me <e>", "<cs> the answer is no <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord williams in moving his amendment and speaking to amendment no <e> <s> began by saying that he really wanted to get an update on the position since when my noble friend lord marshall of leeds has intervened to give his views as to why the amendment of the noble lord lord williams should be opposed because this is an important matter i propose to deal with both amendment no <e> <s> a and the new clause amendment no <e> <s> we have before us two proposed solutions to a common problem because that is what it is <e> <s> before i go into the differences between those approaches i think i should for a moment stress the extent of the common grounds between us <e>", "<cs> with the committees approval i should like to respond <e> <s> i think that the crucial thing to regulate here is the solvency of the insurance company concerned and of course that is undertaken by my department under the insurance companies act <e> <s> thus some aspects of the regulation of these two products must necessarily be different <e>", "<cs> because of the complex-ity because it does overlap into the area of authorisation and sros i should prefer to give a considered reply to the noble lord <e> <s> perhaps i may write to him on that point <e>", "<cs> i only wish that i could respond as briefly as the noble lord lord williams spoke in moving his amendment and the noble lord lord graham in speaking to it <e> <s> i fear that i cannot because before i get to the detail of the amendment i should say something in general about friendly societies and their position in this bill <e> <s> that i hope will set in place the background against which at the end i shall ask the noble lord lord williams to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> i start by thanking the noble lord lord williams for the very clear way in which he described first his basic thinking behind this amendment and secondly some of the reasons that have brought him to this particular position <e> <s> it might be helpful to the committee if i started by describing the background as the government see it to this position <e>", "<cs> i certainly recall the noble lord lord morton of shuna arguing on second reading that the scope of the schedule should be extended to cover situations where shares are acquired by private agreement rather than under the terms of a takeover offer <e> <s> we very carefully considered the point made by the noble lord which had also been put to us by no less a body than the law society of scotland <e> <s> however i fear it is not one which the government can accept <e> <s> section of schedule ties the application of the provisions to takeover offers <e> <s> in so doing it follows section of the companies act and all its predecessors <e>", "<cs> i am just a little disappointed that the noble lord should suggest that i am guilty of an inaccuracy <e> <s> my advice is well founded and i believe it to be true because section of the companies act refers to a scheme or a contract and not just to offers <e> <s> it is certainly true that section goes on to refer to offers and the scope of the bill as i have sought to describe is precisely the same <e>", "<cs> i am so grateful to the noble and learned lord lord silkin for the way in which he has described the amendment <e> <s> that has been very helpful to me since the amendment was put down only yesterday <e> <s> considering that we did not finish our business until half-past twelve this morning i have had very little time to give due consideration to the matter <e> <s> i understand the noble lords concern but his amendment appears to presuppose a procedure somewhat akin to that followed under the companies act where the inspectors job is to unravel and explain for publication what is often a very complicated story <e>", "<cs> i rather suspect that the noble and learned lord lord silkin may wish to respond a little further but i wonder whether at this moment he will allow me to answer a couple of the points which he raised <e> <s> if a person declines to co-operate with an inspector there is an element of protection for the person who has a reasonable excuse <e>", "<cs> the nearest precedent that i can think of is section of the protection of trading interests act <e> <s> it is not quite the same but that is as near as i can get to it <e> <s> so there is in some respects an element of novelty <e> <s> to use the noble and learned lords words yes it is to an extent novel as distinct from being a novelty <e> <s> the noble and learned lord asked about disclosure to another person in a different country <e> <s> yes it is intended to cover this if the person overseas disclosing this information is a united kingdom citizen as indeed is the case in much the same way in the protection of trading interests act <e>", "<cs> i am grateful the noble lord <e> <s> i may very well take advantage of his invitation <e> <s> on the point of extra-territoriality perhaps i may tell the noble and learned lord that the clause is no more extra-territorial in its scope than the protection of trading interests act <e> <s> if i expand a little on that by way of a letter that will probably put the doubts of the noble and learned lord at rest <e>", "<cs> i think that i could have provided the answer <e> <s> i do not know whether i can settle the noble lords qualms in one go but i shall most certainly try to do so <e> <s> indeed i wonder why the noble lord raises this particular question because as i understand it when this matter was being considered on report in the other place it received support from all parties <e> <s> the official opposition spokesman said in broad terms as the government know we the opposition welcome the reciprocity provisions <e> <s> i refer the committee to <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord because that saves me and indeed the committee a great deal of time <e> <s> when financial market access is imperfectly reciprocated in a country abroad this clause would enable the secretary of state or the treasury to serve a notice on a person connected with that country <e> <s> succeeding clauses and i think that the noble lord wants to discuss some of them in a moment or two state the effect of different types of notice disqualification notices restriction notices and partial restriction notices <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> i can understand his doubts <e> <s> i do not know whether i shall be able to allay them but he invited me to comment on the matter and i accept his invitation <e> <s> we would like it known that as with investment business there is in some countries an imbalance of access against uk banking institutions <e> <s> clause is primarily intended to signal to the authorities in those countries our deep concern that this imbalance exists and our determination that it should not continue indefinitely <e> <s> to that end it provides reserve powers which again we hope it will not prove necessary to use <e> <s> but the powers will exist and by this means we hope further to encourage them to open their markets and to promote free and equitable trade in banking services <e> <s> i should say to the committee that we believe that our intentions in this matter have not gone unnoticed <e>", "<cs> no i am going to refuse that invitation <e> <s> i do not think it would be helpful to the secretary of state if i were to pose a hypothetical situation and give it a hypothetical answer <e> <s> i believe that the secretary of state would have to judge each case upon its merits from whatever sector it comes <e>", "<cs> i found this three-cornered lawyers discussion absolutely fascinating <e> <s> i trust that the committee will forgive me if i do not follow each and every noble lord down his own particular path <e> <s> i should like to put quite simply the governments view about this series of amendments <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord lord silkin for addressing his remarks to amendments nos <e> <s> a and a together <e> <s> these matters are important and the whole purpose of recognised self-regulating organisations is to provide investors with the protection that they deserve <e> <s> obviously against that background we had to think very hard before concluding that such organisations should be immune from actions for damages brought at the suit of investors <e> <s> nevertheless we concluded on balance that such immunity should be provided <e> <s> i have to say that i listened very carefully to what the noble and learned lord lord silkin said as i listened very carefully to what my noble friend lord colville of culross said and i am not convinced that the noble and learned lord opposite has said anything that should cause me to change my mind <e>", "<cs> with noble lords from all sides of the chamber speaking in favour of the amendment of the noble lord lord hacking i may find it rather difficult but i want to put to the committee as a whole one or two points <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just finish my argument <e> <s> the fact that a recognised professional body will not have immunity will no doubt affect the kind of business in which it decides to engage <e> <s> i have sought to suggest that most of the business is incidental <e> <s> if a member of an organisation wishes to engage in a different area of business as a main activity or as a principle activity it will be up to that company to seek the immunity that is open to it <e>", "<cs> i should like to answer the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> however before so doing perhaps i may say to the noble baroness lady seear that she might find my suggestion phrased as it was improper but in fact this amendment seeks to do precisely that which i have suggested though by a different route <e> <s> i pick up only one point made by the noble lord lord diamond towards the end of his remarks <e> <s> it is only right that the same protection should be afforded for the same task but the tasks are totally and absolutely different <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord ezra for so carefully explaining the purpose of his amendment <e> <s> i am afraid that i shall have to resist it <e> <s> it is not difficult to set out why although perhaps not as consistently as one would wish <e>", "<cs> i move that the clause does not stand part of the bill because i wish to introduce a new clause which is the subject of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it may be for the convenience of the committee if i speak to it now <e>", "<cs> one always has a feeling on tuesday evening about twenty-two or twenty-three minutes past seven that noble lords minds are perhaps thinking of looking after the inner man after several hours of deliberation <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord hacking explained this very well <e> <s> however i fear we are not satisfied that as it stands subsection achieves the desired effect <e> <s> we think that it contains a potential loophole which could allow companies to provide financial assistance for purposes other than the acquisition of beneficial ownership of shares in the company <e> <s> we intend to close that loophole because we believe that this is an important provision <e> <s> it is sufficiently important that we should make efforts to get it right <e> <s> we intend to close that loophole but it has not been possible to produce a suitable amendment for consideration by the committee <e> <s> we shall wish to bring forward something ourselves on report <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams for telling us that he was in fact probing <e> <s> i read his amendment rather differently so i shall have to abandon the notes that i have in front of me <e> <s> in the light of the reminder to the committee of my noble friend lord colville that we have another extremely important bill passing through parliament which abandons these words the committee may find it agreeable if i say that i should like to look at this <e>", "<cs> would that my noble and learned friend the lord advocate were here <e> <s> however he advises me and the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> will accept that i repeat the advice which has been given to me and offer no further answer that as a matter of scottish constitutional law all prosecutions in scotland are initiated by or with the consent of the lord advocate <e>", "<cs> i rather like the last remark of the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> perhaps he would like to do that and then i can consult with my noble and learned friend the lord advocate <e> <s> that might produce a far more satisfactory reply than my guessing at it <e>", "<cs> i hope that i shall be able to help the noble lord because i was a little surprised when i saw that he and his noble friend had given notice that they wished to oppose the question that clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> it is a technical clause in this the noble lord is absolutely right <e> <s> it contains the general provisions to enable proceedings in respect of offences to be brought against individual directors officers or partners as well as against their respective organisations <e> <s> i think the noble lord will accept that as being correct <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether i can help the noble lord <e> <s> the onus of proof of the offence is on the prosecution <e> <s> the partner or whoever it is has to prove that he should have known <e> <s> he will have to prove that and i understand that such is a common form of provision <e> <s> however i am not sure that i am right <e> <s> i am not of the legal profession <e> <s> i would prefer to take further advice <e> <s> it would be sensible if i were to write to the noble lord with the interpretation that we place on that provision <e> <s> if he wishes to pursue the matter further in your lordships house then he will have the opportunity to do so <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his explanation of the purposes of his amendment <e> <s> as he explained it and as i understand his amendment it seeks to extend the provisions of subsection so that rules and regulations made by an sro may make different provisions for different cases <e> <s> however schedule paragraph requires an sro covering investment businesses of different kinds to have appropriate rules and practices <e> <s> under the bill sro rules will have to be compared with rules made by the secretary of state or by the designated agency <e>", "<cs> let me make it clear what i do mean <e> <s> sros will be making rules under their own constitutions <e> <s> they must have rules as a condition for recognition <e> <s> the difference is that they will not be making rules under the bill but they will certainly have to make rules under their own constitutions <e> <s> so long as those rules are at least equivalent to the rules which the sib or the secretary of state or the designated agency make then they can do anything they like <e> <s> they can therefore provide for the various differences that the noble viscount seeks an assurance will be covered <e>", "<cs> to respond quickly to my noble friend lord marshall of leeds i am sorry if i did not explain the matter sufficiently clearly <e> <s> the implementation of the directives is a matter for the gibraltar authorities <e> <s> as with anywhere in the community there is a community obligation to ensure that the insurance supervision regime is carried out effectively <e> <s> the gibraltar authorities are of <e>", "<cs> i should perhaps make the position even more clear <e> <s> the isle of man and the channel islands unlike gibraltar are not covered by the treaty of rome for these purposes <e> <s> accordingly they have to be treated like any other non-community territory <e> <s> this perhaps makes the position a little more clear <e>", "<cs> it is not for me to answer questions addressed to the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> perhaps he would like to answer now <e>", "<cs> in an attempt to give my noble friend the reassurance for which he is looking i wonder whether i say this in the nicest possible way he will carefully study in <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> i am grateful to him for a number of factors notably that we came to this committee stage at the end of a long and difficult summer and without the co-operation of the opposition and without a certain element of good humour within the committee and outside we should not at minutes to ten on the last day have got through as much work as was put before us <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding the first-class tariff i am advised that if one takes a real price index of in january when the tariff was p in october this year if the proposed charge of p is taken forward the real price index will then be <e>",

believe that that is an excessive profit to be made <e>", "<cs> my lords as i sought to explain in my earlier remarks and as i have sought to explain on a number of occasions these matters are for the management of the post office <e> <s> it is an operational matter <e> <s> the post office receive advice from pounc and from other quarters <e> <s> it is for the management to accept or reject that

goes to the treasury <e> <s> the post office has a negative external financing limit and therefore the money goes to invest elsewhere in the public sector with benefit to the public sector borrowing

profits to assets <e> <s> i think that the noble lord could find those figures in the annual report which was published a short while ago <e> <s> so far as privatisation is concerned i think that i have answered that question on more than one occasion over very recent weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure my noble friend accepts that the figure which i gave was a general and not a particular figure <e> <s> i recognise as does the post office that the standard of delivery service falls short of the target and in certain areas it may fall very short of the target <e> <s> the post office chairman is aware of this and since the agreements on efficiency and manning that were concluded a few weeks ago one anticipates an improvement nearer to the target set across the country <e>", "<cs> my lords that is perfectly true <e> <s> the post office does not keep all its profit <e> <s> in - the governments target of million surplus was to go in the direction which i indicated that is to be invested elsewhere in the public sector with a benefit to the psbr <e> <s> that would come out of the per cent <e> <s> profit on turnover to which i referred earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords the time is calculated and my noble friend is quite right from the date stamp in the sorting office <e> <s> my noble friend has addressed himself to this question on more than one occasion but one has to have some benchmark and that is the benchmark against which we make the measurement <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are satisfied that so far as the caa is concerned the present arrangements are adequate for protecting people flying overseas on package holidays <e> <s> the answer to the noble lords second supplementary question is from time to time <e> <s> thirdly perhaps i may advise your lordships that the director of fair trading is with abta and the caa examining the provisions in relation to holidaymakers <e>", "<cs> my lords the civil aviation authority is looking into current practices and although there are some legal problems it is taking steps to discourage particularly the practice of subcontracting under an atol licence <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already suggested the caa is looking into its practices including the practice of monitoring <e> <s> if the abta sign is fraudulently displayed there may well be an offence under the trade descriptions act and it would of course fall to the relevant trading standards officers to investigate that and take whatever action is necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords the abta arrangement with the two safeguards that i have mentioned is sufficient to provide cover for most package holidaymakers <e> <s> if however a travel agent sets up in business and sells non-abta tours there is nothing illegal in that <e> <s> the whole object of the abta system backed as it is by the caas atol system is to provide protection for those who choose to buy their holidays through those agencies <e> <s> however equally it is for the customer to decide whether he wants to buy a holiday from another source <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that the interesting exchange that we have had this afternoon on this whole business will come to the attention of all the relevant authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords as soon as all the relevant parts of the insolvency act come into force of course they will be rigorously applied <e> <s> the noble lord will remember that the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> he referred to the sum of per euro-cow as against the rather less than one penny spent on consumers <e> <s> i was glad that he underlined that <e> <s> we agree with him <e> <s> we agree that the common agricultural policy does not adequately take account of the consumer <e> <s> the government have recently announced that the national consumer council is to undertake a full study of the impact of the common agricultural policy on consumers <e> <s> i hope that that will encourage him as well as others of your lordships

them by british aerospace with regard to aid of whatever kind <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a fact that so far the a is living up to the expectations that the government had when we provided million of launch aid <e> <s> with regard to the other two aeroplanes neither airbus industrie nor british aerospace jointly or separately has yet approached their respective governments for support <e> <s> the project is still in the proposal stage <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt that the noble lord is right in suggesting that collaborative efforts with our european partners on projects of the scale which the aircraft industry envisages are a desirable feature which should be encouraged <e>", "<cs> my lords the financial consequences for british aerospace of its participation in the airbus programme and its partnership are reflected in the companys published accounts <e> <s> that is true of british aerospaces partners in other countries <e> <s> certainly the government would hope that

the million of launch aid which we afforded to british aerospace for its share in the a the repayments are million in fixed instalments between and and the balance is from levies on sales of the

amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords in responding to this short debate i am almost inclined to rest entirely upon the contribution of the noble and learned lord lord denning but perhaps i should give something of a broader answer because i do not agree that the amendment leaves open the problem of the one-off transaction <e> <s> it is certainly true that at an earlier stage we relied on the argument that the word engages had some implication of continuity but it was clear from the debate at that stage that the argument was open to some doubt <e> <s> it is in order to remove that doubt

the noble lord lord morton <e> <s> i turned over two pages of my brief for which i apologise <e> <s> it just goes to show exactly what his noble friend lord williams was saying earlier this afternoon

piece of co-operation <e>", "<cs> my lords i of course agree with the noble and learned lord lord denning because he supports me but perhaps i should answer the specific point made by the noble lord

your lordships will recall that we have had many debates during the passage of the bill on the provisions of schedule concerning the composition of the governing boards of the regulatory organisations

response <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall begin by dealing with the government amendment which i believe makes it quite clear that it is open to an rsro to establish possibly in conjunction with other organisations an independent mechanism for example an ombudsman scheme for the investigation of complaints against the organisation or its members <e> <s> however that mechanism would not be able to exercise the enforcement or the disciplinary functions of the regulatory organisation because that would remain the organisations responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house before

man and well he knows it <e> <s> but it seems to me that what he has just said suggests that there should be an appeal procedure after the sro has considered the matter internally or as the governments amendment provides externally <e> <s> the governments amendment provides for an internal or external procedure or a joint procedure with other sros <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord strathalmond will forgive me but we are at the report stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord williams for his introduction to this short series of related amendments <e> <s> i recognise immediately the stance that he and his colleagues on the opposition side took when this matter first came to our attention at the committee stage <e> <s> i do not quarrel one little bit with the way in which the noble lord seeks this evening to debate the matter <e> <s> however i wonder whether i may take up the noble lord on one point <e> <s> he said in his closing remarks that this really was a dti a secretary of states bill <e> <s> it is not a secretary of states bill it is a government bill <e> <s> it is a government bill with all that that implies

carefully what i have said and will ensure that his understanding is as i have sought to explain it <e> <s> i believe that it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened fascinated to both noble lords <e> <s> there are only two things i want to say <e> <s> if we have the amounts wrong i reiterate that they can be changed both for schedule and schedule <e> <s> the other point i would make and i think the noble lord lord williams invited me to make it without commitment is that i shall think further on what he said and will take into account what the noble lord lord tryon said particularly in the second of his remarks <e> <s> meanwhile i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can add very much to what i have already said <e> <s> i shall be happy to see whether i can be advised but i do not think that the advice is readily forthcoming <e> <s> i think i shall have to communicate with the noble lord to see whether we cannot reach a mutual understanding <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to spend much time going over the ground of conflicts of interest which we covered in committee <e> <s> whether <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend will allow me to intervene because i think that i can be fairly helpful to the house <e> <s> i was particularly interested in what the noble viscount lord chandos had to say <e> <s> he put his amendment forward as an alternative to government amendment no <e> <s> and i think it would be right for me to spend a few moments on the background to the government amendment and on how it is different from the noble viscounts amendment so that all noble lords can compare them without necessarily taking one side or the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey for explaining his amendment <e> <s> i believe that there are two ways of approaching it one is to argue about the correct period for cancellation rights should we allow or days in the case of this or that investment <e> <s> that is not the basis on which i wish to proceed <e> <s> the opportunity for such a discussion will come if and when the securities and investments board applies to become a designated agency and parliament is called upon to approve the designation order <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can add anything further to what i said on tuesday night concerning this group of amendments <e> <s> i am quite happy to look at what i think the noble lord lord graham is driving at but i must tell him that at this time i can offer him very little hope that we shall be inclined to change the view which we currently hold on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am sorry to have to come back to the box and say that i think i have said all i can say about this because that is the truth of the matter <e> <s> let me just repeat what i said because the noble lord lord mcintosh has not added anything to the fairly short remarks he made last tuesday <e> <s> we would not wish to impose such an obligation on any of the bodies concerned because our new clause provides that the bodies shall make the best provision that can reasonably be made <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall rise again to answer the specific question <e> <s> the sros will produce their compensation plan <e> <s> that will go to the sib and will have to be broadly within the sibs general rules but then it is for the secretary of state when deciding whether to delegate the powers to the designated agency which we are calling the sib to assure himself that bearing in mind all the factors such a compensation scheme within an sro is the best that can reasonably be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in this further debate on the compensation clauses which we discussed at fairly great length last tuesday night <e> <s> i should say that at this moment in time i remain very much of the view that i expressed to your lordships on that occasion <e> <s> however it would be quite wrong if i were to rest there without making some response to the various points that have been raised <e> <s> in general terms we remain convinced that it is right that the rules should be able to allow subject to certain safeguards the establishment of a central compensation scheme because this will enable the compensation arrangements to be effective and we believe well funded <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of your lordships house i am reluctant to go further <e> <s> i do not believe it is for the government as such to contemplate these things <e> <s> i have expressed views which i think will be reflected in the compensation schemes that are arrived at <e> <s> it is for the various bodies making up the sros they are representative to pursue that detail <e> <s> i have suggested that such compensation rules will have to have regard to all the various factors particularly the one my noble friend mentioned which are practicable to achieve the result for which we are all looking that is to get the best practicable provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords there is nothing between any of us on the policy of this matter <e> <s> since it appears that the alternative wording which the noble lord lord hacking has suggested may clarify matters for practitioners i should express my gratitude to him and advise the house that the government are prepared to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords quite frankly we do not want to support this amendment because we believe that it would remove a useful provision <e> <s> on the one hand the provision makes clear the intention that interest earned on a clients money should be clients money for the purpose of the rules <e> <s> on the other hand it specifically enables the rules made under subsection of the clause to permit authorised persons to retain small amounts of interest where it would be administratively inconvenient perhaps it might be better to say administratively impracticable to arrange for their separate payment <e> <s> such provisions are already a feature of other rules on client money accounts <e> <s> we believe that it may well be more in the interests of investors in such circumstances to benefit from the lower administrative costs by paying lower charges which would not be possible were the amendment to be carried <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that the amendment should have been tabled at this stage to a provision which has been unaltered since the bill was first introduced some months ago and which so far as i am aware has not attracted any adverse comment <e> <s> however perhaps that on its own is insufficient to dismiss the point that the noble lord seeks to make about the cooling-off debate <e> <s> i should point out that the principle that the court should have discretion to enforce contracts and exercise its judgment on whether an agreement should be enforceable in certain circumstances is one which has been generally and widely welcomed <e> <s> unenforceability without such discretion might be a blunt instrument <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can say to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran is that from th july until th september my officials had consultations with such a wide variety of people across the entire financial services sector that i cannot possibly remember exactly the extent of the representations made <e> <s> so far as the question of the noble and learned lord lord silkin is concerned i am sorry i cannot tell him <e> <s> i do not know enough about that particular area of the market <e>", "<cs> my lords this government minister will be able to tell noble lords opposite later <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house yes that is what i meant by my previous remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams for his explanation of the amendment which he has put down <e> <s> he mentioned this point during our committee stage <e> <s> at that time he did not suggest that these investment trusts should be included <e> <s> i think the noble lord will recall that when we published the white paper in january we stated quite clearly that the government proposed to retain this position and until we touched upon it in committee that decision has provoked no controversy <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall try to answer in detail <e> <s> an investment trust is not a company which ensures that participants are able to sell their shares on an investment exchange at a price related to the value of the property to which the shares relate <e> <s> the noble lord himself indicated at an earlier stage in our proceedings that a person does not ensure that a thing is done merely by doing something which makes it easier to do that thing <e> <s> if a person ensures that a thing is done only if he makes it certain that it will happen clause <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may put this point to the noble lord <e> <s> investment trusts may well be listed but that does not imply that the company ensures that they can be bought or sold at a price related to the value of the underlying assets <e> <s> surely the point is this the discount at which they are traded reflects market conditions and they may well vary <e> <s> it may not be within the control of the company <e> <s> this is where there is a fundamental difference of thinking between the noble lord and myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can give the noble lord the assurance that he is looking for because what he proposes to add is already in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the amendment is more in the nature of a probing amendment because it is based on something of a misunderstanding <e> <s> at the time to which the noble lord referred we were talking about options under an employee share scheme <e> <s> they are not a part of the property to which the arrangements relate <e> <s> they will normally of course be shares in the company <e> <s> they are then a part of the arrangements which enable the employee to acquire shares on more favourable terms than he could in the market place <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the noble lord has been talking about employee share schemes <e> <s> such schemes involve options <e> <s> the amendment appears to be prompted by concern that options are not specifically mentioned <e> <s> we do not think that there is any need for clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord lord williams has not helped me very much <e> <s> during the committee proceedings he expressed the view that clause <e>", "<cs> my lords may i with the leave of the house come back <e> <s> i accept what the noble lord says about a meaningful argument <e> <s> but surely it can scarcely be said of the shares of a fixed capital company that that company ensures that the shares can be bought and sold at a price related to underlying asset value <e> <s> surely the price will reflect what people are prepared to pay <e> <s> that is surely the position with any share of any kind <e> <s> the relationship between asset value and redemption price if that is what concerns the noble lord is surely a matter that could be set in the rules <e> <s> we are now talking not about moving across from ownership to ownership we are talking about a redemption against an asset valuation <e> <s> if there has to be a formula it would surely be far better that the formula was arrived at through the rules <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can best answer the question of the noble lord by telling him that in order to be promoted in accordance with the regulations made under this subsection units in the scheme would have to be dealt in on a recognised investment exchange or offered on terms that any agreement for their acquisition was conditional on their admission to dealings <e> <s> this is necessary to ensure that unit-holders can sell their units at any time <e> <s> it is a substitute for the redemption requirements for authorised unit trusts <e> <s> the scheme would also have to comply with the other requirements laid down in the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am sorry i rather misunderstood the noble lord opposite <e> <s> stallion share schemes if promoted as investments would not be promotable to the general public but regulations could be made permitting a more restricted promotion <e> <s> i think that is the point that the noble lord was seeking <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams for so easily putting the purport of his amendment <e> <s> i am reminded that the noble lord withdrew an amendment to delete what is now clause <e>", "<cs> my lords let me assure the noble lord lord williams that i always have to think carefully when i come to any point that he <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for reminding me of that it had escaped my mind <e> <s> therefore his consideration of matters of this kind is even more valuable <e> <s> nevertheless i think he misjudges our feeling on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may address myself to the accusation that the noble lord lord shepherd made about my being awkward perhaps i may say that he knows me better than to suggest that i am being awkward <e> <s> if subsection were removed we would have a position where the secretary of state may in fact be obliged <e>", "<cs> to impose limits <e> <s> we seek as a principle to ensure that he shall not impose any limits on the remuneration of managers of any scheme as i have earlier described <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams for telling us that this amendment is in the nature of a probing amendment <e> <s> he then went on to say that he recognised that it may not be in its final form so he may want to come back to it later <e> <s> i think the best that i could do for your lordships would be to give the reasons why we invite the noble lord to withdraw his amendment and we shall see how we get on from there <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord hacking for so ably explaining the purport of the amendments which were down originally in the name of my noble friend lord limerick <e> <s> i have some reluctance given the origins of this amendment in advising the house to reject it <e> <s> i recognise as the noble lord lord hacking suggested that this matter is of some concern to the sib <e> <s> but from the purely practical point of view it is misconceived <e> <s> the proper target of disciplinary action is the person committing the contravention and not its subject <e> <s> where collective investments are concerned this means the operator or intermediaries rather than the scheme itself <e> <s> chapters v and vi already provide ample means of dealing with them in regard to all forms of investment business <e> <s> for example if the operator of a scheme authorised under clause acts in contravention of marketing rules the powers in chapter vi may be exercised in such a way as to prevent him from marketing direct to the public <e> <s> he could be required to market only through other authorised persons <e> <s> there is therefore no need to take the power proposed in order to meet the desired objective <e> <s> because of that it would also be inconsistent with our community obligations <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it would be right or proper of me to answer some of the points which the noble lord lord morton of shuna has raised <e> <s> let me confine myself to what is really the major point <e> <s> the noble lord will know that subsection is concerned with the case where the secretary of state decides first to halt the issue and/or the redemption of units or to order the winding up of an authorised unit trust scheme or perhaps to suspend the recognition of a scheme which is recognised under clauses or on the grounds that the exercise of the relevant power is in the interests of participants or potential participants in the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will withdraw his amendment <e> <s> if he will not i shall feel obliged to invite your lordships to reject it <e> <s> the powers contained in clause are designed for use where the continued marketing of a scheme might put investors at risk <e> <s> i anticipate that the secretary of state or indeed the designated agency would give advance notice of the exercise of these powers where that is possible without putting investors at risk <e> <s> i think it would be inconsistent with this general objective to require advance notice of the exercise of these powers in every case <e> <s> to do so could in some circumstances expose investors to even greater risk before the direction came into force <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord morton of shuna for describing the purport of his amendment <e> <s> he will of course recall that clause was a new government clause at committee stage and i recognise that perhaps all the opportunities to deploy arguments were not available to him at that time <e> <s> however let me invite him to withdraw the amendment by putting these points before your lordships <e> <s> the secretary of state or designated agency would only be able to authorise a unit trust scheme if he or it was satisfied that the manager and trustee fulfilled certain conditions <e> <s> there are other conditions <e> <s> there are other conditions contained in clause for example that they must be independent of each other but if the secretary of state or designated agency were subsequently to apply to a court for one or both to be replaced on the grounds set out in clause it is only sensible that the nominated replacement should pass the same test to satisfy the secretary of state or the designated agency that they meet those conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe for his exposition of the amendment <e> <s> we are concerned about the need for effective lay representation on the governing body of any designated agency <e> <s> the provisions in the schedule which oblige such a body to have non-practitioner members and to have arrangements which give them an opportunity to express their opinions indicate that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are in a difficulty <e> <s> we seem to have overtaken ourselves on this particular series of amendments <e> <s> i am advised that section of the building societies act already provides specifically for certain information obtained under the companies act or the companies northern ireland order to be disclosed to the building societies commission <e> <s> other information may be dealt with as provided for in schedule and in the governments amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> a and a would cut across the other provisions as a result of which i invite the noble lord to withdraw the amendments in favour of government amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams as i am to the noble lord lord hacking <e> <s> we indicated at an earlier stage our grave reservations about the approach underlying this amendment <e> <s> we also indicated that in our view the concerns of the potential rpbs could substantially be met if they were to make it a condition that a person seeking to be certified or who is certified by the body should agree not to sue the body for damages for actions taken in the exercise of its functions <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot possibly comment on press speculation about who was or who was not considered for membership of the securities and investments board <e> <s> clearly there were many possible candidates for appointments of this nature and clearly there must be wide consultation about possible names <e> <s> the assurance that i can give the noble lord is that all members of the governing body are men of the highest calibre <e>", "<cs> my lords there is nothing premature about my answer <e> <s> the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe asked me what were the criteria <e> <s> the criteria are those set down in the bill before your lordships house at the moment <e> <s> if there were no bill the criteria would still obtain <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will recall that my noble friend lord ferrers when asked this question some seven years ago said that the male embraces the female <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams of elvel for having given me notice of his intention to press this matter <e> <s> i shall look forward with anticipation to that debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that there are many men and women of the highest calibre who have political affiliations outside the conservative party <e>", "<cs> my lords this question concerns the european communities product liability directive which the government intend to implement through primary legislation as soon as parliamentary time is available <e> <s> the basic purpose of the directive is to give protection to consumers throughout the community against defective products which have been industrially produced <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the second question of my noble friend no we do not believe that the current situation is wrong <e> <s> with regard to his first point he will recall that i gave a written answer on th october <e> <s> clearly my noble friend recognises that the directive does not apply to injury or damage arising from nuclear accidents which are covered by international conventions ratified by other member states <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept both points that the noble lord has made <e> <s> as i have suggested we intend to bring primary legislation to parliament as soon as time is available <e> <s> it would be best if we were to pursue the detailed differences of opinion during the passage of that bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be glad to accede to the request of the noble lord the leader of the opposition <e> <s> i shall certainly convey his views to my right honourable friend <e> <s> perhaps i should remind your lordships that a consultative document was produced in november following the adoption of the ec directive on th july <e> <s> four <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a matter of opinion <e> <s> i agree that the processing industry probably has more technology instantly available to secure the quality which it will be demanding from the primary producer <e>", "<cs> my lords the department of trade and industry takes our exporting efforts most seriously <e> <s> we believe in an open trade non-protectionist policy across the world <e> <s> we seek to remove artificial barriers to international trade wherever they may be erected for whatever reason <e> <s> i assure my noble friend that we take matters of this kind very seriously indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of your lordships house i wish to respond to one or two of the points that have been newly made as distinct from made in the opening remarks <e> <s> the noble lord lord hacking contrary to his exact words that the city of london was regulated i am sure will accept that it has in fact been self-regulatory and in this regard there is a little difference <e> <s> if circumstances have changed as a result of what he foresees he believes that these reserve powers should be made available <e> <s> what he is saying is in fact exactly what the noble lord lord diamond has said that he wants the powers now because there are changes <e>", "<cs> my lords it is slightly invidious but let me refer to my noble friend lord boardman if he will forgive me as being a typical sometime member of the panel and i can say that there is no justification in suggesting that the panel does not have the interests of all sides and all parties at heart <e> <s> i believe that the past years of operation of the takeover panel have demonstrated quite conclusively that the interests of all parties to a takeover are forefront in the minds of members of the panel <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to be flippant with the noble baroness but we are all employees of one sort or another <e> <s> it is no good her throwing her eyes up to heaven and shaking her head <e> <s> we are all employees of somebody or other <e> <s> if the noble baroness wants to bring forward a different definition of employee than is my belief i shall be happy to hear it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord williams for his acceptance of this amendment and i am most glad that the noble viscount lord chandos should be in his place to express his pleasure at what we have done <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether your lordships with your customary generosity will allow me in replying to amendment no <e> <s> which the noble lord lord williams of elvel has moved and spoken to with amendments nos <e> <s> and to invite you to consider also amendment no <e> <s> which i greatly regret neither noble lords opposite nor noble lords on this side of the house got hold of at the right moment in time <e> <s> i can save your lordships time <e> <s> it is an amendment which was discussed before at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure all noble lords will be grateful to the noble lord on the woolsack <e> <s> then may i turn straight away to amendment no <e> <s> which is before us <e> <s> i have to say that i am totally opposed to moving a minimal position towards an ultimate end which is what the noble lord lord williams suggested he was trying to do <e> <s> he suggested that his amendment was a halfway house <e> <s> i am suggesting that it is halfway too far because as he has already said he would want to go the other way if he gets the opportunity <e> <s> the reason is simply this <e> <s> the amendment to clause would remove the residual element of discretion which the secretary of state would have to refuse to transfer a particular transferable function despite all the criteria for delegation in the bill being met <e> <s> my expectation is that almost all the functions which the designated agency is able to exercise would be transferred <e> <s> there may be a few however that it would he preferable for the secretary of state to retain <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams for the way he has explained the purport of his amendment <e> <s> of course i acknowledge that he gave us notice during the passage of the building societies bill that he was unhappy about these matters and would want to raise them again <e> <s> i acknowledge straightaway his concern that he is looking at the wider field of the social aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to make an attempt to give the noble lord lord williams the assurance he seeks <e> <s> there is no desire and no wish at all that any action of the government through either the building societies act or indeed through this bill should in any way at all destroy the building society movement <e> <s> i am quite sure the noble lord accepts that <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall try to tell the noble lord how i interpret the public <e> <s> what we are talking about here is independent non-practitioner or lay representation on the sib <e> <s> for example the present non-practitioner members of the board are mrs rachel waterhouse of the consumers association mr john clement of unigate mr john kerridge of fisons and the honourable garry runciman of walter runciman plc <e> <s> indeed there is also mr roy croft the chief executive of the sib <e> <s> those are board members they are non-practitioner members <e> <s> they are people representing various aspects of a very broad spectrum of the public <e>", "<cs> no i cannot my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e> <s> we predicted on second reading that no one could seriously question a need either for investor protection in the financial services field or for a modern regulatory system which would <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his first supplementary question <e> <s> certainly the present changes in the city reflect the response of many of the financial institutions including the stock exchange in order to keep ahead of competition in the rest of the world <e> <s> so far as the breakdowns are concerned my understanding is that apart from the two serious breakdowns in the topic system early last week the stock exchange has reported no general interruption in the screen service <e> <s> so far as settlements are concerned i am informed that a number of stock exchange bargains were incorrectly recorded for the purpose of settlement through the talisman system but efforts are being made to clear up this backlog <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for what the noble lord has said in his first supplementary question <e> <s> certainly there is a role for the smaller stockbroker and the provincial stockbroker and for the provincial exchanges <e> <s> each of the various parts of the financial sector make up the whole in a very important enterprise in london <e> <s> i am quite sure that the noble lord will acknowledge the earnings of the city with some million to the british balance of payments in which is a creditable performance <e>", "<cs> my lords i have heard and read in the press that this is so <e> <s> this is of course to be anticipated since one of the objectives of the change was to increase competition and therefore the opportunities for further business between all the parties involved industry as well as the smaller investor <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not too familiar with the rules regarding the claiming of the dole <e> <s> but provided that he lost his living in what i might call something that was not fraudulent i believe that he would be entitled to the benefits that are available to all people in similar circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the leader of the opposition for his supplementary questions <e> <s> i think it is true to say that there was a good deal of criticism in the very early days and some of that was perhaps justified <e> <s> the volume of business using the new market system certainly exceeded the exchanges expectations <e> <s> i think it would be premature to cast judgment now on the reported failures and i really think that all your lordships will join me in congratulating sir nicholas goodison and his team on the speed with which the initial problems were identified and dealt with <e> <s> i have seen reports that it may take two years to make alterations to the system <e> <s> my understanding is that that is an exaggeration of the facts <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks an interesting question which is significantly far from the original one on the order paper <e> <s> i shall be happy to answer him if he cares to put down another question on another day <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to tell the noble baroness that in fact she is not correct <e> <s> i think that she and her colleagues on the select committee will know that sectoral directives have taken variously from to years to bring to fruition <e> <s> certainly it is not clear which directives either that for the chartered society of physiotherapy or indeed the lawyers are at a sufficiently advanced stage to be capable of an early agreement <e> <s> the commission has suggested that faster progress is likely to be made if we pursue the objective of the general directive to which her majestys government agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his questions <e> <s> i do not think it will be possible by the end of this year in fact just short of two months for us to state categorically our conclusion as to the select committees report which we found of great value as indeed i intimated to your lordships in our debate on the th october <e> <s> so far as concerns the general position on the directive by the end of our presidency we shall have achieved progress in identifying and segregating a number of practical problems particularly those which associate with the answer that i gave to the noble baroness <e> <s> we shall have established that the route to recognition of various qualifications will be a common one we have achieved recognition that we are talking about professional activities and not professions and we shall have completed nine meetings at official level <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that sectoral directives are in fact quite a long way away <e> <s> we hope that we shall be able to adopt a general directive before is out <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said to your lordships there have been eight or nine meetings at official level <e> <s> it is those meetings which determine the differences in the texts which are natural in such matters <e> <s> one would anticipate a definitive text being available for ministers consideration during the course of next year <e>", "<cs> my lords i said at the outset that i was not going to involve myself in figures for the same reason that the noble lord lord bruce of donington did not do so <e> <s> i do not have the balance sheets <e> <s> i do not have personal knowledge of the situation in when the valuations were made <e> <s> it would be quite wrong with hindsight to make the kind of judgment my noble friend seeks from me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not a lawyer or in any way connected with the legal profession <e> <s> however what the court had to determine was whether or not the act and those matters that flowed from the act were in contravention of our obligations under the european convention on human rights and in particular article of protocol which we have read out <e> <s> that is what the court had to determine and they have given their judgment upon that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams and to the noble lord lord ezra for their reception of the statement i have just made <e> <s> as regards the first question of the noble lord lord williams concerning the scepticism of the city as reported in the newspapers on occasions such as these i prefer not to comment upon what newspapers report as being the view of certain bodies <e> <s> i frankly do not believe that the city is sceptical about the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i should like to echo most sincerely his complimentary remarks about the statisticians at the central statistical office <e> <s> they deal professionally with a multitude of information that comes to them from a variety of sources and they are quite outside the influence of ministers certainly of those in the department of trade <e> <s> this was evidenced in the figures produced by the central statistical office in august which were less than happy as i think my noble friend will agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> i recollect a number of speeches he has made in which he gave due credit to the financial services which as i have said make a significant contribution to our wellbeing <e> <s> again on behalf of the statisticians in the central office i am glad to accept his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord harris is quite unfair when he says that the department should have taken a good deal more care in the release of the figures yesterday <e> <s> your lordships will know that some years ago there was great argument about governments releasing figures on days which particularly suited their political convenience when for example there was a by-election <e> <s> it was agreed that the government would set down at the beginning of each year the dates upon which the quarterly figures would be released <e> <s> so there is no question of my department having as it were control of the date and time of release of the figures <e> <s> an undertaking had been given an undertaking to which my department kept <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to give explanations as to why the noble lord lord harris should present his argument in that way <e> <s> i do not want to be difficult with your lordships perhaps it is not for me to say but i feel i cannot help your lordships further in explaining and giving an answer to the specific question which was put down in another house <e> <s> i really wonder whether i can help your lordships further this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord opposite prefers to deal in facts and since he invites me to make comments and give figures on a series of estimates that are before your lordships i think i shall resist the temptation <e>", "<cs> my lords the quarterly figures normally released contain very much more information than is provided in the monthly figures <e> <s> i am quite sure that the noble lord will then be satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that i did not say that nor would i dare say that <e> <s> although i do not believe that that is a probability one can never rule out anything <e>", "<cs> my lords i was in fact thinking of specific regulations which are now in force and i should say that the repeal of the act and there is provision in the bill will not come about until substitute procedures are in place to ensure that the regulations to which i refer can be made if it is found to be necessary <e> <s> perhaps the noble baroness and the noble lord lord williams would like me to spell it out quite directly in which case i will write to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that is so <e> <s> local authorities have the responsibility of directing their energies to enforcement as to other of their responsibilities as they see fit <e> <s> this has always been so <e> <s> what effort they put into the enforcement of trading standards is their business <e> <s> it varies up and down the country and it would be quite wrong for me to suggest that any particular level of expenditure should be made out of the total rate support grant or other funding <e> <s> my right honourable friend will take that into account in fixing the grant <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> he will appreciate of course that minutes of standing committee proceedings are completely outside any area of influence that i might have and i resist the temptation to enter into the wider debate that he just momentarily invited me to enter <e> <s> i very much welcome the noble lords acceptance of the order as being helpful and beneficial to consumers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for his very warm welcome for the initiatives that have already been taken however i cannot agree entirely with the article in todays newspaper which the noble lord quoted <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that discussions are currently in progress and i mean currently in progress with the japanese authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords manufacturing output between september and october is up by a half per cent <e> <s> the forecast for on is an upturn of per cent <e> <s> while it is true that imports continue to exceed our own domestic consumption the outlook remains bright <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that there is any lack of credibility in the statistics provided by the cso <e> <s> i do not think that i can add anything to that which i said in response to the noble lord and to other noble lords in this house on th november <e>", "<cs> my lords again i do not think that i can add a great deal to what i said on th november <e> <s> it has been the practice of all governments to adjust and modify the figures as information comes to light <e> <s> that could be upwards as well as downwards <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his question <e> <s> the truth of the matter is that our exports are in a very healthy position <e> <s> over the last two or three years we have gained in world share on <e> <s> we continue to make an impressive performance in world markets <e> <s> the surpluses which have arisen in other areas have led to increased demand reflected in higher imports and that is indicative of the success of the governments fiscal policies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that the noble lord appreciates as i do that as the wealth of the country increases consumer demand increases <e> <s> our manufacturing industries have not yet been able to meet the increased demand <e> <s> there is therefore a demand which is satisfied by imports <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that this makes nonsense of the governments policies at all <e> <s> if the noble baroness would like to put down a question on the element of indebtedness of the nation i or one of my noble colleagues will be pleased to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be so and it may have some effect upon the governments policy <e> <s> nevertheless the situation reflects a growing confidence both of the lender and the consumer and a confidence in the buoyancy of the economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not comment on the forerunner to the noble lords question because he draws an assumption which i did not <e> <s> i gave an estimate and repeated the chancellors estimate of the outlook <e> <s> one must accept that the change in the trading pattern that has occurred over the last two years notably since the fall in oil prices takes some while to readjust <e> <s> i believe that our manufacturing industry is making that adjustment and that is reflected in the acceptance of our exports abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords i explained to your lordships house on th november exactly how these figures are arrived at the length of time it takes to collect figures on invisibles in particular and the way in which adjustments are made <e> <s> i see nothing wrong with the way in which the cso has arrived at the figures <e> <s> i believe that it is right and proper that as the information comes through the adjustments as it sees them are made public <e>", "<cs> my lords first i see nothing sad whatever in the figures <e> <s> manufacturing industry output is at a higher level than it was in <e> <s> investment is greater profitability is greater our <e>", "<cs> my lords i or one of my noble colleagues will be happy to answer questions on unemployment if the noble lord cares to put down a specific question <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lords question is that it was the director general of fair trading who recommended that all three bids should be put to the monopolies and mergers commission because they raised issues of public interest arising from the special nature of the sugar market and the change of ownership of british sugar <e> <s> the ferruzzi bid was referred on the grounds again of the special nature of the sugar market <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord lord walston the government are indeed aware of the concern he expresses as also are the mmc who will be taking that into the consideration they are currently giving to this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the subject matter of the review is somewhat different from the question on the order paper <e> <s> i should be delighted to answer the noble lord if he cares to put down a specific question <e>", "<cs> my lords it is reasonably simple <e> <s> while the price review system controls the profitability of that element of profit that is made out of sales to the national health service it means that should the costs rise by virtue of the increase in research and development which i have described then that would have to be taken into account <e> <s> therefore the rate at which the national health service would have to pay would have to go up <e> <s> however if the companies are able to retain more profit of their own invention by virtue of maintaining the profits from a further four years which is now the -year term set by the act then that amount of money can be turned back of their own volition into research and development <e> <s> that means that the cost to the nhs would be held or would be as i have described it not significantly increased <e> <s> i do not believe that the noble lords fears or indeed the fears of other noble lords with regard to the cost to the national health service are well founded <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to the noble lord lord wigoder for his extremely wise words and the advice that he gives not only to your lordships house but i hope to a very much wider audience <e> <s> i can add nothing further in response to his comments <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to the noble lord lord diamond and underlining what my noble friend lord renton has said i think that in fact i answered when i said in response to the noble lord lord williams that we would certainly be taking account of any matters that are relevant when the inspectors report is to hand <e> <s> that will be the time for us to give proper consideration to any matters of that kind <e>", "<cs> my lords again i have really answered although i cannot stop speculation whether in the press or anywhere else <e> <s> the government took immediate very strong powers as soon as evidence was brought before them and will not hesitate to take any action that is necessary in matters of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord orr-ewing raises two points <e> <s> first i think that he would recognise as would other noble lords that it is not for me to suggest to the board of the company what it should or should not do <e> <s> as to the second matter i give my noble friend the assurance that the government will not be rushed into any premature decision or premature consideration of the matters currently before them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord dean of beswick and to the noble baroness lady seear for their contributions to our quite short debate tonight <e> <s> i feel as does the noble baroness that training is important and it is sufficiently important for me to spend if your lordships will permit a few minutes taking up some of the points which have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords in approving the boards proposals the manpower services commission expressed concern at the level of the boards reserves <e> <s> indeed the government shared this concern <e> <s> the board has given assurances that it will take steps to bring its income and expenditure more closely into line in future <e>", "<cs> my lords we have prepared ourselves for these debates on the basis that we would proceed through the bill in the normal way as it is printed and accordingly we would not expect to come to amendments on schedule for some time <e> <s> even if schedule were to be grouped for example with clause parts of the bill connected with part i would still come up later for example the definition of supply in clause is important to part i as is clause which relates to liability for products <e>", "<cs> we have had a good debate on this important subject of which notice was given to us at second reading <e> <s> however i think that the fundamental point is to establish what might be called the onus of proof in this case <e> <s> i am not at all sure that the onus should be upon the government to justify the exclusion of primary agricultural products rather i think the onus should be upon those supporting the amendment to justify their inclusion <e> <s> i do not think that that case has been made before now either inside or outside this chamber <e> <s> i think that the way that the directive is framed and was agreed by the member states tends to support my view <e> <s> such products are excluded and member states may only add them by derogation <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for explaining his amendment <e> <s> i confess that it is not something that i had considered until i saw the amendment on the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> i wish the matter were as simple as the noble lord lord morton has suggested to the committee <e> <s> i should say a little about the purposes of the clause c <e> <s> the basic proposition of part i is that the producer shall be liable for damage caused by defects in his product <e> <s> it is therefore critical to define who is the producer of a product <e> <s> that is set out in clause <e>", "<cs> i accept the reading of the directive by the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> he is right <e> <s> i do not think that there is any necessity for me to take away this amendment and consider it because i believe the amendment to be unnecessary <e> <s> article of the directive which is implemented by clause provides <e>", "<cs> i would think that it would be a manufacturing or an operating defect in the appliance <e> <s> there is no simple straight answer to that question i fear <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly try to answer the point of the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> my interpretation is that it is irrespective of the subsidiary company or its shareholding <e> <s> the point at issue here is who in fact assembles the article in question <e> <s> if one takes a complicated piece of machinery which basically is produced by one person and put together by another then it is the other person who is responsible irrespective of their standing one with the other <e> <s> if however the assembly is something comparatively minor two parts of a thousand then of course it would be the originator <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord is right <e> <s> that is the question the noble lord asked me <e> <s> does the noble lord want to ask another <e>", "<cs> i do not believe for one moment that that situation is likely to arise because i think it would be too difficult practically to do that <e> <s> however the noble lord will of course appreciate it when i say that i shall look carefully at what he has said <e>", "<cs> i find it very difficult to believe because perhaps i am a naive man that companies will engage in a number of those practices which the noble lord opposite thinks may happen <e> <s> i dare say that a number of noble lords could paint a variety of scenarios all to the detriment of some producer who wants to escape his moral as well as his legal responsibilites <e> <s> i do not believe that business is conducted in that way <e> <s> i believe that the provisions of the bill are sufficient to persuade him to a proper course of action <e>", "<cs> i have a suspicion that whatever way i answer that question there will be a further question as to exactly what i mean <e> <s> why does the noble lord not put his point more succinctly and then i may be able to answer him in full <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether my noble friend lord de la warr was going back on the earlier point that the noble lord lord williams made <e> <s> my noble friend knows because he has been in business a long time that in practice the reputable industrial commercial and manufacturing companies do not seek to avoid their risks <e> <s> having said to the noble lord lord williams that i shall look at these points i do not think that i can go further than my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord lord denning for underlining what i said earlier <e> <s> i suggested to the noble lord lord williams that there were other statutes <e> <s> i remember because he and i dealt with the matter not so long ago the insolvency act <e> <s> there are other acts of parliament that the noble and learned lord mentioned to us the companies act and so on <e> <s> it is not just a question of a company seeking an out through this bill <e> <s> however we have agreed that we shall consider this and any other scenario that the noble lord likes to put to me <e> <s> it might be more useful if he put it to me rather than to the entire committee <e>", "<cs> i had already made up my mind before the noble lord lord airedale said there it is and sat down to say to him that i appreciated what he says about hard luck <e> <s> let me give an undertaking to him that i shall see whether i can remove some element of this hard luck <e> <s> i do not promise but i offer to do that and if i am successful i shall tell him what it is <e> <s> if i cannot i shall also tell him <e>", "<cs> i again remind the committee that when my noble and learned friend the <e>", "<cs> would that it were only freezing <e> <s> if one suggests that to the chip makers of the united kingdom they will say it is a good deal more than that <e> <s> i myself am not involved in food processing but it seems to me that having accepted some potatoes from the wholesaler or the farmer or whoever i buy them from there are a number of things which i as a potato processor should like to do <e> <s> i should probably want to grade which we have discussed earlier and which is not an industrial process <e> <s> i should perhaps want to wash we have discussed that and decided that if it happens inside the farm it is not an industrial process <e> <s> i should want to peel i should want to cut i may want to regrade i then may want to freeze and package <e> <s> we thus have a number of processes which i should describe and which could quite reasonably be seen and accepted as industrial processes <e>", "<cs> i always listen carefully to the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> normally i like to agree with him <e> <s> however in looking at the interpretation of the directive while it may be quite clear what is meant that must be translated into a common usage or common understanding in the english language <e> <s> we have taken paragraph of the preamble into consideration <e> <s> the preamble states <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is obviously going to ask the committee for its decision on the amendment <e> <s> to be quite honest i think the noble lord is being rather pedantic <e> <s> at the end of the day whatever word is put in will be determined by the european court <e> <s> our job is to make the interpretation of that into english law as clear as we can <e> <s> it is an absolute red herring to draw the german spanish and italian language across the path of the committee <e> <s> no doubt the germans the spanish and the italians are having the same difficulties as we are having in writing the directive into their domestic laws <e> <s> i believe it is quite clear within the context of this part of the bill what is an initial process and what is an industrial process <e> <s> i hope that noble lords will support me in that belief by rejecting the amendment <e>", "<cs> what an interesting discussion this has been <e> <s> using the analogy that the noble lord lord airedale used of a burning ship a dock and other ships i hope that my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne has not taken the opportunity this evening by virtue of his amendment and i quote his article of putting the minister on a burning deck <e>", "<cs> i thought originally that the amendment moved by the noble lord was designed to bring the wording in clause into line with that used in other enactments <e> <s> reasonably be expected is found elsewhere <e> <s> there is a simple reason for the use of these words <e> <s> they reflect the words used in article b of the directive where a defective product is covered by the words could reasonably be expected <e>", "<cs> i am quite sure that the noble lord lord williams is right in what he perceives to be his noble friends view <e> <s> i would say to the noble lord and to my noble friend lord de la warr that when he reads clause at line he should read the whole piece <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt that the noble lord is interested to see whether i can find an answer <e> <s> he is always interested in such things particularly if i may say so at this time of night <e>", "<cs> what a sterling request has come from the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i should say one or two things before i tell the committee what i propose to do <e> <s> there are difficulties here i must confess <e> <s> if noble lords who have spoken are in some doubt they are in pretty good company because they are not the only people who have failed to understand this <e> <s> we have spent quite a lot of time with parliamentary counsel trying to make it easier <e> <s> i assure the committee that the clause has improved enormously since the earlier drafts <e>", "<cs> it is not reasonable for me to accept that from the noble lord lord morton <e> <s> i have said that i am quite prepared to see whether i can obtain with my officials and parliamentary draftsmen greater clarity <e> <s> for the noble lord opposite to accuse me of refusing to do something for loss of face is quite unworthy of him <e> <s> i have made the offer in good faith and i see no reason in the light of that offer to accept an amendment which removes from the bill that which we see as essential <e> <s> if my explanation of what we have in the bill was insufficient that is my fault i have not made that explanation suitably or adequately and i accept that <e> <s> however to make the accusation that it would be for the government to lose face in accepting the amendment is i think just a little too mischievous for even me to accept tonight <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord airedale puts his arguments in very persuasive terms but i fear that i shall have to resist his blandishments <e> <s> the purpose of the subsection we are discussing is to allow the producer of a defective product a defence if the defect in the product was solely due to compliance by the producer with either a united kingdom enactment or with a community obligation <e> <s> this is a very strict defence and is intended to cover the situation which i believe would be against the law of possibility where the producer of a product has made a defective product because of the inevitable result of compliance with a national or community law <e> <s> it does not mean that compliance with a safety regulation would be a complete defence <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness raises a very important point <e> <s> i do not think that i said what she thinks i said but i do not wish to argue the point <e> <s> i should like to make it quite clear that what i meant was that british standards are more often concerned with performance criteria than safety <e> <s> that is not to say that the british standards institution does not have regard to safety of course it does but some of the standards are related to performance only and not to construction safety and so on <e> <s> that is the point that i was trying to make <e> <s> i have no doubt that we shall return to that matter as i suggested we may do when we come to discuss the general safety requirements <e>", "<cs> i think that i am right in saying that this is the last amendment that we shall discuss at any length this evening <e> <s> to put the committee out of any painful thoughts it may have i <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> since i have had the responsibility for answering from the government front bench on consumer matters i have come to have an extremely high regard for the consumer movement and in particular for the noble baroness lady burton who diligently and rightly pursues the proper interests of the consumer lobby if i may call it that <e> <s> i have a very high regard too for the views held by the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale who has brought to the committee this afternoon the arguments that he has deployed over a number of years <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord airedale has asked me what my beliefs are against a hypothetical situation set in itself against a situation which was never determined by the courts <e> <s> with all the noble lords reasonableness i do not think that he would expect me to lay my beliefs before the committee this evening against that background <e>", "<cs> in fact i was not a party to all the discussions that went on but certainly one of the <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly try to answer the points which the noble lord has raised <e> <s> clause read with clause d gives effect in relation to electricity to an entry in the minutes of the council <e> <s> these were adopted at the same time as the directive <e> <s> it reads <e>", "<cs> i greatly enjoyed hearing again the example of the noble lord lord airedale <e> <s> he said that to alleviate to some extent his new clause he has added the words whenever practicable <e> <s> he then said that you cannot go on to name every component <e> <s> he referred to the nail but where is it not practicable and where do we draw the line <e> <s> one would go to the producer of the step-ladder if indeed that were defective <e>", "<cs> i suggest to the noble lord lord airedale that he does not press his amendment for a number of reasons which have already been given by members of the committee <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can then deal with the one principle which i believe is wrong <e> <s> there are practical arguments that one can portray and some have been portrayed <e> <s> i refer to such matters as own insurance which the noble lord lord ezra spoke about earlier <e> <s> i should say that compulsory insurance is not a feature of the directive <e> <s> in the interests of harmonisation and the agreement which was struck in brussels it would be wrong for the united kingdom unilaterally to put in such a provision as it would put a tremendous burden an impossible burden to enforce on our manufacturers or producers <e>", "<cs> let me first give a warm welcome to the noble baroness lady nicol who moved this amendment <e> <s> i think that this is the first occasion during our committee proceedings that we have had the pleasure of hearing and seeing her at the dispatch box <e> <s> that i do not agree with her does not in any way reduce my admiration for her argument <e>", "<cs> i have just said so <e>", "<cs> i think i said clause i should have said clause <e> <s> i apologise to the committee <e> <s> as we discussed yesterday at question time sometimes the way parliamentary draftsmen order the affairs in writing what ministers want to put in a bill exceeds some of our understanding <e> <s> i take the point that the noble lord makes <e> <s> i do not think he wants to make too much of an issue about it this evening <e>", "<cs> i can assure my noble friend lady gardner of parkes i am grateful to her for allowing us to discuss her amendment no <e> <s> with amendment no <e> <s> that we give serious consideration to the matters that she raises <e> <s> of course i am aware that the consumers association and the national consumer council have opposed this exclusion but i have to say that car boot sales private sales or charity sales notwithstanding where the government see the need to prohibit the supply of unsafe goods whether they are new or secondhand we would do so under the existing consumer safety act or the regulation-making powers contained in clause of this bill when it is enacted <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord lord hacking has raised matters of importance <e> <s> i had intended to say until the noble lord lord williams stood up that i would give the noble lord lord hacking a couple of fairly quick comments <e> <s> in the light of what the noble lord lord williams says i prefer to say to both noble lords that i should like to consider carefully what has been said in relation to clause stand part <e> <s> perhaps i may come back to both noble lords in due course <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for so clearly explaining the purpose of her amendment <e> <s> she says that the new clause proposes that if it appears to the secretary of state that any product or any consumer goods are dangerous defective or unsafe he may serve on any person a product recall notice <e> <s> according to the proposed new clause this notice may require a person named in it to recall the product or consumer goods in question <e> <s> the notice may require the person to disclose the nature of the defect or the danger to identify the circumstances in which the use of the product or goods are unsafe and to disclose procedures for disposing of the product or consumer goods <e> <s> the notice may also require the person named in the notice to inform the public that he will repair or replace the product or consumer goods or refund the price of the goods <e> <s> the new clause would also make provision for the notices to be supported by a regulation-making power <e>", "<cs> yes i do because i should not like the noble baroness to think that i am not serious <e> <s> i did smile but that should not be taken as a display of non-seriousness <e> <s> i smiled because the noble baroness said we are only providing an enabling power <e> <s> i have stood here at this dispatch box on more than one occasion and produced exactly the same argument <e> <s> the response has always been why is the minister asking for enabling powers unless he or the secretary of state has the intention at some time of using such powers <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord gallacher for the way in which he has described the amendment and i have to tell him straightaway that i have some sympathy with the reasons for it <e> <s> i cannot actually agree to accept the amendment as it stands which would in effect prohibit the movement of any goods but i shall certainly agree to consider tabling an amendment which would ensure that local authorities were able to know at any time where those goods were kept to which a suspension notice related <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord morton of shuna for speaking to amendment no <e> <s> with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i understand the purport of the amendments <e> <s> they would make a significant change to the application of the provision for compensation <e> <s> at present enforcement authorities are liable under the consumer safety amendment act to pay compensation where <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams for his remarks <e> <s> he reminds us of what he said at second reading that for his part he would deal with this bill as expeditiously as possible commensurate i think he also said with our duties as a revising chamber <e> <s> i fully appreciate what he has said and what he means by it <e> <s> i am grateful to him and his colleagues for the co-operation they have shown <e> <s> we on our side have sought to give the essence the kernel of the answers in the hope that they may satisfy <e> <s> if on this side we can do anything further to ensure that the report stage when it comes is as harmoniously conducted as the first two days of the committee i assure members that we should like to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord williams and lord diamond for their reception of the statement which i have just repeated <e> <s> i think that both noble lords will appreciate that the government have not sought the views of the council of lloyds as regards the report nor have we put to the council our views on that report <e> <s> therefore i should prefer to consider many of the questions raised this afternoon as points of view expressed by both noble lords <e> <s> those views will of course be communicated to lloyds <e> <s> however there are one or two of those questions that i can answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend who has never made any secret of his involvement with lloyds and the council of lloyds <e> <s> i am glad he is able to bring from lloyds its gratitude to sir patrick neill and his colleagues for the report <e> <s> i was not aware that the council had this morning decided to adopt the suggestions made in the report with regard to the change in composition <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for telling us that this is so <e> <s> i am particularly glad to hear from him of his confidence about the other recommendations including those in chapter vii <e> <s> the government look forward to receiving the councils response to the report in due course <e> <s> we shall then in our turn be able to make comments on its actions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord ezra for his general acceptance of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very different question <e> <s> no doubt the noble lord looks upon the next election with less anticipation than i do because i am quite confident that we will be continuing our programmes successful as they all have been shown to be <e>", "<cs> my lords companies themselves are in a better position than those in government to decide on the most profitable use of their resources <e> <s> it remains for them to make those commercial decisions <e> <s> it may be and i quote the noble lord lord beswick that a new breed of people are emerging in the city <e> <s> this is perhaps not unusual since the changes that are occurring in the city bring new and different forces to bear <e>", "<cs> my lords the government with the takeover panel will be considering the lessons of the present investigations that are going on <e> <s> certainly the speed and flexibility of the panel remain considerable assets <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly was not aware that the noble lord had left the city at that time <e> <s> i am glad to hear his view <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> with the passing of the financial services act further tightening has taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree that it is necessary at this time for the government to take any measures to further tighten those which are already in place <e> <s> on the point about what the bank of england is doing with the city institutions that is its business <e> <s> as i have said in answer to an earlier supplementary question at the present moment we have no plans to change the existing measures <e>", "<cs> my lords this government have consistently sought to eradicate misdemeanours and wrongdoings not only in the city but elsewhere and will continue so to do <e> <s> the noble lord will know that an inquiry is in place right now dealing with matters in regard to mergers takeovers and also the restrictive trade practices act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord nugent of guildford for his question and embraced within it his comments <e> <s> there is in place a policy that takes account of what my noble friend is suggesting <e> <s> this has worked extremely satisfactorily <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what the noble lord lord williams is asking <e> <s> however in the light of recent events i do not think that it is for the government to insist upon disclosures of that kind <e> <s> surely it is for the shareholders to require their companies to disclose the information which they want <e> <s> there is nothing illegal in how the companies spend their money in terms of the way in which the question is asked <e>", "<cs> my lords this is really a matter for the stock exchange <e> <s> if there are breaches of the stock exchange rules and regulations which are in their turn in breach of the law of course the government will not hesitate to take steps <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lords first supplementary question could possibly be embraced in the original question and i should not like to comment on it this afternoon <e> <s> as regards his second supplementary question i do not think that over the past or months we have heard any more or any less about the matters which he raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a question that would be better addressed to the labour party rather than to me <e>", "<cs> my lords the recent action taken by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry in appointing inspectors illustrates the seriousness with which we consider matters of this kind <e> <s> such action also demonstrates the firmness with which the government intend to deal with malpractice wherever it takes place <e>", "<cs> my lords inquiries into a number of matters not one of which the noble lord mentioned specifically he will know what i mean as i think i know what he means are taking place and the appropriate action will be taken when all the relevant information is gathered <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord an assurance in the terms he asks for because neither i nor my right honourable and honourable friends can command the free movements of individuals <e> <s> i have given an assurance that the government as demonstrated by their actions seek to take a firm stand wherever evidence of malpractice or misdemeanour is brought to our attention and the rest follows from that <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that noble lords may inquire about anything at all <e> <s> what the answer is may perhaps be a little different <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not feel able to comment on that matter <e> <s> it is very wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his question as it underlines the importance of the city <e> <s> i can certainly tell him that the interests of the nation to which he draws attention are indeed the same as the interests of the government in that connection <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his question and i confirm that he is quite right <e> <s> perhaps i ought to have said to the noble lord lord paget at the time i answered him that of course questions other than those which are <e>", "<cs> it may well be for the benefit of the committee if i speak now <e> <s> that is not to say that i shall not listen carefully to anything your lordships may have to say following my remarks <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part on this further debate on the substance of the amendments <e> <s> as i said earlier i shall of course give careful consideration to what they have said <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend lord campbell of alloway for the way in which he has explained his amendment <e> <s> i have said earlier that we accept that there are difficulties with clause as it is at present drafted <e>", "<cs> i think if the noble lord lord monson addresses himself carefully to clause he will see that prices of investment such as unit trusts are covered by the financial services act which was discussed by your lordships last year <e> <s> they are excluded from this bill by virtue of that clause <e> <s> i would anticipate that the regulations or the rules as i think they are to be called under the financial services act will ensure that all relevant matters that an investor should take into account or to whose attention matters should be drawn will be reflected in those rules <e> <s> i cannot really offer anything to the noble lord under the terms of the bill before the committee this afternoon <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> his question raises a fundamental matter <e> <s> this part of the bill on misleading prices is directed in particular to the consumer in order that he may have a proper choice as it is simply put that he is not misled <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord lord gallacher that this amendment dealing as it does with codes stands on its own irrespective of the discussions of the committee earlier today <e> <s> i can <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down he tempts me and i cannot resist that temptation <e> <s> when he speaks about speed he will recall that when i spoke earlier i said that the document of the concordat would have to be discussed with a wide range of people who have not had the opportunity of putting their views on the paper of the concordat <e> <s> therefore i am not too sure that the analogy which the noble lord draws is entirely fair <e>", "<cs> the negative resolution procedure is quite appropriate for regulations which may be made under the powers conferred in this clause <e> <s> there are a number of precedents <e> <s> indeed one of the precursors of this bill the price marking of bargain offers order was itself made under that procedure <e> <s> the same applies to regulations made under the trade descriptions act the fair trading act and the consumer credit act <e> <s> all these provisions may impose requirements contravention of which will be an offence <e>", "<cs> i take all the amendments that are put down by noble lords opposite with the seriousness they deserve <e> <s> this amendment is a serious matter <e> <s> of course it is a serious matter <e> <s> the noble lord lord gallacher has ensured that the committee recognises the seriousness of it <e> <s> but i have to say that the suggestion of the noble lord lord williams that the secretary of state can of his own volition amend the bill is wrong <e> <s> he has to consult and he has then to lay regulations which are subject to the approval of both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> by way of introduction perhaps i may say that clause gives the secretary of state the power to make regulations governing the manner and circumstances in which price indications or any associated information are given by a person in the course of any business of his <e> <s> regulations may also make provision for the enforcement of clause or of any regulations made under this clause <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble baroness lady robson of kiddington for moving the amendment which she describes as a probing amendment <e> <s> i am of course glad to hear what the noble baroness lady nicol said in general support although i think that she may like to go a little further than the noble baroness lady robson indicated <e>", "<cs> first i express my sorrow and tender my apologies to the noble lord lord morton of shuna for any omission in the correspondence we have had since the bill came to this place <e> <s> i should not want him to go without the benefit of our view on these matters <e>", "<cs> i anticipated that the noble lord lord graham of edmonton might return to this <e> <s> i confess that i thought he might have moved an amendment which would have enabled me to give more detailed consideration of the response that he now invites me to make <e> <s> i have to be very careful <e> <s> i do not underestimate for one moment the work and the dedication of enforcement officers <e> <s> they have wide-ranging responsibilities in a number of very different areas <e> <s> their time is extremely precious <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord gallacher for explaining the reason for putting down this amendment <e> <s> in fact i believe it to be misconceived and i may take some little time to explain why <e> <s> the committee will remember that this issue was debated at some length during the passage of the consumer safety amendment bill last year <e> <s> we initially thought that hours was sufficient for this limited purpose <e> <s> we were then persuaded by very strong arguments from the national consumer council and local authority associations that up to hours may be necessary to deal with awkward cases <e>", "<cs> i am quite happy to hear from the noble lord lord williams and indeed from my noble friend lord brougham and vaux that they both have some concern in this matter <e> <s> at this time there is little i can do other than draw to the attention of the committee and in particular the two noble lords what i said in relation to the point that the noble lord lord graham of edmonton and the noble baroness lady nicol raised in an earlier discussion on resources available to the enforcement services <e>", "<cs> again i am grateful to the noble lord lord airedale for the way in which he has put his amendment to the committee this evening <e> <s> it defines community obligation in clause <e> <s> in this clause we have defined those words which need defining or interpreting for the purpose of the bill <e> <s> the phrase community obligation is relevant to the defence in clause a that it shall be a defence for a producer of a defective product to show <e>", "<cs> i can readily understand the concern which has prompted these amendments but i ask the committee to accept that the repeal of the trade descriptions act is necessary in order for the united kingdom to comply with its community obligations <e> <s> i should also like to reassure the committee that the government are leaving no stone unturned in their efforts to identify further measures which might be introduced to mitigate the effect of that repeal <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble lord is trying to tease me this evening <e> <s> he knows because he has experience of these matters that i cannot put a date on it <e> <s> the consultations may take a long time and i mean a long time and i hope he is not going to ask me what i mean by long <e> <s> we usually have this in terms of short <e>", "<cs> before we leave clause i should like to respond positively to my noble friend lord brougham and vaux <e> <s> i am sorry that he is not in his place because he specifically asked about the repeal of the consumer safety act <e> <s> we moved on rather quickly and i should have told him that although the act will be repealed its provisions will continue in the bill <e> <s> in this regard the bill is a consolidation measure <e> <s> i think he should know that before he proceeds in the way that he indicated <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that only parts will be consolidated <e>", "<cs> my lords with minor reservations i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> it is particularly for this reason that the department of education and science has undertaken a review of the place of foreign languages in the school curriculum <e> <s> the review is to underline the importance of being able to communicate in a language rather than perhaps learning some of the deeper aspects of it particularly in languages other than french <e>", "<cs> my lords the acceptance of what the noble lord says right across the house leaves me with no alternative but to agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords although my noble friends question is perhaps a little wide of the original one and although i have no personal experience of this again i have only one alternative and that is to agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords that again is a little bit wide of the original question <e> <s> what the noble lord describes may have been an impression given many years ago but in particular there has been a great change of attitude by employers towards language skills for employees <e> <s> there are encouraging signs that exporters are developing greater language skills <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the answer to the first question <e> <s> i shall look at the second <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i can only repeat to my noble friend the point i made earlier <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science is undertaking a review to establish which is the best way to encourage language teaching particularly in schools and places of higher education so as to meet todays needs <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> it is encouraging that a start has been made <e> <s> it is the purpose of the review to ensure that that start is continued right through <e>", "<cs> my lords that most certainly is not true <e> <s> there are adequate funds <e> <s> it is a question of education authorities devoting those funds to the best advantage <e> <s> that is called management <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> her knowledge of what happens in plymouth is well known since she was such a distinguished member of parliament for the constituency <e> <s> i am sure she is absolutely right <e> <s> i am also sure that any stimulus that can be given to young people and older people to encourage their language learning and practice is to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords there is only one point on which i disagree with what the noble lord said <e> <s> he described the city as much maligned <e> <s> i do not agree with him <e> <s> i agree that the city makes a significant contribution to the economy of this country and the city itself and all its institutions have taken advantage of the techniques available including language to improve their position <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i cannot answer my noble friend <e> <s> i simply have no knowledge about the supply of language teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords internal market measures were adopted and another four agreed during the united kingdom presidency <e> <s> this represents a substantial acceleration in progress towards completing the internal market <e> <s> we hope that the momentum now established will be sustained under subsequent presidencies <e>", "<cs> my lords the items cover a wide spectrum <e> <s> about half were agreed in the internal market council dealing with mutual recognition of national standards for industrial products of particular interest <e> <s> perhaps i may tell my noble friend that the consumer credit directive a regulation with regard to counterfeit goods a further regulation with regard to hotel fire safety and a directive on good laboratory practice are four that come very readily to mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not surprised at the noble baronesss supplementary <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret to have to tell the noble lord that not as much progress has been made as anticipated but ecofin adopted an important directive in november on the liberalisation of capital movements <e> <s> i think what lies behind the noble lords question is the fact that a genuinely free market in financial services insurance and so on would give our firms wide and new opportunities to market their services throughout the community <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> of course priorities have in themselves priorities <e> <s> but it remains an important matter for us to pursue through the community at every opportunity we have <e>", "<cs> not without notice my lords <e> <s> the noble lord will recall that the white paper produced by the noble lord lord cockfield as commissioner had some measures <e> <s> i cannot recall how many of those have been adopted since the white paper was produced <e>", "<cs> my lords i really have to agree with my noble friend lord nugent of guildford <e> <s> the single european act is an important step towards enabling the united kingdom to realise more fully the benefits of our membership of the community and a greater use of majority voting will i think lead to much faster and more effective decision-taking in all areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the true answer to the question of the noble lord lord bruce of donington lies in the fact that the european court judgments in the non-life insurance test cases became available too late in the presidency to allow us to make progress <e> <s> we hope to make better progress in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to both noble lords for their reception of this statement <e> <s> i shall certainly do my best to answer the main questions that have been put to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the answer to that question <e> <s> i do not think that there is any relationship whatsoever <e> <s> the interest that the rover group and the government have kept to the forefront is the interest of our commercial vehicle industry <e> <s> we know that there will be some job losses <e> <s> let me say quite bluntly that whatever may be the position in holland had we not concluded the negotiations which had been going on for a long time inevitably there would have been very many more job losses in the united kingdom because the truck industry as represented by leyland could not have been sustained in the face of the competition in view of the overcapacity in the market place <e> <s> i believe that there is a net gain for the work people in the truck industry in that there is a secure and viable future for them <e> <s> i have suggested and i believe that the expanded market and the greater opportunities that are offered will in their turn give further job opportunities in the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the privatisation of british leyland the government have never made any secret of the fact that it is their intention to return that company to the private sector as soon as practicable <e> <s> that remains the governments stance <e>", "<cs> my lords there are no plans or none that i know of to re-open the bathgate plant <e> <s> with regard to wider markets it is for this new anglo-dutch company to decide in which markets it wants to engage <e> <s> i understand the concern of the noble lord lord hatch of lusby about the humanitarian aspects and the inability of some countries to transport food aid because of the lack of trucks <e> <s> i suggest that that is well outside the area of the statement and the setting up of a joint company <e> <s> it is for that joint company to make its commercial decisions about the world markets that it will tackle <e>", "<cs> my lords i

dutch owned <e> <s> we shall have representation on the board <e> <s> it is a new joint anglo-dutch company <e> <s> i should have thought that the noble lord would be pleased that we have been able to secure an agreement for the reasons that i have described with one of our european partners <e> <s> it will help us enormously to secure our share of the european truck and van market <e> <s> the other matters that he raised are commercial decisions for the board of the new company <e> <s> it is not for her majestys government to tell it in which areas it should engage <e> <s> that is precisely the point of encouraging the new company <e>", "<cs> my lords i have found the past few hours to be one of the most interesting and exciting experiences that i have had the pleasure of in your lordships house <e> <s> it has been that kind of debate <e> <s> perhaps i should say straight away that in common with other noble lords i am sorry that the events of the days proceedings meant that we started a good deal later than we should have wished <e> <s> i shall certainly ask my noble friend lady hooper to convey the feelings of your lordships to those who are normally described as the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will perhaps allow me to continue a little further i think that he will find his question answered <e>", "<cs> my lords if he does not get a job and comes back for further counselling even after some training he still has not had a job and is still long-term unemployed <e> <s> that is the simple answer <e> <s> the noble lord lord hatch is trying to ascribe a motive which is far from our minds that of reducing artificially a group of people <e> <s> the matter is too serious for us to engage in the figure shuffling business <e> <s> we are not in that business <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness went a little further than i did but i understand what she is saying <e> <s> it is a real problem and if we are serious about looking at the whole problem then the whole problem is what we must look at <e> <s> there may be answers i do not know them <e> <s> however i shall certainly be happy to discuss the matter with my right honourable friend the secretary of state to see what programme can be devised to best fit that group of people <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for her acceptance of the draft regulations <e> <s> perhaps i should just say that the governments regulations were not totally unsatisfactory <e> <s> it is never entirely one sided it is invariably six of one and half a dozen of the other <e> <s> perhaps the government did not make it clear to the industry exactly what was required and perhaps the industry did not entirely understand what we were saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly be happy to provide the noble baroness with examples in detail and set out a schedule but on a debate of this kind one is mindful of the clock and i have a number of points that have been raised which i must answer <e> <s> perhaps i will be able to come back to that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure airbus industrie has a number of commercial strategies that it would wish to deploy in the programme <e> <s> but as the government have not yet committed million or anything at all towards the programme my noble friends question is somewhat hypothetical <e>", "<cs> my lords i can agree with some parts of the noble lords question <e> <s> here is an extremely profitable successful high-tech company <e> <s> the government would wish to give careful consideration to any application british aerospace may make for support in the furtherance of its activities <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the earlier questions of the noble baroness i do not think that i can answer on behalf of my noble friend <e> <s> no doubt he will answer for himself in due course perhaps outside the chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords that is indeed right <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for his question <e> <s> it is the collaboration among the constitutent countries in airbus industrie which has made it such a success <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lord is two fold <e> <s> the governments consideration of the present application is proceeding in parallel with the decision-making timetables of the french and german governments <e> <s> we shall take account of the progress of airbus industrie and its partners towards the launching of the programme <e> <s> it is certainly right that the million given to the a launch is proving at this moment to be a successful support programme <e> <s> we continue to monitor it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will forgive me but i cannot quite follow what he is asking me <e> <s> the partners in airbus industries government are at one in investigating the application for support for the programme <e> <s> they are in harmony over that <e> <s> when those considerations have been completed joint decisions will be made to airbus industrie and british aerospace is a partner with that organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i undertake to do the best i can in that regard <e> <s> to date at pre-introduction there are orders for the a <e> <s> that is well on the way to meeting the criteria that the government set down at the time the million was advanced <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i have upset the noble lord by using the word support <e> <s> they are moneys loaned to the company to help it launch the programme <e> <s> the criteria for that are clearly set down <e> <s> there has to be a commercial rate of return <e> <s> that is negotiated as it was with the a <e> <s> all those considerations will be brought into account in assessing the viability of the a and the a and arrangements perhaps on a similar basis will be made in that regard <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not suggest that the americans are squealing <e> <s> they believe that the launch aid which is now being asked for contravenes the gatt arrangements <e> <s> my right honourable friend has discussed this with the americans and the gatt air committee is meeting to ensure that we do not breach the gatt rules <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord <e> <s> knows that his question is very wide of the original question on the order paper <e> <s> i shall be delighted to answer his question if he likes to put it down <e>", "<cs> my lords put simply the case for the amendment is that the exclusion it makes for development risks is narrower than the exclusion made by the words that we have used in the bill <e> <s> what we are really being asked is why we have not precisely implemented the directive <e>", "<cs> my lords we discussed the inclusion of the development risks defence in part i of the bill at some length at committee stage and your lordships will recall that after a division the amendment which aimed to remove that defence was disagreed to <e> <s> it is quite apparent that before us we have an amendment which would remove the availability of that defence in respect of medicines and drugs covered by the relevant acts <e> <s> it is apparent from the form of the amendment that the noble lord lord allen and other noble lords opposite accept that the defence should be available generally <e> <s> but i have to express real surprise that it should not be available to the manufacturers of drugs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lords lord williams and lord airedale for telling us what lies behind their two amendments <e> <s> of course i forgive the noble lord lord williams for that little error <e> <s> it may be typographical it may be due to the printers or it may be the error of the noble lord lord morton <e> <s> but as the noble lord lord williams said this is a serious matter and we want to discuss it seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord williams said i will certainly be advising the house not to accept this amendment <e> <s> i have already said so to my noble friend lord mottistone in a letter which i confess was only written this morning and delivered to him shortly before your lordships house sat this afternoon and i doubt whether many noble lords have had an opportunity of seeing a copy in the library <e> <s> the noble lord my old friend asks me to explain to your lordships why i will not accept it and this is what i propose to do as shortly as i can and as he suggests for the record <e> <s> the amendment does introduce this element of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord gallacher for moving this amendment in the name of his noble friend lord graham <e> <s> as he says the amendment attempts to restrict those standards of safety which would be considered in deciding whether consumer goods fail to comply with the general safety requirement to as the amendment states <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what i have just said in response to amendment no <e> <s> i doubt whether my noble friend lord mottistone or the noble baroness lady nicol will wish me to rehearse all the arguments again no the noble baroness indicates that she does not wish me to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness lady nicol for the way in which she put her amendment she described it as another attempt <e> <s> i fear that my response is practically the same <e> <s> let me deal if i may with the three outstanding points <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to fall foul of the nomenclature consultations <e> <s> i said that we were discussing these matters with a number of interested parties <e> <s> i think that in the terminology that the noble baroness means formal consultations have not yet taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i think technically i should say before the noble baroness sits down i think if i may say so that she is getting a little confused <e> <s> she talked about chippendale <e> <s> chippendale furniture is not an every-day sale <e> <s> i was talking in terms of furniture on sale which changes hands quite rapidly and frequently in large volume <e> <s> chippendale chairs have to be repaired to the standard pertaining at the time of original construction or they fail to keep their value <e> <s> you cannot bring a modern repair factor to bear in the case of furniture of that kind and well the noble baroness knows that <e> <s> i think she is pulling my leg a little <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend lord renton wishes a confirmation i shall indeed confirm that clause is concerned with consumer goods <e> <s> there are two main regimes for unsafe goods <e> <s> one regime concerns the safety of goods used at work <e> <s> that regime is set out in the health and safety at work act <e> <s> that act contains very broadly speaking a general safety requirement for goods for use at work and in clause of this bill we make some modest improvements to that regime <e>", "<cs> oh <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel at something of a loss tonight because the noble baroness puts her amendments so shortly and my explanations in rejection are so long <e> <s> all i can pray in aid is the seriousness with which i view the noble baroness amendments <e> <s> as she says a similar amendment was moved in committee and this one certainly avoids many of what can be described as the draconian provisions that were evident at that time <e> <s> however i have to say that i really still do not believe that a case has been made out for including such a recall power in this bill <e> <s> the amendments before us do not remove the administrative difficulties which i have previously referred to <e> <s> to be really effective any recall produced must be capable of being employed very quickly and of being very effectively enforced and equally effectively monitored <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i have the point that my noble friend makes <e> <s> the amendment merely states <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am perhaps still speaking because i was interrupted before i sat down <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships will be generous to me even at pm <e> <s> i may have been a little misleading <e> <s> when i said the local authority i was referring to what went above <e> <s> the he in the last line of the amendment is the person who is prohibited from supplying the goods <e> <s> i may have confused my noble friend and the house for which i apologise <e> <s> i should like to have a look at this little exchange and write to those noble lords who have taken an interest in this amendment to make clear the governments position and to enable them to do what they will later <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a rerun <e> <s> as i said during our committee stage an amendment such as this would make a significant change to the application of the provisions for compensation in the event that goods seized by an enforcement authority or subject to a suspension notice subsequently do not contravene any of the provisions of the consumer safety legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mackie of benshie asked me two questions <e> <s> in response to the first perhaps i may say this <e> <s> british companies themselves have made acquisitions overseas <e> <s> this gives us an interest in the free flow of international investment <e> <s> over the years many of the foreign companies have made a major contribution to the british economy <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter of opinion for my noble friend lord nugent of guildford <e> <s> i hear what he says <e>", "<cs> my lords again i have to say to the house that if it appears to my right honourable friend the secretary of state that previously undisclosed material facts in relation to the merger have emerged he has a discretion to make a reference to the mmc but more importantly he has a duty to investigate those matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already answered that question by saying that inquiries and investigations are being undertaken to examine all the material that has been placed before us from mr rowlands letters and from other areas <e> <s> when those investigations are completed my right honourable friend the secretary of state will be in a position to take a decision as to what further activities if any need to take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i always try to answer questions by noble lords put properly to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords since certain material has been put before my right honourable friend the secretary of state he has the statutory duty to consider that material and any representations made to him <e> <s> that is exactly what he is doing <e>", "<cs> my lords whether lonrho showers the noble lord opposite with letters is a matter between lonrho and the noble lord <e> <s> the company know that the material which the letters contain and other material which has been furnished to us are being inquired into <e>", "<cs> my lords all factors relevant to this matter put before my right honourable friend are being inquired into <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an interesting afternoon as i thought originally it would be <e> <s> i have decided with a little help from your lordships that the brief which a few days ago i prepared with the aid of officials would not do <e> <s> i wish to concentrate upon answering noble lords <e>", "<cs> we are always looking of course to discharge our responsibility as a supporter of industry and as a supporter of trade both at home and overseas <e> <s> we shall continue to do that <e> <s> that is as far as i shall go <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that the noble lord opposite will forgive me if i have misheard or misunderstood him <e> <s> i shall of course carefully read what he said <e>", "<cs> we are on a limited debate and i think that perhaps i will try my best to finish in time <e> <s> it is a limited debate and i think i am entitled to refer to other comments that have been made <e>", "<cs> i want to turn to the noble lord lord butterworth who gave us a description of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord gallacher for the way in which he explained the purpose of and the reasoning behind the three amendments which he has put before your lordships this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is confusing two issues <e> <s> i have not even come to discuss the matter of weighting i was merely answering the question of the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord morton of shuna for his explanation of the amendment <e> <s> let me say at the outset that generally in deciding what the penalty should be for the offence of giving a misleading price indication we might perhaps look at the precedents <e> <s> it is true that under the trade descriptions act there is the possibility of imprisonment under section which deals with false price indications <e> <s> however <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i listened very carefully to what both noble lords have had to say about this <e> <s> i leave two thoughts with your lordships <e> <s> it is a general principle <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams for carefully setting out his general concern <e> <s> of course i too appreciate that events move on and that he has to take advantage of procedures to raise these points <e> <s> and of course i do not quarrel with him <e> <s> i was glad to hear that he was treating this amendment as a probing amendment because i was a little perplexed when i first saw it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord might have understood that but that was not the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord graham for his explanation as i am grateful to the noble lord lord gallacher who reminded us that we discussed this quite shortly during committee stage <e> <s> i am sorry if he found me unsympathetic on that occasion but i have to tell your lordships that i have nothing to add to what i then said so perhaps my lack of sympathy has extended over the weeks for which i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords i have always felt that the problems of one group of people are the opportunities of other groups <e> <s> i do not see this as a problem in that there are very few movements of goods out of an unmanned dock for example <e> <s> i do not <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me perhaps if he is going to quote me he will use the full quote <e> <s> i stated that the officer would take a preliminary view as to whether he should exercise his other powers the other powers being seizure and detention for up to six months <e> <s> that is what i said <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate and understand the concern of the noble baroness <e> <s> i think her concern is shared by the select committee of your lordships house and indeed by consumer organisations <e> <s> however i have to remind the house that the resolution does not require the commission to make a report until the end of this year and so i can offer no grounds for optimism that the subject will appear on the agenda of the consumer council before then <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness puts me in a rather difficult position because i think she will recall that the government have no <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord molloy embraces two separate issues <e> <s> i have explained that we have no standing in the ccc the government are not represented there and so what they do is outside any jurisdiction <e> <s> i have also explained that the commission are required by the resolution of last october to report the outcome of their deliberations on the implementation of consumer interests throughout the communitys directives <e> <s> i have explained that the steering committee will be meeting on four occasions and that the working party of that body will be meeting throughout the year <e> <s> that is how the matter will be taken forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always surprised that the noble baroness has information about meetings of the ccc and indeed about consumer matters in the commission long before i get such information <e> <s> she is extremely well informed in that area <e>", "<cs> and therefore i am always grateful to her for the information she gives me <e> <s> we do not have information as to what happened at the meeting of the th february but we shall press to see what information we can get and no doubt the noble baroness will do likewise <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear it will be necessary for me to jog back a bit <e> <s> i accept that the person who is injured by a product must be able to ask the supplier under clause to identify the producer <e> <s> at committee stage the noble lord lord morton put down an amendment to ensure that the injured person could act through a representative <e> <s> as my noble and learned friend the lord advocate said at that time it seemed to us unnecessary to make a provision of that kind <e> <s> however the amendment did highlight a potential difficulty in cases where the injured person had died before making a request because he would not by that date have acquired a cause of action under part i which would enable his estate or his dependants to sue <e> <s> we accordingly tabled an amendment at report stage to deal with that problem and the relevant provision is now in clause <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord morton for putting us on notice of that problem <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will recall that at report stage my noble and learned friend the lord advocate explained that we had considered the noble lords desire to make clear that liability under part i is to be treated as a liability in tort delict or quasi-delict <e> <s> we had taken the view that there was some uncertainty about the position under the law of tort <e> <s> however we did not think that the same doubt arose about delict <e> <s> we accordingly tabled amendments dealing only with certain statutory provisions referring to liability in tort of which the most important is now in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the summing up of the position by the noble lord lord morton but i fear that after that i part company with him <e> <s> these two amendments raise an important question for both traders and enforcement officers <e> <s> i begin by recalling a little of the history of these provisions since they represent the outcome of considerable debate earlier in our proceedings and an earlier change in the provisions in favour of the enforcement officers <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to keep your lordships house this evening <e> <s> i should like to acknowledge with thanks the points which have been made this afternoon some more heartfelt than others <e> <s> we have discussed most of them on more than one occasion and therefore i do not propose to reiterate any arguments <e>", "<cs> i remind myself that we are back in committee and i shall respond to any point that is put to me on any amendment as and when those amendments come up <e> <s> i think i made the governments position clear at an earlier stage in the bill and my noble friend lord beaverbrook made it abundantly clear when he looked after the first part of the committee stage <e> <s> we support the principle behind this bill <e> <s> i really do not think that i can answer for another place <e>", "<cs> i say to the noble lord lord stallard that i fully understand his concern <e> <s> however i must indicate that i cannot accept his amendment <e> <s> i recognise that some pharmaceuticals receive marketing approval long before others and the noble lord indicated a number of these <e> <s> however the <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> perhaps i should repeat what i said because there is no picking particular figures <e> <s> these were the actual figures <e> <s> i said that that analysis indicated that in and there were estimated cost savings to the national health service of less than million in the first year and million in the second year when a total of four products were affected <e>", "<cs> i did not say that <e>", "<cs> it might be helpful if at this stage i put the governments view <e> <s> i have looked at the amendment itself and its effect <e> <s> we do not support the concept of compulsory generic substitution or the imposition of an additional burden on doctors in their methods of prescribing <e> <s> the amendment which has been proposed and described to us by the noble lord lord kilmarnock would require changes in the contracts and conditions of service of both doctors and pharmacists and it would undermine the research-based pharmaceutical industry in the united kingdom which the administration of the noble lord opposite and my own party have consistently encouraged <e>", "<cs> my lords i expanded this point so that the noble lord or perhaps another speaker would not come back and ask me what would happen in the rest of the world <e> <s> what i was saying about the international standardisation applies also to the community <e> <s> i said that the problem here was not the plug but the various sockets <e> <s> those would all have to be changed and that would require households throughout not only the community but the whole <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of points have been raised on this order <e> <s> some of them are not totally relevant to the order but i shall do my best to respond <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the criticism i deny the charge <e> <s> the statistical office is as is the civil service politically impartial <e> <s> the noble lord lord diamond said that he did not want to question the integrity of professional statisticians <e> <s> indeed i do not believe that the noble lord lord ezra or the noble lord lord williams of elvel wish to criticise the integrity of professional statisticians <e> <s> the estimates are readjusted upwards or downwards as evidence comes to light <e> <s> there is no question of any influence whatsoever being brought by government departments <e>", "<cs> yes the companies act <e> <s> as to the true nature and extent what is relevant is whether the subsidiary branch or associate has a relationship in the shareholding one with the other <e>", "<cs> i should think because those who were consulted about this the companies and so on felt that this was the best way of expressing what was meant <e>", "<cs> my lords if your lordships will permit me i must confess that i had not anticipated that noble lords would read into the schedule a number of matters which most certainly are not included <e> <s> it may well be that i have not been able to provide noble lords with all the answers that they wanted and perhaps not even with answers that are totally satisfactory to them <e> <s> nevertheless they are the answers <e>

a long time <e> <s> i do not think the name matters a great deal <e> <s> the noble lord lord nugent of guildford in a recent question in your lordships house on road signs illustrated the fact that we have a fairly deplorable system of road signing in this country <e> <s> perhaps the ministers endeavours will be charged with greater urgency when this bridge opens <e>", "<cs> my lords since i was involved in the earlier stage in this area of the bill i should take exception with my noble friend on this occasion in that his amendments nos <e> <s> and take away the existing provisions which were a fundamental part of this part of the bill <e> <s> it leaves the equivalent of the provisions to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin with the dti press notice of th october which started by saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i admit that the amendment is the same one as i moved previously although i have taken a slightly different angle <e> <s> i apologise for any inadequacy in my explanation at committee stage which has meant that i have taken a rather longer time this afternoon amplifying my intention <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord graham <e> <s> i confirm that the purport of the amendment is to encourage manufacturers to invest the considerable sums of money required to produce low alcohol and alcohol-free products which taste and smell like beer so some people tell me <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for having quoted the passage from the masham committee report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lord ferrers for his response <e> <s> i am more grateful however to all those noble lords who have spoken in support of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in this short debate tonight <e> <s> perhaps i may comment on one <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support my noble friend lord mottistone in his amendment but at the outset i should like to endorse what the noble earl lord halsbury had to say about the late member for kensington a man of untold energy <e> <s> it is sad that the efforts he spent over the years on bills of this nature should be thwarted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord williams but if he quotes me i should be grateful if he would quote me in entirety <e> <s> i said by virtue of this bill <e> <s> i found it intolerable that the bill should be used for this purpose <e> <s> i concluded by saying that if change was necessary it should come about within the context of the review of the companies act and i asked my noble friend what was happening in that respect <e> <s> that is rather different <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that it is for the government to give a lead in the matter <e> <s> are there any plans to produce a discussion document upon which decisions can be made and the government can assess the chances for the consensus of which he has spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord nugent of guildford is quite right <e> <s> we have been around this circuit on more than one occasion and i recall the circuit <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord monson will withdraw his amendment because we shall not arrive anywhere <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that doubts have been expressed recently as to the content of some of the waste material imported <e> <s> is he satisfied that the hazardous waste inspectorate which comes under his department is sufficiently adequate both numerically and technically to deal with what is becoming an increasing problem <e>", "<cs> my lords given the exchanges across your lordships house will my noble friend now answer the question which i asked him <e> <s> that was given the present concern with regard to waste is he satisfied that the hazardous waste inspectorate not the pollution inspectorate is numerically and technically strong enough to deal with this increasing problem <e>", "<cs> i greatly admire the manner in which my noble friend has dealt with this part of our debate <e> <s> i am sorry that he did not follow my example by being less wearisome to the committee since we have dealt with the problem <e> <s> i do not propose to comment further <e> <s> i have made my observations as have other members of the committee <e> <s> they stand on the record and i press the amendment standing in my name <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may come in on this discussion although i certainly do not intend to be anecdotal <e> <s> i oppose the amendment of the noble lord lord winstanley <e> <s> i noticed when he was speaking that he said that what he wanted to do was to make available a simple magnifying lens <e> <s> i do not know how he will do that with this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that the amendment would allow ready-made spectacles of wide varieties of shapes sizes and distances off the nose and so on all of which have a bearing on seeing <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord asks me a direct question i can tell him that i have lost my spectacles on more than one occasion <e> <s> most <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be proper if i were to remind your lordships that i am a member of the public policy committee of the rac <e> <s> however having said that i think that your lordships will recall that long before i joined the committee i took an interest in such matters <e>", "<cs> my lords against the zealous background for change would my noble friend agree that small community shops selling essentially food are a benefit to the community generally and that the community would be greatly disadvantaged were the hours of trading of such shops on sundays reduced <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that the dvlc is a not very efficient tax-gathering machine <e> <s> perhaps it would be better for the crime prevention role to be returned to the police and for the remainder of it to be returned to the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the two videos and the literature made available by his department to trade associations chambers of commerce and so forth are most instructive and illuminating <e> <s> does he also agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate my noble friend on the way in which he has introduced the bill <e> <s> a bill whose title starts with the words road traffic always encourages us to think of its omissions because we should all like to see a variety of other matters included so seldom do we have an opportunity to consider a road traffic bill <e> <s> however i shall try to keep my remarks to the matters in hand <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i certainly did not refer to rat runs <e> <s> was speaking about the better utilisation of the road system and i leave it at that <e> <s> i do not believe that roadways are necessarily for playing in or for car parking <e> <s> they are part of the transportation system <e> <s> all i am looking for is the best utilisation of the roadways and the road networks <e>", "<cs> my lords with the notable exception of the noble lord lord williams of elvel who is to wind up for that side of the house and my noble friend the minister and excepting my noble friend lord broxbourne who has introduced this debate in such a gentle way at the end of the general list of speakers it is difficult to find some new aspect <e> <s> i do not have a new aspect <e> <s> i wish to underline one or two matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i concur with what my noble friend says <e> <s> i hope i did not give the impression that there should be no compensation <e> <s> i was suggesting that the compensation might come from a different area <e> <s> no one can guarantee at all times that x or y will happen <e> <s> certain failures may be compensatable others most certainly would not be <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may give some admittedly muted support to my friend lady gardner of parkes <e> <s> i say muted support because my amendment follows this one <e> <s> it is fair to agree with my noble friend that until some accident occurs many drivers do not realise that their eyesight has deteriorated to the point at which they are incapable of driving a motor vehicle <e> <s> in the past seven to years a number of studies have been undertaken which have established conclusively that that is so <e> <s> during the passage of another bill last year i referred to the mckean and edington report from southampton university on the incidence of glaucoma <e> <s> the survey was admittedly small but it showed that a large majority of people had not realised that they could not see to the left or the right which was the reason for their accident <e> <s> they were grateful that they were stopped from driving on medical advice or as more frequently happened as the result of advice from their friends or relatives <e> <s> they relieved themselves of the burden of making the voluntary decision to stop driving <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for his response although i have to confess to being very disappointed by it <e> <s> it is odd is it not that the medical commission on accident prevention has said that approximately per cent <e> <s> of drivers about million fail to meet what it believes to be the minimum eyesight requirement <e> <s> if one measures that against million convictions there seems to be some relationship <e>", "<cs> my name has been attached to the wrong amendment amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that is probably my fault <e> <s> however perhaps i may have a moment or two of the committees time <e> <s> we have to ensure that a training centre is reasonably available to everybody <e> <s> i find amendment no <e> <s> the most attractive <e> <s> fifteen miles is too arbitrary <e> <s> it may be right in some areas and not in others <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> should read that <e>", "<cs> not wishing to be repetitive i hope that my noble friend can give us a satisfactory answer <e> <s> we frequently find ourselves in difficulty over the words may and shall <e> <s> it seems to me that since this part of the bill is concerned with the greater safety of motor cycle riders their training and so on there should be an express duty on the secretary of state to do something rather than making it purely permissive as my reading of clause c leads me to believe <e>", "<cs> i had anticipated that amendments nos <e> <s> and would be grouped together and i should like to speak to both <e> <s> on reflection i can see no reason why we should not deal <e>", "<cs> what my noble friend lord strathcarron says may be true or it may not that is something of a hostage to fortune <e> <s> i should like to ask my noble friend the minister why the subsection is in the bill at all <e> <s> it seems to be totally contrary to the governments general philosophy that market forces should prevail <e>", "<cs> i think i understand the purpose of the noble lord lord underhill in moving this amendment <e> <s> i do not wish to criticise my noble friend the minister on this point and it is a little difficult to relate what the noble lord <e> <s> lord underhill seeks to do with the guidelines but like him i should prefer to see some parts of the guidelines incorporated in the bill before us <e> <s> i suspect that we shall come on to that at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i should like to say something before the noble lord decides what to do <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has described this as a probing amendment <e> <s> my questions were similar <e> <s> as one reads the bill it appears that there can be one scheme by operator x and another by operator y the autoguide guidelines insist on compatibility in adjoining areas whereas the bill is continually referring to the same area <e> <s> i could not quite follow that point <e> <s> i shall be glad to hear the minister on the subject <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord underhill will not he surprised that i seek to influence the committee in opposing this amendment <e> <s> in fact i gave notice of this during second reading <e> <s> i do not believe that it is practical to impose the kind of conditions which the amendment seeks to do <e> <s> if we are to take full <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his explanation which i accept <e> <s> however i should like to take up one point <e> <s> it is conceivable and those were the words used by my noble friend that in the future having expended some or million on developing a system an operator comes to the secretary of state and says now we have been through the monitoring process i have done all you wanted <e> <s> it has come out right <e> <s> can i have my -year licence <e> <s> oh yes says the secretary of state but technological advances have been such and such and such and so i think i shall have to impose that which the law allows me to namely a certain restriction on charge <e> <s> when one has expended some or million and one has to get a return one will not start to argue about a few pounds licence money or royalties or whatever it may be <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to my noble friend the minister and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in this group of amendments the noble lord raises an issue that is probably dear to the hearts of members of the committee it is the question of privacy and the invasion of privacy <e> <s> when speaking about this series of amendments he has been speaking about tracking <e> <s> the amendments ask for the protection of autoguide <e> <s> i take the noble lords point that we are talking about driver information systems loosely called autoguide at this time and access by the secretary of state <e> <s> obviously we are not talking about a particular individual but rather about a government office of state <e>", "<cs> i do not find that reassuringto be honest i want to take legal advice on the matter <e> <s> i think i shall want to come back to amendment no <e> <s> later although i have some sympathy with the ministers answer <e> <s> however in amendment no <e> <s> we are dealing with something rather different because we have moved a little bit away from the details of the licence and we are in the area of the secretary of state mating payments in respect of the furnishing of information by virtue of that which is gathered by a licence-holder <e>", "<cs> i wanted to raise one issue on clause and i apologise to my noble friend for not having given him notice of my intention <e> <s> however i only discovered it late this afternoon and i shall be quite happy if he wishes to let me know later his feelings on the matter that i wish to raise <e>", "<cs> for some obscure reason i see that the noble lord opposite and i have put down amendments couched in precisely the same terms <e> <s> i do not dissent from anything that the noble lord lord carmichael said <e> <s> however i would add two points <e> <s> first without the amendment the clause that we are discussing specifically excludes existing road furniture <e> <s> that seems to me quite ridiculous <e> <s> a licence holder would then seek permission as necessary to stick up his own piece of furniture <e> <s> that is absolute nonsense when the existing furniture can be used <e> <s> that is where i believe the highway authority should come in <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that having given due parliamentary and other considerations to the competing claims it is best for us now to get on and take some further step toward the completion of the strategic network of roads which are to the commercial and general benefit of the nation <e>", "<cs> my lords when my noble friend the minister spoke earlier he expressed the hope which i think he knew would not be realised that your lordships would come to some kind of consensus on this matter <e> <s> so far the only consensus that has been shown to exist is the anomalous situation on sunday trading that cannot continue for very much longer <e> <s> whether that is on the grounds that my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter so expressly put in his remarks on the law and order front or for any other reason is what the debate is all about although i must say that i subscribe to the view that he then expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i prefaced my remarks by saying that i was returning to the subject of eyesight testing <e> <s> i am referring to the conditions which were described by my noble friend the minister as having to pertain in the future to professional and vocational drivers <e> <s> those conditions specify that at the age of they should undergo a medical examination <e> <s> at age they would have to undergo another test and at they would have to undergo a further test <e> <s> each year thereafter they would have to satisfy the requirements as to medical fitness which presumably includes ears and eyes that may be laid down in regulations <e> <s> those are the conditions to which i refer in my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords who have taken part in this short debate <e> <s> i apologise to the house for the imperfections of my amendment which sought to highlight the desirability for further research <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to give some general support to the idea behind the amendment <e> <s> when we discussed these matters before it disturbed me that it was not the governments intention to have a register of teachers or trainers that no standard was to be set and that therefore there was to be no overriding control <e> <s> the standard of the proprietor of a school or training establishment affects precisely how the examiner ultimately views the pupil <e> <s> i can see some areas of conflict arising <e> <s> this kind of situation arose in regard to car driving instruction before the introduction of the adi system which brought some uniformity to training standards and improved the element of driver training that is training to be a teacher <e> <s> this seems to be entirely missing in the current arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords i too shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> to and no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am not sure why amendment no <e> <s> has been left out of the group <e> <s> i suppose that i shall find out in due course if i contain my impatience <e> <s> although i have not heard the argument on amendment no <e> <s> my remarks will apply to that amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for explaining the provision <e> <s> however he will recognise that my objection to the previous group of amendments applies equally well here <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend who read the fear i expressed at committee stage quite correctly <e> <s> so far <e> <s> as i am <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for writing to me to set out the position <e> <s> i tabled these amendments as a result of that letter because i was not happy about it <e> <s> my unhappiness concerns solely the word determine <e> <s> of course any agreement has to be freely entered into and the terms have to be negotiated <e> <s> from what my noble friend wrote in his letter and from what he has said today i assume that determine can also embrace negotiate or agree and that i should not therefore take it purely and simply on its own account <e>", "<cs> i do not want to dissent from anything that the noble lords lord mishcon and lord lloyd of kilgerran have said <e> <s> quite properly the secretary of state has certain powers in this clause and he can do exactly as the noble lord lord mishcon said that is be less forthcoming next time if the outside regulatory authority breaches the confidence that such an exchange ofinformation would normally bring about <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord mishcon decides exactly what he will do perhaps i may add something <e> <s> i understand what the secretary of state has said with regard to the memorandum of understanding that obtained by virtue of bilateral arrangements in particular with the sec <e> <s> my worry is when no such memorandum of understanding exists <e> <s> i am sorry if i repeat the point of the noble lord lord mishcon he used different words <e> <s> i certainly wish to underline it <e> <s> where no such memorandum of understanding exists because there is no bilateral or any other arrangement the responsibility falls on the secretary of state to make a judgment <e> <s> i am not suggesting that he is unable to make such a judgment <e> <s> i am seeking to ensure that he has the power to support that judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords i greatly admire the persistence of the noble viscount lord hanworth in this subject area but i have a feeling of <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend lady gardner of parkes will not think me ungallant if i say to her that i am sorry that she has introduced this bill into your lordships house <e> <s> she described it as a mixture <e> <s> frankly i describe it as an unsavoury collation of cold and unappetising measures of bureaucratic proportions which frustrate most peoples aspirations and to a great extent business <e> <s> she said that the bill was designed in part to deal with certain happenings <e> <s> but she did not go too far into what those happenings were <e>", "<cs> that is safer <e>", "<cs> on the ground <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene since i have my name down to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i have listened very carefully and i was rather heartened by the response of the minister to the earlier amendment of the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e> <s> one was much encouraged by what he said then <e> <s> however in nearly everything else that he has said he has drawn further backwards <e> <s> that is the impression i received <e> <s> if one is to look at matters sympathetically one does not say that there is a resource implication <e> <s> we must try to find a solution to something which arouses fairly strong feelings <e>", "<cs> i rise to support my noble friend lord peyton of yeovil on the grounds which he put forward <e> <s> however i think that there is an additional one <e> <s> over the past four or five years the government have quite properly been looking at and amending the insolvency acts the companies acts and the financial services act which has to a certain extent thrown the marketplace into an expensive confusion <e>", "<cs> that is why i want it changed <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend lord jenkin and the noble lord lord williams will forgive me if i do not address my remarks specifically to the amendments <e> <s> they appear to me to have been overshadowed by the governments consultative document which i welcome <e>", "<cs> i was referring to members of your lordships house wherever they sit and that is so <e> <s> however that does not mean to say that the principle with which we were then dealing was wrong <e> <s> i do not believe that it was nor do i believe that the intentions of the government were wrong <e> <s> however i believe that the adjustment which must now be made was inevitable <e> <s> it is purely and simply because of the unforeseen costs and complexity <e> <s> more particularly i believe that it is due to the complexity of the financial services market <e> <s> the new opportunities which have been given have induced further complexities <e> <s> i believe that the consultative document reflects consideration of the anxieties that have been growing <e> <s> the bill provides the opportunity to put such reflections into the law <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy for the view of the noble lord lord williams with regard to the status of the sib in five or years time <e> <s> however i cannot believe that at this moment it <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend <e> <s> no doubt the working party will take note of the comments made in your lordships committee <e>", "<cs> when we were discussing an earlier amendment i indicated that i thought that this amendment on principles was somehow linked <e> <s> i am glad that the noble lord lord williams described the amendment as a probing amendment <e> <s> i wonder whether against that background i might make a few comments for the committee primarily to enable the government to give further consideration not only to the discussion document but to the questions that inevitably arise when a new section is inserted into a bill <e>", "<cs> a natural person is the investor however he goes about it <e> <s> whether he allows his investment to be discharged by others is a different argument and one which i do not propose to be drawn into by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> let us suppose that the professional

house how many old-age pensioners who may be able to take advantage of this arrangement do in fact have financial advisers <e> <s> does he not think that it would be more helpful to them if guidance were available through leaflets published by the department <e>", "<cs> my lords the motion of my noble friend lord brougham and vaux reminds us that certain parts of the north report have already been implemented and the changes that we discussed some months ago came before us on <e>", "<cs> my lords while i do not have any of the agricultural legal or financial expertise that the noble baroness lady robson described her committee as having nevertheless i enjoyed working under her chairmanship on that committee <e> <s> i would describe myself as a commercial man and as time went on i became increasingly frustrated at what i saw to be a general lack of concern over what is now -plus years of the existence of the community which arrives here in with the cheating of these very substantial sums of money from its funds <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord montagu of beaulieu for the manner in which he put forward the claims of the southampton city council in respect of the bill <e> <s> were it not for the conventions of your lordships house i should have tabled a six-months motion or a notice of rejection of the bill on the grounds which i shall later describe <e> <s> however i abide by the conventions of your lordships house and expect that the select committee to which the bill will be committed will give due consideration not only to the petitions to which i shall refer but to this short debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for allowing me to intervene <e> <s> i am not quite sure what he meant when he said that the costs would be passed on to me and my business friends <e> <s> i said that i have no business interests in southampton <e> <s> the inference that i draw from what he said is not totally fair <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to get involved here <e> <s> however my noble friend lord mottistone is now suggesting that there is some nannying involved in the amendment <e> <s> since by statute we have set up both the office of fair trading and the commission it seems to me that it should be charged with all relevant responsibilities <e> <s> in the light of changed circumstances over the past few years i believe that those responsibilities should be considered <e> <s> this amendment seeks to look at them again <e> <s> in the complexity of company share movements today with mergers of subsidiaries by other foreign-owned companies there would be many notably employees who would not necessarily be aware of the direction in which the company might be moving or more certainly might not have the ability to raise the questions with which an office would be charged were the amendment accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend the secretary of state most

lords just about a year ago at the european council the heads of government stated <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove for his contribution in this short debate which if nothing else has drawn some attention to the fact that there are surpluses in some areas and that there are shortages of car parking spaces whether on street or off street <e> <s> that leads in part to the congestion on our roads <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend the minister for his explanation <e> <s> i have to accept that responsible local authorities should use the moneys

the road and rail issue which i should like to pose to my noble friend the minister <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether we can get back to the point at issue <e> <s> i think that my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls has quite enjoyed himself perhaps at the expense of other noble lords and perhaps at his own expense <e> <s> i do not want to discuss why the dock labour scheme came into being we have

southampton as an example it has been frustrated in its full development <e> <s> employers whether engaged in cold storage in other motor-orientated activities have found that even in a free port things have not worked properly because they have not had the opportunity to bring in their own labour and their own work practices <e> <s> all that this whole series of amendments seems to do is to tack on a little bits and pieces to delay the abolition of the dock labour scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder why the noble lord lord mellish continues the same old argument <e> <s> i do not believe for a moment that the modern dock industry highly technical as it now is is vastly different from a number of other industries notably the construction industry and perhaps the mining industry <e> <s>

amendment seeks to put in place something else <e> <s> every amendment attempts to build a platform from which something can be salvaged from the old scheme <e> <s> that is what all this is about and nothing else <e> <s> it does not advance the new era of the dock industry <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may have a moment or two of your lordships time largely to assure the noble lord lord mellish that some of us on these benches have had business in and around the docks <e> <s> my knowledge goes back to when i came out of the army and went to work in southampton leaving there in <e> <s> the effect in the latter years on southampton docks has been a lack of exploitation through the dock labour scheme <e> <s> i was involved in transport overseas trucking cold storage warehousing and so forth <e> <s> there is no doubt that the scheme greatly prevented a number of commercial companies from coming into the docks where there is now virtually a wasteland <e> <s> the abolition of the dock scheme will undoubtedly given commercial companies in many different sectors further opportunities to enhance their business and indeed the dock and port industries <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i

anything he said <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for his support <e> <s> he underlines the thinking that lies behind this amendment we are not promoting the maintenance of some advertising medium we are trying to ensure that the service provided by three motoring organisations is maintained <e> <s> it is a question of maintenance because when the london <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend finishes he might appreciate it if i made it clear that in giving its reason for making a charge as damage to its street furniture the london borough council failed to point out that the aa and the rac contracts with local authorities expressly indemnify the local authorities against any damage to the furniture persons or anything else <e> <s> the reason given was a feeble one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend and i am sure that the house is grateful also for this decision <e> <s> i noted carefully and i have little doubt that my noble friend lord errol also noted carefully the governments general view on signing and the expectation they have <e> <s> i feel sure that the motoring organisations concerned will tomorrow read in <e>", "<cs> my lords in enforcing the present law such as my noble friend emphasised does he not agree that there are already three specific provisions within the road traffic acts which allow police to stop suspect motorists <e> <s> do not the execution of those powers provide an adequacy of enforcement <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to follow the noble lord lord mulley but he will forgive me if i do not agree with quite a lot of what he said <e> <s> i start by underlining what the noble lord lord shepherd said in his glowing tribute to the staffing of your lordships committee <e> <s> however i think it right that as a member of that committee i should pay an equally glowing tribute to the noble lord lord shepherd for the guidance and general manner in which he allowed us to conduct the inquiry <e> <s> essentially the inquiry was to look at and <e>", "<cs> my lords i had intended to speak quite briefly but certainly i wish to endorse what my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter has said <e> <s> i do not wish to play with words but it always seemed to me and still does that the anomaly rests not necessarily with the salary but more with the expenses that junior ministers have to cope with <e> <s> i am talking of course about the london allowance <e> <s> it is monstrous that junior ministers in your lordships house are deemed to live in london <e> <s> if one looks at the list over the past years or so one finds that they do not live in london <e> <s> they have to take up a residence or an establishment of some kind and incur an expense which has to come out of taxed income <e> <s> the taxed income in terms of the remuneration is not all that generous as my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter said <e>", "<cs> my lords i give a general welcome to the statement which my noble friend repeated to your lordships <e> <s> let me say at the outset that it is a limited statement <e> <s> it is the expression of a new initiative <e> <s> i believe that that is what we have been looking for particularly in terms of road congestion in london <e> <s> that is to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his warm remarks in introducing <e>", "<cs> since amendment no <e> <s> in the name of my noble friend lord mottistone and myself is grouped together with and covers the same subject area as all those in the name of the noble lord lord monson it seems sensible to discuss them together <e>", "<cs> i am sure that my noble friend lady gardner of parkes will forgive me if i say that i do not wish to become involved in what she sees as a shortfall in clause nor do i wish to confuse the committee because i believe that her point is not associated with my amendment but is a clause stand part point <e>", "<cs> i suggest that the noble baroness lady phillips has just contradicted herself <e> <s> a policeman may take a certain course of action against a criminal who is carrying an imitation gun because he had no reason to suppose that it was not a live firearm <e> <s> that is precisely the same as i am suggesting <e>", "<cs> as i do not think i am going to get any further with this matter i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to suggest to the committee that this amendment is neither necessary nor desirable <e> <s> i would not normally accuse the noble lord lord tordoff of naivet <e> <s> however on this occasion he has displayed a remarkable example of that quality <e> <s> the fact is that the entry upon a register of any notice is in itself sufficient to attract adverse press attention <e> <s> moreover the successful appeal against such a notice is not reported that is not the way the press operates <e> <s> therefore it would bear harshly and unfairly upon the person concerned <e>", "<cs> i do not find the ministers answer very helpful to those unfortunate people who may have a notice put upon them for some minor or major infringement <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the ministers remarks about a government amendment <e> <s> however any such amendment would deal only with one aspect of the matter <e> <s> that is one of the reasons for tabling the amendment <e> <s> it deals with those circumstances where pending an appeal the receiver of a notice would not be guilty of an offence if the improvement whether it involved building or equipment were not in place at the time specified in the original notice <e> <s> nevertheless the nature of a notice may well inhibit a business and a proprietor so causing monetary damage for which if an appeal were successful he should be compensated <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my noble friend mentioned the point about insurance against loss of profits <e> <s> it was also mentioned by my noble friend lord stanley of alderley when we discussed an earlier amendment <e> <s> he said that insurance in those circumstances is nearly impossible <e> <s> it is true that you can certainly insure almost anything at some kind of rate and a loss of profits insurance is not overly difficult to obtain <e> <s> however a loss of profits insurance that involves an action by a proprietor would almost certainly make void his loss of profits claim <e>", "<cs> my noble friend mentioned the bill <e>", "<cs> i am obviously grateful for the advice that i have received from my noble friend <e> <s> as i suspect she knows the point is that there is a subtle difference in wording <e> <s> the act deals with a person who sells food which is not of the nature or of the substance or of the quality required <e> <s> thus a prosecutor under the act must specify which of the three categories is applicable <e> <s> in this bill there does not seem to be that necessity <e> <s> that is the purpose of these two amendments <e> <s> however i take heart from what my noble friend said a few moments ago and i look forward with eager anticipation to her response to this amendment <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> with that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for her explanation which i understand in part <e> <s> not having to hand the relevant sections of the treaty of rome it is rather difficult to reconcile what she says so i must look at that <e>", "<cs> knowing the noble baroness as long as i have done i certainly detect an ironness in her remarks <e> <s> i should not expect her this evening to change her mind <e> <s> i shall think about what she said and i ask her to be kind enough to think about what i said <e> <s> i may or may not wish to return to this matter on another occasion <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for reminding me of that <e> <s> i had that point written down but i failed to read it out <e> <s> the minister is quite correct <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for her explanation <e> <s> does her answer apply to a tin of carrots <e> <s> that is a purely rhetorical question <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend <e> <s> i have in mind matters such as vat records <e> <s> where we are attempting to protect one agency against the incursion of another agency it would be quite wrong to give a food enforcement officer powers to examine the vat records or other matters which are confidential between the business and customs and excise and have nothing to do with the matters dealt with in the bill <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend the minister will give sympathetic consideration to the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for her explanation <e> <s> i am of course somewhat amused that she calls in aid the act when it suits her but when it suits me she feels that it is not appropriate <e> <s> however that is the way matters go and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend the minister for her explanation <e> <s> perhaps i may just say to my noble friend lord mottistone that i am grateful to him for his support <e> <s> it is late <e> <s> i think i have taken in what the minister had to say namely that the enforcement officer has to make his application for the order within three days and that he has to give one days notice <e> <s> nevertheless an immense amount of damage can be done to the business in that time <e> <s> it is exactly that problem particularly with a small business that worries me <e>", "<cs> were it a different time i should be happy to debate the matter further <e> <s> however at this time of night i am left with no option but to withdraw my amendment <e> <s> i do not find my noble friends answer satisfactory <e> <s> i am not looking for a comprehensive code i said a general code <e> <s> that is not beyond the wit of man or woman <e> <s> it is certainly not beyond the wit of officials because there are sufficient codes of practice from which something can be drawn <e> <s> if it is proper to draw up a code with regard to the number of inspections or visits carried out under various and different categories it is not beyond the wit of man to draw up a general code to set a general interpretation <e>", "<cs> perhaps before my noble friend answers i may intervene <e> <s> i had intended to raise a similar point in relation to paragraph because training is uppermost in our minds in a number of areas <e> <s> there is no indication of whether the training is to be industry led whether the industry is to set the standards or curricula or whether there is to be a government-inspired programme <e>", "<cs> my lords in the short time that i have at my disposal i should like to concentrate primarily on four principles and none of the detail contained in the discussion document <e> <s> i give a general welcome albeit somewhat guarded to the document <e> <s> i said when my noble friend the minister repeated the statement on th december that there was a general welcome for it <e> <s> whatever one may think about red routes or through routes in a certain measure they will take some of the traffic away from crucial areas <e> <s> that is not the point of what is before us because in the discussion document the department talks about the change since <e> <s> in fact the change has been occuring since about <e> <s> successive governments have failed to recognise the importance of traffic and transportation for the countrys general economy hence they have always put it near the bottom of their investment list <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that your lordships will be grateful to the noble lord lord ezra for introducing this bill and for explaining to us how he sees its operation <e> <s> equally i am quite sure that you will be grateful to him for highlighting three particular areas of great concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for her kindness <e> <s> the trading standards officer has power but this applies after the purchase takes place <e> <s> i am sure that she would not disagree with that fact <e> <s> however the bill introduces the involvement of trading standards officers at an earlier stage in the proceedings <e> <s> therefore she is quite wrong to say that trading standards officers are unable to exercise authority in the matter of used motor cars <e> <s> in fact they can do so and they do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i wonder what else she perhaps has to tell us <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for the explanation which frankly i have to reject i must point out that i am not making a plea for special treatment <e> <s> i am not concerned one little jot about traffic offences <e> <s> we are not talking about traffic offences but about food safety and the prosecution of those who may or may not offend against the legislation currently before your lordships <e> <s> it is not at all a question of speeding up anything <e> <s> the amendment is giving some justice repeated in the weights and measures act to a potential offender <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for the outcome of the undertaking she gave at an earlier stage to consider the matter and for putting down these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is rather unkind because in committee and earlier today my noble friend the minister has satisfied me on a number of points which have been raised <e> <s> on this occasion she reassures me but she does not totally satisfy me because the provision gives enormous scope some of which she has outlined <e> <s> i am however a little reassured by the words ministers may make regulations <e> <s> presumably they will come before both houses of parliament so that if we feel that the scope is being <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the contribution made by the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> he underlined the fact that there is a serious matter under consideration here <e> <s> i am also grateful to my noble friend the minister for what she said <e> <s> of course i shall respond to her invitation to provide chapter and verse of those cases which have been brought to my attention where i believe it would have been more helpful had a more prompt response been made by the trading standards officers or others <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the st year that the national association of citizens advice bureaux has been in existence <e> <s> it is timely i am grateful to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs to have a short debate <e> <s> it is as it were a run around the houses to see how the bureaux are getting on <e> <s> i am sorry that the tenor of our discussion so far seems to have concentrated more on current social conditions than on the work of the cabs <e> <s> the few remarks that i want to make will be about the cabs and not about the other conditions which obtain which of course give rise to the work of the bureaux <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord cocks will allow me to say so i found his speech particularly invigorating in that he drew for the first time from that side of the house meaningful comparisons <e> <s> he finished by suggesting a manner in which we might make matters a little better <e> <s> he said that perhaps we should stand back and look a little objectively at some of these problems <e> <s> in my view that is the major fault if there is one with the funds which the administration which i support on this side of the house make available <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lady gardner of parkes for her explanation of the bill for which she seeks a second reading tonight <e> <s> but i fear that she is under a number of misconceptions with regard to part ii <e> <s> i regret that i shall have to explain why i fear that <e> <s> it would also be fair although according to our conventions not strictly necessary for me to remind <e>", "<cs> if they are not paying it why was it necessary for my noble friend to say that they resent paying it <e> <s> they have given no indication of resenting payment for inspection of fire and other services <e> <s> what they resent and what is in the petition is that the bill in clauses and alters <e>", "<cs> since this matter impinges on later amendments i feel bound to support the noble lords lord carmichael and lord macaulay on the opposite benches <e> <s> i can well understand the objection of my noble friend lord brentford in principle <e> <s> however we are not talking now about the principle but about the equity <e> <s> it seems rather pointless that one should set down in law the inability of a person to buy liquor in one place whereas if he crosses the street he may buy it freely <e> <s> this seems to me basically wrong <e> <s> it holds no great substance <e> <s> the major objection to drinking on sunday has already been dealt with in the provisions that exist in scotland <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will excuse me i should say that i did not wish to consider amendment no <e> <s> a along with this amendment <e> <s> i believe that is my right and that it would be proper for the committee to deal with the matters raised in those two amendments separately and treat each of them on their merits <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to tread on the sensibilities of any scots people particularly <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for his further explanation <e> <s> the balance does not appear to be tipped in my favour <e>

two comments <e> <s> first it is not for me to answer for the benches opposite but it came quite clearly from the noble lord lord macaulay that he would in general support what my noble friend and i were proposing <e> <s> indeed he was given to express great concern over the element of violence that may obtain in the acquisition of liquor supplies in small stores which is a matter that the authorities would have to consider separately <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> i obviously did not express myself properly <e> <s> i intended to mean that it was not for me to answer why the members on the benches opposite took the view that they did <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e> <s> it is interesting that the bill has a history going back to and there is a common thread from that time up to the present <e> <s> your lordships will probably recall that a building was erected in hyde park in on the occasion of the great exhibition <e> <s>

which i readily concede are of great importance <e> <s> before i respond to some of the points perhaps i may thank the noble lord the chairman of committees for his guidance about the way in which the bill will develop provided that noble lords give it a second reading tonight about which i am quite optimistic <e>", "<cs> my lords an exhibition and conference centre can provide for seminars lectures and artistic displays whether they be of painted works poetry readings or anything else <e> <s> i should have thought that would come into an educational context in todays usage <e>", "<cs> my lords my honourable friend the member for beckenham who promoted the bill in the other place has talked with me as have officials of bromley borough council <e> <s> they envisage that some million will be spent if parliament passes the bill and the various planning requirements are met <e> <s> that kind of money will be <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend the minister for giving a timetable as regards what the government intend to do on the matter of enforcement elements <e> <s> frankly that is the <e>", "<cs> i did not move the two previous amendments because in re-framing the clause the noble lord lord ezra has perhaps removed some of the most objectionable parts of the bill as it then stood <e> <s> nevertheless i am not happy on a number of grounds with the new clause that he proposes <e>", "<cs> i am certainly sympathetic to the calls that the noble lord lord ezra and the noble lord lord mason of barnsley make <e> <s> both of them have totally misdirected their attention <e> <s> the new clause that is suggested by the noble lord lord ezra is a catch-all catch-none clause <e> <s> it is badly drafted <e> <s> for example it states <e>", "<cs> the committee will agree that we have covered most of the elements contained in the bill <e> <s> i suspect that members will wish to deal with more pressing and urgent business this evening <e> <s> therefore it would not be helpful if i embarked on the reasons why i do not like clause <e> <s> indeed neither do i like clauses or <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his full explanation of this group of amendments <e> <s> he reminded the house that in april my noble and learned friend the lord advocate promised to consider the views then put forward <e> <s> the outcome of that consideration is this series of amendments <e> <s> it meets the proper needs and concerns of the retail trade and the consumers <e> <s> at the same time it does not abandon the control of the sale of liquor and alcohol to under-aged persons <e> <s> were that not the case the amendments would not commend themselves to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord dunleath tempts me into discussing with him the emissions of diesel and other engines and the use of leaded and unleaded petrol <e> <s> we may debate that as we proceed through the various stages of the bill <e> <s> however i shall resist that temptation this afternoon save to say to him that the motor and oil industries have taken on board over recent years much of what he said and have been driven to some extent by the european commission directive on fuel emissions <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord mcintosh and indeed to members of the committee for agreeing to deal separately with amendment no <e> <s> which is tabled in my name and amendment no <e> <s> tabled in the name of the noble lord lord nathan <e> <s> i think that they are slightly different <e> <s> the noble lord suggested through a number of amendments that we ought to define as closely as we can those matters to which this part of the bill applies <e> <s> i have no quarrel in that respect <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord lord nathan will forgive me <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mcintosh and my noble friend on the front bench have agreed to take amendment no <e> <s> separately i shall not comment on amendment no <e> <s> tabled by the noble lord lord nathan until we have dispensed with the rest of the amendments in the group <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has given a number of explanations <e> <s> however he may recall that i did not define either quantity or concentration <e> <s> i merely drew attention to those factors largely for the sake of consistency <e> <s> whether or not the government could live with the words <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend lord crickhowell is right the minister must be wrong because the minister says that we cannot tinker with the definition as set down in the earlier amendments in part i of the bill because it would leave a loophole were we to embrace the definitions in the later parts of the bill to which both the noble lord lord nathan and i have referred <e> <s> my noble friend then says but we can cover up that deficiency by utilising the powers under clause that is the regulatory powers <e> <s> it seems to me that if we have the powers to determine the various concentrates quantities and qualities in clause we might just as well have precisely the same pattern in part i of the bill in defining pollution as i suggested earlier <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend will explain a little more slowly what he has just said about the same definition in both parts of the bill <e> <s> i am sure that that is what he said <e> <s> perhaps he will explain to the committee why that argument is good enough for this amendment but was insufficient for previous amendments <e>", "<cs> i understood that the noble lord lord addington had agreed that we should take amendments nos <e> <s> and together because they have a similarity <e> <s> in fact i should like to speak to my amendment no <e> <s> in slightly more general terms but not in any way deviating from the principle

sense of it was not lost on the noble lord lord clinton-davis <e> <s> in response my noble friend said that there will be consultation under this clause <e> <s> the noble lord lord clinton-davis referred to section of the control of pollution act <e> <s> will my noble friend consult under the provisions of that section of that act or only under this clause <e> <s> he has not made that clear <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether the committee wants to engage in the attempt of the noble lord lord mcintosh to have a debate on transport policy <e> <s> if it does then i shall join in but i would rather address my remarks to the noble lord lord clinton-davis <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may detain the committee for a moment <e> <s> i was proposing to attempt to establish that there was to be a provision in the bill to create a clear lead body in the arrangements for the integrated pollution control <e> <s> to a large extent that will depend on the understanding and the understandings of the authorities involved <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his explanation <e> <s> i shall have something to say about clauses and in a few moments <e> <s> the point that he made about clause i had not recognised <e> <s> i still feel that there is good reason for compensation provisions to be made <e> <s> however in view of what the minister has said i wish to have a careful look at

amendment this morning but perhaps i may make one or two comments <e> <s> of course the committee will agree with my noble friend that the speed at which enforcement can be executed is important <e>

true <e> <s> they do share that view <e> <s> it is something which they would not wish were it not for the actions taken in recent years which have circumvented the law which has been in place and has given rise to the situation that other laws have to be put in place to give a balance to precisely the argument to which the noble baroness refers <e>", "<cs> before the minister responds can the noble lord lord wedderburn explain to the committee how those people they may be called branch secretaries or branch treasurers who may not be empowered under the terms in the rule book may be separately identified by the membership as not being officials and therefore unable to call an action <e> <s> i should have thought that anybody of a particular standing within the organisation would be thought of by rank and file membership of a trade union or any other organisation as having authority to perform a certain action <e> <s> whether at a later stage a trade union can repudiate that action because of what is in the rule book seems somewhat immaterial <e> <s> i cannot understand that argument <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness lady turner of camden for explaining the position <e> <s> however she is quite wrong <e> <s> the amendment does exactly the opposite to what she said <e> <s> i ask the committee to consider what my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter had to say about best endeavours and reasonable practice when we debated amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> similar arguments obtain on this amendment <e> <s> as i read the bill subsection requires that the union shall do its best <e> <s> the words are <e>", "<cs> i meant no discourtesy to the noble lord by my humorous interjection when he was describing the purpose of the amendment <e> <s> i just found it extraordinarily humorous that in moving her amendment no <e> <s> the noble baroness lady turner objected to the provisions in the bill for repudiation as soon as reasonably practicable for a wide variety of reasons calling the lay members having weekend meetings and so on <e> <s> then in moving amendment no <e> <s> the noble lord lord mccarthy wanted to insert the requirement that the union shall do what is reasonably practicable <e> <s> that seems to be a contradiction in terms <e> <s> he then added one or two small details of who and how <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for her response <e> <s> as she said it was indeed complex <e> <s> like the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey i think that one would wish to have a further look at the matter to try to slot into place the various points she made especially as regards which of the authorities is in the pole position <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey mentioned my name perhaps i may say a few words on the matter <e> <s> in my view he is somewhat confusing secrecy and confidentiality <e> <s> i say that because to claim commercial confidentiality the information will have to be divulged to a body which will determine whether it falls within that category <e> <s> if it does not then the information is open and will appear on a register <e> <s> however if the information is deemed to be commercially confidential then it is known only to a number of people <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may return to amendment no <e> <s> which i broadly welcome <e> <s> it is clear that the government set great store by the voluntary arrangements <e> <s> it makes good sense to come to those arrangements because resources both of people and finance are not limitless <e> <s> at the conference to which my noble friend lord jenkin of roding referred which i attended anxiety was expressed about the guidance <e> <s> the anxiety was not in terms of whether the department had the resources to produce the guidance but whether it would be available in time for the various parties to take account of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friends lord jenkin of roding and lord balfour for their contributions <e> <s> i said the matter was complex and i still think it is complex <e> <s> i do not believe that a chinese wall can be erected in scotland separating one function from another <e> <s> i do not believe that the private sector may not in the short term be interested in carrying out the activities which clause appears to reserve to local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i readily accede to my noble friends invitation <e> <s> as a result of discussion and correspondence during the summer recess the noble baroness intimated that she would put down amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i thank her for her letter <e> <s> as a result i did not pursue the argument or indeed the amendments on this matter which i tabled at committee stage <e> <s> at that time i sought to give statutory backing to a set of voluntary guidelines <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not suggest that but the act does if they are found in certain places notwithstanding the great endeavours of that body to contain its trolleys <e> <s> the noble baronesss letter states that this year on year business will in fact prevent unreasonable charges being imposed <e>", "<cs> i thought that the noble lord would agree with that <e> <s> page of jowitts <e>", "<cs> my lords not minutes but perhaps three or four more <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcintosh may think it an abuse <e> <s> he has wound up some of his amendments at very great length without anybody challenging the abuse <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord balfour for his support and i am rather more grateful to my noble friend the minister for his acceptance of them <e> <s> i was glad to hear what he had to say about the cost implications and the technical competence of those employed in waste disposal activities within the local authority <e> <s> i am sure that that information will be broadcast widely <e> <s> i accept as he does that there is always a need to raise standards whether in the public or private sector <e> <s> the amendment will help to do that in scotland <e>"]
