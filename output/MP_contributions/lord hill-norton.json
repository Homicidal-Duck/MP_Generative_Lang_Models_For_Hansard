["<cs> my lords the excellent custom of your lordships house that maiden speeches should be short and unprovocative imposes severe constraints on one who is by nature a compulsive talker and enjoys controversy <e> <s> i will do my best to offend in neither respect this afternoon unlike mr canning whose maiden speech in another place in which was the first to be so described was lengthy and provocative <e> <s> if i offend in any other respects my lords i beg you to put it down to inexperience <e>", "<cs> my lords it is obviously impossible in a discussion on an unstarred question to deal adequately with such a huge subject as that opened up by the question so ably put by the noble earl lord kimberley and i hope your lordships will agree that a subject of such overriding national importance deserves at least a short debate early in the new year <e> <s> i hope further that when this occurs this particular issue will not be confused with the problem of long-range theatre nuclear forces which is of a quite different nature <e> <s> the barest bones of the subject we are discussing today are starkly simple it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he will agree that a golden opportunity for standardisation has thereby been lost <e> <s> would he also agree that the operational and logistic disadvantages which flow from that loss are serious <e> <s> would he further agree that it may not be wise when we and our allies face the same threat on precisely the same ground to accept these disadvantages simply because the leopard tank was not invented here <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> i found it alarming <e> <s> may i ask further whether in view of the fact that the russians are now building aircraft at a rate which would replace the front line of the whole royal air force every six months he regards what he has just said as an adequate deterrent in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> may i put it to him that as the numbers of our frigates and submarines in the royal navy have declined by no less than one-third in the last years it might be wise to seek to reinforce that strength as economically as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by saying that i found this years defence white paper from almost every point of view the best we have had for a long time <e> <s> but although it is a good deal more informative than at least its dozen predecessors it does still in my view despite what the noble lord the minister said at the outset err on the side of undue caution in various respects <e>", "<cs> my lords i should declare a personal interest in this matter and i think that i am the only one of your lordships here today who has this personal interest <e> <s> it is if i may say so and i am not making a speech a monstrous injustice which the noble lord the minister has tried to slough over by quoting a phenomenon called the overtaking phenomenon which applies to permanent civil servants but not to the officers who were previously the professional heads of their armed forces <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be kind enough to answer one or other of my questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i would much rather their lordships were informed as well as myself <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that a very large number of people in this country regard this statement as the best news for our country and for nato that we have had for a very long time <e> <s> does he further agree that the stationing of these weapons in this country will contrary to what is put about on various sides in no way increase the risk of nuclear attack on this country which is already very high indeed <e>", "<cs> may i add a few words in support of the noble earl lord selkirk <e> <s> i have no interest in building societies <e> <s> if it is necessary to declare any interest i may say that i am still on the active list of the royal navy <e> <s> i should like to say to the committee from my own long and indeed current experience that there is no question that anything which helps service people male or female to own houses is good news <e> <s> it is good news for them good news for the people running the services and therefore good news for the country <e> <s> it has been said although not said in this committee today that other people may have to move about young executives members of the foreign service and so on <e> <s> but i maintain that service people deserve <e>", "<cs> my lords as the first speaker today from the cross-benches may i say that i am sure that i speak for all my friends on these benches when i say how warmly we endorse the tributes just paid from the front benches to the late lord ballantrae <e> <s> for my own part and that of all my contemporaries in all three services we shall remember with admiration and affection the splendid soldier whom we knew as bernard fergusson <e> <s> he will be greatly missed not least in your lordships house to which he brought not only his military flair but great distinction in three other important fields which have been described today by other noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make two comments and ask two questions first associating myself with what has already been said in my pleasure at his advancement and my commiseration with the noble lord lord strathcona and mount royal <e> <s> my first comment is that it should be clearly understood i am sure the minister will confirm this if it needs confirming to your lordships that it is no good going on about the strategic arms limitation talks which have nothing whatever to do with this country they are bilateral talks between the united states and the soviet union <e> <s> we can help but we cannot either bring them forward or contribute to them <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount the minister agree that the reason why we have sold no warships abroad for something like years i think i am right in saying is that the capital costs of building them in this country grossly exceed the capital costs of building similar ships anywhere else in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount the minister for that unsatisfactory and incomplete reply <e> <s> might i ask the minister further what is now regarded as a reasonable minimum number of flying hours for front-line pilots in both the royal air force and the royal navy and secondly to what extent has our participation in both national and nato exercises been curtailed for the reasons given in my question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say how flattered i am that in hours i have moved up the scale of nobility from a viscount to an earl to reply to my question <e> <s> would the noble earl agree that the reply which he has given refers to what may take place in the future rather than answering my question which is what has taken place in the last months <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount agree with the figure published within the last month in a bow group pamphlet which states that on average week-on-week there are men absent from the rhine army in the united kingdom on courses at any one time <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put it to the noble viscount that the only reductions contained in that very long statement in the teeth arms available to the government were those to the royal navy <e> <s> they were savage reductions amounting in the first instance to about per cent <e> <s> of the surface fleet and as the answer to the noble lord lord kennet revealed within another two or three years another per cent <e> <s> making a total of something like per cent <e> <s> of the surface fleet <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be allowed to offer some views on the security aspects of the situation for i was personally responsible for it not very long ago and at first remove more recently than that <e> <s> in spite of the ministers exhortations at the beginning of this debate i perceive a very clear linkage between the security situation in the province and the political machinery both of today and in the future of which the order we are now debating forms an essential part <e> <s> it seems to me that what i am about to say does have some relevance to the order itself <e>", "<cs> my lords we are asked by the noble lord the lord president to take note of the white paper <e> <s> it would be difficult for me at least not to do so since it represents the second attempt by a tory government in the last years to destroy the royal navy <e> <s> it will not therefore surprise your lordships if i address most of my remarks today to what is now so foolishly proposed for the service whose uniform i have worn for more than years <e>", "<cs> my lords with the utmost respect to the noble lord the figure was produced by the secretary-general who is as well known to me as he is to the noble lord lord home of the hirsel because that was what he thought the nato market could bear <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount whether in his knowledge any country belonging to the warsaw pact has asked the soviet union to withdraw nuclear weapons from their territory <e> <s> secondly may i ask him whether there is a dual key arrangement so far as he is aware between the governments of the members of the warsaw pact and the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords i too must apologise in advance as did the noble lord lord buxton of alsa for the fact that an engagement at which i am presiding and which was arranged many months ago will i fear cause me to leave before the debate is over <e> <s> i shall not detain your lordships long and nor shall i except in passing deal with the economic aspects of the south-western atlantic now or in the future about which other noble lords are much better informed than i and have spoken wisely both today and on previous occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount whether or not it is true that all the sighting reports received by the ministry of defence before were destroyed because they were deemed to be of no interest <e> <s> and if it is true who was it who decided that they were of no interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble viscount whether he and his colleagues not only at the ministry of defence will take exceptional steps to make quite certain that the arguments produced in the statement by the defence secretary are widely disseminated throughout the country because they are <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount confirm to the house and if possible to the public that a great change has taken place in maritime warfare since it last took place to the extent that modern weapons are of very much longer range and very much shorter time of flight whether they be in or over the sea <e> <s> therefore any task force commander or any task unit commander cannot hang about while he evaluates a potential enemys intentions <e> <s> going with that will he confirm in view of the last question that the task force commanders tactical decision that the general belgrano was a threat to his force is warmly underwritten by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness the leader of the house <e> <s> i respect the ministers wishes not to become technical <e> <s> however there is one point of a technical nature about which i feel obliged to enquire of the minister <e> <s> can the noble viscount say and i am not seeking operational information which should not be disclosed whether decoys were used which should if used have seduced the exocet missile from its target <e> <s> may i ask him a question of a quite different nature <e> <s> in order to preserve a sense of proportion both in the public debate and in the debate in your lordships house and in another place will he confirm that the government weighed up the risks of ships being sunk and aircraft being shot down and these will not be the last <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that a large number of people outside your lordships house do not share the welcome given by the noble lord lord peart and others to the statement which has just been made <e> <s> and neither do i it is my judgment and that of many other people outside the house that too many such statements have been made <e> <s> i would ask the noble viscount if he would discuss with his right honourable friends whether perhaps we are not overdoing the amount of information we give and the amount of opportunity we give for words to be spoken which are deeply resented by those in the task force who have been given a military job to do and should be given the opportunity to carry it out without constant threats that their efforts may have proved in vain <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships would hardly expect me to agree with most of the views expressed by the noble and gallant lord lord carver <e> <s> i understand of course why he holds those views and why they are shared by all those generals who have been gallumping about in the correspondence columns of the newspapers <e> <s> well as the lady said in the high court they would wouldnt they <e> <s> they should instead seek to win by argument instead of by <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that this bill is fatally flawed in both purpose and substance <e> <s> as for the former the noble lord lord jenkins of putney and any other noble lords who may support the bill must know quite well that it has no chance whatever of reaching the statute book in this parliament <e> <s> indeed it must be my own earnest hope that it would also fail in any future parliament <e> <s> thus its purpose can only be to seek publicity and act as a propaganda vehicle for the rather small minority of our countrymen and i believe of your lordships house who support the mistaken notion of unilateral nuclear disarmament for britain <e> <s> for let there be no misunderstanding the passage of such a measure would be the first step down that slippery slope and it would be totally disastrous not only for the defence of our realm which must always be the first charge of her majestys government but for that successful deterrence of soviet aggression which not only lies at the very heart of the north atlantic alliance as the noble lords lord mayhew and lord kennet have just said but has kept the peace in europe for a generation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble viscount lord trenchard two or three questions on the statement <e> <s> not having seen the white paper i will not attempt to ask any questions about that <e> <s> three of my questions concern words which the noble viscount or his right honourable friend have used and one concerns an omission <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first apologise to the noble baroness and to the noble lord who is to wind up and to your lordships that i am unable to remain until the end of the debate because i have a long-standing speaking engagement contracted before the debate was fixed <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the authors of the paper on a well-written and interesting document <e> <s> i intend to confine myself rather strictly to it to what it actually says and which i regard as of equal importance to what it does not say <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the six former chiefs of the defence staff still living apart from the noble and gallant lord lord carver have all stated publicly and repeatedly that they warmly disagree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord the minister misunderstood my question <e> <s> the point i was trying to make was that the views of the noble and gallant lord lord carver which are so frequently prayed in aid by the noble lord lord jenkins are disagreed with by all the other former chiefs of the defence staff still alive <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be strange if i did not add my congratulations to those which have already been expressed on the impressive clear and forceful maiden speech made by the noble and gallant lord lord lewin and i do so with pleasure <e> <s> i had not <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to devote most of my time this afternoon and a short time it will be to the first part of the noble viscounts motion namely the present state of the shipping industry because it is in a parlous state which requires urgent and decisive action by the government if it is not to become irreversibly worse even terminal <e> <s> i should like to make one or two brief observations on the report of which your lordships are asked to take note <e>", "<cs> my lords the defence open government document which has given rise to this debate promises that there shall be and i quote <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i hope i may say and i am sure that your lordships will agree a kind word <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to congratulate the noble lord lord crawshaw on a really splendid maiden speech <e> <s> i am sure your lordships will agree that in content form and manner it could not have been better <e> <s> it was also after our exchanges on procedure mercifully brief <e> <s> your lordships may not be aware that the noble lord holds the world non-stop walking record and it is very kind of him today not to have competed for the non-stop talking record <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble and gallant friend lord lewin i must start by declaring two personal interests in the bill <e> <s> first i am retained as an occasional consultant to a p appledore which is a member of one of the consortia seeking the management contract of devonport dockyard although i doubt whether it will entirely welcome what i am about to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i must start by criticising as vigorously as i am able the usual channels which have arranged for our defence debate this year to revert to the entirely unsatisfactory practice of being confined to one day <e> <s> i have so informed both the noble viscount the leader of the house and the noble lord the leader of the opposition that i was about to do so <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am sorry <e> <s> i speak only once a year and i should like to continue <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i very much hope that the noble viscount the leader of the house will give the matter his personal attention before arrangements are made for the debate next year <e> <s> if the noble lord lord kennet has something to say now i shall give way <e>", "<cs> if i may continue my lords i have some points of substance to make on this years statement <e> <s> first i congratulate the ministers the editor and the authors on an extremely well-presented well-written and generally informative document <e> <s> it has been criticised in some knowledgeable quarters as being a bit glib and so i suppose it is in the sense that most of the really difficult problems before the government in the defence ministry are glossed over a bit easily not least of course the fact that defence spending is set to decline in real terms by per cent <e> <s> over the next three years <e> <s> it is that central decision by the government which has caused and given rise to the serious difficulties which face those who have to administer defence today which will certainly be exacerbated in the next few years and from which our general defence posture now suffers <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to devote the few minutes at my disposal this afternoon to the philosophy of the deterrent rather than to its nuts and bolts <e> <s> but i should like to preface my remarks by saying that the brilliant speech made by my noble and gallant friend lord lewin a fortnight ago which was delivered with all his personal authority and deep knowledge should have disposed of any doubts that <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the question quite misunderstands the arrangements of the royal navy and other navies declared to nato <e> <s> the united states chief of naval operations i am sure the noble lord would agree has nothing whatever to do with nato arrangements <e> <s> is he aware that the two supreme commanders concerned in nato are saclant and cinchan <e> <s> they obtain their instructions from the nato military committee <e> <s> there is no conceivable possibility of strategy being developed by any authority other than the nato military committee and endorsed by the nato council <e> <s> finally does he agree that even if the question were well advised it would be quite wrong to give the information requested <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may just intervene because he referred to me by name during his speech of which he kindly gave me notice <e> <s> may i say that in what he described as my extraordinary letter to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether it is proper to continue with this exchange but i must say that those are about the only four words which the noble lord has quoted correctly <e>", "<cs> my lords as we have come to expect the white paper is well written well produced and readable <e> <s> i found the several essays i believe there are more this year on various subjects particularly valuable <e> <s> i should like to make one suggestion for presentation to the minister of state and that is that the annexes which show the strengths of the three services would be more valuable if they included manpower figures as well <e> <s> i have never quite understood why they do not <e>", "<cs> my lords i found this years white paper and its predecessor well written well presented and clearly laid out <e> <s> i thought that the photographs were rather dull and hackneyed <e> <s> they are never very good <e> <s> it is a pity i always think i have said so in your lordships house before that other great departments of state are not put through the discipline of accounting for their stewardship once a year <e> <s> if they were i do not believe that any of them would do it better <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with other noble lords who have said that the pace of change recently has been such that the statement on the estimates which we are debating today is no longer very relevant even though it was published but a few months ago <e> <s> i do not intend to spend much time on the text although there are three matters in it to which i wish to refer <e>"]
