["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> may i put two further questions to him <e> <s> do the government recognise that such leaders as jomo kenyatta once stigmatised by the british government as a terrorist later became the acknowledged leaders of their nations <e> <s> furthermore do the government recognise that the present legislation being proposed by the united states will very likely be found to be unconstitutional by the supreme court <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think most people believe that either the cia or the police exist but so long as they do the time has come for britain and the rest of europe to fight for their lives and expel the cia <e> <s> britain should support the labour partys policy of unilateral disarmament and support for cnd in support of the prime minister of romanias suggestion to sir geoffrey howe that nato and the warsaw pact should be dissolved <e> <s> once out of nato britain would have no legal obligation to receive the cia on british shores <e> <s> fight for your lives britain and europe for the cia are planning to flood britain with heroin and destroy the younger generation in england as they have in america <e> <s> the cia have joined with the police forces of western europe to enslave the young and make money out of their suffering <e>", "<cs> my lords my main objection to this bill is that the spirit of it is wrong <e> <s> it will create a we-they atmosphere which will provoke civil discord as some labour spokesmen have been saying <e> <s> as long as the authorities have such wide power to take away liberties on all sides the condition of the british people will continue to deteriorate <e> <s> as a result of the extreme intolerance encouraged by the police the british people will develop an introverted instead of an extroverted personality <e>", "<cs> my lords somewhat unusually i must begin by declaring an interest not once but twice <e> <s> first i wish to declare an interest as an ilea parent who voted in the ballot <e> <s> i must confess that i listened with some strain on my patience to some of the things that were said about me and my fellow voters from the benches opposite <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may be forgiven for borrowing a phrase which has been used elsewhere <e> <s> i feel i rise as a lion in a den of daniels for i rise with rather more trepidation than i would wish to express the voice of the honest atheist <e> <s> i express it with some trepidation because these have been shown today to be dangerous waters for atheists <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment moved by the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> on second reading the cry of flexibility was coming from all quarters of the house <e> <s> the minister gave a hint that one might be pushing on a partially open door <e> <s> before i came into the house this morning it was made clear to me by some of my colleagues that they believed the amendment appeared to meet the cry for flexibility in a particularly suitable way <e> <s> my colleagues in universities are much concerned about what happens in schools as a result of a national curriculum <e> <s> the amendment achieves a certain amount of good in that it helps to meet the point made by my noble friend lord mcnair about the preservation of the classics it makes it possible to study more than one modern language and it makes it possible to study three serious sciences <e> <s> to many of my colleagues those points appear to be of some importance <e>", "<cs> i speak in support of both my noble friends lord ritchie and lord mcnair on the subject of testing <e> <s> these benches have not been objecting to testing as such <e> <s> we have been saying two things throughout these debates <e> <s> first we have been expressing our reservations about testing by the order of the secretary of state <e> <s> the secretary of states hoof is all over this bill <e> <s> we think that it should be viewed with some suspicion <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down perhaps i may find out whether i have understood her aright <e> <s> is she telling us that her intentions are honourable but that she does not yet know what they are <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words in favour of the amendment of the noble lord lord peston <e> <s> i speak personally on this issue because i have a son who is studying for the gcse <e> <s> one of the loudest snorts of contempt that i have ever heard him utter came when i quoted to him the recent observation of the secretary of state that the gcse was the best prepared examination in history <e> <s> it represents a very considerable burden of work <e> <s> the course work has proved to be much heavier than expected <e> <s> that does no harm <e> <s> if however i were to exert my parental influence and try to get my son at the same time to take seriously a large number of tests in other subjects in which he is not interested it might prove beyond my powers <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i listened to that reply with some misgivings <e> <s> the effect of the amendment moved by the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee would make it impossible for the secretary of state arbitrarily to abolish the examining of a subject <e>", "<cs> the discussion is about the powers of the secretary of state <e> <s> this has not been answered <e>", "<cs> i listened with considerable sympathy to the points made by the noble baroness lady cox <e> <s> they are matters of real concern and i have heard the story from colleagues many times <e> <s> however when i hear it from colleagues it is a little less exciting and little less black and white than i have heard tonight <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment of the noble baroness <e> <s> she seems to have raised a principle of great importance which goes right to the centre of this bill that is whether the secretary of state may confine himself to receiving advice when and as he so wishes <e> <s> that is something that executives have wished to achieve for themselves for very many centuries and which parliaments have tried to ensure that they do not achieve for almost as many centuries <e> <s> i believe that parliament should continue to do its job <e>", "<cs> my lords the task of ringing the house dinner bell seems to have fallen to me and i believe that there is a certain appropriateness about that because in these days when a conservative government use the word revolution with approval to describe their programme the mantle of edmund burke may well be said to have descended on this side of the house <e>", "<cs> i should like to answer a few of the remarks made by the noble lord lord trafford about professional arrogance <e> <s> i am aware of the danger <e> <s> it is a real one <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord underrates the determination of professionals to protect one another against this arrogance <e> <s> i should like to know from the noble lord whether the temptations of professional arrogance are ones from which the secretary of state is immune <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak to what i hope the noble baroness will forgive me for describing as the prefabricated amendment <e> <s> i speak to it with some feeling as coming from a college where many of the teachers are still in the temporary accommodation where they were placed for a few short months in <e> <s> i found the ministers reply wholly unsatisfactory and it seems to me to raise big questions which are central to a good many of the debates that we have had on this bill <e>", "<cs> it seems that my noble friend lord grimond and i without any concerted design have succeeded in impaling the government on the horns of a dilemma <e> <s> every argument that has been put forward against my amendment is an argument in favour of the amendment of my noble friend and every argument against the amendment of my noble friend is an argument in favour of mine <e>", "<cs> i should like to express my entire agreement with the noble lords lord swann and lord adrian and the noble earl lord halsbury <e> <s> they have spoken on behalf of a large and deeply <e>", "<cs> sadly i find it difficult to follow that reassurance <e> <s> for me the noble lord lord peston has spoken very clearly <e> <s> i agree that a dialogue is needed but on this occasion i find it hard to be convinced that one party controlling the terms and forms of the dialogue can entirely be trusted <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has spoken assuming a situation of trust to exist <e> <s> members on this side of the committee have been telling him all night that that situation no longer exists <e> <s> i wish to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am extremely sorry to hear the proper informing of parliament described as a time-wasting distraction <e> <s> with respect the noble and learned lord has not entirely taken on board the purport of the amendment <e> <s> it is not merely a matter of informing this chamber or another place of what individual decisions the ufc has taken <e> <s> it is not only a matter of ensuring that the accounts are open and above board <e>", "<cs> this is in some senses an exploratory motion <e> <s> on second reading i said that i was not at all clear why the government wished this clause to be in the bill <e> <s> i cannot say that i am any clearer now than i was then <e> <s> so far as i can see the ugc system as far as anything does these days was working reasonably well <e> <s> it seemed to be a case of the good old american maxim if it isnt broken dont fix it <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor sits down will he tell us that there are no other purposes in setting up the universities funding council <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for that assurance which i welcome <e> <s> i shall press the matter no further at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to present a petition from parents students governors head teachers principals and staff of schools colleges youth clubs and other institutions of the inner london education authority <e> <s> the petition prays that this house will seek a full review of provision of education in inner london before any alteration is made to the existing unitary arrangements <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> i am not by any means an uncritical admirer of edmund burke but i believe that some of the wisest things that he had to say in his reflections on the revolution in france were on the dangers of local government reorganisation <e> <s> it was in that context that he developed most effectively the case that one cannot effectively tear down a living institution and build it up again in a completely new form <e> <s> one has to let the institution grow and when it grows one has to pay attention to the form in which it has grown <e>", "<cs> it strikes me that we are today dealing with a kind of mini-bill <e> <s> in effect we had this afternoon a second reading debate which we concluded at about six oclock <e> <s> we have now begun a committee stage so to speak anew <e> <s> that illustrates how many measures are packed into this bill <e> <s> incidentally if this were in law a single bill as it is in fact it would be out of order to take the second reading and committee stage on the same day <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> c and d which are grouped together <e> <s> however before i do so perhaps i may respond to the gracious remarks made by the noble lord lord thomas of swynnerton <e> <s> i am particularly grateful for what he said about the uncontroversial character of my maiden speech <e> <s> that point caused me some anxiety <e> <s> the remarks which he made about faults on both sides are ones to which it is always necessary to respond <e> <s> however what he said about the treatment of visiting speakers is a matter with which i am in full profound and entire agreement <e> <s> i shall continue to say so wherever i can find an audience for those remarks <e> <s> i am happy to say that the visit of the noble lord lord joseph to my own college was entirely free of trouble <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond briefly to the noble lord lord annan <e> <s> had i laid the duty which he discussed on the provost of university college i should have created the problems he foresees <e> <s> however the amendment places the duty only on university commissioners who will be engaged in investigating university standards <e> <s> it is concerned only to ensure that they do not dismiss the best people because they are the most expensive and replace them with cheaper ones and that they take account of the quality of the service provided at the end of the day <e> <s> i believe that the fears which the noble lord lord annan expressed do not bear entirely on the amendment <e>", "<cs> if i said that in rising to speak in defence of tenure i was rising on a forlorn hope i should be guilty of foolish optimism <e> <s> but i rise without any hope at all <e> <s> i speak on this without the support of my noble friends the vice-chancellors if i may so describe them <e> <s> they reached an agreement with the secretary of state which was described by the noble lord lord flowers as an acceptable compromise <e> <s> i understand that by their acceptance they made great gains whereas we in this chamber have made very few <e> <s> this makes one think about the comparative importance of parliament in our political system <e> <s> the fact remains that this in many ways is a very bad proposal <e> <s> there are certain speeches which one cannot fail to make if one is to look oneself in the face again <e> <s> in that light i hope the chamber will forgive me if i speak with somewhat less than my customary brevity <e>", "<cs> i recognise the force of the argument put forward by the noble and learned lord as regards changing economic conditions <e> <s> however in the interests of the academic it is not sensible to accept employment under those terms <e> <s> i believe that if the clause is passed we shall not fill our posts <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor to address the question that has been raised several times this evening that of attracting people back from the united states <e> <s> the noble and learned lord asks why this accolade <e> <s> the answer is that people with american appointments in good universities certainly will not come anyway near this country without it <e>", "<cs> with respect <e> <s> i was not talking entirely about the future <e> <s> i was talking about the decision that i took in the very recent past and the ground on which i took it <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may cursorily answer the noble lord lord beloff <e> <s> in the present financial circumstances vice-chancellors are very rarely recruiting anybody <e> <s> they are living from hand to mouth <e> <s> the time may come when recruitment may resume <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down for the benefit of unlearned lords as i am perhaps i may ask him what are the implications of becoming a statutory body for the purposes of dismissal <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord for that very helpful answer <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord explained the position of the junior lecturer and the professor extremely clearly <e> <s> however when the junior lecturer grows to be a professor does he expect to be dismissed <e>", "<cs> my chief desire is for some information <e> <s> perhaps i may raise the matter of amendment no <e> <s> b which fell because the words to which it related were deleted <e> <s> this is a matter of the interpretation of good cause for dismissal <e> <s> it arises from the discussions with members of the committee of vice-chancellors and principals <e> <s> the case law that has been found does not seem to establish clearly that opinions are not by themselves good ground for dismissal <e> <s> one wonders whether there might be any scope for further discussion or further clarification on this matter <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord for that reply <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak to amendment no <e> <s> d which is grouped with this amendment and is designed to achieve a similar effect <e> <s> it is also concerned with the retroactive provision but seeks to come at the matter from a slightly different angle <e>", "<cs> i cannot really regard that as a satisfactory reply <e> <s> i take the point that people knew that the bill was likely to become law <e> <s> what i think most of us do not know and did not know is exactly what sort of contracts are likely to be on offer when the bill is law <e> <s> tonight noble lords who are experts in labour laws have discovered that in some respects this bill means something very different from what was said <e> <s> i think that until they know what sort of contracts can be available for them people are being asked to buy a pig in a poke <e> <s> i do not think that that is fair commercial practice <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i must remind the noble lord lord trefgarne that it is not easy to subdue criticism from these benches by saying that the labour government did it before <e> <s> i listened with great interest <e>", "<cs> one does not necessarily involve every party to a somewhat informal pact in every act that was done in every detail on every platform during its operation <e>", "<cs> it is not necessary for the government to accept per cent <e> <s> of the arguments put in favour of this amendment in order for them to accept it <e> <s> even if they do not sympathise with the arguments of social conscience which have been put forward they might consider that they are setting themselves an immense administrative nightmare <e> <s> this is not only a point about trying to collect money from people who have no money it is much more important than that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i was wondering whether the degree of central control over the economy that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is invoking is something which in times past he would have described as socialism <e>", "<cs> is it something which in times past the noble lord would have described as socialism <e>", "<cs> i cannot say i heard that reply with any great satisfaction <e> <s> this is a matter of quite general concern in university circles and among others to the committee of vice-chancellors and principals <e> <s> student life financially is very tight now <e> <s> in fact trying to organise inter-collegiate teaching arrangements in london we find it difficult from time to time to get people to go to lectures or classes at another college because they simply cannot afford the fares <e> <s> i appreciate as the noble lord lord mcintosh said that there is a review under way but it is not concluded <e> <s> the noble earl lord caithness may say that it is only a mere straw he is laying on the students <e> <s> but the camels back is very near to breaking <e> <s> i hope that the government will think further <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord consider looking again at the actuarial basis of these figures because outside government circles they carry very limited conviction <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome that reply <e> <s> the prime minister states a general principle in the words on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that as quoted in the question the prime minister has stated a general principle that is in fundamental conflict with the purpose of a government bill and if not why not <e>", "<cs> i speak in support of amendment no <e> <s> on behalf of my noble friend lord ross of newport who is unable to be present <e> <s> i have listened with some puzzlement to the reply that has just been given to the committee <e> <s> it seems to me that the government have created an enormous and complicated apparatus in order to achieve a very small and somewhat theoretical gain <e> <s> there are to be rebates of per cent <e> <s> and there is money to be paid out of public funds in order that it may come back into public funds <e> <s> that is a long circular laborious and expensive process <e> <s> i understand that the government themselves estimate that the housing benefit caseloads will increase by per cent <e> <s> as a result of the rebate scheme <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has made an extremely interesting speech with perhaps rather more far-reaching implications than he is aware <e> <s> this is the first time in this place that i have heard set out the case for moral qualifications for citizenship <e> <s> i find it curious <e> <s> we live in a country which for good or ill has universal suffrage for young and old rich and poor and good and evil saving only condemned criminals lunatics and peers of the realm <e>", "<cs> as the minister said we have been here before <e> <s> last time during the debate on the first part of the bill the noble earl said at the third time of asking a little more than he said just now <e> <s> he used the magic words i will take this back and think about it <e> <s> once again we are up against the idea that these hostels are residential <e>", "<cs> just for once i must say that i am in agreement with the noble baroness lady carnegy and not with the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> i accept that those objections exist but if i have understood the proposal aright it is not being proposed that anyone should be forced to take part in a lottery <e> <s> i must admit that i also take some exception to the comparison of lotteries with football hooliganism <e> <s> it seems to me that one of them does no harm to anyone except possibly to the participant and probably not to him either <e> <s> the other does a good deal of harm to other people <e> <s> on the other hand if the noble lord lord morton of shuna had concentrated on the question whether a lottery will raise enough money to make a statistically significant contribution to paying off the community charge he might perhaps have been on rather stronger ground <e>", "<cs> in the hope of saving the committee time by avoiding an unncessary speech perhaps i may ask the minister whether it is his understanding of this clause that universities are required to certify students addresses <e>", "<cs> i am also very glad that the noble lord lord renton said what he did <e> <s> the noble lord lord sanderson of bowden replied to the point with dignity and care <e> <s> however this is not the first time that it has happened <e> <s> we have had before us two large bills which have grown very remarkably in the telling and i mean that in the most literal sense of the word <e> <s> the practice of adding to acts is one that has increased is increasing and should be diminished <e>", "<cs> i view this with a certain amount of misgiving <e> <s> private bill committee standing orders are an important constituent of liberty <e> <s> they restrain the bringing of the full statutory juggernaut to bear on a particular private individual which i think is necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with interest to the noble and learned lord lord hailsham <e> <s> i wonder whether he has taken on board that the point of this amendment is that one day the cows will not come home <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to see that the noble baroness lady young is back in her place <e> <s> she argued that the subjects under discussion could be dealt with in the time left over from the subjects in the national curriculum <e> <s> if that argument were capable of carrying conviction on these benches these amendments would never have reached the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> my lords the right reverend prelate the bishop of london said that his amendment was not a compromise <e> <s> as a statement of his intention i entirely accept that <e> <s> however i believe that the right reverend prelate would probably agree that the agreement of this house to his amendment was a compromise <e> <s> if that compromise should break down in one quarter of the house it may also break down in others <e> <s> it may be that the noble lord lord campbell of alloway is not the only person in this house who wishes to reserve his position <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also very briefly express my support for this amendment on the ground that it provides an alternative to the compulsory study of music <e> <s> i have no lack of sympathy for music <e> <s> i followed my noble friend lord donaldson of kingsbridge into the lobbies for music in the course of the debates on this bill <e> <s> however it is something that some of us simply cannot do <e> <s> one can take a horse to the water but one cannot make it drink <e> <s> that is a proposition in which i declare an interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to support this amendment <e> <s> i should like to offer support on all three limbs of it <e> <s> on the proposition about learning languages young there is a considerable body of educational research as well as a considerable quantity of anecdotal evidence to support the proposition that languages are more easily learned at a younger age <e> <s> my father at the age of three spoke french german and english approximately equally well as a result of having a swiss governess who on one occasion distinguished herself by asking herbert gladstone the way to the lost propriety office <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister whom i should like to thank for her sympathy when she observed me yawning on thebench at oclock this morning knows that i am aware of the need to husband time <e> <s> i make no apology for speaking to the amendment because it has a considerable claim to be regarded as the most important on the marshalled list <e> <s> one cannot do a job without tools <e> <s> one cannot teach without teachers <e> <s> one cannot read without books <e> <s> when my own department interviews entrance candidates it regularly asks them about the contents of their school libraries <e> <s> we are well aware that standards of provision are falling rapidly seriously and drastically indeed to the point where many candidates arrive quite ill-prepared for what they are supposed to be doing <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down perhaps i may ask her to address the question of availability of teachers in particular subjects <e> <s> that is something which the teacher-pupil ratio does not altogether address <e> <s> that creates a need for teachers in particular subjects <e> <s> can that need be met <e>", "<cs> my lords i once had a pupil who had been an officer in the us army <e> <s> he told me that one of the principles that he had been taught in that capacity was never to give an order which would not be obeyed <e> <s> that struck me as a very sensible principle <e> <s> it is also an illustration of the central point of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said earlier today that she wants to assure us on the subject of the governments willingness to listen to professional advice <e> <s> i was glad to hear that <e> <s> this could be a good opportunity to offer precisely that reassurance and also to put the point in a nutshell <e> <s> it might be in the governments interests to remember that some day there may be a secretary of state who is not of their political persuasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain the house long <e> <s> i should like to say to the movers of these amendments what i think the right reverend prelate after a process of consultation which was a model of its kind knows perfectly well <e> <s> the trouble arises from the fact that in trying to provide worship in schools in a state system we are trying to provide something which will affect everyone <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord swinton gives us some reason for optimism but he speaks about a present situation <e> <s> in discussing the bill we are concerned with the future <e> <s> it seems to me that that opens an area of doubt <e> <s> we have here an amendment which results from a genuine doubt about what the bill means <e> <s> it is where we have i shall not say a contradiction because i do not think that is true a potential divergence between one area of the bill and another <e> <s> on the one hand we have in the national curriculum clauses a need for a specific number of teachers of specific subjects in specific places <e> <s> the minister said yesterday in col that this will create a considerable need for redeployment <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of my noble friend lady seear who is otherwise occupied i should like briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> it seems to be yet another case of the government having potentially divergent objectives <e> <s> for a long time it has been the objective of the government to secure what they describe as the more efficient use of resources otherwise translated as the lowering of public spending <e> <s> it is also the objective of this government as stated to move in a free market direction the central objective with which we are dealing <e>", "<cs> my lords one point arises here which i hope is worth a minute of your lordships time <e> <s> i am referring to the provision of a budget for a financial year <e> <s> that is not a year under which a school operates <e> <s> this is a difficulty which is familiar in some parts of the academic world <e> <s> it is likely to become more serious when the size of a schools enrolment is likely to vary considerably from one part of the financial year to another <e> <s> this is a possible cause of budgetary instability anxiety and confusion <e> <s> i should welcome some assurance that the point has come to the governments attention <e>", "<cs> my lords before the house is asked to say content to these amendments may we be told why they were not in the bill when it was first published <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that they are tidying-up amendments <e> <s> may we know why the bill was not tidy <e>", "<cs> my lords before we are asked to say content may we be told why the amendment is necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter of quite widespread concern in the teaching profession and in educational circles generally <e> <s> i beg the government front bench to pay attention to the amendment and to think about it <e> <s> there is a potential conflict between free market theory and the existence of an organised profession <e> <s> there is a tendency in some but not all government circles to view professions as no more than restrictive practices <e> <s> when it gets to that point then the philosophy becomes anti-academic <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a point of some importance that rights should not be taken away by <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter of some concern to the house in general as well as to the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> we have here a considerable addition to the bill at a very late stage <e> <s> i believe that we are entitled to ask for an explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a slightly awkward question that i wish to put <e> <s> i had understood perhaps incorrectly that no parliament could bind its successors so how can this amendment work <e>", "<cs> my lords i too briefly support the amendment <e> <s> i have had a certain amount of experience of the inclusion of students in university committees and i have found that they take part in a <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with interest to the noble earl lord swinton but cannot answer for what is being done in the sdlp because that is happening on the other side of the irish sea and i am not an expert in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady carnegy said that many of the arguments were familiar <e> <s> perhaps i may beg leave to offer her one which she may find a little less familiar <e> <s> i wish to express my support for the amendment on the grounds of cost-effectiveness <e> <s> when i taught at adult education classes a high proportion of the people who attended belonged to one of two categories namely either married women whose children had grown up and left home or people of either sex who had gone into retirement which very often was premature retirement <e> <s> those are large categories <e> <s> they are also categories in which i think we shall find a large amount of stress-related illness <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to add my support to the amendment <e> <s> one of the things i noticed while teaching in the united states of america was that a great deal more has been done in that country than has ever yet been done in this country especially in the way of securing easier access to university buildings <e> <s> the only word of caution i shall say on the matter is that such things cost money <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak briefly in support of my noble friend lord grimond <e> <s> there are questions here which will need a good deal of serious thought <e> <s> i do not know at the moment whether i am entirely persuaded by the case for going over to fees <e> <s> i am certain that it needs investigation <e> <s> i also think that if universities are to be asked to cut their costs they need more control over the arrangement of their own costs than they can have at present with the reservation that no system of re-organisation can make two plus two equal five <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess that that answer gives me profound disappointment <e> <s> in effect it is the same answer that i received in committee which is an answer to something rather different from the amendment that i moved <e> <s> i was not expecting that there would be any problem about the universities funding councils annual accounts <e> <s> i am aware that that is well taken care of <e>", "<cs> my lords before i take any decision perhaps may ask the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor whether he will reassure me first that it is not the objective of the universities funding council further to reduce unit costs and secondly whether he will tell me whether mr waldens statement which i quoted still represents government policy <e> <s> within the meaning of standing orders it is a question asked for the purposes of elucidation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor able to answer the question about mr waldens statement <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a very limited and guarded reassurance but it is all i can expect to get <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have got into the habit of supporting amendments <e> <s> wish if may to achieve a hat trick by supporting all three amendments in this group the government amendment no <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> za in the name of the noble lord lord adrian and amendment no <e> <s> a which i understand is to be moved by the noble lord lord wedderburn <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to offer my apologies to the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton for speaking prematurely to this amendment <e> <s> it was a result of some misunderstood <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down in attacking uncertainty does she contend

further and adult education services which have been provided by the ilea <e> <s> criticism has not concentrated in that area <e> <s> that point is worth the attention of the house <e> <s> the case for an overall london service is in this area quite peculiarly strong <e> <s> london is a single social unit <e> <s> its transport makes it work as one at least so far <e> <s> if we have say people in

thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for the care he has given to that reply and for the courtesy with which it was put forward <e> <s> i cannot say that i am convinced by it but i do not think that the noble and learned lord honestly expected that i should be <e> <s> i shall not follow him into the thickets of the oxford east argument <e> <s> my reply to that argument is on record in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i must admit that that reply causes me a certain amount of disappointment <e> <s> however at this hour of the morning and after the major concession which we have just received and welcomed i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i will study that reply with care when i have more leisure than i can give to it at this hour in the morning <e>

bill <e> <s> nevertheless in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in welcoming this amendment i have to declare an interest <e> <s> it means i could accept the headship of my department without losing my tenure <e> <s> whether that interest makes me more or less grateful for the amendment is a matter about which i shall have to think <e> <s> nevertheless this a good amendment and i am glad to see it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for the care of his reply <e> <s> i appreciate the force of the point about unfairness but it seems to me that there will be an unfairness if there is a cut-off point anyway <e> <s> i cannot see why the unfairness is greater under the proposal that i was offering than it is at th november <e> <s> nevertheless it seems to me that this is a proposal which cannot operate unless the government wish it to operate <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain the house long <e> <s> this seems to be a case which arises from the ambiguity about who is the employer under local financial management a subject upon which we have already touched <e> <s> i appreciate that there was need for legal tidying-up to deal with that point <e> <s> but it seems to me that this clause has been drafted in a way which is a good deal too sweeping and which <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the support expressed by the noble lord lord trafford <e> <s> this is a most modest little amendment <e> <s> as has been said it does not attempt to exempt anyone from any charge <e> <s> it does not so far as i can see challenge the principle of accountability <e> <s> however the amendment is concerned with what i think your lordships may occasionally have observed that is if any of you are capable of deciphering the graffiti on the london underground namely the tendency of quarrels of other countries to overflow into our own <e> <s> it is something which is not peculiar to our country <e> <s> it has happened in paris and it has happened in the united states where not so many years ago there was a quite alarming murder of the leading bahai in stamford connecticut which caused intense fear in the bahai community in that city and for good reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords this clause seems to be part of what i have described on other occasions as the notion of a planned economy of learning a control over local initiative <e> <s> it is an excessive discouragement to local initiative <e> <s> as the bill stands if i understand it correctly if the secretary of state should fail to specify a specific language he has in effect killed that language <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment appears to have uncovered a major ambiguity in the governments thinking <e> <s> the government have said consistently that one of the purposes of this bill is to transfer power to consumers <e> <s> however there is a considerable difficulty here about who actually consumes education <e> <s> the noble lord lord morton of shuna exposed the difference between us when he referred to a proposal which might have the effect of disfranchising children <e> <s> it seems to us in both the opposition parties that if education has consumers they are the children <e> <s> they are not those who presumably at some future time will be asked to cross the palm with silver <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that the bill was about enhancing the rights of parents <e> <s> we now understand the rights of parents not the rights of children <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may just say that some members of the house have other duties tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that nothing in this bill has caused deeper disagreement than the proposition that it is possible to take apart the services of ilea and devolve them upon the individual boroughs <e> <s> it seems to me to be rather like a proposal to disband the government and devolve their powers upon separate ministries <e> <s> it is possible that we are wrong about that if we are wrong this amendment will make no difference but should it be by any chance possible that we are right this amendment might enable the secretary of state to clear up the mess <e> <s> in that context i say to the government i pray you in the bowels of the lord to think it possible that you may be mistaken <e>", "<cs> my lords it appears that essentially the disagreement between the noble baroness and myself is about what the academic community thinks <e> <s> with respect i believe that that is an area where of the two i am more likely to be right <e> <s> it does not matter whether academics will lose appointments after restructuring <e> <s> in deciding whether to accept relocation what matters is whether they

that we have had an opportunity to debate this amendment during the hours of daylight <e> <s> it arose before at a quarter past twelve at night and at twenty to eight in the morning <e> <s> i am sorry i must correct myself because the latter was during the hours of daylight <e> <s> nevertheless i believe that we are entitled to take a few moments to debate the amendment at an ordinary time of day <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may respond to what the noble lord has just said <e> <s> if we could have established a dialogue at a slightly earlier stage of the bill s proceedings we would have done so <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i owe a response to the noble earl lord baldwin of bewdley <e> <s> if i may say so if he says that the universities have most of what they want i believe that is somewhat of an exaggeration <e> <s> i accept that the universities have some things <e> <s> on this the noble lord lord beloff and i speak with one voice <e> <s> where we speak with one voice i believe that that voice may indeed be taken to be the voice of the academic community <e>", "<cs> only for the time being <e>", "<cs> this is a debate in which it has been a pleasure to take part <e> <s> it has been conducted to a high level <e> <s> i must confess that i rather like the idea of being earl of the rings <e> <s> the noble lord lord trafford made an intervention which raised the level and the pleasure of the debate <e> <s> perhaps i may reply briefly to him <e>", "<cs> i take the point about income generation which clearly covers this clause <e> <s> however the power to do anything whatsoever to generate income is still a quite sweeping power <e> <s> for example if i may ask a not entirely frivolous question would it be lawful under the terms of the clause to raffle the office of secretary of state to raise funds for the health service <e>", "<cs> i was a little perplexed by the reference made by the minister to free market principles <e> <s> i am aware that rents in shorthold tenancies are market rents <e> <s> however there is a procedure in clause if i have read it correctly for those rents to be referred checked and controlled <e> <s> that means that although they are market rents they are not entirely free market rents <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord graham of edmonton knows that i go along with a very large part of the general framework of criticisms that he and his colleagues have developed but there are occasions of which i believe this is one when i find it necessary to say that landlords are people too <e> <s> i do not believe that there is a large amount of housing in london about to be brought onto the market <e> <s> i do not think there are many more houses to be found in london <e>", "<cs> i wish to reassure my noble friend lord ross that he has succeeded in carrying me with him <e> <s> it is not as difficult a task as carrying with him his honourable friend the member for rochdale <e> <s> this is such a good amendment that i have no doubt that he would have succeeded <e> <s> it seems to distinguish with a discrimination which is characteristic of the approach on these benches as regards landlord and tenant relations as between use and the abuse <e> <s> that distinction needs making <e> <s> i do not believe that the amendment has the effect suggested by the noble lord lord renton because it is creating an excluded tenancy that is a tenancy in which the landlord can recover possession without the difficulties characteristic of other tenancies <e> <s> i do not believe it is the effect of this amendment to give guaranteed possession for two months for a tenancy which was supposed to last for two weeks <e> <s> i believe that it does what it is intended to do and i am happy to support it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps before beginning what i have been preparing to say i may take the chance to answer the noble viscount lord eccles <e> <s> he asked why the british people continue to support the conservative party <e> <s> the answer is that at the last election fewer of them did than at any other election <e>", "<cs> i find this an interesting amendment and i am happy to support it in the form in which it is drafted <e> <s> there is an opportunity with this amendment which could be used <e> <s> it is possible that one or two words of caution may be worth uttering also <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support my noble friends amendment <e> <s> i should like to say first that the law on unintentional homelessness is an area of quite exceptional difficulty <e> <s> i have read a great many cases in <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the house for taking part in a debate so much of which i have missed <e> <s> and what i have heard only increases my regret <e> <s> this afternoon i was teaching and i must say that when i speak to your lordships on the subject of academic freedom i do not mean freedom to neglect the job for which i am paid <e> <s> on that note i must also apologise for the fact that as i shall be teaching again this evening i shall have to leave the house in another minutes <e> <s> therefore i may not be able to hear the debate on the amendments put forward by the noble lords lord trafford and lord beloff <e> <s> if that is so i shall very much regret it <e>", "<cs> my lords is it in order to ask a question at this stage <e> <s> i want to know whether it is in order <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to know whether if the minister takes this away and thinks about it he will accept that the purport of this debate is that the existence of the contract is one abuse <e> <s> its abuse would be two abuses <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate apart from a slight tendency to length has been a model of its kind <e> <s> there has been a real attempt at meeting of minds to which the minister has made a welcome contribution <e> <s> i should like to answer a few points that have been made in some of the speeches <e> <s> i tried to say that i was not arguing that

of security raises separate problems although i agree with the point made by my noble friend lord grimond that in matters both of security and even more in the public interest the governments judgment is not necessarily always the last word <e> <s> the noble lord lord campbell of alloway asked why days <e> <s> it is that because that was the departments normal practice until february days to run from submission of the work to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords in one sense i agree with the noble lord lord ennals in welcoming this amendment and i thank the minister and the noble lord lord trafford for the effort that has gone into it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that by saying that the current nurses pay increase has been fully funded he has made a controversial statement <e> <s> does he agree that the difficulty in retaining nurses illustrates the difficulties of the present system of funding public sector pay increases and that that system leaves the government the proud possessor of more hot potatoes than mcdonalds <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that brents difficulties are by no means confined to the immediate problems <e> <s> is he aware that there have been complaints on the subject of street cleaning for nearly two years <e> <s> will the minister tell us why he regards the councils present assurances as more credible than any others it has yet given <e> <s> will he further undertake to keep the matter under review <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord young of graffham is perhaps aware that one cannot have something for nothing <e> <s> he may therefore be prepared to consider the possibility that the restraint in public spending on which he has so <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord <e>",

speech which states the the government will continue to take action to raise standards throughout education <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the noble lords pardon but i do not think i said that <e>", "<cs>

firearms bill <e> <s> i fancy that he was in the same lobby <e>", "<cs> i take the noble and learned lords point that there should not be an obligation on the local authority to provide care when the child does not appear to need it <e> <s> i think that the question underlying this amendment is how far the local authoritys judgment in this matter is likely to be entirely disinterested <e>", "<cs>

intervene but i should like to point out that the failure to supply information was in large measure due to the lack of access to the records and subsequently to the auditors inability to sign the

us an opportunity to debate matters which seriously need parliamentary scrutiny <e> <s> i agreed with almost everything that the noble lord said including that the academic part of these matters

introduce into law the concept in this amendment <e> <s> i am aware that recent decisions by the commissioners tend to take the line that a person may lose benefit for refusing a job by which he may be worse off <e> <s> i am also aware that not so very long ago when the noble lord lord joseph was secretary of state most of us believed the law to be as the amendment asks it to become <e> <s> we have here a case of tightening the spirit in which the regulations are administered <e> <s> this has appeared in a good many places recently <e> <s> when the noble lord accuses me of trying to introduce something into law he may not be inaccurate but he is slightly cutting a corner <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure that i followed the minister <e> <s> is he saying that it is not reasonable to expect an employer to pay a living wage to someone with children <e> <s> that would be quite a significant statement <e>", "<cs> we have not heard the last of this <e> <s> we have here a good many issues running round together and becoming confused with each other <e> <s> by the leave of the committee it might be best to come back to this matter on a later occasion with a different draft perhaps two different drafts <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> the whole problem of bed and breakfast is a major one <e> <s> i know that the noble earl lord caithness in his review of homelessness is taking it into account <e> <s> i hope that he will take into account what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> the problem is an immediate one <e> <s> the basic purpose of the social security system is that people should have enough to eat <e> <s> that purpose is not being met <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that he recognises the problem but that it is a great deal too difficult to do anything about it <e> <s> with respect i find it very hard to accept that answer as satisfactory <e>", "<cs> i must apologise for standing between members of the committee and their dinner <e> <s> it is always an uncomfortable place to be <e> <s> nevertheless this is probably the most important single issue in the bill <e> <s> i hope that members of the committee can bear to go hungry for just a few minutes in order to discuss it <e> <s> i support amendment no <e> <s> to which i have my name and amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i support also amendment no <e> <s> to which i would have had my name if the noble baroness lady david had not beaten me to the tape by about a yard <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may cursorily answer the noble baroness <e> <s> the case to which i referred came <e>", "<cs> is the minister seriously suggesting that people will leave home for the sole reason of enjoying the luxury of living on a benefit of a week <e>", "<cs> i wish to express full agreement with everything said by the noble lords lord allen of abbeydale and lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> beyond that with respect to the arguments of the noble lord lord mottistone i am entirely in favour of the principle of saving time <e> <s> but i am in the hands of the committee <e> <s> i have a good many arguments against this clause which i wish at some stage to develop but they go rather wide of the amendments on the marshalled list <e> <s> if the committee wishes me to take some liberty with the rules of order and develop them now i am happy to do so <e> <s> if it wishes me to take some liberty with time and develop them later i am equally happy to do so <e> <s> i should welcome guidance <e>", "<cs> the government seem to have cast themselves in the part of becket <e> <s> by that name i do not mean the honourable member for derby south <e>", "<cs> i want just to say a word in favour of the amendment <e>", "<cs> it seems essentially inequitable that someone might go to court win an award of damages and be worse off as a result because he had to pay part of the award to his lawyers and part of it to the department of social security if the two sums together come to more than the total award <e> <s> it is rather like the unfortunate situation of the lady who was bankrupted by being left million in shipping shares <e> <s> the shipping shares were left in the spring of and were valued for death duty in the autumn of <e> <s> i suggest that the operation of this clause is about as unpredictable as that <e>", "<cs> i shall not detain the committee for long but this matter is of some importance <e> <s> the present law creates a good deal of hardship <e> <s> i shall quote only one case that has been drawn to my attention <e> <s> it is the case someone who was at first unable to obtain a yts place because she was too near the weeks before birth limit at which she would have had to give it up <e> <s> she had on which to support herself and possessed only one skirt that she could get into <e> <s> that is slightly more than hardship and at that stage of someones life they ought to be offered support <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> he may perhaps appreciate that i would be somewhat relieved if it were to stop there <e> <s> however perhaps i may pursue the question a little further <e> <s> has any consideration been given to putting a cash limit on the total amount of work resulting from these studies <e> <s> in particular is the minister in a position to deny the report which appeared in the <e>", "<cs> my lords before i attempt to answer the minister i should be grateful if i am allowed to set the record straight for having inadvertently misled the house when i spoke to this amendment in committee <e> <s> i quoted a figure from the <e>", "<cs> my lords i connot claim to be satisfied with that reply <e> <s> there is perhaps a misapprehension but i think there may be some question as to where it resides <e> <s> i could not help wondering in listening to that reply whether whether it was drafted for the amendment in committee on suitable work <e> <s> there is no attempt in this amendment to suggest that people should be able to look for a rate of pay that they have had in a specific job <e> <s> the suggestion is only that they should not suffer a loss <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> some things do not change <e> <s> one of them is the spirit in which entry into this country is sometimes approached <e> <s> i am reminded of a friend who was parachuted behind the german lines at arnhem <e> <s> he had the misfortune to break his leg on landing <e> <s> he crawled away after nightfall and made his way to france <e> <s> when the gestapo came to his hotel he leapt out of the window <e> <s> he got in touch with the french resistance and was taken across the swiss frontier discovering a minute before he crossed that the french resistance had planted spying documents on him <e> <s> he finally made his way to portugal and after a three months wait got a boat home <e> <s> he had with him one bottle of sherry <e> <s> he said the customs impounded it and then i knew i was home <e> <s> that is the same spirit behind this per cent <e> <s> regulation <e>", "<cs> my lords this appears to be another wrong box amendment <e> <s> i say that because under the new system we have a separation into housing benefit which is for lodging and income support which is for eating <e> <s> and never it seems the twain shall meet particularly if it is a case of bed and breakfast <e> <s> of course those categories were based upon the notion that people live and eat at home as of course people short of money normally do <e> <s> as is fairly obvious eating at home is a great deal cheaper than eating out especially in london <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to support this amendment <e> <s> as i have said before this evening i am concerned about how much the whole system costs <e> <s> where costs can be kept down without causing undue pain to those concerned i believe that we should try to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> it is not the first time tonight that we have heard the argument that the proposal in question reintroduces the worst features of the old supplementary benefit system <e> <s> i am beginning to wonder whether when the minister speaks about the worst features of that system he may occasionally be speaking about certain aspects of it which some of us on this side of the house may regard as the best features of the system <e>", "<cs> my lords before dealing with the amendment i should first like to offer thanks to the minister and through him to his officials for the care and courtesy with which they dealt with the debate which took place on this clause in his office <e> <s> there we all entered the discussion with real political good will <e> <s> i believe that if there had been agreement to be reached we would have reached it <e>", "<cs> my lords i hasten to assure noble lords that i shall not make the same speech twice <e> <s> however i agree with every word of the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> i should also like to try to clear a little of the confusion that the business has created <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the house will forgive me at this time of night for supporting the amendment <e>", "<cs> i can only beg the pardon of the noble baroness <e> <s> this is a point of some importance <e> <s> some of the cases in the briefing papers are really quite harrowing <e> <s> i do not want to quote them at length at this time but the reduced rate of income support for teenagers is particularly illogical in the case of pregnant women <e> <s> i cannot believe that it is doing anything other than giving severe hardship <e> <s> although i know that the sins of the fathers are visited on the children i do not think that the state needs to be an accomplice in the process <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that very detailed and careful reply <e> <s> i sometimes wonder whether in the governments eyes amendments put before the house divide into two categories the unnecessary and the wrecking <e> <s> i am well aware that this is not a wrecking amendment so i am not surprised to find it placed in the other category <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess to being somewhat puzzled by that reply <e> <s> i take the point that those who are receiving unemployment benefit must be available for work but the minister appears to be defining available for work in such a way that no single parent can possibly be available for work <e> <s> the minister knows perfectly well that the secretary of state is much concerned about the cost of single parents to the social security system <e> <s> if single parents cannot be regarded as available for work i cannot see how the secretary of state can bring that cost down <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened very carefully to the remarks made by the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> i was much impressed by what she said but at present i retain an open mind <e> <s> the situation is a serious one <e> <s> the estimates we are now given show that there are about homeless teenagers in london <e> <s> the number is estimated to have risen by as much as per cent <e> <s> since last april <e> <s> moreover for the whole country a probable estimate seems to be in the region of homeless teenagers <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for a great deal in the conduct of the bill <e> <s> first i should like to thank him for his unfailing good humour during debates which sometimes have been pretty hotly contested <e> <s> i should like to thank him for a great deal of helpfulness <e> <s> i should like to thank him for his letters which have saved me from putting forward a great deal of criticism which i might otherwise have uttered <e> <s> i know that in the light of what i have uttered the minister may be surprised to hear that but it is true <e>", "<cs> my lords edward gibbon was once commanded by his father to desist from a courtship on which he had set his heart <e> <s> he sighed as a lover and obeyed as a son <e> <s> it is a story which comes regularly to my mind when one of our amendments comes back from the commons with a privilege reason attached <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish briefly to associate these benches with the remarks made by the noble lord lord carter <e> <s> once again we accept the power of those who bear sway in another place to do what they have done <e> <s> they have decided that they cannot help the deaf the blind and the autistic and those suffering from downes syndrome in other words some of the poorest and weakest groups in our society at a very small cost because the integrity of public funds will not permit it <e> <s> i did not know that we were that poor a country and i am very sorry to hear it <e>", "<cs> my lords i heard that reply with interest <e> <s> is the noble viscount aware that one cannot have something for nothing <e> <s> does he agree that his answer carries a risk of conflict with the universities funding council circular letter / in particular with the dutch auction proposal for competitive bidding and the proposal for two-year degrees <e> <s> will the noble viscount perhaps tell us whether when vice-chancellors conclude as is their office and as they have done that they cannot maintain quality on present funding levels the government would prefer them to cut quality or to raise fees <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree that it follows from his first answer about quality being a matter for the universities that how much quality can be had for the money is also a matter for the universities to decide <e> <s> will he say that respect for university autonomy is not confined to cases where it would save the government money <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister was perhaps rather hasty in his rejection of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> he made a number of technical points <e> <s> so far as they go some of them are valid <e> <s> however they have a slightly limited perspective <e> <s> for example the minister said that it might change the standards of fitness for human habitation <e> <s> those standards may perhaps be written about tablets of stone but they are hardly written on them <e> <s> they have changed considerably over the years <e>", "<cs> i can hardly say that that answer causes me great surprise <e> <s> as soon as i observed the minister pronounce the words public expenditure i waited to see whether he would genuflect <e> <s> he did not quite do so but he came a little near it <e> <s> money can save expenditure as well as creating it <e> <s> if we let our housing stock deteriorate at the rate at which it risks deteriorating we may end up spending a great deal more in the end <e> <s> we have here an example of the fact that the government do not have an adequate concept of the public interest but that is something that i would not presume to argue out at this time of night <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i understand that another noble lord will speak to amendment a <e> <s> these amendments form a group of minor amendments logically belonging together that concern grants for minor works for energy conservation <e> <s> i shall not repeat remarks i have made about energy conservation in general <e> <s> i shall say that in a great many old houses around london the present standards of energy conservation are seriously deficient <e> <s> if one goes near a window ones papers rustle go near a door and your coat moves <e> <s> that kind of thing costs money to put right <e> <s> not everybody has money ready to hand at every moment <e> <s> however not spending money can be expensive not only to the householder but also to the country <e>", "<cs> i have sometimes listened to ministers putting a treasury case arguing the problem which is created by the competing claims for one form of expenditure or another <e> <s> but what is true for treasury ministers is also true for household budgets <e> <s> those who manage household budgets are constantly facing competing claims for different forms of expenditure <e> <s> an excellent case is invariably made out for most of those forms of expenditure <e> <s> an irresistible case is made out for many more of them than could be met <e> <s> so if it is left to the discretion of the managers of household budgets however necessary some of this work may be one cannot guarantee that it will always be done <e> <s> if the state should believe that it is in the national interest partly on the grounds of a long-term saving of public money that it should be done it is a legitimate object of public policy to use financial incentives to <e>", "<cs> my lords we on the liberal democratic benches join with the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey in saying that we welcome the amount of consultation that has gone into the production of the amendment <e> <s> it is a serious attempt to get it right <e> <s> however as with so many matters it will go further in form of regulations and we must debate the amendment without the regulations before us <e> <s> before we can say how far the government have got it right we must wait as usual to see what is in the regulations <e> <s> we must look at them with care <e>", "<cs> my lords we on the liberal democrat benches warmly welcome this amendment and support it strongly <e> <s> i believe it is a basic legal principle that there ought not to be a wrong without a remedy <e> <s> where we as legislators find a wrong without a remedy as the noble baroness has done here we ought to think very hard indeed about providing one <e> <s> it is no excuse for the denial of justice to say the wrong is only a little one <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady carnegy said in committee in dealing with a recalcitrant local authority adverse publicity is not always enough <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is not satisfied with the form of this amendment will the government undertake to give serious and urgent consideration to trying to find an alternative way of achieving the same effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister will give some sympathy to the purposes behind this amendment <e> <s> perhaps some noble lords remember an amendment to the education bill moved by <e>", "<cs> my lords although i warmly welcome the ministers initial reply can he say whether he will further consider two of the specific recommendations made by the national association of citizens advice bureaux <e> <s> the first was that those who have registered for yts may continue to receive a bridging allowance until they receive a place <e> <s> the second recommendation was for a review to take place of the weeks maximum child benefit extension period for those unable to live at home <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the lord privy seal accused my noble friend lord bonham-carter of flying in the face of the evidence <e> <s> if my noble friends view is flying in the face of the evidence perhaps the noble lord can explain why so many people have expressed that view in the past few days <e> <s> i would have taken the evidence that the noble lord quoted against that view and the secretary-generals statement in particular as face-saving courtesies <e> <s> however is not taking face-saving courtesies for approval of substance one of the characteristic errors of a regime which has been in power too long <e>", "<cs> my lords listening to this debate i am increasingly being drawn to the suspicion that the secretary of state has brought on himself a great deal more obloquy than he needed <e> <s> it is not only my noble friend lady robson with whom i agree entirely who believes this contract contains some good points <e> <s> that view is quite widely held around the house but it has not produced a good reaction <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a good day for the house <e> <s> i cannot recall any other day since i have had the privilege to be a member of this house when we have heard three maiden speeches of the high quality that we have heard today <e> <s> it has been a great pleasure to listen to the maiden speeches of the noble lords lord mccoll of dulwich lord walton of detchant and lord sainsbury of preston candover <e> <s> i am sure that i speak for every quarter of the house in offering the warmest congratulations to all three of them and in looking forward to hearing them on many future occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords in common with all other noble lords who have spoken i should like to thank the noble lord lord hunter of newington for introducing this debate not only because it has given us a chance to participate in a discussion at an early stage of the bill but also because it is something more as well as something less than a second reading debate <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord lord carr of hadley was right when he said that a second reading debate would have been a good deal more adversarial than this debate has been because it has been a remarkable feature of the debate that almost every noble lord who has participated has in effect made points on both sides of the house <e> <s> when i look at the points which have stuck in my memory they are very often points which one would have expected to come from the opposite side of the house to that from which they came <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the situation is a little too important for the scoring of party points <e> <s> rather than doing that i should like to turn our attention to the question of whether students entering higher education next october and their parents may count on some visible means of support <e> <s> with that in mind i should like to ask the noble viscount whether he can give a copper-bottomed guarantee or if not whether he will ask his right honourable friends the secretary of state and the chancellor of the exchequer whether they can give such a guarantee that student grants will continue to increase in line with inflation unless or until a workable student loan scheme is in place <e>", "<cs> it is only with the greatest trepidation that a layman intervenes in such matters <e> <s> however listening to the debate on this amendment and to the related debate on amendment no <e> <s> i could not help finding a great deal of what was said painfully familiar <e> <s> in understanding any problem it is important to try to get a sense of the whole size and shape of the matter <e> <s> the debate has encouraged me in the belief that the difficulties of the law of medicine and of universities have a great deal in common <e>", "<cs> having listened to the noble and learned lord lord roskill and to the noble baroness lady faithfull i think i hear a conflict <e>", "<cs> like the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale i have no objection in principle to the objectives of the clause <e> <s> i believe that making litigation cheaper is a laudable objective provided that that can be made compatible with the interests of justice <e> <s> one must also concede that there must be a place for enabling legislation <e> <s> the bulk of legislation and the bulk of the things which governments wish to do is now so great that without enabling legislation this chamber would very often have to sit beyond midnight when issues may not receive adequate scrutiny <e>", "<cs> the noble lords lord mishcon and lord henderson of brompton made some powerful points which compel attention <e> <s> however i should like to be allowed if i may adopt legal language to confess and avoid some of those points <e> <s> i am well aware of the threat of an overwhelming flood of primary legislation <e> <s> i know that the noble lord lord rippon of hexham is also aware of that threat <e> <s> one of the parliamentary moments i shall not soon forget is when he dropped the water bill <e> <s> if i had been a security man i should have been in danger of a heart attack at that moment <e> <s> i do not wish to argue i do not imagine that the noble lord lord rippon wishes to argue that everything should be embodied in primary legislation <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon might perhaps consider the possibility that there is some undistributed middle between his argument and that of the noble lord lord rippon <e>", "<cs> i should like very briefly to add my voice to what the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale has said <e> <s> i indicated last week that there is a place for henry viii clauses <e> <s> i must apologise for having somewhat misled the committee last week by quoting a precedent from memory <e> <s> i quoted earlier legislation as having referred to the pricing of wines <e> <s> it referred in fact to the import and export of wines and therefore had the effect of importing statute into an area previously governed solely by prerogative <e> <s> so henry viii clauses are not necessarily arbitrary <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister comment on the work done by the salvation army in providing shelter for the homeless and in particular on the recent financial difficulties of salvation army hostels <e> <s> how far might these result in problems in the system of payments by the department of social security especially in regard to the habit of paying benefit in arrears <e>", "<cs> my lords the liberal democrats are the only party which take a truly empirical attitude to the free market <e> <s> the government are in favour of it <e> <s> the opposition are against it <e> <s> we suspect both of them of knowing the answer before they know the question <e> <s> we should like to know suitable to what and suitable to achieving what purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord lord mccarthy has chosen to speak about training <e> <s> when the noble lord lord peston put down this motion which i am very glad that he did he used the words education and training <e> <s> i am sure he meant by that to discuss many sorts of education other than that of which i have personal knowledge <e> <s> therefore in discussing matters of which i have some personal knowledge i do not in any way wish to imply that they are more important or more urgently in need of attention than other considerations about which i am not talking because they are not within the area of my expertise <e> <s> i have listened to my father-in-law comparing the educational qualifications of german and british foremen <e> <s> i found that that was something that i had to take very seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that it is convention to express gratitude to the noble lord who introduces the motion but it is well recognised that some lords are more grateful than others <e> <s> on this occasion i am particularly grateful to the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> these are important matters <e> <s> of course we regularly discuss procedural questions in the course of the pieces of business which occasion debate about them <e> <s> that means that we tend to discuss them with a tincture of our opinions of the measure under discussion <e> <s> that risks confusion of form and substance <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the noble lord lord carter in congratulating the minister on the lucidity with which he has introduced these regulations <e> <s> i should also like to <e>", "<cs> my lords i was intrigued to read in this mornings paper of the conversion of the communist party of the soviet union to the principle of separation of powers <e> <s> i should like to think that i am a reasonable man <e> <s> i do not intend to adopt today as extreme a libertarian position as the communist party of the soviet union <e> <s> i believe that montesquieu rather exaggerated i believe that the notion of separation of powers depends on an over-exact sense of categories <e> <s> although i do not believe in separation of powers i believe strongly in checks and balances <e> <s> the noble lord lord rippon of hexham to whom i am very grateful for introducing this debate referred to the formidable nature of the power that is in the hands of those who pass an act of parliament <e> <s> that is a point that cannot be overstressed <e> <s> the noble lord will perhaps forgive me for adding one more story to his examples <e> <s> it is the case of the bude and torrington railway <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me for interrupting him the figures that i quoted for divisions on statutory instruments since were for this house alone <e>", "<cs> i listened with a great deal of interest to the noble earl lord halsbury who put his case as always powerfully lucidly and persuasively nevertheless i must admit that i agree with the noble lord lord ennals on this matter <e> <s> in particular i was a little alarmed by the arguments we heard from the noble lord lord hylton and the noble viscount lord caldecote <e> <s> they said that because it is very difficult to persuade parliament to change the law we should give the right to change the law to someone else <e> <s> that is an argument which has been made a good many times before in this countrys history <e> <s> however it has generally not been viewed with favour in parliament <e>", "<cs> no i said no such thing <e> <s> indeed i would not presume to do so <e>", "<cs> my noble kinsman made a very powerful case <e> <s> i listened to it with a great deal of interest <e> <s> i take the point about no northern ireland politician having called for this but my noble kinsman has imposed a very exhaustive process of consultation slightly more exhaustive if i may say so than has usually been asked for by the government <e> <s> perhaps i may ask my noble kinsman this if the elected representatives of northern ireland at westminster were to ask him for change would he consider the possibility of accepting what they ask <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that according to government figures per cent of parents fail to pay the full parental contribution <e> <s> is she also aware that according to government figures given in a parliamentary answer last week the average new mortgage in london is now <e> <s> does the minister entertain the hypothesis that those two figures might in some way be connected <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government entertain the idea that in handling young people they regularly assume a contribution from parents which they nevertheless do not require parents to pay and that the effects of this in many cases may be unfortunate <e> <s> do the government consider that the whole subject may need reconsideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain the house long <e> <s> i share the concern that has been expressed about student poverty <e> <s> only at lunchtime today i was asking myself why the proportion of overseas students in the college refectory is three times as high as in the college as a whole <e> <s> the minister said that there is an increase of per cent <e> <s> which sounds generous until one reflects that it falls short of returning to the figure <e> <s> we could pursue these matters much more effectively if the size of the loan were specified in the bill and it were properly appropriate to put down an amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords after yesterday i feel a little as if i were purveying tickets to the mousetrap <e> <s> however i reflect that i was an undergraduate at merton college oxford whose visitor i am very glad to see in the chamber today <e> <s> that is a college which celebrated its septencentenary shortly after my graduation <e> <s> in that context perhaps we may regard the mousetrap as the novelty that it is and reflect that the show must go on <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the minister to comment further on the question asked by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> the noble lord used the phrase a well-run local authority <e> <s> does the minister agree that a low community charge is not a sufficient definition of a well-run local authority <e> <s> one must also think of the quality of the services delivered <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise very briefly to wish this bill a fair wind and to congratulate the noble lord lord houghton on the distinction with which he has played the part of william webb ellis <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate the noble baroness lady hooper on the distinction with which she has combined discharging her personal conscience and her official duties <e> <s> it cannot have been an easy task <e> <s> it has been an outstanding example of the ability to distinguish between the person and the office <e>", "<cs> i believe i can enlighten the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter at least a little on the subject of the social security regulations as i received a letter about them from the clerks office earlier this morning <e> <s> the statutory instrument has been tabled and it is at present before the joint committee <e> <s> i am told that it will come to this house shortly after easter <e> <s> but having so far only heard the contents of the letter read quickly by my wife over the telephone i cannot say whether it involves the affirmative or the negative procedure <e> <s> that point is worth some attention <e> <s> i entirely agree with what the noble lord said about taking a bone out of the dogs mouth <e> <s> we might also reflect that there is a social security bill before parliament at present in which these changes could perfectly properly have been embodied <e>", "<cs> i try to be a practical man <e> <s> i have two questions which particularly concern me about any scheme of student support and they are more important than whether i like the scheme or not <e> <s> the first is should the scheme put money in the pocket of the student at the time when it is due to be spent and the second is if it is a loan scheme should the money be returned to the pocket if that is the correct word of the consolidated fund <e> <s> it is the purpose of this amendment to show that the bill is not yet ready to pass these tests <e> <s> i do not think the scheme should come into force until it is <e> <s> if that opposes the central principle of the bill i can only say that i am very sorry and rather surprised to hear it <e>", "<cs> i am in full agreement with what has been said by the noble lords lord boyd-carpenter and lord renton <e> <s> i do not believe that i am straining things by saying that we have here an argument of implied contract which is something about which universities are careful when dealing with their students <e> <s> when new courses and new degree regulations are introduced it is pretty well invariably on the understanding that these apply only to those who will be admitted in the future and not to those who are already admitted <e> <s> it is a principle which was accepted by the government in a case about which they felt strongly the abolition of academic tenure <e> <s> that measure was to apply only to appointments made or contracts signed after th november <e> <s> that was a good <e> <s> equitable principle <e> <s> i was glad to see it there i should like to see it here <e>", "<cs> the minister never ceases to surprise me <e> <s> he discussed the option if the amendment were accepted of paying to those affected a sum in grant that would be equivalent to the loan <e> <s> he said that he ruled that out on the grounds of cost <e> <s> i do not understand that because the sum concerned is equal in both cases <e> <s> the cost to the treasury would be the same <e> <s> all that would happen is that the government would save the costs of administration <e> <s> how that could amount to a net extra cost is more than i can understand <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the noble baroness lady blackstone on amendment no <e>

rejoin the labour force should they wish to do so <e> <s> during the past few minutes i have looked again at that debate which was a good one <e> <s> the chamber seems to me to have been in general agreement on two propositions <e> <s> the first was that this was properly an area where we should not interfere with freedom of choice <e> <s> the noble lord lord henley speaking for the government said that he regarded the governments role as an enabling one <e> <s> the second point that the whole chamber seemed to be in agreement on was that it was very much in our national economic interest to make it easier for those married women who wished to rejoin the labour force to do so <e>", "<cs> i feel that i should apologise to the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour for joining the queue to answer her but for the moment she seems to have volunteered for the part of lightning conductor <e> <s> the repayment of loans by employers is among the obvious possibilities <e> <s> it causes some misgivings on these benches first because if it is done by private employers it is capable of increasing our industrial costs which is something that concerns liberal democrats considerably <e> <s> a small increase in industrial costs can be a major disadvantage in competitiveness which is often a matter of narrow margins <e> <s> i am not convinced that that is the best place for costs to fall <e>", "<cs> i must confess to being disappointed with that reply <e> <s> i am truly surprised to hear books described as a special circumstance <e> <s> they are a circumstance without which people cannot be adequately educated <e> <s> i entirely agree with my noble friend lady seear that it would be better to do without all the staff and keep up the number of books <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i support both what my noble friend lord addington said about scotland and what the noble lords lord colwyn and lord butterfield have said about medicine <e> <s> other people are also affected and the british dental association for example is very much concerned <e> <s> before the subject is left somebody ought to put in a word for greats at oxford which as many members of the committee know is capable of providing an excellent education <e>", "<cs> i should like to support amendment no <e> <s> and speak also to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the presence of mature students is a vital part of the education of other people in a university <e> <s> it is important for a community that all are involved <e> <s> that was a factor i missed badly at an american university <e> <s> the vast majority of students were drawn <e>", "<cs> those words offer a valuable small crumb of encouragement <e> <s> i welcome them <e> <s> i welcome also what the noble baroness lady young has said <e> <s> i do not believe that one should talk about the higher potential earnings of non-graduates <e> <s> as my noble friend lord addington has reminded me employers ask about qualifications <e> <s> they do not ask about educational experience <e> <s> i know that we used to be told once upon a time that there were regular applications from people claiming to be failed ba <e> <s> we do not get those now <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down perhaps he will answer the point made by the noble baroness lady blackstone regarding the logic of taking postgraduate students out of the social security system without giving them access to loans <e> <s> i must confess that the logic of the governments position escapes me <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first say something which i think i may say without infringing standing orders <e> <s> i am aware that i have something of a cold today which occasionally leads to coughing <e> <s> should that incommode the house i would of course withdraw until it was over <e> <s> i hope that is understood in the spirit in which it is meant <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl lord longford for what he has just said <e> <s> he has been here a great deal longer than i as i understand it this is a free parliament <e> <s> a noble lord who decides whether to call a division has to use his judgment as to whether or not the committee will like it <e> <s> we have heard assurances before and some of them were more categorical <e> <s> last week we heard assurances concerning affirmative resolutions and those assurances were far more categorical <e> <s> i believe that it is parliamentary practice that a noble lord retains the right to be unsatisfied by assurances quite as much as the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls retains the right to be dissatisfied with my dissatisfaction <e>", "<cs> i am in full agreement with what the noble baroness lady young said about the access funds i am glad that she said it <e> <s> were we to be given the kind of assurance that she suggests i should accept and welcome it with open arms <e> <s> i am also in full agreement with everything my noble friend lady seear said about vacations <e>", "<cs> i wish to ask for one more piece of clarification <e> <s> do the figures which the noble earl has just given us include housing benefit coming through local authorities <e>", "<cs> i am thankful to be able to agree with the noble earl about something <e> <s> of course i agree that we are limited by the constraints of public expenditure <e> <s> in turn i ask the noble earl whether he will agree with something else namely that we cannot have any more students than we can afford <e> <s> however that is by the way <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness said that this amendment would constrain the secretary of state <e> <s> i thought that was the purpose of having a parliament <e>", "<cs> in the past i have expressed the view that the noble earl has surprised me <e> <s> this time he <e>", "<cs> very briefly i should like to add my name to those supporting these amendments <e> <s> one of the values of going to university is that you meet all sorts of people so one of the great arguments for keeping up the number of disabled students is that it is a better education for everybody else <e> <s> it is the same argument as for mature students <e>", "<cs> we seem here to be running into a brick wall in government thinking <e> <s> i am trying to work out exactly what that brick wall may be <e> <s> i am wondering whether the problem that we have run into is the determination to apportion repayments exactly to the size of the individual borrowers debt whether we have once again hit what the noble earl had to expound to us so many times on the local government finance bill the principle of accountability <e> <s> is it not more trouble that it is worth <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness warmly for that reply <e> <s> those assurances are precise and specific and go right to the point desired <e> <s> i am delighted to accept them <e> <s> in the circumstances i happily beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have listened with interest to the noble baroness lady young <e> <s> i take her point about the difficulty in making everybody exceptions <e> <s> i hope that she will also take the point that here is an area where the government have to choose between two of their stated objectives <e>", "<cs> i was a little dismayed to hear the noble baroness quoting the per cent <e> <s> deferment provision as a protection for low paid professions <e> <s> i hope that she will assure the committee that that is not evidence of the governments thinking on the likely direction of teachers salaries <e> <s> since i believe i am right in saying that at the moment the starting salary of a university lecturer is low enough to obtain a student loan deferment perhaps one cannot be sure <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble viscount lord eccles for what he has said <e> <s> the oxford heads of colleges tell him exactly the same as my pupils tell me <e> <s> i know that it is late at night and i am mindful of the committees time but as this is an issue of quite considerable magnitude i hope that i shall be forgiven if i spend a few minutes on it <e>", "<cs> i wish to add one simple question to what the noble lord lord peston has said are the staff of the student loans company to be civil servants <e>", "<cs> we are in danger of having a clash between right and right <e> <s> with respect allowing for the point that the noble lord lord peston made about default sometimes being involuntary there is also force in what the minister said about defrauding the taxpayer <e> <s> i did not mean to say anything that suggested that i had no respect or understanding for that point <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the minister for that reply for which i am grateful <e> <s> i shall read what he said very carefully and i look forward with a great deal of interest to what he has to say on the subject at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if the government are to make a habit of tabling bills which they cannot convince us can be put into operation they must expect fairly lengthy discussions <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down does he accept that many of us believe that the words wrecking amendment are not nearly as appropriate as salvage amendment <e>", "<cs> i tabled amendment no <e> <s> with the intention of pressing it and incorporating it into the bill <e> <s> it does not seem appropriate to do so at the moment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with the noble earl about taxpayers money <e> <s> if there is to be a loan scheme at all the money must be recovered <e> <s> i will repeat that as many times as is needed <e> <s> i hope that all i was saying about the point of allowances was something that would be within the commercial practice of any normal banking manager of making as much allowance as is necessary for maximum efficiency in recovering the debt <e>", "<cs> that helps considerably and with that assurance i am happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords no one has suggested that the noble lord the lord privy seal is guilty of any dishonourable conduct <e> <s> he has behaved with impeccable honour <e> <s> our concern is not with honour it is with having sufficient time for business <e> <s> most noble lords specialise in a particular field <e> <s> i am not a specialist in consumer credit <e> <s> i should therefore want to take advice on that subject <e> <s> i should have hoped my noble friends who are expert in consumer credit might be here <e> <s> the house might consider the amendment more effectively if the noble lord were to accede however reluctantly to what the noble lord lord cledwyn asked <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has said much for which we can be grateful and indeed i am grateful to him <e> <s> however i share the misgivings of the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale about clause <e> <s> that is the clause which gives the minister power to amend primary legislation <e> <s> this is not a particularly heinous case in that respect <e> <s> however i believe that this is not something which should be undertaken lightly <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i made clear my basic point <e> <s> i shall not pursue it any further <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add one more name to the list of those who support these amendments but i shall be brief <e> <s> the amendments concern a considerable number of people <e> <s> i noted the point made in committee by the noble baroness lady young regarding oxford chemists <e> <s> however there is a general theme here <e> <s> the government have introduced a differential price tag for different courses <e> <s> if the government believe in their own principles they must believe that by making some courses more expensive than others they are creating a market in which there is an incentive to choose some courses rather than others <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down and before i reply can he clarify one matter <e> <s> does the expression average earnings mean as shown in the department of education and science leaflet or as he has just said <e> <s> is the discrepancy between these figures caused by an uprating from one year to another or by something else <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that helpful reply <e> <s> we have here a clash of opinions which we have met a good many times since the beginning of our discussions on the bill <e> <s> the minister is perfectly convinced that above per cent <e> <s> of average earnings the disincentive effect of repaying the loan does not operate <e> <s> a good many nobis lords think that there could be a considerable disincentive effect of having to repay the loan in the area between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> it seems to be an area on which there is not a meeting of minds <e> <s> i do not think it is worth pursuing the point on this amendment <e> <s> for the time being i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the noble lords pardon <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the noble baroness for that long and careful reply <e> <s> it makes a number of points of substance for which i am grateful <e> <s> i do not feel that it goes all the way to meet the situation <e> <s> i take for example the point about social security benefits continuing to be available to single parents <e> <s> without the child care disregard this concession is not of as much value as perhaps otherwise it might have been <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has not met my main concern <e> <s> i tried to spell that out at the beginning of my speech moving this amendment <e> <s> i am grateful for the opportunity to discuss resolutions under the affirmative procedure <e> <s> i wanted the opportunity to amend them <e> <s> that is the most important power that this house has <e> <s> throughout this bill i have noticed that the government have slightly different ideas of the functions of a revising chamber from those of the opposition parties <e> <s> as closely as i can follow it the governments idea is that they arrange for matters to be discussed they are graciously pleased to listen to what is said and then occasionally out of the goodness of their heart they make a small modification for which we are duly grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with a very large part of what the noble earl said <e> <s> i agree in principle with the statements that he made <e> <s> however i wish <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that this was a probing amendment <e> <s> i probed and i found a gaping hole <e> <s> i cannot see that the government have any procedure to recover loans from those who go abroad <e> <s> under those circumstances to claim that they intend to do so can only be a pious aspiration <e> <s> nevertheless because i agree with what the noble earl said namely that people who go abroad do not have any equitable claim to renege on their debts and because i agree with him that the house should not encourage them to do so i do not intend to press the amendment <e> <s> however i should like to put on record the fact that i think we have discovered a haemorrhage in the governments scheme which may well result in all the money leaking out of it and the scheme becoming inoperable <e> <s> however that is their problem <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i still do not altogether understand why the government are quite so determined to take students out of the social security system <e> <s> the main point that they seem to make consistently is that student support should come from educational sources <e> <s> i have no wish to argue with that point but the proper way to achieve that laudable objective is to pay students maintenance above benefit levels <e> <s> if the government can do that then any move to deprive students of social security entitlement is entirely redundant <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no comments to make on the last four amendments in this group <e> <s> however i wonder whether amendment no <e> <s> is necessary <e> <s> i have looked again at the bill schedule paragraph which states <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support these amendments <e> <s> i shall not elaborate on the points that the noble baroness made about the money that has already been spent <e> <s> i agree with them <e> <s> i will add only one small question to that about the managing director of the student loans company <e> <s> it struck me as curious that that post was advertised only in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my sympathy with the government for the predicament in which they have found themselves at such a late stage of the bill <e> <s> i can see that it is thoroughly upsetting and disturbing <e> <s> they have done their best to get out of the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down can he help us a little further <e> <s> are there any other provisions concerning minors which may come up and ambush this bill in the future <e> <s> if it is necessary for year-olds to ratify the loan on reaching their majority can he tell us whether any procedure has yet been devised to make sure that they do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> i must confess that i am still a little confused <e> <s> i do not quite see how the institution of the referee as described adds to the fact that parents normally forward their childrens post after they have left home <e> <s> simply conveying the information to the child or telling the child that he or she ought to pay the loan and putting pressure on him to do so is something that one might reasonably expect from any parent <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl very warmly for what he said in introducing the amendment <e> <s> i also have to say to the house that to my great regret i shall not be able to be at third reading since i shall be in america <e> <s> under those circumstances i hope that the house will forgive me for saying a very few words of what i might have said on the motion that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> on behalf of the liberal democrat benches i should like briefly and without unduly gilding the lily to add support to the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish first to take up my noble kinsmans remarks about the size of the social security budget <e> <s> i hope that by raising the matter now i shall save myself the need to run through the argument or times in committee which may bore your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will forgive me i did not say that this procedure had not been used for years <e> <s> it was last used in the education scotland act <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a very interesting and excellent debate to which i have listened with great care <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter put his finger on the key issue is this to be regarded as unacceptable delay and if so for what reason <e> <s> i entirely accept what the secretary of state said <e> <s> since the bill has been through both houses the student loans scheme should come into operation at the earliest practical moment <e> <s> however in my view the adjective contained in that statement deserves weight as well as the noun <e> <s> the question as to what is the earliest moment which is practical is one on which others as well as the secretary of state may be entitled to an opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords i hasten to reassure the noble baroness lady young and the noble lord lord henderson of brompton that i should not for one moment dream of questioning the speakers ruling either on grounds of authority or on grounds of competence <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly but warmly to add my support to the amendments <e> <s> a teaching hospital is a beast a little like a centaur <e> <s> it is both a university department and a hospital for treating patients <e> <s> if you wish to produce an immaculately turned out centaur you have to supply it with both a groom and a valet <e> <s> in this context i hesitate to suggest which might be which but it is our suspicion <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down perhaps she could answer a question raised by the <e>", "<cs> it is very simple <e> <s> i asked why the government have chosen not to continue the duty on hospitals to do research which exists in present law <e> <s> the point made by the noble lord lord walton was that the duty exists at present <e> <s> the government are causing it to cease to exist <e> <s> i wondered why <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to take up the suggestion of the noble lord lord underbill that a private members bill is not the appropriate method of proceeding in this matter <e> <s> the precedernts are against him <e> <s> when my great grandfather introduced the great reform bill in another place i admit that he did it from the government front bench <e> <s> however he was only in a position to do that because more times than i care to count he had introduced it as a private member and gone on and on until people were persuaded <e> <s> this is entirely the appropriate way to begin the consideration of an issue of this sort <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness caused me a little surprise by quoting my noble kinsman lord henley as saying that if the amendments were accepted the bill would be as thick as the white paper <e> <s> i have been looking at it i think it is already <e>", "<cs> i should like to add my support to these amendments particularly to amendment no <e> <s> zd <e> <s> my name should have been put to that amendment <e> <s> it is an oversight of my own that it is not but i should like

bringing back something which has been moved before and to which the government have said no <e> <s> that has been done for as long as parliaments have existed <e> <s> i hope that it will continue to be done for as long parliaments continue to exist <e> <s> the risk in bringing back business which has been discussed before is the risk of boring the committee <e> <s> noble lords are entitled to run

long debate on the uprating statement dealing with the amount of money that the government have in fact committed to the proposals <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness warmly for that comment <e>

as a probing amendment but it seems that i have found a good deal of confusion <e> <s> the difficulty on the government benches in understanding what the amendment is all about indicates that its tabling was well worthwhile and that we still need to find out why the government think that they are entitled to discriminate <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter suggested that by incorporating a general principle in legislation one might give rise to litigation <e> <s> i could not help wondering whether that was what king john said about magna carta <e>", "<cs> i wish to join

that the government intended to take away the concept of entitlement <e> <s> however the courts found that there was an entitlement <e> <s> this provision takes away peoples property rights something which parliaments have regularly viewed with some misgiving <e>", "<cs> if the government had simply said that they did not consider the social security system the most appropriate way of supporting students i would not have felt the need to argue with them <e> <s> the appropriate response to that belief if they had held it was to increase student support to a level which raised students above benefit levels in fact to float them off benefit <e> <s> the right honourable friend of the minister mr scott admits that the government have not done this <e> <s> in a letter he was kind enough to send to me on th april he stated <e>", "<cs> i am happy to support the amendment <e> <s> as the noble baroness said it does not merely relate to london <e> <s> throughout our debates on the subject

separate form from substance <e> <s> we shall have plenty of opportunity presently to discuss how well the social fund is or is not administered <e> <s> the proposal is concerned with the constitutional form in which the minister gives his directions <e> <s> what is at stake in this amendment is not whether the social fund is well or badly adminstered or whether its principles are right or wrong the question is whether it is under parliamentary control <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> i listened with interest to the speech of the noble lord lord jenkin of roding <e> <s> he seemed to have an allergy to the notion of single payments <e> <s> i have detected that before in other speeches from the government benches <e>", "<cs> i accept that the line has to be drawn somewhere <e> <s> however i do not quite follow why the government chose to draw it where they did <e> <s> the purpose of these grants is to assist people to re-establish themselves in the community as my noble kinsman said <e> <s> i do not understand why invalidity benefit disqualifes one from needing help to re-establish oneself in the community <e> <s> i should have thought that this was precisely the kind of case that the government intended <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> there may be circumstances which make it necessary to leave a job <e> <s> they may be very difficult to explain to a tribunal <e> <s> nevertheless it may sometimes be necessary to leave a job in order to maintain ones self respect <e> <s> any minister who has resigned on a point of principle is likely to understand that <e>", "<cs> i am sorry not to be told why the consent of the treasury is more essential than the consent of parliament but i did not expect to be told <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i cannot say that i am entirely satisfied with that reply but it is not quite so bad as the matter arising in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall not detain the committee for long <e> <s> as my noble kinsman said we debated these amendments on monday evening <e> <s> they were moved on tuesday evening and put to a division and the question was declared not decided <e> <s> the words to which i and my noble friends took exception appear in amendments nos <e> <s> and in proposed subsection b which states that cases <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for that reply <e> <s> it is the most encouraging reply i have received during the passage of the bill <e> <s> my noble kinsman has encouraged me to hope and i am delighted by that fact <e> <s> however i hope that he will forgive me for reminding him that hope deferred maketh the heart go sick <e> <s> i am happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down perhaps she will answer the very specific question i asked her <e> <s> was the teenager who refused a yts place because she could not complete the course behaving responsibly or not <e>", "<cs> i am beginning to think that richmond house is something of an ivory tower <e> <s> that reply does not come from the real world <e> <s> i can see no point of connection between that and the experiences of ordinary people <e> <s> the noble baroness said that she must not keep repeating that the guarantee of yts places is being honoured <e> <s> i agree with her <e> <s> she said that the rules are the same as those for availability for work <e> <s> i accept that <e> <s> but the cases are not parallel <e> <s> when one is already established in work one can continue to work for a few weeks if ones health permits <e> <s> if one is undertaking a course of training one cannot responsibly take that on unless one can complete the course <e> <s> by producing that argument the noble baroness creates a great deal of doubt in my mind about whether the yts is genuinely a training scheme <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness produced as a justification that for those over the rules for the yts were exactly the same as the rules for availability for work <e> <s> the noble baroness said that <e> <s> i think that i am right <e> <s> that seems to show complete indifference to the distinction between work and training <e> <s> one can work for a limited period of time and then leave at the end of that period <e> <s> one can work for a week and if one does ones job properly one has not wasted the time <e> <s> but if one is on a six-month training course for only three months one has wasted ones time <e> <s> i believe that the government are cocking a snook at the yts <e> <s> i commend the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i support my noble friends amendment <e> <s> i speak with a certain amount of feeling on this subject having once lived in a place in cornwall miles away from the nearest hospital <e> <s> i remember visiting that hospital on the day of the lynmouth floods <e> <s> it was in a place named swilly which seemed on that day quite peculiarly appropriate <e> <s> it has always been a real problem <e> <s> it is likely to become a much more real problem under the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of these benches i am glad to support the amendment <e> <s> it makes the vital point of providing a breathing space <e> <s> anyone who has advised young people in a crisis as any university teacher has must realise that that can be absolutely vital <e> <s> disasters which seem quite overwhelming if people have to carry on the next day as if nothing has happened seem a great deal smaller if there is a week or two in which to get on their feet and absorb and digest what has happened <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble kinsman sits down would he agree that the use of the perverse incentive in the context of going out to sleep rough credits teenagers with a degree of perversity worthy of the marquis de sade <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> this is another of a crop of amendments to which we come from time to time which deal with the difference between contributory and non-contributory <e> <s> the severe disablement allowance is lower because it is non-contributory <e>", "<cs> my lords on any matter concerned with parliamentary drafting one must listen with care to the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> i sympathise profoundly with his arguments against putting general principles into regulations <e> <s> he and i have often spoken together about the matter <e> <s> but it was not i who put the general principle into regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to contribute only one point on this amendment <e> <s> i wish to answer a question asked of me by the noble baroness lady blatch on th may <e> <s> she asked me to give detailed evidence of cases of people who had applied for yts places and were unable to obtain them <e> <s> i have a <e>", "<cs> my lords the case in favour of the amendment is that students cannot live on the amount of money available to them at present unless they are available for employment during the long vacation <e> <s> that is pretty well common ground among all the people who teach them <e> <s> in theory though i can understand the governments case here <e> <s> i understand the argument which says that they ought not to be available for employment during the long vacation <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the difficulties of definition are quite as grave as the <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been interested to see what a lively response the amendment has provoked <e> <s> it encourages me to think that it may have been of some importance and was worth putting down <e> <s> it appears to have ruffled so many feathers that it may have been rather useful <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment <e> <s> here we have a saving of some million and as a parliament it is proper that we should want to know what is happening to that money <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is of course correct as far as he goes <e> <s> however i do not think he has answered the underlying purpose of this amendment <e> <s> it is perfectly true that review is always taking place <e> <s> however some reviews are a great deal more serious comprehensive and substantial than others <e> <s> the opcs surveys are often mentioned by ministers in this house as a reason for not doing anything yet <e> <s> those surveys have built up a large body of expectation <e> <s> i believe the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter knows perfectly well that to build up a large body of political expectation that one is going to do something and then not do it may be rather unwise <e> <s> that is the real point behind this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> i am grateful for the sympathy for the principle of what we are trying to do <e> <s> i am glad that its helpful intent is recognised <e>", "<cs> my lords i become very puzzled by the governments resistance to the amendment <e> <s> it is a matter of plain common sense and i cannot understand what the point is which causes them to resist it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my support to the amendment the secretary of state is aware of the problem <e> <s> he has already taken some action but it is not sufficient to close the gap between the cost of residential homes and the amount which is given under income support <e> <s> we hope that the amendment will give more power to the secretary of states elbow <e>", "<cs> my lords i sympathise with what the noble baroness said about freedom of choice but is she also aware that in most fields certainly including my own the number of junior academic appointments available is so small that it is essential to advise postgraduates that if they wish for academic employment they must seek it abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak in support of the amendment and to ask the goverment whether they can recognise a pistol when they see one <e> <s> i have been looking at the fifth report of the select committee on social services of another place <e> <s> it quotes the royal college of nursing to the effect that carers are becoming a scarce resource for reasons that i believe i do not need to go into <e> <s> it also quotes and accepts the estimate that carers are at present saving the exchequer billion a year <e> <s> that is a considerable sum <e> <s> it is a level similar to that for the whole of the budget for defence and education <e> <s> if carers should lay down the burden ministers may then understand what i mean by a pistol <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to support the amendment <e> <s> treating a house as a capital asset is one of the absurdities of present financial thinking <e> <s> it accounts for much of the credit boom among other things <e> <s> even if it is an asset it is not a negotiable asset <e> <s> if people sell their house where will they live afterwards <e> <s> i remind my noble kinsman that we shall debate homelessness in a few moments <e> <s> he might find it rather expensive to turn this amendment down <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> it is a little less forthcoming than i had hoped but at least it offers me a crumb of comfort <e> <s> i must confess that i find it extremely difficult to see the precise line of difference between his honourable friends proposal and my own save only that his honourable friends proposal involves a proliferation of agencies <e> <s> i do not see that as being a great virtue <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the liberal democrat benches i support the amendment <e> <s> we agree with the noble baroness that weeks appears to be harsh <e> <s> it is approaching what might be described on the other side of the atlantic as cruel and unusual punishment <e> <s> we also agree that no state can encourage people wantonly to turn down jobs <e> <s> however we believe that the period is extreme <e> <s> we also agree with the noble baroness that it can be difficult for anyone outside the immediate circumstances to judge exactly a persons reasons for leaving a job <e> <s> there is a possiblity of error and therefore there is a need for a slightly less stringent punishment <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say what legal advice the government have received on the possibility of the charter becoming european law by majority vote <e> <s> further can he say in the event of it becoming law whether they will reconsider some of their comments on the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to extend the point made by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter to the st report of the joint committee on statutory instruments <e> <s> in my opinion that is an extremely helpful document and has resulted in improvements in these regulations which i welcome <e> <s> however if i had been teaching this morning as i might well have been i would have known nothing of that report until i arrived at the house almost ready to speak <e> <s> in future can the reports of the joint committee be made available a little sooner before we have to debate them <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness and the noble lord the lord privy seal for the consideration and courtesy with which they dealt <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the minister for a little clarification on this matter <e> <s> it is the policy of <e>", "<cs> my lords we need a little clarification here <e> <s> is it government policy that students should be supported at a level that makes it financially possible for them to manage without paid employment during term time <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation has changed slightly since we debated the amendment in report <e> <s> since then we have had the statement of nd june from the ministers honourable friend mr spicer on the problem of homelessness which takes us a little further forward <e> <s> by way of a written answer the ministers honourable friend said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to keep preventing my noble kinsman from sitting down but may i draw his attention to the fact that the cases to which i referred of people denied benefit because they were caring for sick parents or were ill are in the file which i sent to him on th june <e> <s> cases arising since march are being prepared and will be sent to him shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with interest to the noble lord lord renton and also the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter who made a similar point in relation to a previous amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton knows that i listened with interest when he made the point previously <e> <s> we have spoken privately about the subject <e> <s> the proposal is worth thought <e> <s> the difficulty is that we are led to believe that parliament is a sovereign body <e> <s> parliament may enact what it sees fit to enact <e> <s> the question is if parliament is not to act in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government consider the case for commissioning academics rather than consultants <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the liberal democrat benches i am happy to support this amendment <e> <s> it involves the status of judicial decisions and therefore the entitlement to review for other claimants which may arise as a consequence of a judicial decision <e>", "<cs> my lords it is sometimes maintained that family quarrels are more bitter than others <e> <s> i am deeply grateful to my noble kinsman for helping to ensure that that should not be so <e> <s> i am grateful to him for his unfailing courtesy his unfailing good humour and his care in dealing with points that have arisen and for keeping me on my toes by being like his predecessor in the office never more dangerous than when apparently on the ropes <e>", "<cs> reflecting on the difference between a half-full and a half-empty whisky bottle <e> <s> where i see a bottleneck i see people being impeded from getting out <e> <s> where the government see a bottleneck they see ravening hordes craving for benefits struggling to get in <e> <s> the government therefore try to make the bottleneck narrower and narrower i try to make it wider and wider <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we have lived beyond no popery i think that that is a bygone which we can allow to be bygone <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say two things <e> <s> first i join in the congratulations to the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth and also to the ministers right honourable friend the minister for the disabled <e> <s> this is a very welcome concession <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with everything that my noble kinsman has said about the privileges of another place <e> <s> i am well aware that each house is sovereign over its own privileges and that we have no more power here to discuss the privileges of another place than we have to put down amendments to change the education policy of the government of italy <e> <s> nevertheless i must excuse myself against any charge of having inadvertently misled the house in my speech of nd july which gave the impression that some members of this house might attempt to insist on these amendments <e> <s> i made that speech because i had not expected that amendments nos <e> <s> and would be covered by privilege <e> <s> i was mistaken <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the liberal democrat benches i express agreement with what the noble baroness lady turner of camden has said <e> <s> we believed that the proposals were wrong in principle misjudged in practice probably unworkable in execution and wide of their purpose in so far as they failed to distinguish between ordinary damages and damages for pain and suffering <e>", "<cs> when the noble baroness lady cox said that this may offer an objective test she expressed my misgivings about the amendment <e> <s> i can understand the desire for such an objective test but i cannot see an objective tester <e> <s> until i can i believe that the amendment savours of the utopian <e>", "<cs> i am not one of those to whom the noble baroness lady elles referred who considers impartiality impossible <e> <s> however i beg the supporters of these amendments to consider this <e> <s> the issue is more difficult than they imagine <e> <s> the key question was put by the noble lord lord barnett who will be the judge of impartiality <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the noble lord proposes that appeals should go to a collective body <e> <s> in some sense that must be a representative body <e> <s> the question then arises representative of what <e> <s> i hope that i do not need to continue <e> <s> the possible complexities are endless <e>", "<cs> my lords will her majestys government consider the possibility that they might have fewer unexpected shortfalls as regards the funding of the national health service if they were to base funding on the actual inflation figure of the previous year rather than on forecasts of inflation for the coming year which almost invariably prove to be optimistic <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord to withdraw the phrase spanish practices <e> <s> it is an unfriendly phrase to a friendly nation and moreover i believe it is incorrect <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped to save the time of the house by not developing that argument <e> <s> among many recent examples this procedure was used in by lord duncan-sandys on the town and country planning order to prevent roads being put through national parks <e> <s> that motion was pressed to a division <e> <s> it was won and the government did what was asked <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make a small correction <e> <s> i base my figures on my own experience <e> <s> i believe that the national union of students understated its case <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble kinsman for that reply <e> <s> it contained no surprises <e> <s> he asked why i did not table this motion on th june <e> <s> the answer is as the noble baroness lady blatch made perfectly clear that it was not then certain what was to happen to students social security entitlement <e> <s> this is the first time that the total package of

couple of days any great breathlessness <e> <s> i am glad to note that the secretary of state has argued a case to the treasury for meeting the costs of inflation <e> <s> inflation is of course the dominant theme of the statement <e> <s> inflation is very expensive indeed from the governments point of view <e> <s> one begins to wonder after this passage of time how far the government have ideas
