["<cs> my lords i have time for only one short point <e> <s> i hope it will please the noble lord lord kings norton <e> <s> i have been invited to draw your lordships attention to the formation of yet one more voluntary organisation called the english language society shortly it is hoped to become the english language foundation the sole purpose of which is to combat the very corruptions and deteriorations which we have been debating today <e> <s> as i have no interest to declare other than admiration for the energy and enthusiasm of the young founders of this society i should be glad to send their name and address to any noble lord who might feel like supporting them <e> <s> i am grateful to them for reminding me of just one quotation which i hope i shall be allowed <e> <s> it is not in mandarin chinese but it is from confucius <e> <s> it seems that he was once asked by his disciples what he would do first if he were to have the power to set right the affairs of his country <e> <s> he answered <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that one of the reasons for the troubles of the british textile industry might be the fact that for too long too many of our manufacturers have been adding too little value in terms of design and innovation <e> <s> if he were to agree with that would he perhaps be prepared to study the device adopted by the canadian ministry of industry and commerce to encourage canadian manufacturers to invest a bit more in design and development <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister whether he is satisfied that if the recommendations of the whitford committee are accepted they will compare favourably with the practices adopted in other european countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord spens for suggesting that i might take part in this debate for it gives me an opportunity to air for six minutes just two topics namely design and craftsmanship <e> <s> the role and status of design in british industry are to my mind subjects which deserve a debate to themselves but i think design is also relevant to the motion before us this evening <e> <s> surely the most important question facing british industry is what to make not how much how cheaply or how quickly but simply what <e> <s> and that cannot properly be answered without the designer <e> <s> so pursuing the plea of the noble lord lord spens for positive steps i would urge the government to do all in their power to stimulate and enhance design in british industry through better education of designers and manufacturers alike through intelligent promotion and propaganda and most effectively of all perhaps through <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he is aware that the royal fine art commissioners view this development with the utmost dismay <e>", "<cs> my lords if this mas is offered free of cost to small firms may i ask why the design councils design advisory service is charged for <e> <s> in other words is the product not as important as its production <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that the design councils design advisory service as the minister will be aware is also a dependency of the department of industry <e> <s> why is that service charged for whereas the manufacturing advisory service is not charged for <e>", "<cs> my lords what plans do the government have to improve still further the standard of design of the products of british industry that are intended for export <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for that answer which does not surprise me <e> <s> may i ask whether he is aware that the decision of british airways not only runs counter to the prime ministers many admirable initiatives in the field of design but has greatly discouraged the whole of the british design profession and not least our very excellent graphic designers <e> <s> is it not sad that the organisation which has been exhorting us all to fly the flag should set such a bad example <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we would all wish to congratulate the right reverend prelate the bishop of ripon on his maiden speech and also the royal society of arts the royal society for the encouragement of arts manufactures and commerce for its initiative in organising industry year <e> <s> however as has already been said one year is not enough it is too short a time <e> <s> a decade or a century would more justly meet our needs for the purpose of the year is in the words of sir geoffrey chandler its director to attack our inherited culture and our set of attitudes which put industrial activity at the bottom of the social pecking order <e> <s> to attack our national culture patterns is asking quite a lot even though they are the root cause of our relative industrial decline <e> <s> but ralf dahrendorf once said that an effective economic strategy for britain will probably have to begin in the cultural sphere <e>", "<cs> i strongly support the amendments <e> <s> i speak as a former governor of the royal college of art <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> i believe that i should declare an interest <e> <s> for many years this was some time ago i was a director of the design council <e> <s> at that time i should have been very pleased by the answer <e> <s> however i gather that the design council not only receives a much larger grant in aid now than it did but that it is also much more dependent on the goodwill of the dti <e> <s> i therefore ask the government to reveal a little more about its relationship with the design council <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> i should like to ask him two questions <e> <s> first does he think that it is appropriate for a rich nation to depend on such low grade commercial devices for the protection of a museum containing the worlds finest collection of artefacts <e> <s> secondly will the same solution be adopted when the time comes to clean the victoria tower of this palace <e>"]
