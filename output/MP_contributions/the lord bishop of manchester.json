["<cs> my lords it is by no means easy to speak on the complex and controversial matter of airports policy in a maiden speech while observing the long-established conventions of this house but i am encouraged by the splendid example which has been given by the noble lord lord sanderson who has also made his maiden speech today <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord beloff has referred to the fuss bother and commotion that has gone on over this business <e> <s> i would suggest that this is not simply because it is rather fun discussing other peoples salaries but because it points to wider and deeper implications in society <e> <s> i accept the point which has been made earlier that this is neither the time nor the place to discuss incomes policy in general but this matter must surely relate to it and to how we organise ourselves in british society at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that that is precisely why i said that it was the task of governments to set the decisions of a review body into the overall national context <e>", "<cs> my lords on a point of personal explanation did the noble lord the minister hear me when i said that i did not understand that the cabinet had agonised over this <e> <s> it was not simply a matter of discussing it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister has made the point of the governments commitment to equality of opportunity regardless of race in matters of employment but some of us would value an assurance that the kind of surveys we have been seeing recently about discrimination over jobs are being taken seriously by government together with the enormous problems which are being faced by young blacks in particular in inner urban areas in obtaining employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the opportunity to speak in support of the bill which has been moved by the noble lord lord hatch for a number of reasons <e> <s> first i would remind your lordships of the way in which the bill is framed <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness agree that in fact from all reports the majority of leaders of the commonwealth countries were pressing for measures of the kind envisaged in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to have been able to come down from manchester today to attend this debate and not least for hearing the maiden speech of the noble lord lord mellish which i greatly enjoyed as did the rest of your lordships <e> <s> i have problems in getting back tonight and i crave the indulgence of your lordships and particularly the noble lord the minister who will reply if i am not present at the end of this long debate <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that most responsible leaders of nationalist black opinion in south africa are against this continued level of investment from western countries which they believe is perpetuating an unjust and oppressive regime <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord agree that the whole point of this is to show that there is a difference in character between sunday trading and that which goes on in the rest of the week <e> <s> the point that he is making about the growth of small businesses and the need to encourage them is much more applicable to what goes on in the rest of the trading week than what is proposed for a sunday <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware as regards the cbi forecast that whether the decline in the rate of job losses is faster or slower the fact is that a very high proportion are losses in the older manufacturing areas of the north of england <e> <s> are the steps being taken to try to halt this decline constantly under review especially in view of the fact that the take-up in the service industries is often comparatively slow <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will allow me to interrupt at this point <e> <s> i am sorry to interrupt him but while he is proceeding down this track and i defer to his greater knowledge in this field is it not the case that local newspapers are in business precisely for this type of purpose that is inserting notices which people can read if they are concerned <e> <s> surely that is a way of consulting local interests <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord the minister in full flow but as he is arguing so eloquently against the local authority option and in favour of this being a national responsibility can he explain to the committee very clearly why it is that members of parliament and peers are not being allowed to make a decision on these fundamental matters at national level in response to the feelings of their constituents and of those with whom they are in touch <e> <s> does the noble lord recognise that it simply is not adequate to show the difficulties of the local authority option without answering that question <e> <s> may i further ask him to comment on whether he is aware that some of us who <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships will be very grateful to hear this piece of potentially good news from the noble earl the minister <e> <s> as he is probably aware the poundswick school is in the diocese of manchester for which i have a responsibility <e> <s> my colleague the dean of manchester cathedral has been one of those engaged in trying to find some solution to this tragic and difficult dispute which has caused a great deal of disruption to education there <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble earl the minister whether he will accept that this is as has already been suggested an indication of low morale among many teachers which goes much wider than poundswick <e> <s> one reason for low morale is the problem of discipline in secondary schools and the need for continued research into ways of dealing most fairly and adequately with disruptive pupils <e> <s> some of this may cost money in the nature of special units and visits to homes <e> <s> i should like to be assured that there will be an effort to take on board whatever lessons there are to be learned from this sad dispute at poundswick <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships would wish me to express appreciation to the noble lord lord walston for mounting this debate and introducing it in this way and for all the work which he has done on this all party group and for his part in the production of this most valuable report <e>", "<cs> my lords may i venture to interrupt on a point of explanation so as to make clear that what i was saying was that population and rapid growth in population are caused by poverty <e> <s> the illustration which i gave shows how the attitude to having large numbers of children in these societies is because of insecurity particularly of people in old age or high rates of infant mortality in the past and things of that kind <e> <s> i was simply trying to make the point that it is no good targeting population as the cause of poverty when it is the other way round <e>", "<cs> my lords if i am not in my place at the end of the debate to listen to the noble lord the minister and to the noble lord lord bottomley as the debate concludes i hope that they will forgive me <e> <s> it depends on when the debate finishes but the train for manchester calls <e> <s> when the noble lord the minister does reply i hope there will be no complacency over this issue because as has been shown during the debate a critical situation faces a large number of very worthwhile organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he would accept that sometimes with the best will in the world district authorities might wish to fund certain bodies yet the pressures to which they are subject do not really make it possible <e>", "<cs> my lords the tone of this debate is thoughtful and sombre and i think there is an appreciation on the part of all those who have spoken so far of the desperate urgency of the situation in south africa and also an appreciation that the problems of south africa will be solved inside that country and that what can be done from outside is necessarily limited <e> <s> i am not sure that the appreciation is general among us though that many of the things which have featured prominently in the debate in recent years about the iniquities of apartheid are now beginning to disappear from the scene as major factors and that what really is at stake is a struggle for power a struggle for human freedom a struggle for dignity <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been reminded already that we last debated namibia in the sanctions bill in october last year <e> <s> it was significant then that this was the th anniversary year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that swapo has support not simply from one tribe but from many tribes ethnic groups in namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way i do not really want to prolong this but i must ask him whether he knows of any independent struggle in history which has not been accompanied by tragic acts of violence on both sides <e> <s> what is happening in namibia as we know well is a struggle for independence and freedom <e> <s> inevitably there are some atrocities committed under swapo auspices yet it was the testimony of people i met there that the overwhelming majority of such incidents were coming from the south african defence forces <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever the noble and learned lord lord denning says about whether the proposal is commercially desirable the amendment fits into wider regional policy <e> <s> we had a short and quite spirited debate on unemployment a short time ago when the secretary of state for employment declared how vital it was to deal with long-term unemployment <e> <s> he also talked about the older industries declining in certain areas of which the north-east and the north-west of britain are two <e>", "<cs> my lords some years ago archbishop william temple wrote in a book entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say to what extent the government are taking account of widespread disparities in the effect of long-term unemployment in different parts of the country and how far the scheme that he has outlined relates to that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister indicate whether there is also concern in government circles apart from linking pay and productivity over the fact that very large sums of money are paid out regularly to certain individuals in this country sometimes running to more than a year with large percentage increases <e> <s> will he agree that this has a very considerable psychological effect in the popular mind and that it makes it difficult to encourage pay restraint among those who are comparatively low paid <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord dean of beswick in this amendment <e> <s> i appreciate that we are at the report stage and that long speeches are not welcome or necessary at this stage <e> <s> however there are a number of things in the bill as a whole about which i am unhappy <e> <s> in regard to the clothing industry and textile workers i am remided of a recent visit to india and of going round a textile factory there <e> <s> many indian workers exist in appalling conditions in these small factories <e> <s> speaking to the employer at the end i asked him about the sitution as regards unions so far as his workers were concerned <e> <s> he lifted his eyes to heaven and said thank god we have no unions in this factory <e> <s> it seemed to me then that one could see in the textile factories of india very much what things must have been like in manchester salford and other cities where much of britains wealth was created in this industry back in the th century <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for his helpful reply <e> <s> i have been encouraged to read the positive comments of the manchester council for community relations in their reports on procedures at heathrow airport in which they spoke of the sensitivity and understanding which immigration officers can and do bring to their work <e> <s> the fact remains that on a recent tour of india <e>", "<cs> my lords can the mnister tell us whether the government have taken note of the very strong resolution by the church of england general synod at its meeting on monday about the need for strong economic measures against south africa in the present crisis by this and other countries and of that as an expression of opinion among the churches and among the people in britain at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the very beneficial effects of this remarkable development in hip operations my wife is just recovering from one also underlines the need to persuade people to pay more taxes to improve the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i support lord aveburys motion and am very grateful to him for bringing it forward <e> <s> the noble lord lord reay has rightly pointed us to the background to todays pressure of people wanting to come to britain for whatever reason <e> <s> without wishing to be unduly personal about the average age of the house of your lordships i suspect that the great majority of us grew up in the last days of the british empire and we realise all too well that it is because of those days of empire and not least because of the english language that the very considerable number of people from commonwealth countries as the empire evolved into commonwealth have come to live and work here <e> <s> many of them came in the days of the industrial boom in some ways a false industrial boom when after the war they were wanted in our countrys factories and many of them in the health service and the other fields of british life <e>", "<cs> my lords much is being said in this debate about the north-south divide and especially about deprivation in the older industrial areas in the country <e> <s> the first point i should like to make is that the northern areas are wonderful places in which to live if you have the money wonderful scenery excellent road networks especially around greater manchester where i live warm and friendly people including many from the ethnic and cultural minorities who enrich our common life <e> <s> but there is no doubt at all about the disparities we have in this country <e> <s> as has rightly been said there have been growing disparities between the comparatively affluent south-east and other regions in britain <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister appreciate that in namibia there are representative black voices calling for the implementation of such sanctions in the interests of speeding the independence process <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment because surely it is in the interest of all of us to consider the morale of men and women in the teaching profession at the present time <e> <s> whatever our opinions may be about the bill itself and it is now at an advanced stage it has undoubtedly caused a great deal of disquiet in the teaching profession <e> <s> if this amendment were passed it would be a concession towards those who feel very upset by what they regard as an interference with their negotiating rights <e> <s> it is surely in the interests of all of us <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that it is inadequate to draw a parallel between terrorism in regard to single ferry boats and the channel tunnel which could be a prime target of a very different order <e>", "<cs> my lords i now have the difficult task of bringing your lordships thoughts back to the important question of unemployment <e> <s> we should all be very grateful indeed to the noble lord lord mccarthy for putting this motion before us <e> <s> i do not want to get involved in the argument about the statistics of unemployment but the importance of statistics is very great in any field <e> <s> perhaps i may be permitted to say also that all governments need watching over the matter of statistics whatever the field may be <e> <s> it is very easy to be persuaded to make statistics which are less than favourable come out in a better light <e> <s> one of the best features of british society is that we are served so well with statistics at present <e> <s> long may that continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord in this assault but is he in fact denying that in areas of very high unemployment in this country there are many young people who are looking for work who are disappointed and that when vacancies are advertised say in the hotel trade there are many who queue up for those jobs and do not get them <e> <s> i do not understand <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am very grateful to the noble lord lord mayhew for tabling the motion though discussion of thermonuclear weaponry has a certain nightmare quality about it when one talks about the number of casualties or the number of warheads that each side possesses <e> <s> i should like to focus on the word dangers thinking of dangers not only as physical dangers or the dangers of an outbreak of this terrible conflict but as dangers to our consciences <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that while sharing the deep concern felt by the noble lord lord molloy over mr terry waite concern which i am sure is felt by everyone in this house it would not be helpful at this stage to go further into this matter because things may well be going on behind the scenes of which we have little knowledge <e> <s> the situation is delicate and the government should not be pressed further upon this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my very pleasant duty to congratulate most warmly the noble and gallant lord lord bramall on his contribution to our debate this afternoon <e> <s> he speaks out of a great wealth of military experience and indeed his presence here shows the invaluable part played by the forces of the crown in the life of our country <e> <s> he has shown this very deep concern for peace and also a perhaps not unexpected flash of biblical knowledge <e> <s> i hope it does not come from listening to all those lessons read at the funerals he has been attending <e> <s> we do indeed very much welcome the noble lord among us and we look forward to many more contributions of this kind in the years ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by apologising to the noble lord lord hesketh owing to the length of the statement i may not be in my place at the end of the evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful too for the opportunity to debate the green paper <e> <s> i believe that trade unions play a very vital role in our society these days <e> <s> i am very conscious that the issues raised in the green paper are complex and that there are people present in your lordships house who have lived with them perhaps from both sides of industry and commerce for many years <e> <s> we have already benefited from hearing some views and i look forward in particular to hearing the maiden speech of the noble lord lord basnett <e> <s> i am not quite sure how long this debate will go on <e> <s> your lordships might say that that rests partly in my hands along with other speakers <e> <s> i should like however to apologise to the noble lord lord young if i am not in my place for the concluding stages <e> <s> i hope to be here but i shall have to see how it goes <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say to the noble lord lord denham who is now present that i was speaking of the value of party whips at least on one point of view <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will listen carefully to the arguments behind this amendment and others to come <e> <s> unfortunately i was not able to be present at the debate on second reading so i had to refer to <e>", "<cs> there seems to be one good reason why the government should accept the amendment or why the minister should give it careful consideration <e> <s> there are surely cases under present regulations where the british government themselves require the co-operation of carriers where people are being deported against their will <e> <s> in such a case surely we would not welcome the kind of legislation from a foreign government that put penalties on the carrier for doing precisely that <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment as strongly as i can <e> <s> i was moved by the opening speech of the noble lord lord mcnair <e> <s> it set the arguments before us very powerfully <e> <s> i must confess that i do not understand the argument of the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> he says how can we accommodate all the unfortunate people from other parts of the world <e> <s> i thought that the object of the bill as explained by the minister and others was not to keep out genuine refugees and those who are in grave or immediate danger <e> <s> am i wrong on that point <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for giving way <e> <s> i cannot follow his argument <e> <s> a well-founded fear of persecution would include grave or immediate danger <e> <s> i would regard that as being wider than grave or immediate danger <e> <s> perhaps the noble earl can explain how these two are <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness agree that in the light of the swing to the right in the white south african elections and the deteriorating situation throughout southern africa it is of the greatest importance that her majestys government show sympathy for those who appear to speak for the oppressed people in southern africa of whom the african national congress and swapo for namibia are among the chief <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to congratulate the noble baroness lady stedman on her choice of subject and also on the splendid speech with which she introduced this debate <e> <s> as the noble lord lord hatch indicated questions of the environment are of very great gravity indeed and they call for an all-party approach <e>", "<cs> my lords we are moving towards the end of a long debate <e> <s> i feel sorry for those who are even further down the batting order than i am <e> <s> if we had a captain of the side i suspect that he would say go and hit out get out quickly and make some runs <e> <s> how your lordships interpret that remains to be seen <e> <s> i do not think that any one of us would resent the time that we are giving to this vital subject in the life of our country <e> <s> we are all grateful to the noble lord lord windlesham for tabling the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his intervention <e> <s> i intend to refer in my remarks to phoenix and to weary your lordships with a short quotation from its literature on that precise point <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that <e> <s> i believe that the elected council is now prepared to work within the law <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord will have noted the statements of the liverpool church leaders on this very point <e>", "<cs> my lords a new realism has emerged in many townhalls throughout the country <e> <s> even those with massive labour majorities have been recognising publicly the need to work with private industry and they are increasingly prepared to co-operate with central government <e> <s> my own city of manchester a part of my diocese is an example <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagine that the minister may have rather mixed feelings about the various congratulations which have been poured on his head <e> <s> the task which he is undertaking is seen to be from some points of view a real bed of nails <e> <s> however i have no doubt that he has a tough hide and i join with others in wishing him well in the months and years ahead <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to interrupt the noble lord again <e> <s> i know that he has had a number of interruptions <e> <s> will he accept that there is a middle path between doing nothing and enacting legislation namely that these things are often fought out on an individual level by pressure from parents and in other ways <e>", "<cs> the bishop of ripon was speaking essentially about ordination to the priesthood in the church of england <e> <s> i fully support him on that <e>", "<cs> my lords many of us will be glad to hear the ministers response and to learn that representations have been made in private <e> <s> can he also give us some assurance that when government ministers at any level go on official visits to countries where human rights are in question no impression will be given that everything in those countries is in order but there should be a public indication to make people aware of the anxieties which have been caused by the policies of such governments <e>", "<cs> i cannot follow an act like that <e> <s> however i should like to ask the minister one question <e> <s> i apologise if the point has been made before during the debate as i am sure it has <e> <s> the amendment states <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for giving way but as he is unable to attend the whole debate perhaps he will forgive me for asking whether he accepts that there should be a limit to those disparities in income to which he referred <e>", "<cs> my lords in days of old when knights were bold we used to have an organisation known as the prices and incomes board <e> <s> it tried to secure some fairness in the distribution of resources <e> <s> although there may be differing views about its effectiveness the chairman after he had finished this work wrote a book and a passage from it is i believe relevant to the debate we are having this afternoon <e>", "<cs> i should like to say why i feel that i should support the amendment <e> <s> i am sure that all sides of the committee appreciate that we are dealing with real people <e> <s> although the numbers affected by the proposed legislation are comparatively small these people form a significant group in the life of our country <e> <s> the point about family life and the strengthening of family life is important whether it applies to many or to few <e>", "<cs> my lords reference has been made during this statement and questions to the minister to the role of the churches <e> <s> i am sure that we all recognise that they have a part to play <e> <s> one thing for which we can be profoundly grateful is the increasingly good relationships between christian leaders in the republic of ireland and northern ireland although the bitter divisions between the communities are still all too apparent <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord whether the struggle against terrorism which has to go on constantly is in any way going to impede the search for political solutions because we realise that this is fundamental to the whole tragic situation in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that behind this question lies the fact that a terrible war continues affecting the people of namibia <e> <s> they look to the people of this country for support and one of the most effective means of giving that support is to bring economic pressure to bear on the south african government <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the minister about those who deceive immigration officers and whether it is quite as simple as that <e> <s> is it not possible to envisage cases and i am sure that there have been quite a number in recent years where people have come in as visitors without the intention necessarily to overstay <e> <s> then later on they have transgressed in that way <e> <s> i am sure that none of the noble lords here is supporting those who break the law in this way <e> <s> but the question of some right of appeal seems to be at stake in such cases <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment and i should like to draw attention to the fact that recently there was some controversy between the present home secretary and leaders of the british council of churches over precisely that point <e> <s> the british council of churches issued a briefing on the immigration bill in which it accused the bill of being racist <e> <s> that briefing said <e>", "<cs> if i may say so that is a difficult matter to determine <e> <s> there is evidence to show that racial prejudice is higher in areas where there are very few black people than in areas where there are substantial numbers of black people in spite of the pressures on housing and jobs <e> <s> however i take the point that none of us here would stand for an open policy of immigration <e> <s> that is not what we are talking about <e> <s> we are talking about people who are related to black british citizens who should be allowed to enter the country without being at a disadvantage when compared to ec nationals <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond to the point that is constantly being made by the noble earl when he says that one must not confuse immigration policy with what happens over <e>", "<cs> yes about which you have yourself said <e>", "<cs> my lords the quality of some speeches that we have heard today is ample justification for this debate on the national health service <e> <s> without being invidious perhaps i may be allowed to say that i particularly appreciate those who speak with detailed knowledge of medical care like the noble baroness lady cox <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord hatch for tabling this question and i look forward with some anxiety to the reply from the minister <e> <s> i think it is true that ritual condemnations of apartheid are no longer enough in this very grave and serious situation that faces south africa the world and our own country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the minister <e> <s> however it is difficult to follow the logic of the argument that certain measures adopted by her majestys government are said to have been sending signals to pretoria and at the same time any further sanctions will he counterproductive <e> <s> what makes one course productive and the other counterproductive <e> <s> i do not follow that <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister appreciate that as the easter egg is a symbol of new life it is entirely appropriate that vat should be charged as a sign of the importance of taxation in the life of our country <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to confess to the noble lord lord ezra that a comparatively short time ago i was in a large coach i presume it was unregulated which was struggling towards westminster abbey <e> <s> we left manchester this morning shortly after seven oclock and had a comparatively smooth run down the m and the m <e> <s> then the horrors of getting into the <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he assure the house that he has listened to the very considerable volume of evidence and criticism of the way in which deregulation of buses has been working or not working especially as this affects some of the poorest members in our society <e> <s> i detected a note of complacency about what had been said <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a word in support of the amendment but first i recognise that we are faced with a very cruel dilemma behind this whole discussion because the principle of greater parental choice is obviously a very good one from many points of view and is something which we <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will very kindly give way <e> <s> i made it clear that i appreciate the concern of parents for the education of their children <e> <s> i did not imply that they made necessarily bad choices <e> <s> i am concerned about the restriction of the freedom of parents where schools in inner city areas and on council estates suffer from great social pressure <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support the amendment although quite obviously the same arguments which we had earlier on in the afternoon could also be introduced on this amendment <e> <s> the point seems to me to be that it will make it easier for educational planning <e> <s> i plead that there should be some consideration given to the task which faces those who have to implement educational policies locally <e> <s> i hope very much that the noble baroness will give some encouragement here so that the process of increased parental choice does not go to extremes in any given area <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down can he tell us why it is that there is the necessary delay for inner london which does not apply to some other parts of the country <e> <s> one of the matters which is of very deep concern is getting sufficient people who are prepared to serve and give the time on school boards of governors and also giving them the resources to back the financial administration <e>", "<cs> the minister may be unduly optimistic in saying that these additional burdens will not be so great as may be supposed <e> <s> it seems to many of us that what is being delegated particularly on the financial side will involve great pressures on the governors <e> <s> their support and training which we have already considered are vital <e>", "<cs> that is why i referred to the burdens of industry i meant paid time <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there has been a good deal of informed press comment by those who know southern africa well indicating that there seems to be no intention on the part of the south african government to make such a settlement along the lines of the security council resolution and that there is a necessity for negotiation to be accompanied by effective economic pressure on the south african government <e>", "<cs> i shall try to reply to one or two of the points made by the noble baroness lady young <e> <s> it is correct to say that behind the amendment lies a deep concern about the whole principle of opting out and grant-maintained schools <e> <s> it would of course be difficult to deny that fact <e> <s> yet the fact of the matter is that presumably a great majority of members of the committee have accepted that that is the intention of the other place <e> <s> somehow it must be made as effective as possible if it is to succeed <e>", "<cs> no i do not think i am confusing the issue at all <e> <s> i have already said that we recognise that there is this process and that that is generally respected <e> <s> i am saying that the initial vote is a most important one and therefore it should not be taken on a simple majority <e> <s> one of the points which i think is difficult for us to recognise is that many parents find it hard to proceed on the basis of postal ballots they do not live in that sort of world <e> <s> this concept is very remote if i may say so from the kind of world which most of us inhabit <e> <s> we must have as clear a perception as we possibly can as to what postal voting actually means to parents in inner-city schools on large council estates or wherever they may live <e>", "<cs> i should like to say briefly why i think that the noble baroness lady cox is completely wrong on this matter and why i believe that the powerful and moving speech we heard a few moments ago from the noble lord lord stewart has the elements of the right way forward for the education system of this country <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble lord on a small point which may carry implications <e> <s> can we use the words ethnic minorities rather than immigrants <e>", "<cs> i hope very much that the committee will not pass amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble baroness lady cox <e> <s> i should like to say something about that first and then come back to the points which the noble lord lord young put before the committee so forcefully this afternoon on the need for greater freedom of choice and variety in schools <e> <s> there are one or two hard questions that he needs to answer on this way forward <e>", "<cs> without wearying the committee the short reply to the noble baroness is that i have never denied that there may be dissatisfaction in certain areas with some lea provision <e> <s> there will always be a head of steam from certain groups which wish to set up their own schools <e> <s> that is undeniable <e> <s> however the factor which she completely ignored is the much more important factor causing falling rolls demographic change and movements of population <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is very persuasive but i am afraid i shall not be with him in the lobby on this amendment <e> <s> the reason is the linking of the bill with the amendment in the name of the noble baroness lady cox amendment no <e> <s> which has to do with the whole question of how local education authorities do their job <e>", "<cs> when making her response to those comments would the minister confirm first that the governments view is in sympathy in general with what is stated in this amendment to be the aims of higher education in these items in subsection a to h secondly that those aims do not appear elsewhere in the bill in relation to the purposes of higher education and thirdly so far as concerns the act there is no specific reference to those aims in connection with higher education <e> <s> it seems to me that those who moved this amendment have made their case for something along those lines as a guide for the aims of higher education <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment as strongly as i can before the noble and learned lord replies <e> <s> it seems to me that as the schedule is drafted at the moment the words <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that because the original meaning of the word holiday is holy day there may be a case for re-opening the discussion with the churches whatever may have taken place years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in many urban areas there is an impression that public transport and bus transport in particular has declined in quality <e> <s> many passengers do not know about the timetables and frequency of the buses <e> <s> some of these minibus routes after making a start have been taken off because they were not profitable <e>", "<cs> my lords it sometimes helps to put the enormous problems of africa into a historical context <e> <s> i have been reading a book recently about the lancashire cotton famine back in the last century <e> <s> that may seem a long way from the problems of africa in the th century <e> <s> i think it is worth a mention because that is one example of the terrible situation that prevailed in britain during the years when industrial wealth was being created at the time of the industrial revolution and when there were various cycles of trade which brought enormous suffering and hardship <e> <s> some of the case studies in that book are the kind of things which are very similar to what we have been seeing on our television screens about africa today <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down can she comment on press reports which have indicated that over the past few years not only has the overseas aid programme been slashed four times as hard as government expenditure as a whole but also that if the programme had continued in the same way and at the same level as in we would now be spending million a year more on overseas aid <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister assure the house that there is a proper understanding in government circles that it costs money not only for the keep britain tidy group but especially for local authorities <e> <s> it is no good <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there are quite different interpretations of the figures on scottish churchgoing as just given to us by the noble lord lord campbell of croy <e> <s> moreover very many people in this country believe that there is a halfway house between the chaotic situation of sunday laws as we have them at present and the complete deregulation now being advocated in some quarters <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that all of us will agree with the noble earl lord ferrers that this is a very important issue and it is right that your lordships house should have an opportunity to debate it <e> <s> the fundamental point of principle lying behind this is the matter is this how far should a democratic society go in sacrificing its freedoms in order to fight terrorism <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he take the opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for giving way <e> <s> the churches have made clear their abhorrence of terrorism <e> <s> however surely the point is that at the moment sinn fein is a legal organisation for which a large number of people have voted <e> <s> therefore it enters into the picture of those who are able to present the injustices faced by their people especially as these occur in the minds of many people in the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give any indication of how the figure that he has quoted as regards investment in roads compares with investment in railways including perhaps digital clocks <e> <s> can the minister also say whether the government are adequately aware of the dangers of pressing ahead with a road policy without at the same time trying to get more people back on to public transport <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that if we abolish all wages councils and all such protection we are encouraging the inefficient use of labour and that many employers do not want to see such restrictions abolished <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord mean that taking the whips off applies to the government side too <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter as a good churchman undoubtedly looked at his ecclesiastical calendar and decided that ash wednesday would be a suitable day for penance and for us all to gather together and hear the arguments all over again <e> <s> however i think that there have already been many benefits in the debate <e> <s> it has cut across the parties which is always refreshing <e> <s> that is one reason why i believe that if the matter should come to the vote again it should be on the basis of a free vote in the other place <e> <s> we have also had some fascinating insights into how various noble lords spend their sundays <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will forgive me but i think that that is irrelevant to the main argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i was talking about the strength of opposition generally in this country to complete deregulation <e> <s> the fact that at the moment some cathedrals are going down that path does not in any sense counter the argument completely <e> <s> one may have different views as to the way in which they manage those shops <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a bit of both but it was without doubt enforced by law <e> <s> new delhi is a good example of this as are other indian cities where the practice is also taken into account in local regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that is possible <e> <s> there is no doubt that even if there were a great deal of revulsion after five years it would be impossible to go back <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that when one says there is no pressure on the big stores to open in scotland the fact that some do automatically puts pressure on others <e> <s> is this not one factor in the truth that the number of stores opening in particular in edinburgh is now rising <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister will allow me to make the point that i thought it was absolutely clear that i said i had no desire to leave things exactly as they now are and nor did the churches <e> <s> the point was that conserving what is best means moving into a new situation and managing change instead of merely being driven by it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a very quick intervention to make <e> <s> the rest proposals would make what the deans and chapters are doing entirely legal <e> <s> that is a point of view with which i am sure the noble lord should agree <e>", "<cs> my lords my only qualifications for making a brief contribution to the debate are first that i come from a diocese in which we have cities and towns that have similar circumstances to those in bradford in such matters as unemployment urban deprivation and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord the minister would give way for just a moment <e> <s> if the situation is such as he describes and these economies are being achieved without reduction of services how does he account for the fact that so many of the church people in bradford are deeply concerned about them <e> <s> for example the bishop of bradford has parishes which are in urban priority areas and is fully <e>", "<cs> my lords during mondays debate in another place church leaders were exhorted to concentrate on matters spiritual and eternal and leave what is obviously temporal to others <e> <s> is rail use a temporal or a spiritual and eternal matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> in quoting these statistics can he also relate them to levels of unemployment and poverty in the areas of which he is speaking <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we are agreed on all sides of the house on three points in this debate <e> <s> first we give a warm welcome to the fact that the noble lord lord reay has raised this important issue for us <e> <s> secondly violent crime has been rising and statistics are incontrovertible on that point <e> <s> thirdly as the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones said there are no easy solutions <e> <s> we are discussing very complex and difficult subjects this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the trend towards sunday opening in scotland is proceeding steadily and more shops are opening every year <e> <s> is he also aware that many responsible leaders of the churches in scotland are anxious that england should not go down that road which will in the end lead to the destruction of the special character of sunday in scotland as much as in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister appreciate that every time a school opts out for whatever reason whether it is threatened with closure or it sees certain advantages in opting out it creates enormous difficulties for local education authorities <e> <s> is the minister further aware that it will be even more difficult in the years ahead to secure people of ability and quality to serve in educational administration if schools opt out in substantial numbers in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister further aware that the main thesis of that pamphlet on opting out has been denied by the church of england board of education <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to draw to your lordships attention the fact that the time indicator read when the noble lord lord ardwick began speaking as it did when <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i wrote to the foreign secretary on this matter <e> <s> the reply that i received stated that the matter of more un police personnel was a subject for the united nations <e> <s> there was no assurance that the british government would use their best efforts to make sure that more united nations police were sent there <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that the total number of un police for a population of some in ovamboland is no more than at the present time which is totally inadequate for the task required <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say that the minister misheard me slightly <e> <s> i said that there were un police in ovamboland for a population of which is the approximate population <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that slightly encouraging reply but i am sure that he is aware that the list of prisons produced by the prison reform trust shows very few prison visitors centres with adequate facilities <e> <s> will he confirm that only is available for the support of such centres in the current year <e> <s> will he give an indication as to how much that figure will be improved in the sum that he mentioned <e> <s> is he further aware that strangeways prison has a visitors centre which has been used by visitors and families in the last couple of years or since it was opened in that its future is in jeopardy because of underfunding and that an estimated is needed to secure its future <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that in certain inner city areas those shortages are considerably worse than the figures which he has given to us would indicate and that the shortages will not be ameliorated in fact <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister appreciate that although there may have been gains in efficiency as a result of constant financial pressure on local authorities there have been great strains and in many cases damage to the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister go a little further on the matter of aid <e> <s> will he not agree that it is not simply a matter of aid linked to the numbers who are repatriated but also the general economic conditions in vietnam as a whole <e> <s> whatever may be the policies and deficiences of the policies of the present government there the fact is that it is basically a very poor country which has been put under great pressure by western powers particularly the united states <e> <s> what do the government propose to do about that <e>", "<cs> my lords earlier this year in our general synod of the church of england in york there was a debate <e> <s> there were a number of speakers who expressed deep anxieties about the present situation in the national health service <e> <s> a consultant surgeon from doncaster took the opportunity to knock the church of england <e> <s> he said many people think that the church of england has the idea that the nhs is an extension of the kingdom of god whose constitution is written on tablets of stone and that the eleventh commandment is thou shalt not change the nhs <e> <s> i hope that that is not true <e> <s> i am sure it is not true for those who are critical of the present proposals <e> <s> we have already heard some very thoughtful and informed speeches in this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not normally regard your lordships house as being a place of surprises but i must admit that i have been surprised on two counts this afternoon first to arrive here from manchester and to find that so few noble lords had put their names down to speak in a debate which raises some fairly important issues and secondly the pleasant surprise of hearing the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne introduce his motion by saying that he is opposed to tax breaks in general <e> <s> i was surprised and glad to hear that stated <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> as a point of information those paying tax at the higher rate must claim relief in the same way as on mortgage repayments <e> <s> so i take it that it is not completely limited to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> if one accepts his premise that it is impossible to satisfy the needs is he really saying that the needs should be satisfied of those who possess the financial resources and not determined on other criteria <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness not agree that the employment of staff in privatised services of this kind has often led to severe underpayment among people who are often already very poorly paid <e>", "<cs> i wish to add one further point <e> <s> in trying to envisage how the provision will work in operation i wonder whether it is true that if the amendment were passed one would have to hedge it around with further legislation to ensure that it did not become a farce <e> <s> one can envisage that people may put forward the name of a specified woman in that way but with a wider purpose in their minds <e> <s> i do not believe that the purposes behind the amendment can be achieved by the form of wording suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that the take-up rate among families or mothers who earn low wages is extraordinarily low <e> <s> the take-up of family credit is i believe as low as per cent <e> <s> according to the latest figures whereas the target was per cent <e> <s> can she give any reason for that state of affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords many of your lordships may know that a new report has been produced from within the church of england called <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord will forgive me for intervening <e> <s> is he suggesting that there should be no limits to the differentials beteween the salaries necessary to attract entrepreneurs and poverty <e> <s> can they rise as high as entrepreneurs like <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord but before he leaves that point can he tell the house whether he has the figure for the increase owing to unemployment benefit for the increased number of those unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware of the growing concern in the churches about the strain on the clergy mainly church of england and catholic clergy who live in these areas particularly the inner cities and who have these folk on their doorsteps very regularly <e> <s> can she assure us that in any consultations about the right way forward the views of such clergy will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords as this is the evening of ash wednesday perhaps i should start my few remarks on a suitably penitential note <e> <s> the churches simply do not have their act together over the issue of gambling in general <e> <s> we are divided about it <e> <s> perhaps i may illustrate that with a little story <e> <s> some years ago the secretary of the churches council on gambling was tackled by a certain gentleman who pointed out that gambling is referred to favourably in the pages of the new testament <e> <s> in the acts of the apostles we read that they drew lots and the lot fell on matthias <e> <s> the secretary was not at all put out by that because he immediately replied yes but whoever heard of matthias again <e> <s> that perhaps does less than justice to st matthias but it illustrates the ambivalent attitude to gambling found in the churches <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest to the noble lord that he would not exactly encourage a scheme in which the proceeds of prostitution were used to fund the arts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord lord goodman has fallen into the same error but i am not responsible for the views of either noble lord <e> <s> the danger is twofold <e> <s> there is an erosion of the public sense of what charitable giving is all about <e> <s> it has to do with generosity to causes about which men and women know something and which appeal to their best motives and their sympathies for them to give what they can without expecting anything in return <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate <e> <s> we all agree that it is an immensely serious matter <e> <s> we are grateful to the noble lord lord harris for introducing the debate <e> <s> we look forward with great interest to the ministers reply <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that among the many whose human rights are threatened in sri lanka is one viraj mendis who lived in this country for years and who was deported back to sri lanka around months ago <e> <s> is he further aware that far from the situation which is sometimes presented in the press this mans life has been threatened he has been in considerable danger and discomfort since returning and is now endeavouring to secure entry into west germany <e> <s> can the minister assure the house that no obstacle will be placed in the way of his transfer should it be possible <e>", "<cs> my lords although this debate has been introduced by an eloquent speech by a distinguished labour peeress i believe that we can honestly say that this is a subject which cuts across the parties <e> <s> the citizens advice bureaux forms one of the most valuable networks that we possess in britain and is something of which we should be proud <e> <s> its work and the enormous problems and pressures that it faces at the moment are i am sure of deep concern to all sides of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down will he agree that as seven years have passed since the lovelock report to which he referred there is a case for a review of its recommendations with regard to local authority funding and should this not in some sense be statutory <e> <s> i think he will agree that one point which has emerged from the debate is that inconsistencies <e>", "<cs> my lords ever since the publication of the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i associate myself warmly with the sentiments of the noble lord lord thomson in giving thanks to the noble lord lord underhill for bringing the debate before us and for the way in which he introduced it <e> <s> i am also grateful for his tribute to the maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl accept that the expenditure was indeed exceptional and unforeseen and that it was due in part to national conditions within the prison service <e> <s> will he also agree that it would be quite unjust for the charge payers of greater manchester to have to incur the whole burden <e>", "<cs> i was glad to discover that the amendment had been tabled because it attempts to meet the widespread concern in social services departments throughout the country <e> <s> certainly in the area from which i come i have heard the concern expressed again and again that only one part of the griffiths report is being implemented <e> <s> was it not churchill who said <e>", "<cs> if the minister will give way perhaps i may say this <e> <s> the same point will apply to the remarks of the noble lord lord jenkin <e> <s> surely the number of elderly has been increasing very rapidly <e> <s> of course there is more expenditure in that field <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord rea for introducing this tremendous subject to us this afternoon <e> <s> his background of medical knowledge and overseas experience has given him insights from which we benefit <e> <s> the subject is so vast and important that it must make much of the political debate in which we are currently engaged rather trivial in comparison <e>", "<cs> i wish to support this amendment and those that follow it which are in the same tone <e> <s> i do that with some hesitation when there are so many members of the committee around me who are experts in this field <e> <s> however i feel that it should be appreciated right across the committee that there is a deep concern among many thoughtful people in this country of all political parties and persuasions that the best in british broadcasting should be preserved as we move into the new era <e> <s> i believe that the amendments that we are discussing and particularly amendment no <e> <s> help to achieve that <e> <s> subsection of the proposed new clause in amendment no <e> <s> states <e>", "<cs> i may be naive but i should have thought that the amendment moved by the noble baroness lady david and those grouped with it would find an echo in the breast of the noble earl lord ferrers when he replies <e> <s> after all the proposals are a modest extension of what is already written into the bill as can be seen in subsection a on page where protection is given to news and current affairs programmes of high quality dealing with both national and international matters <e> <s> these amendments propose that the protection should be extended to documentaries and social action programmes <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make one brief point in support of the amendments <e> <s> i remind the minister that when we discussed television he referred to the dire fears that were expressed when commercial television was introduced into this country <e> <s> i must admit that i was one of those who had such dire fears that the quality of television would deteriorate enormously as a result <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the right reverend prelate the bishop of bath and wells george carey whose appointment as archbishop of canterbury was announced this morning has a long-standing interest in youth matters <e> <s> is she further aware that when he comes to this house he will have much to contribute on that subject among others <e>", "<cs> my lords many of us in the churches are profoundly distressed at the level of this problem in our country at the present time <e> <s> anything which the government are able to do to meet the problem has our warm support <e> <s> like others who have asked questions of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor i support the principle of responsibility of those who have children and whose family relationships have broken down whether men or women <e> <s> my question relates to the protected level of income and how possible it will be to administer the system <e> <s> one fear already expressed by noble lords opposite is that some of the poorest people in our society will be affected by what is proposed thereby making the problem for second families possibly worse <e>", "<cs> my lords on this matter of taxation and the proposed registration schemes for dogs is it not true that there are many matters before the house which relate indirectly to taxation without them being taxation matters <e> <s> with regard to the other point made by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is it not also a fact that the proposal of the noble lord lord stanley contains no details of how the registration scheme would be financed whether the tax would be a flat rate and whether there would be exceptions <e> <s> all that remains to be worked out <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is a growing feeling in this country especially among the churches that the evil which could be released by offensive operations further than those already undertaken with forced sanctions would be much greater than the peaceful pursuance of sanctions <e>"]
