these are autonomous bodies which we have set up <e> <s> we are not only telling them what they are and what they have to do but in prolix and unnecessary detail we have also gone on to tell them exactly how they should do it and that they may operate for example through committees which is perfectly obvious in the case of an autonomous body <e> <s> but the new clause amendment no <e> <s> does not create an autonomous body in that sense <e> <s> the commission is to exercise certain ministerial functions so it seems to me to be genuinely a delegate <e> <s> before the bill goes to another

schedule and other provisions of the bill as matters of legislative technique <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened to the three speeches with which your lordships have been favoured so far by noble lords all of whom are held in high respect by your lordships i am bound to say that i myself shall vote against the amendment <e> <s> this bill is concerned with a small aspect of liberty in other words the power of individual citizens to make for themselves or to influence the choices that affect <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the criticisms of the trading restrictions go far beyond sunday trading <e> <s> if there is to be an inquiry will he ensure that it covers the whole ground in the same manner that was covered by the gowers committee without effective action being taken <e>", "<cs> my lords as the surviving member of the percy royal commission may i ask the noble lord whether in considering this matter he will bear in mind the desirability of doing nothing to impair the increased recognition of mental ailment as illness and incapacity not to be hived off separately so as to run into the danger of the past of regarding mental ailment as a subject for shame and concealment <e>", "<cs> my lords i follow the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter not only in addressing your lordships but i hope i may say without impertinence in expressing admiration based on long experience of the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> perhaps i ought to say that that admiration is widely shared <e> <s> it is not limited to those who are former treasury ministers <e> <s> i desire to say that right away because like the noble lord who has preceded me i cannot follow the noble lord lord diamond in his suggestions today <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with considerable diffidence that i address your lordships at this stage of the bill because being abroad by long arrangement during the previous stages i could not take any part in the debates <e> <s> but having presided over the jurisdiction with which your lordships are instantly concerned for a decade or so i do not really feel that my previous absence absolves me at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will feel indebted to the noble lord lord hatch of lusby for these two amendments because they identify a problem which has been recognised as being part of the injustice to wives which was implicit in the legislation <e> <s> being so very near the heart it is far from easy to be rectified <e>", "<cs> my lords this matter will be further considered <e> <s> i desire only to express my agreement with what the noble lord lord hatch of lusby has said but to voice reservation about the restrictive provisions of subsection in the amendment whereby the wife can benefit only if the husband <e>", "<cs> i venture to urge your lordships to prefer the bill and to reject the amendment for a number of reasons <e> <s> in the first place the bill follows the final recommendation of the law commission and that should <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will allow me to intervene because that was not quite the question that i asked <e> <s> if it is equitable to take conduct into account why is it only in those circumstances which are exceptional <e>", "<cs> my lords i said explicitly that that was the commissions final conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords if i did the noble lord an injustice i apologise but i was not present <e> <s> i read his speech very carefully and i thought that he had made it quite plain that that was his preferred solution <e>", "<cs> my lords may i voice two matters of disquiet <e> <s> the first is raised indirectly by this amendment <e> <s> i refer to the final words of subsection of the new section on page of the bill which read <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of your lordships and arising out of what the noble baroness has said i should like to say that i realise that i expressed myself clumsily in suggesting that the clause should end at education <e> <s> i certainly did not mean to eliminate training which i think is necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble and learned friend allow me to intervene <e> <s> when i voiced my difficulty about the paragraph and the amendment my noble and learned friend very kindly directed my attention to section <e> <s> it does not at all meet my point about what is the primary consideration which is the new provision in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i was proposing to support this amendment for two reasons first because during the time that i had some responsibility for this sphere of jurisprudence i was continually conscious of how little we knew of the cumulative facts of the impact of our general decisions <e> <s> the second reason was because the noble lord lord mcgregor of durris made a pioneering study which i believe is unfortunately still a unique study with mr blom cooper and i think mr gibson called <e>", "<cs> my lords i am far from confident that i have got the point right because it is only just by the courtesy of the noble lord lord underhill that i have the right marshalled list <e> <s> i can see the attraction of this amendment in an inflationary situation but we are not legislating purely for an inflationary situation <e> <s> one must remember that during the s there was pretty steadily a gradual deflation <e>", "<cs> my lords when a minister is asked a question to which he feels he cannot do an immediate justice would he consider if the answer is likely to be more than of interest to his sole interlocutor inviting a question for written answer rather than promising to write a letter <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones pointed out the bill effects certain improvements in the way of jurisdiction and practice and i welcome them <e> <s> it has also in my respectful submission to your lordships introduced one substantive improvement namely that in the financial provision the court shall pay first <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great privilege to follow the noble lord who has just addressed your lordships not only for the reasons that were given by the noble lord <e> <s> lord paget and i venture to take up the point on which he sat down namely that it is a matter of life and death <e> <s> today we stand in the direst peril <e> <s> the world is divided ideologically more grievously than it was at the time of <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble lord this question <e> <s> has he not considered that the state which holds these assets is entitled to freeze them and take them over in the event of an illegal action by the possessing state that is the state which takes over the previous possession <e> <s> the great example is the united states and the iranian assets <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness this question <e> <s> it was formerly the custom to intervene militarily when there was default <e> <s> do i take it from what she said that that is no longer policy <e> <s> if not what is now the sanction <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us how the square metres compares with the present one-eighth and one-quarter of an acre <e> <s> i realise that i am very ignorant in asking that but it would help <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton for allowing me to slip into the gap on the speakers list after i had inadvertently failed to put down my name but i must not abuse his courtesy <e> <s> i also share with your lordships gratitude to the noble lord lord wallace of coslany for putting forward this bill giving us an opportunity of discussion and for his very clear exposition of the bills provisions <e> <s> i notice however that he shares my own woeful inability to translate the old measurements into the new <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord whether the amendment at the top of page is <e>", "<cs> it is with very great temerity that i intervene in a committee of such experts particularly when your lordships are exercising your expertise for the third time as regards this immediate area <e> <s> of course as a member for an industrial constituency i had housing problems brought to me but they were not at all the particular problems that arise on this amendment <e> <s> nevertheless there are two reasons why i venture briefly to address your lordships <e> <s> the first is that i was a close ministerial colleague of the late lord amory for whom i had the most profound admiration and affection <e> <s> it seems to me that the arguments which he advanced and which commended themselves to your lordships in are just as cogent and just as unanswerable today as they were then <e>", "<cs> surely a contract to leave property by will is a perfectly valid contract <e>", "<cs> may i ask the government not to accept this amendment even though i have no doubt that the noble lord with his usual courtesy will answer the question asked of him <e> <s> i suggested earlier that one of the grave disadvantages of our housing law was its built-in system which has now subsisted for so long of rent restriction which precludes or at any rate inhibits the kind of mobility that we need in our industries <e> <s> it seems to me that the reduction of the period from three years to two giving rise to the right to buy is a counter indicator of that and is of value in itself <e>", "<cs> when i first addressed your lordships today i apologised as a neophyte addressing a committee of experts <e> <s> so i am sure that your lordships will know the answer to the question that i am now going to ask which i know i ought to be able to answer myself were i not virtually innumerate <e> <s> will the noble lord the minister let me know what is the period to be taken into account to obtain the maximum discount <e> <s> i thought that in the act it was either or years and in the bill either or years <e> <s> but it is rather important when one considers that it may be a number of years before anybody can earn the maximum discount <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reinforce what the noble baroness has just said <e> <s> may we all know the answer <e> <s> i was about to ask the same question as the noble lord lord northfield and particularly i wanted to know who the adjudicator will be <e> <s> i took it to be a county court but that may be quite wrong <e> <s> if it is a county court the problem of what is reasonable is the sort of problem with which a court has to deal every day <e>", "<cs> may i raise one substantial point on this clause some drafting points and a protest against the way in which this clause and so much else in the bill is drafted with as urgent a plea as i can make for consolidation at a very early date <e> <s> i can deal with the really important point very quickly <e> <s> it is on the new subsection a <e>", "<cs> i was going to voice a slight word of demur <e> <s> although the noble lord who moved this amendment has identified a very real problem on the whole when it comes to evicting one spouse the matter is very much better left to a court which is seized of the human and the property problem <e> <s> as the noble lord the minister said the booth committee is at the very moment seized of this difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords in asking to be associated with the expressions of gratitude to the noble lord lord diamond in initiating this important debate i confess that i feel myself somewhat of an intruder <e> <s> it is true that i was once a member of that detested tribe of treasury ministers but that was long ago and i have had all too much time to forget all that the noble lord lord roberthall taught me during those days <e> <s> i am glad that he is to speak today and i hope to be refreshed by it <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord will allow me to intervene before he gets on to the amendment <e> <s> i have no idea where the responsibility for this situation lies but i should like to reinforce the noble lords note of indignation <e> <s> this is a bill of appalling complexity and difficulty and i adopt the noble lords language in saying that it is a travesty of parliamentary proceedings that so much of it should be brought on at this time on the third day <e>", "<cs> when your lordships went into committee on this bill earlier this evening the noble lord lord graham of edmonton expostulated that so important a bill on which there is so much to be discussed should be brought on at such an hour <e> <s> we are now clauses further on over amendments later and over an hour and a half later <e> <s> i draw those matters to the attention of your lordships committee in weighing up whether what has happened this evening may not be a breach of any decent parliamentary practice <e>", "<cs> a half night <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for the support of the noble lord lord molson <e> <s> may i deal with a point he made on parts i ii and iii <e> <s> in the normal process of consolidation the draftsman will only consolidate with the act so much of this bill when it is an act as is relevant to the act <e> <s> we had that experience i believe two sessions ago it may have been last session in relation to matrimonial homes <e> <s> an act had to be consolidated which dealt partly with matrimonial homes and partly with matrimonial property <e> <s> the draftsman quite properly consolidated only that part which was relevant namely that relating to matrimonial homes <e> <s> so there is no difficulty in hiving off part i <e>", "<cs> my lords has it ever been argued that government funding of the losses of unprofitable nationalised industries should properly be treated as remission of indirect taxation <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord proceeds is he right in grouping together so many amendments <e> <s> do not they fall into two quite separate categories that is to say those relating to the right to buy and those relating to security of tenure which are dealt with in different chapters of the act which is the act which is being amended <e>", "<cs> my lords was the noble baroness dealing with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if so i should like to reinforce what she said because it raises very big constitutional issues <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could say how grateful i am to have received a copy of the grouping paper but of course nobody consults anybody sitting on the cross-benches <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervened at the committee stage of this bill knowing that i was addressing a committee of experts because i wanted to put the case for the exclusion of old persons dwellings particularly in relation to an area such as scarborough which is an attractive seaside resort with a large rural hinterland and a much higher than average number proportionally of elderly persons in its population <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has referred to me so agreeably perhaps i may say that i would not wish to delay the implementation of this bill <e> <s> i do not believe for a moment that consolidation would do so <e> <s> after all the noble lord has a draftsman <e> <s> the editorial board of the <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness moves amendment no <e> <s> am i right in thinking that she is now seeking to move out of the bill subsection of this clause as not yet amended because we have not reached amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord the minister for dealing with this matter and also for separating out these two sets of amendments <e> <s> when i spoke on clause as it was standing part the noble lord twitted me genially with <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether i need to ask your lordships leave to say merely this <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord evans for his support and i am very grateful to the noble lord the minister for his most forthcoming reply <e> <s> i of course am very glad to leave the matter in his hands <e> <s> i do not know whether i said this in opening <e> <s> i did not deal with the other loopholes that i suggested to the noble lord might be used because i did not want to advertise them <e> <s> but i think it would be a good thing if the noble lord would keep his eye on those as well as trying to improve this aspect and make the consequential amendments <e> <s> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> as i mentioned in committee without developing it the draftsman had an extraordinarily difficult task over this <e> <s> as i <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for taking that line <e> <s> i had of course considered whether the interpretation act would take care of the question <e> <s> it seemed to me reading the whole of the clause and in particular the subsection that it could well be argued that the contrary intention does appear and that the singular is not intended to extend to the plural <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will consider this with the draftsman in the light of what i say <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot resist the temptation to point out the few words of this act in the paragraph to which the amendment relates <e> <s> i should point out once again that unless this act as it will be goes out consolidated that will he entirely misleading <e> <s> it is not this act it is the act to which reference is made <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that your lordships are in an extraordinarily difficult position <e> <s> the noble baroness must be right that there are anomalies as the bill stands and they have to be reconciled if only to make sure which is dominant clause or clause <e> <s> that is a comparatively simple drafting technique but it involves a major political decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather thought that we had stopped short of amendment no <e> <s> on the ground that the noble baroness wanted to speak to that amendment as did i what causes me <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps your lordships will permit me to address the house again on this matter <e> <s> i merely desire to say that whether the clause goes in with the undertaking which the minister has given and which of course we take unreservedly that he will look at the points again or whether the amendment is now withdrawn and reintroduced at a later stage seems to me to be marginal <e> <s> however in view of what the noble earl said concerning his doubts as to the value of this clause at all i should have thought that the balance was slightly on the side of withdrawal <e>", "<cs> my lords i too had underlined those same words so i shall be very grateful if the noble lord the minister will send to me a copy of the letter he sends to the noble earl lord selkirk <e>", "<cs> my lords did the noble lord say two months <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to reply in only a few sentences <e> <s> with great respect i did not agree with my noble and learned friend on the woolsack in his description of how <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that we had stopped in that grouping at amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i have a note see column <e> <s> it looks as if the noble lord did not go beyond that <e> <s> i do not raise that point just to be difficult or because my amendment has not been approved but i want to ask a question on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite irresistible <e> <s> what i wanted to ask was how the top of page will read under this amendment <e> <s> i found it very puzzling <e>", "<cs> i think we are on schedule are we not <e> <s> page reads schedule inserted after schedule to act <e> <s> then schedule a and then comes the amendment that has just been moved qualification and discount part i and then does the heading follow determination of relevant periods for the purposes of section and which are of course the act <e> <s> have i read it right there <e>", "<cs> they follow that do they not <e> <s> and precede the words determination <e>", "<cs> my lords they do not according to the marshalled list <e> <s> i do not want to waste time on this but perhaps ministers would look at this before third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords it only remains for me to thank the noble lord the minister <e> <s> he referred very flatteringly to me but in fact this amendment is far better than my shot at it <e> <s> in particu-lar the last phrase closes a minor loophole which i had not spotted <e> <s> i simply desire to say that in addition i have written to the noble lord he will not yet have received the letter because i only received his letter in the country yesterday about further methods which might be used of evading these controls both in subsection and subsection a <e> <s> i do not want to advertise them but perhaps the noble lord would keep an eye open for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i only desire to add this point which the noble baroness did not deal with <e> <s> i entirely agree with her about subsection and i am most grateful to the noble lord the minister for writing to me about it <e> <s> i got the letter only today but that is because i only came up today <e> <s> i should like to add a word about subsection which takes most drastic steps going so far as to render void a conveyance to a <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord the minister sits down may i ask am i not right in thinking that the only way in which further consideration can be given is by accepting this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords inevitably at this stage of any bill there is a slight feeling of nostalgia the minister having virtually got his bill says it was a famous victory and the opposition front bench having carried three substantial amendments against the government also says it was a famous victory <e> <s> then perhaps comes the voice of little peterkin perhaps from the cross-benches asking what it was all about and both front benches say in unison we truly do not know but twas a famous victory <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves the noble earls amendment he mentioned amending legislation <e> <s> when is that contemplated <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to support the noble baroness in her amendment i must declare that in general i have been entirely convinced by the ministers propositions <e> <s> it seems to me that generally speaking the right to buy has been abundantly vindicated and it has had the beneficial results that the minister has claimed <e> <s> where i venture to differ from him <e> <s> and why i rise to support this amendment is on the passionate logic to try to carry that good principle into every corner of our social and legal life in the face of common sense humanity experience and convenience <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has asked that question not merely rhetorically <e> <s> is not the intention of this bill to give a right to buy a dwelling-house and not to make a financial windfall <e>", "<cs> i hope that this matter will not be pressed to a division but if possible i would urge that the matter be kept open for consideration until a later stage <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord <e> <s> lord houghton would lose anything in taking that course <e> <s> there seems to me to be great force in what the noble lord lord mishcon says that the issue of reasonable belief is eminently a matter for a jury and is normally a matter for a jury <e> <s> i should like to raise just one further point <e> <s> the noble lord the minister and the noble lord lord nugent are quite correct in saying that subsection applies only to clauses and and that apart from the issue which the noble lord <e> <s> lord mishcon raised the issues are likely to be very narrow <e> <s> the same point arises on subsection <e>", "<cs> may i presume to endorse what the noble lord lord mishcon said <e> <s> the short title of a bill is its label and nothing more than a label <e>

"<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon has said everything that i intended to say except for this <e> <s> courts nowadays examine the long title in the construction of a statute and rightly so <e> <s> if the word censorship goes into the long title it will colour the construction and colour it in a way absolutely contrary to that which the noble lord lord monson desires <e>", "<cs> my lords it is convention <e> <s> if not a rule in your lordships house that on a motion such as this your lordships do not debate the substance of the matter sought to be consolidated but merely the desirability of consolidation <e> <s> but that involves priorities <e> <s> i have no objection rather the contrary to the consolidation of this particular branch of the law <e> <s> however i should like to ask my noble and learned friend what has happened to what i understood was the promised consolidation of some matter in the national heritage bill the drafting of which was objected to so much last session <e> <s> i was given the impression and i have <e>", "<cs> my lords has not the secretary of state refused to designate as rural areas a great number of quite substantial areas which are in every sense

<e> <s> can the noble lord explain why <e>", "<cs> as i understood the noble lord the minister he is accepting the substance of what is proposed both by the noble lord on the front bench and by the noble lord lord gifford but he is saying that the information will be available at the police station <e> <s> as a notice has to be left in the vehicle i should have thought there is much to be said at least for stating the grounds and certainly for stating in the notice left in the vehicle what articles have been removed <e> <s> would the noble lord consider that point <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that one needs something on the lines of paragraphs <e>", "<cs> i should like to associate myself entirely with what has been said by the noble lord lord hutchinson <e> <s> from the schedule to the extradition act one has seen how comparatively insubstantial offences get added in a moment of excitement <e> <s> i must say that part i of schedule reads extremely oddly not least paragraph <e>", "<cs> in view of what the noble lord has said as i understand assault it merely involves a contact without consent <e> <s> it is not necessarily anything violent <e> <s> the mere placing of a hand for example on the outside of the trousers would be an assault unless it were by consent which in this context it would not be <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord would investigate that with the legal department <e> <s> that is what i have always understood to be the law relating to assault <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to intervene when i played no part in the discussions on this bill but i have always understood that the british constitutional position was that we ratify intending to legislate <e> <s> having ratified we are under a duty to legislate but we are not bound to postpone ratification until after legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords the central feature of this important bill is the separation of the prosecution process from the investigatory processes of the police <e> <s> that has received universal approbation during your lordships debate and if i may say so i entirely adhere to that view <e> <s> the difference of opinion that has developed is whether the new prosecution should be a national or a local service in the sense of whether responsibility for the decision should be made locally or to the central government of this country and ultimately to parliament <e> <s> i differ with very great diffidence from what is said by my noble and learned friends <e> <s> lord diplock lord denning and lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> but on this matter i found myself entirely convinced by the minister by the noble lord lord wigoder and by the noble baroness <e> <s> shortly i think that the reason why ultimate responsibility is better laid at the centre is because there is less likely to be political interference with the prosecuting decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked on what principle it was impaired <e> <s> i know what principle on which it is founded which is a fundamental constitutional principle of individual liberty based on the rule of law <e> <s> i wanted to know on what principle it had been impaired <e>", "<cs> my lords were the figures not formerly published by the customs and excise authorities under the head of extra statutory concessions <e> <s> if so why has that practice discontinued <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of the noble earls supplementary answer to my supplementary question when an extra statutory concession is made by the executive constitutionally should not that be reported to parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords rather than proceeding with immense complication often belatedly and frequently ineffectively against particular schemes for avoidance of tax can consideration again be given to the american and australian system of providing simply that any transaction whose paramount object is the avoidance of tax shall be void for that purpose though valid for all others <e> <s> would that not greatly simplify our fiscal code <e>", "<cs> my lords in the conservative party manifesto at the general election it was written <e>", "<cs> i wonder if i may interrupt the noble lord to ask whether it would

much evidence that that works very well and might well provide a guidance in this country <e> <s> so far as the wider question is concerned like the noble lords lord wigoder and lord hutchinson i was convinced on balance by the october white paper that the system should be a national one though i shared misgivings as to whether that might not involve us in a great centralised bureaucracy <e> <s> but like the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson having seen the white paper of last december i have had all my misgivings assuaged <e> <s> i think that though one can argue about detail the

classes should realise that this is one of the matters on which the working classes do not see eye to eye with us necessarily <e> <s> personally i have the same outlook on these matters as the noble lord lord hutchinson <e> <s> indeed i was a member of the select committee in another place which led to the act which was the great act of liberalisation <e> <s> to my mind it is extremely important

second time we have come across that particular incantation <e>", "<cs> i would not intervene to make this point were your lordships not already considering whether the clause shall stand part <e> <s>

will be available in the library but it would be a personal convenience if he could meet my request <e>", "<cs> i am quite sure that it is not inadequate <e> <s> what is inadequate i am afraid is my understanding of it <e> <s> as i understand it a legal aid order is made and a certificate is then granted sometimes subject to a contribution <e> <s> i can well understand that the contribution is to be disregarded that was the point the noble lord lord mishcon raised <e> <s> i can understand that the fact there has been a legal aid order shall be disregarded but if it means that the full costs of

"<cs> i certainly cannot ask more than that my noble and learned friend should consider the draftsmanship before the next stage of this bill <e> <s> otherwise i am very content <e>", "<cs> i presume to agree with my noble and learned friend lord denning and the noble lord lord campbell <e> <s> the question as regards a fine is not only what is the amount appropriate to the offence <e> <s> but

mitigating the fine in order in the circumstances envisaged to bring the fine below the amount of costs <e> <s> i hope that my noble and learned friend will not accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i

include the plural and therefore it would certainly cover the conveyancing of a large urban estate <e> <s> it would certainly exclude office buildings and farms apart from the immediate messuage to

and the shops act <e> <s> however i do not follow the noble lord as to why he wants to omit section <e>", "<cs> i think i indicated earlier that what many of us want to hear is that there is to be sufficient protection for shopworkers in the future without necessarily clinging to the provisions of the shops act <e> <s> as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter pointed out section now applies only to to year-olds <e> <s> i wish only to say that while i have sympathy with the approach of the noble lord lord stallard we shall be making a great mistake if by amendment we complicate more an extremely complicated act of parliament <e> <s> if we are to make progress in the direction that the noble lord would wish i hope that it will be by simplification rather than by complication <e>", "<cs> with great respect <e>", "<cs> the point that i was trying to make was not the point that the noble lord has just summarised namely now that the impact of section of the act is limited to to year-olds that is a reason not to try to improve that part which is left <e> <s> my objection is that the amendment is not an improvement <e> <s> it is simply an over-complication <e>", "<cs> i trust that your lordships will not accept this amendment and that the government will consider it with considerable reserve <e> <s> far from correcting an anomaly it creates a whole number of new ones <e> <s> what it seeks to do is to ensure that persons entering shopworking employment after the commencement of the act should have the right not to work on sunday without being punished for <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble viscount but i fear i do not deserve his sympathy because i no longer live in the area concerned <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord proceeds may i ask whether there has been another agreed list of groupings of amendments <e> <s> if there has been and there is a spare copy i should be very grateful for it <e>", "<cs> i have just got it <e> <s> i only had the original list <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i find myself very much in agreement with both the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and the noble lord lord sandford <e> <s> it seems to me absolutely wrong to treat shopworkers as a quite different category of employee in this respect from all the others who work on sunday <e> <s> on the other hand i join with the noble lord lord sandford in feeling anxiety about the rapid revision that there is in clause <e> <s> i should like to see a transitional period <e> <s> in particular i revert to the point that i made last tuesday namely that it seems wrong that the to year-olds are left without the protection of either the shops inspectorate and their legislation or apparently so far as we can judge from the secretary of states letter the wages council legislation <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord he is of course quite right <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister about the meaning of subsection <e> <s> if it means anything why is it in this extraordinary place and not in schedule <e> <s> i gave the noble lord notice that i wanted to raise this question but if he is not prepared to deal with this today i am content to have it dealt with on report <e> <s> i shall put down the appropriate amendment myself or he can do it <e> <s> perhaps it would be convenient if i indicate the problem <e> <s> would that be convenient for the noble lord the minister <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he has clarified matters but on neither point has he given in my respectful submission a satisfactory answer either on the question of what the subsection does or why it is in clause <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord is right <e> <s> it could be in schedule as a minor and consequential amendment in so far as it picks out particular words or it could be in schedule <e> <s> the one place that it is certainly wrong for it to be is in the enacting provision of this bill <e>", "<cs> that is not the point <e> <s> the point is that section does not deal with young persons <e> <s> that is dealt with in section <e> <s> it does not deal with young persons and never has dealt with young persons <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> perhaps i may suggest that he sends a copy of his letter to the noble lord lord renton who naturally keeps a fatherly interest in all matters arising out of the renton report <e>", "<cs> i must apologise to the noble baroness <e> <s> i am rather lost <e> <s> are we on amendment no <e> <s> b and the others that go with it <e>", "<cs> on one matter i find myself in entire agreement with both the noble baroness and the noble lord lord renton namely that this part of the schedule and indeed most of it is absolutely baffling <e> <s> also i am afraid that i disagree with the noble baroness and agree with the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> when she says most shopworkers do not work under a contract what she really means i think is that they do not work under a formal contract <e> <s> i think i have appreciated what she means <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton is absolutely right when he says that except for voluntary work all work in <e>", "<cs> the noble lord knows far more about these matters than i do but is he right under this part to say that anybody is forced to work <e> <s> as i read it it is purely that an employee who worked on sundays before the commencement of the act is entitled to go on working if he wishes it is put round the other way in the clause whereas if he did not before then work on sundays it is purely up to him whether he does or does not <e> <s> the only stipulation is that he should agree in writing and i imagine that that is for the sake of certainty <e>", "<cs> may i say that i think i put it right the first time but i was conscious of putting it wrongly when i intervened in the speech of the noble lord lord murray <e> <s> if the noble lord will look at <e>", "<cs> your lordships will certainly agree with the noble lord lord graham that one must have a precise date for ascertaining the status of the worker which gives rise to the rights that the bill gives him <e> <s> i do not know whether it was a slip of the tongue on the noble lords part but commence-ment date is a precise date <e> <s> the date of royal assent is the date that a bill becomes an act <e> <s> under a statute of somewhere near the end of the th century i have forgotten its name the clerk of the parliaments writes under the title of a bill at the moment it receives royal assent the date of royal assent <e> <s> that is by statute part of the act of parliament and that is the commencing date unless some other date is specified <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has mentioned it may i ask why we should define it since it is already defined by the statute to which i referred <e> <s> there are several other unnecessary definitions in that paragraph shop shopwork and i think shopworker <e> <s> why in particular is it necessary to define commencement date <e>", "<cs> i thought that the noble lord had finished <e> <s> i think he has now made his point <e>", "<cs> as i told the noble lord lord graham i feel considerably embarrassed in that i feel that i have to oppose this amendment after having told him that i was in general sympathy with him on this part of the bill <e> <s> so far as the noble baronesss intervention is concerned perhaps the minister would bear this in mind <e> <s> we are concerned here with written contracts <e> <s> it would be perfectly possible to have the contractual obligation to work on a sunday which was entered into after the date of royal assent provisional <e> <s> i realise that is a lawyers point of view but i think it is a valid one <e> <s> usdaw might consider putting out pamphlets pointing out that as a possibility or possibly the ministry might do so i do not know <e> <s> it seems to me that would be preferable to writing anything into the bill <e> <s> the suggestion of the noble lord lord graham seems to <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that the noble lord is not drawing me on to very dangerous ground <e> <s> i certainly do not like giving instant legal opinions indeed i am much too old to give legal opinions of any sort but it struck me that might be a way of meeting the point that both the noble lord and the noble baroness have in mind in other words an agreement without prejudice to reconsideration say after two months <e> <s> i am thinking quite loosely <e> <s> i have no doubt that the usdaw lawyers will be able to work out something very much better and certainly the very able legal department of the home office <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble viscount where he finds that <e>", "<cs> i have considerable sympathy with this amendment on the ground that anything that lightens and mitigates the complication of this schedule is to be welcomed <e> <s> but i do not i am afraid follow the noble viscount when he says that the employer can force the employee to work on sunday <e> <s> all he can do is to hold the employee to a contract to work on sunday just as the employee can hold the employer to a contract to employ him on sunday <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is very good to say that he will look at this <e> <s> my point was that two of them were so remote that they are not worth troubling about and the only one that is worth troubling about can be dealt with much more simply <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to do in another way that which the noble lord lord graham sought to do with an earlier amendment <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will forgive me if i say that if i had to choose between the two i should prefer the noble lords amendment <e>", "<cs> there is the objection to this amendment and this is really to elaborate on what was said earlier by the minister that such a provision could work very unfairly against an employer <e> <s> take for example the case of a small petrol filling station that has a shop and the proprietor of which wants an attendant to work three days a week including sundays <e> <s> one can take any figure one likes it could be three half-days per week including sundays <e>", "<cs> there is obviously a mistake in the bill but i wonder why it is subject to paragraph <e> <s> paragraph says that an established shopworker can contract out of his rights under the bill <e> <s> as such it seems to me merely declaratory because the bill has said earlier that he can contract out by writing on or after the act comes into force <e>", "<cs> i have already indicated that it is at least arguable that the existing paragraph is for no more than the avoidance of doubt <e> <s> as such i personally have no objection to it but i would ask the <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will consent to look at this point again <e> <s> it is not really the same point we discussed before <e> <s> it is really that if you limit in any way the power of perfectly free contract and this bill does limit to some degree the free contractual power of employer and employee you need some such provision as this <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will not close his mind to the matter and will look at the debate in <e>", "<cs> in a very strong committee on the preparation of legislation the chairman of which was the noble lord lord renton started off chapter of their report <e>", "<cs> i should like a tribute to come also from the cross-benches <e> <s> we on these benches have appreciated enormously the industry courtesy and thoroughness of the noble lord <e> <s> we are truly grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble baroness any figures to show what the net cost might be if the retirement age or pensionable age for women were raised to at the same time <e>", "<cs> has the noble lord considered also speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and as they seem to raise the same point <e>", "<cs> in rising to support the amendment i do so not only because it raises an important point of private international law but also because the background of the leading case throws considerable light on the social problems with which your lordships i believe will be largely concerned <e> <s> this bill is concerned with capacity to marry <e> <s> under our private international law capacity to marry is referred to the personal law of the person who is concerned that is to say in english law normally the law of the domicile as the noble lord said although in some systems it is the law of the nationality <e> <s> it differs therefore from where the question of the formality of the marriage is concerned which is referred to the law of the place where the contract of marriage is concluded <e>", "<cs> in answer to the noble baroness the reference to grandparents and granddaughters is of couse quite unreal but both the majority and the minority reports included them because they appear in both the table known as archbishop parkers table to the book of common prayer and in the schedule to the marriage act <e> <s> therefore they must be picked up when one is dealing with the realistic question which arises under this subsection not the next which is dealing with stepparents as a matter of reality with stepfather and stepdaughter and stepmother and stepson <e> <s> the next subsection is the one which deals with in-laws <e>", "<cs> i did not intend to intervene to speak at this stage but the noble baroness as i understood her said that this would apply notwithstanding that the child in question is not a child of the family <e> <s> i wonder whether she was right about that in view of the succeeding words at the end of this subsection and subsection <e> <s> as i read the amendment all it did was to raise the age of to <e> <s> i see the noble baroness is nodding in approbation <e> <s> i believe that is right is it not <e>", "<cs> obviously this is an arguable case <e> <s> it has been admirably argued <e> <s> i ask the noble baroness not the press her amendment for two reasons <e> <s> the first is that the age of has as my noble and learned friend has said for all practical purposes in pursuance of the report of the latey committee a powerful committee been reduced to <e> <s> the argument used at the time in your lordships chamber notably by my noble and learned friend lord gardiner was that the age of maturity was steadily going down and that was sensible now where might have been sensible before <e> <s> the age of here fits better into the general framework of our law of minority <e>", "<cs> i am glad on this occasion to follow the right reverend prelate in total agreement save for his reference to the shops bill on which i shall not follow him <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness was kind enough to say i have been a long time proponent of the institution of the family court <e> <s> i proposed quite an elaborate structure in to the morton royal commission <e> <s> the concept has lately been gathering support significantly and encouragingly particularly with the law society family law committee and now the law society itself <e>", "<cs> i have one question to ask about the schedule <e> <s> i cannot find the reference but i shall tell the noble lord what my problem is <e> <s> why is there a provision that publication of banns should not apply to marriages under this bill <e> <s> it seems that it applies to all the other ways of publicising marriage or authorising marriage licence and superintendant registrars certificates but why not the publication of banns <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has given quite a number of answers to my query any of which would have been conclusive so there is nothing for me to do except say thank you <e>", "<cs> my lords before we proceed i should like to ask whether page of the marshalled list is correct and if it is not correct how it should be dealt with <e> <s> the reference to after clause at the top of the page must be wrong because it is dealing with the continuation of a clause to be inserted after clause <e> <s> however there then follows amendment no <e> <s> which i read as being after clause <e> <s> i do not know whether any of the noble lords who have put their names to the amendment are present <e> <s> the noble lord lord mccarthy was here a moment ago <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> reads as if it ought to come after clause <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> reads as if it ought to come after clause <e> <s> there must be something wrong on this page and i should be grateful if i could be told how it can be most conveniently dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps the noble lord lord mishcon is entitled to express an opinion on that matter as he is one of the signatories to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords at second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so sorry i beg the right reverend prelates pardon <e> <s> i can see him now and i ask him to excuse me <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the second time that i have intervened <e> <s> the first time was before the right reverend prelate spoke <e> <s> i apologised to him and i repeat my apology <e> <s> now i have interrupted the noble lord

starts on a friday evening does it not <e>", "<cs> my lords not of all time only of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i was one of those who expressed misgivings at committee about clause and i pleaded for a transition period so that one could be reasonably sure that sufficient protection was not being withdrawn from a peculiarly vulnerable class of employee <e> <s> moreover i based as so many of your lordships did the support of clause and resistance to amendments to clause on the cogent arguments of the auld committee <e> <s> however as my noble and learned friend has reminded your lordships and as was quoted at committee stage by the noble lord lord lloyd and i think the noble baroness lady turner the auld committee itself expressed misgivings and looked to wages councils to provide the sufficient protection <e> <s> our difficulty was that we did not know what was going to be in the wages council legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble and learned friend will allow me to intervene that distinction is drawn already in the shops act which he wishes to continue <e>", "<cs> my lords the main provision of this new clause has been argued on either side <e> <s> any further points will no doubt be picked up by the noble lord the minister <e> <s> however i should like to ask the noble lord lord graham when he replies whether he could clear up two points on subsection at the top of page of the marshalled list <e> <s> first <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord is finally allowed to sit down will he if he wishes deal with the question i asked about sub-section <e>", "<cs> my lords that is post-act workers is it <e>", "<cs> my lords i largely want to deal with the technical point <e> <s> it seems to me with respect to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that this amendment is clearly within the long title of the bill and in any case in this house we can amend the long title later <e>", "<cs> on the other hand my lords it seems to me to fit most unhappily into this bill <e> <s> i do not altogether follow the noble lord lord mishcon when he says we are in danger of falling between two stools or between two gates in his biblical quotation <e> <s> we shall certainly have an opportunity of considering this sort of provision when the wages bill comes before your lordships <e> <s> it will obviously be far more convenient to consider wages council protection for the to -year-olds over the whole field rather than as your lordships are invited by this amendment to do to confine it to the retail trade <e> <s> therefore i very much hope although subject to a better view that this is in the long title of the bill that the noble lord <e> <s> lord mccarthy will not press the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords i did not catch what the noble lord lord graham said <e> <s> what is being taken with this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i gather that this is largely a probing amendment and i am bound to say that i read the rights given by the first schedule to the persons entitled under clause as covering all the sorts of penal action that are referred to in subsection of the new clause particularly now that the schedule happily and mercifully has been redrawn for which we shall express our gratitude in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i probably did not make it clear <e> <s> my point was that she had agreed to do so <e>

lords i agree entirely with the noble lord the minister and the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i should like to be added to any list of recipients <e> <s> i rise however to say that the amendment that was carried on clause may well have repercussions on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the noble lord the minister will probably want to consider what those repercussions are and to advise us in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords not by me <e>", "<cs> my lords i opposed this amendment at committee stage and i shall not repeat the argument <e> <s> however my noble and learned friend puts this altogether too simply when he says that an employee albeit if he enters his contract of employment after the act should be entitled to say i do not want to work on sundays if the employer has decided on a seven-day opening instead of six <e> <s> it is not a matter of saying i do not want to work on sunday <e> <s> this amendment gives the employee a right to say i dont want to work on sunday but i claim that i am entitled nevertheless to work on six days a week whether it suits you or not and even though it might suit you very much better to employ somebody who will work on a sunday <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may know much more about this than i do but there is a right to be reinstated <e> <s> i know it is not used very much but it exists in the act i think i am right in saying subject to correction <e>", "<cs> my lords it only remains for me to say that that is most generous and how grateful i am to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i will gladly withdraw the amendment <e> <s> it is the sort of amendment that can go down if necessary on third reading but it is a comfort to know that there is some common ground between section and section <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords at committee i surmised that paragraph was merely declaratory and the noble lord the minister agreed with that <e> <s> that being so it could be either dispensed with or be preceded by words showing that it was purely a declaratory provision <e> <s> i am very glad that in fact the course was taken of removing it and i do not think that the noble lord lord graham is from his point of view in any way prejudiced by that <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of those who presumed to criticise the drafting of the original schedule it is only right that i should say that this seems to me to be a tremendous improvement <e> <s> it can now be easily understood by the trade union officials and by the retail organisations and i should have thought by an individual shopkeeper who has been accustomed to the shops act <e> <s> that is the general position so i express my thanks <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very frequent when the government are neutral on this type of

assistance in this sort of context would be available to the noble lord lord meston <e> <s> if he can say that may i respectfully suggest that the noble lord might withdraw this amendment at this stage because it is the kind of amendment which can properly be made at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady seear did not state with complete accuracy what the objection to her

of the noble lord lord kilbracken was an improvement to the bill <e> <s> this gives us an opportunity of saying how much we all owe to the noble lord for the immense care that he has taken with this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend summarised in ringing tones the purpose of the first three subsections of this new clause <e> <s> he then said again in ringing tones that no one will dissent from that <e> <s> i have to say with all respect to him that i strongly dissent with regard to subsection <e> <s> it seems to me highly objectionable to put on the registrar the duty of inquiring the true facts relating to the birth of any child particularly in the circumstances with which we are concerned <e> <s> to have the registrar cross-examining the persons who are seeking the registration to ascertain the circumstances in which the child was engendered seems to me impossible of acceptance <e>", "<cs> my lords in welcoming the bill even more heartily than i did on second reading i should like to congratulate my noble and learned friend on the woolsack for yet again bringing forward the law commission reform of family law legislation <e> <s> its record is outstanding

is made on that question i should like to ask the minister how late he proposes to proceed on this report stage <e> <s> it is a most important bill reforming the law for the first time since and reforming the system of pilotage which dates from long before that <e> <s> there are amendments listed for consideration <e> <s> a number of them are of great importance some are very lengthy and some

remind your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords may i have an answer from the noble lord <e> <s> the bill is very lengthy with amendments <e> <s> not all of us are in the full <e>", "<cs> my lords there were a number of objections to clause as it stands most of which have been dealt with by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> the most serious was that whereas at present pilots are except in two pilotage districts independent contractors the clause as originally drafted and as now reported to your lordships gives no rights to the pilots as independent contractors <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down i do not know whether this is a convenient time to ask him to deal with the point i raised on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> perhaps i may put the point again <e> <s> if one looks at amendment no <e> <s> subsection of the new clause appears to give the pilots the offer of either a contract of employment or a contract for services <e> <s> if one looks at subsection one sees that it is entirely up to the harbour authority to decide which is the appropriate contract to put forward <e> <s> in other words it takes away the choice at the option of the harbour authority <e>", "<cs> my lords on the drafting point that was made by the noble viscount lord simon that there is a reference to subsection which has been removed perhaps i may make two points <e> <s> first of all i very much agree with the noble lord lord underhill about the excessive grouping that we have had <e> <s> we have got into a mess over clause and will i think continue in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment subject to the drafting <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment <e> <s> naturally i am attracted by the word reasonable in this connection because my noble and learned friend lord brightman and i used a similar expression when we tried to frame a short amendment to take the place of this clause <e> <s> but i am particularly anxious to get rid of the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so sorry to interrupt but where does the noble lord get those words <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord lord underhill will say why he has limited the amendment to the relevant licence holders or all the old pilots <e> <s> i also wish to take up a point i made earlier which applies equally to clause and amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i should like to ask whether it is possible to simplify enormously the very clumsy definition of relevant licence holders and relevant authorised pilots which the minister accepted was even if necessary rather cumbrous drafting <e> <s> one could cut straight through that by referring to the trade union representatives of the pilots <e> <s> the phrase appears later in the arbitration amendment <e> <s> if the minister would consider that matter it might be possible to simplify the present clause or the new clause amendment no <e> <s> in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble viscount will go ahead <e> <s> he remains seated so i will go ahead <e> <s> i have already made a number of rude noises about this amendment and its predecessor clause <e> <s> a moment ago the minister suggested that subsection gives the pilots a choice between a contract of employment and a contract for services as self-employed <e> <s> that limits the apparently very wide options of the cha under subsection <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister is right on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord sure that he is right about that <e> <s> subsection refers only to a contract of employment <e>", "<cs> my lords on the grouping list according to my note here there is also amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> is that right <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not desire at this stage to speak about amendment no <e> <s> in general except that i should like to associate myself with the gratitude that has been expressed to the minister because i was one of those who at the committee stage urged the necessity of either appeal or arbitration <e> <s> this is yet another example of the way the noble lord has gone far to meet the views that were put forward in committee <e> <s> i am also very grateful for his sending me a copy of the letter which he wrote to the noble lord lord underhill about the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords as we are now debating amendment no <e> <s> i ask the noble lord to consider three points <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to amendment no <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill made it plain that what he had in mind was dangerous cargoes <e> <s> when your lordships were discussing this matter in committee there was general agreement that dangerous cargoes should be specifically dealt with <e> <s> i ventured to express doubts as to whether it was necessary to amend both clause and clause <e>

is now part of the bill we need amendment no <e> <s> at all <e>", "<cs> my lords it only remains for me to thank the minister for his words <e> <s> i am entirely content that he should take the point away and consider it <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure where we are <e> <s> has the noble lord lord strathcona and mount royal moved a manuscript amendment to put his amendment in order <e> <s> a manuscript amendment may be moved on report otherwise surely the amendment that is put from the woolsack should be that which is printed

interests to weigh and i find myself perfectly well persuaded that his scheme is not only fair but extremely adroit <e> <s> i respectfully agree with my noble friend lord greenway and the noble viscount lord simon that this amendment is a fair and equitable compromise between conflicting interests <e>", "<cs> my lords even more than usual it seems to me that the contributions to this debate

and learned friend lord denning said and as the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead said in committee an essential constitutional basis namely the rule of law on which our liberties depend <e> <s> if we allow a blanket cover for all actions of a minister and they are multifarious as my noble and learned friend pointed out and oust the jurisdiction of the court as this bill does we strike at the very basis of the rule of law <e> <s> i venture to suggest that we also create a most dangerous precedent that may well be abused by those who do not value the rule of law in the same way as members of your lordships house do today <e>", "<cs> my lords if as so many have said the rule of law on which our liberties depend is involved is that not an issue which far transcends the words of this particular clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak as i have spoken before on the present subsection <e> <s> however it might be more convenient if the minister first dealt with the reasons why he prefers his amendment no <e> <s> to the noble lords amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am entirely in his hands in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i gather that the minister prefers to speak after we have all said what there is to say on these amendments <e> <s> as noble lords know i have always been completely baffled by subsection <e> <s> i have taken the view that it takes away the choice apparently given to pilots earlier <e> <s> the minister has explained to me a number of times that subsection operates only to allow a competent harbour authority to refuse to authorise if the pilots refuse both a contract of employment and a contract for services <e> <s> i was unable to understand that and in the end the noble <e>", "<cs> the minister said employment <e>

not for the first or for the last time having looked through the list of amendments have i occasion to thank the noble lord for his receptiveness to the suggestions that have been made at various stages of the bill and for the care that he has taken in considering any point that has been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to be associated with those thanks and also to congratu-late the minister on the felicity with which he drafted the amendments which no doubt he will pass on to the draftsman <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister is not getting tired of people saying thank you to him <e> <s> at any rate i should like to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill has undoubtedly been much improved during its passage through this house <e> <s> all of us are deeply indebted to

donaldson indicated that he introduced this amendment in order to test the opinion in the committee <e> <s> in expressing a personal view it is only right that i should remind the committee that it is now years since i had responsibility for prison administration <e> <s> nevertheless i am bound to say that having listened to the arguments today it seems to me that the arguments in favour of the amendment far outweigh those against it <e> <s> the committee has heard them fully and pointedly put but that is the impression made on at least one cross-bencher <e>", "<cs> not even my affection for my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones can prevent my saying that this amendment seeks to insert in the statute book a mass of quite unnecessary verbiage when it is already too full of such matter <e>", "<cs> in moving this amendment the noble lord said truly that the statute book is replete with provisions enjoining one public body to co-operate with another <e> <s> i can only say so much the worse for the statute book <e> <s> i trust that for the reasons given by my noble and learned friend the committee will not accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady faithfull indicated that this was a probing amendment <e> <s> at the moment opinion is running much more strongly than it has during any part of my lifetime in favour of a system of family courts <e> <s> if we are to have a system of family courts there is a very strong argument for not having the duplication which would be involved in the system suggested by this amendment but having minor juvenile crime dealt with in the family court <e>", "<cs> the words in parenthesis in subsection seem to me to be right <e> <s> the exception made there is a pocket knife with no blade which is longer than three inches or which locks when open <e> <s> in other words the draftsman intends that the exception shall not extend to a flick knife <e> <s> the drafting is in what the noble lord lord mishcon has called a negative form <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will be greatly indebted to the noble earl who is not only an eminent lawyer but has also held some of the greatest offices of state <e> <s> when he introduces the debate as he did one hopes against hope that at last some notice may be taken of what the renton committee in said was widespread concern about the complexity and lack of clarity of much of our legislation <e> <s> those words apply every bit as much today as they did then <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the noble and learned lord is not gainsaying that the job <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord referred in passing to secondary legislation <e> <s> will he be kind enough to deal explicitly with the important point made by the noble lords lord meston and lord renton namely that we may have to look forward to secondary unamendable legislation taking the place of primary amendable legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i trust that it is not inconvenient if i mention at this stage something about the marshalled list <e> <s> i imagine that most of your lordships make notes on the bill of the numbers of the amendments on the marshalled list <e> <s> when we collected the marshalled list this morning that was virtually impractical <e> <s> in one case there was no number printed <e> <s> in other cases a digit was cut out <e> <s> in other cases still the numbers were under the staples <e> <s> the marshalled list was reprinted <e> <s> perhaps i may make one comment and one plea <e> <s> what happened was in no sense the fault of the noble earl or his department <e> <s> however it is the sort of thing that inevitably follows if we try to over-legislate and to legislate too urgently <e> <s> we discussed that matter last wednesday <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear from the speeches made by the proponents of the amendment that they are concerned with sexual abuse and assaults on young children <e> <s> however the new clause goes far beyond that when it states that video interviews are admissible in all criminal proceedings <e>", "<cs> even if that procedure was limited to cases of sexual abuse of young children the noble lord lord paget has rightly pointed out that perpetrators of abominable crimes are often exonerated or go free from prosecution <e> <s> the alternative is to put the child through the trauma of giving evidence and recapitulating a terrible event in a way that is likely to be damaging and distressing <e> <s> when i weigh those alternatives i am convinced by the arguments of the noble lord lord paget that bringing in this innovation would be most unsafe <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will allow me to intervene that is not quite what i said <e> <s> i said that it is better that one or two villains should escape than that an innocent man should be convicted through prejudice <e>", "<cs> my lords on examining the drafting paragraphs a and b seem to need the word unless but paragraphs c and d seem to need the word if <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all noble lords feel deeply indebted to the noble lord lord windlesham <e> <s> i am wholly persuaded <e> <s> any recommendation made should be made in open court so that it is understood by the public and the defendant and although this anticipates the next amendment so that it is reviewable <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said on the last amendment i am generally in favour of this amendment <e> <s> if the judges recommendation has no influence it should not be made but we know from what we have been told that it has some influence <e> <s> as it has some influence and as judges are fallible the accused should have the right to have the recommendation reviewed by the court of appeal criminal division <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether it is convenient to intervene at this moment and whether it interferes with the dinner arrangements but i hope noble lords will indicate if they are becoming hungry and would rather that the debate was adjourned at this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support both of these amendments because to my mind the second amendment no <e> <s> is vital to the first <e> <s> i myself had no hesitation in supporting the government in abolishing the right of peremptory challenge by the defence <e>", "<cs> my lords when a similar amendment was put forward in committee i said that i should prefer to see the problem identified and the solution advanced within the ambit of a system of family courts <e> <s> i was much encouraged by the noble earls reply that consideration of setting up a system of family courts is proceeding <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee i expressed the view that the clause as drafted was absolutely correct <e> <s> it was clear that the offence of carrying a flick-knife in a public place was established by the drafting <e> <s> i expatiated on that in a letter to the noble earl analysing further the drafting and adhering to that view <e> <s> i added that if the draftsman could recast the clause in a more affirmative form although i did not think it was necessary he would please the noble earl lord de la warr and the noble lord lord mishcon and that he has done <e> <s> i slightly prefer the original draft but it would be churlish and curmudgeonly of me if those two noble lords are pleased although they are not present to pursue any stylistic argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if i may interrupt the noble lord lord paget <e> <s> is he not now speaking to amendment no <e> <s> to which we shall come in a moment <e> <s> that will be called whatever we do with amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble earl will give consideration to paragraph b of the amendment because there are a number of people for example a high sheriff who must carry a sword as part of their public duty <e> <s> i imagine that the same consideration will apply in the case of a bayonet carried by a guardsman on parade <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will tell me if i am wrong but my recollection is that those words go back at least as far as the copyright act <e> <s> i am speaking now to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is absolutely necessary to avoid arguments such as that is not a graphic work that is a mere scribble or that is not a painting that is a mere daub <e> <s> as i understand it that is why the words were originally included and have been maintained for over years <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to discuss before the committee in its legislative capacity a case in which i took part in noble lords deliberations in a judicial capacity <e> <s> however in the case of <e>", "<cs> my lords on report i supported the purport of amendment no <e> <s> but like the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter i found it difficult to accept the last provision that was then in the amendment as it was inconsistent in spirit with the decision that your lordships had taken to allow appeal by the prosecution against an over-lenient sentence <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> now comes forward without what both the noble lord and i found to be a ground for objection <e> <s> the noble lord lord harris has argued that point with complete persuasiveness <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble earl will not think me discourteous if i say that i am not entirely satisfied with his explanation <e> <s> but this is no time to debate this so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that noble lords will allow a short intervention from the cross-benches before passing this bill <e> <s> perhaps i may make two comments by way of preliminary observation <e> <s> first this is an enormous bill <e> <s> my noble and learned friend has described it as a marathon <e> <s> it is mammoth and it seems to me that we have rushed it too much <e> <s> the times between the various stages of the bill were very short indeed <e> <s> i was quite amazed at the way in which the noble earl managed to deal with the vast mass of correspondence between those various stages <e>", "<cs> has the noble lord considered those poems the whole essence of which is the typographical arrangement <e> <s> historically there was a poem in the shape of a butterfly <e> <s> in quite modern times there were poems by cummings for example where the whole essence was the typographical arrangement <e> <s> for the moment i cannot see why the period of copyright should not be the normal one in the case of a literary work <e>", "<cs> i agree with everything that my noble and learned friend said with the exception of the last part to which the noble lord lord lloyd referred <e> <s> i have always regarded the phrase and/or as one of the laws few useful contributions to the english language <e>", "<cs> i should have thought myself that subsections and merely state what the courts would in any case do as a matter of ordinary statutory construction <e> <s> as for subsection although the noble lord lord broxbourne managed to find it easy to understand when a former quain professor of law declares that he cannot understand it i am bound to ask what chance has the ordinary artist or literary man who is affected by it <e>", "<cs> where does the minister find the concept of primary purpose <e> <s> the words in line are for the purposes of <e>", "<cs> in addition to the instances which have been given by the noble lord lord peston and the noble baroness it seems that the amendment has this advantage <e> <s> it says in one word what the bill says in two <e> <s> in consequence a large passage can be omitted from the definition section clause <e>", "<cs> i wonder if i may ask the minister arising out of the instance put by the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington whether the signing of a picture or a drawing is in the view of the government an assertion <e> <s> if he prefers to say that he is considering the whole aspect of that matter i should be content to leave it like that <e> <s> but he may know the answer at once <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the difficulty about the amendment is that there are a number of different sorts of private houses <e> <s> there is number laburnum grove and there is blenheim palace <e> <s> a line ought to be drawn somewhere between those <e> <s> the amendment goes altogether too far <e>", "<cs> i have two short drafting points to raise <e> <s> i am reluctant to question the drafting of what has been generally accepted as a well-drafted bill <e> <s> however i should like to ask the minister to consider with the draftsmen whether lines and are necessary <e> <s> i should have thought that they could be taken for granted <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord sefton has once again put your lordships in his debt by drawing attention to what in my respectful submission i speak as an admirer in

westmister and not old trafford or headingly he also even managed to squeeze out a friendly reference to a document from yorkshire <e>", "<cs> my lords i must sit down without mentioning the relocation of industry and government departments and the desirability of regional and local pay settlements <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me for interrupting i was dealing with

one of the solutions to this problem would be the restoration to the cabinet legislation committee to which he has already referred of the task of scrutinising the drafting of all legislation with the remit that nothing shall be introduced the provisions of which are not immediately and clearly comprehensible to those affected by it <e>", "<cs> i have in the past and still do work very closely with the noble baroness and indeed with the noble lord lord mcgregor and on matters which we put very high on our respective agenda i believe we see eye to eye <e> <s> however in my submission this amendment is wrong both in its form and in its intention <e> <s> in its form it puts a duty on the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> that duty as my noble and learned friend lord denning pointed out by the evolution of our legal process is now reviewable in the courts <e> <s> the job that is given to the courts is really quite an impossible one to carry out <e> <s> the amendment refers to people of small or moderate means <e> <s> the people who apply will obviously be the people who are just above the current legal aid limits <e> <s> how can any court possibly say that they are of small or moderate means <e> <s> i suppose we all think of ourselves in those terms when we read of the glittering figures on wall street <e> <s> however it is really quite an impossible task to impose on the courts and indeed on parliament when it comes to review the regulations <e> <s> it is quite premature now to canvass the question of the regulatory powers under this bill <e> <s> that is quite a different question <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord allow me <e> <s> the amendment states <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may interrupt the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i have not had a list of groupings <e> <s> did he say that he was taking this amendment with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> constitutionally this seems to me one of the most important matters that the committee has to consider <e> <s> a great deal under this bill is carried out by regulations <e> <s> we have come to accommodate that although it inhibits to a great extent the regulatory function of the houses of parliament and in particular it inhibits the function of this house as a revising chamber <e> <s> even if this amendment is accepted there is no possibility of amending the regulations that are laid <e> <s> all that can be done is discussion and if opinion is hostile enough the regulations are taken away redrafted and relaid but at any rate this goes part of the way <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord moves his amendment i wonder whether there is a spare copy of the groupings of amendments because i am anxious to follow the proceedings <e> <s> i apologise to the noble lord for my interruption <e>", "<cs> the reason i ventured to ask for the grouping of amendments at inconvenience i fear to the noble lord lord mishcon was that it seemed that amendment no <e> <s> which is the only one before the committee at the moment would have extremely limited if any effect unless considered with the other amendments <e> <s> indeed the noble lord lord mishcon dealt with the subsequent amendment and continued as far as amendment no <e> <s> dealing with the affirmative resolution which is extremely important <e> <s> so far as i can see unless the other amendments are accepted amendment no <e> <s> has almost no effect at all <e> <s> i can with difficulty spell out a very limited effect which certainly would not satisfy the noble lord lord mishcon <e>

to the constitution of the board the question of the regulatory powers arose and i ventured to draw attention to the fact that proceeding by subordinate legislation was a serious inroad on your lordships constitutional duty to act as a revising chamber <e> <s> my noble and learned friend lord hailsham subsequently pointed out that there was a genuine distinction between matters of substantial importance which if there were to be regulation could go by negative resolution and others more important that ought to be dealt with by affirmative resolution <e> <s> not for the first time he convinced me and i think my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor accepted that position <e>", "<cs> i spoke in favour of the amendment but having heard what my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor has said it would seem extremely ungracious to say the least to press the matter <e> <s> i agreed entirely with everything that my noble and learned friend lord hailsham of saint marylebone said <e> <s> there may be a defect in the drafting <e> <s> but my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor has shown an openness of mind in being willing to consider the matter further this means that things not considered satisfactory can be proceeded with again on report <e> <s> i can only express the hope that my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones will not divide the committee on the amendment <e>", "<cs> this amendment has been moved by my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones but it stands in the name of the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> it is a very sad business because it represents a recrudescence of a malaise on the part of the noble lord which so distressed the committee on the prosecution of offences bill <e>", "<cs> this amendment is designed to meet a case where an order for costs would be made if the proceedings had not been legally aided and the court had in addition to be satisfied that it is just and equitable in all the circumstances that the legal aid fund should reimburse the unassisted party <e> <s> surely that should be an end of the matter <e> <s> if it is just and equitable that the legal aid fund should pay that answers with all respect the point of my noble and learned friend lord hailsham that there should be a sanction against the legal aid fund where it allows unmeritorious action to be brought <e>", "<cs> i stand by everything i said in relation to the earlier clause to which my noble and learned friend lord ackner has referred <e> <s> i hope that we shall have a further opportunity of discussing that

distrust of the treasury <e> <s> the bill is concened with the provision of justice through legal aid <e> <s> the worst place to proclaim justice is on the doorstep of the international monetary fund

seems to find so ignoble <e>", "<cs> i trust that that is not the last word of my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor <e> <s> it seemed to me that the speech of my noble friend lord benson

with the contents of lines and about which the noble lord lord mishcon and i both asked <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord mishcon sums up this debate i should like to thank my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor for his very kind references to me and ask him what difference it will make to any action of his of any official of his department the chancellor of the exchequer or any treasury official if those words are omitted <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord but for the sake of those of us who had to leave the chamber before the end of the proceedings yesterday may we know whether any amendments were accepted other than the governments amendments <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged <e> <s> i apologise to the noble lord for interrupting him <e>", "<cs> my lords my

where they are capable of dealing with their existing load <e> <s> he must have put in or at least prepared figures <e>", "<cs> i venture to support the generality of the amendment <e> <s> there are two reasons for doing so <e> <s> one is that so much of what is intended to be done under clause will be by subordinate legislation not all of it subject to affirmative resolution <e> <s> even if it were it is liable to escape parliamentary notice and this proposal will give parliamentary notice <e> <s> the second reason as was said by the noble lord lord mishcon is that we may want to move to an alternative system <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton suggested not the unified civil court but the amalgamation of the county and the crown court <e> <s> as i read it there is nothing in the amendment which would in any way run counter to what the noble lord lord renton would like to see <e>", "<cs> noble lords have just heard a powerful speech made by a noble lord of great legislative parliamentary and ministerial experience and will want to give due weight to it <e> <s> i have no quarrel with the thrust and intention of clause <e> <s> however i wish to draw attention to a point implicit in the speech of the noble lord lord rippon <e> <s> the clause starts as so many do with the words <e>", "<cs> i do not know what the usual channels are in this connection <e> <s> i was

voices are collected how far the government reasonably expect us to go this evening and how late they contemplate sitting <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount did not answer my second question <e> <s> if we try to reach clause we shall go well into the early hours of the morning <e>", "<cs> having listened to this debate i have been strongly under the impression that a high balance of argument not merely numbers but the weight of argument has been against my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor <e> <s> i do not know where we go from there because there is a safe majority outside the chamber

constitutional and social importance <e>", "<cs> i think it ought to be withdrawn <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the motion <e>", "<cs> i should like to take up a theme which was adumbrated on earlier amendments <e> <s> my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor has just referred to it again <e> <s> it is the long-standing dispute over rights of audience and preferment to the high court bench which has been running and i think is still running between the bar and solicitors <e> <s> i do so from two points of view <e> <s> the first is that apart from the immediate future i cannot see that what my noble and learned friend proposes will do otherwise than defeat his own purpose <e> <s> the second is to tell the committee that i believe that the problem was within an ace of solution at one time and that a solution is still available <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> i dealt precisely with that on the basis that the overheads of solicitors are much higher than those of the bar <e>", "<cs> as regards the parliamentary aspect i wish to point out the following in case what i call the mishcon doctrine should be thought to have been adopted by default <e>", "<cs> it did not concern the length of time that we should be speaking <e> <s> it concerned how many days should be given to committee and the hours that members should be compelled to sit <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble viscount how late we are expected to sit tonight <e> <s> in doing so i should like to indicate the undesirability of having to discuss a bill of this kind late at night or early in the morning <e> <s> i should also point out that we spent three-quarters of an hour earlier this afternoon on a statement <e>", "<cs> this is an immensely complicated schedule and members of the committee will be very much indebted for the exemplary clarity of my noble and learned friends lord ackner and the lord chancellor in explaining where their difference lies <e> <s> as i understand it my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor only demurred on one point namely that although he thought it right that the authorised bodies should be consulted he did not

necessity of subsection in its present permissive form <e>", "<cs> will my noble and learned friend kindly answer my original question namely if the lines were removed would he not be able to do everything contained in those lines <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble viscount until what time it is proposed to sit to consider the succeeding extremely important <e>", "<cs> as i might have done on the previous amendment i merely remark that my noble and learned friend has very properly said what he proposes to do which is a perfectly adequate way of dealing with these matters of detail rather than to have a permissive clause stating that the minister may in particular do so and so <e>", "<cs> in the interests of constitutionality and economy of words in the statute book i draw attention to

of the henry viii clauses and what should be proper parliamentary control <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor is it seems at one with the law society in wishing to sweep away any restriction on multi-national partnerships and associations <e> <s> but he has gone on to sweep away more than that <e> <s> he has swept away any restrictions on multi-disciplinary partnerships and associations <e> <s> in doing so he has failed to recognise the point validly made by the noble lord lord mishcon that the law society would be left open to objection by the director general of fair trading on the grounds of setting up a restrictive practice if it took advantge of the power given by my noble and learned friend to inhibit multi-disciplinary practices <e> <s> the only answer

well <e> <s> there is always great competition for public funds <e> <s> the treasury tries to attain the right priorities <e> <s> if there is a disagreement the matter goes to a cabinet committee and nowadays if necessary to the committee that is known as the star chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to refer to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> my noble and learned friend lord ackner gave us some quotations which show the background of constitutional suspicion as regards the advisory committee <e> <s> the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington voiced the same viewpoint from a slightly

astonishing amendment a complete new schedule brought forward at report stage <e> <s> there has been no attempt to re-commit the bill so that it can be properly considered <e> <s> not only is it quite astonishing that a new schedule of more than three pages should be tabled at report stage and that it is brought forward at twenty to ten at night with a sparse house but the content of the schedule

still speaking <e> <s> i am sorry to prevent him from settling down but perhaps he will be good enough to answer the question i tried to put to him namely whether it would be open under the new contract that can be made between barrister and client to absolve the barrister from any liability at all for negligence or breach of contract <e>", "<cs> my lords he decided wrongly <e>", "<cs> my

began <e> <s> it must be a record when government amendments on report exceed the number of new clauses moved elsewhere <e> <s> there is an important matter still to come <e> <s> there is the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington to leave out clause <e> <s> i do not imagine that the new clause and the new schedule tabled by my noble and learned friend will take long but the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right but the remaining were substantial amendments including new clauses <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the leader of the house is always responsive to feeling in the house indeed he is its interpreter <e> <s> the feeling in the house as manifested from all parts of the house is that we have gone far enough today and that the government should find another day <e> <s> they are not doing the bill justice they are not doing themselves justice and above all they are not doing justice to the reputation of this house as a revising chamber <e> <s> if the bill is rushed through its remaining stages as it has been rushed through so far the message will have to go to another place that noble lords have not been able to discuss it thoroughly and that even with those advantages and sacrifices in spite of amendments not being moved particularly those not moved so that they can be discussed informally with my noble and learned friend the government have been extremely harsh in driving the bill through with a tired majority waiting outside in case there is a division and pie-eyed junior ministers at the behest of the noble lord the chief whip kept here in case there should now be a division <e> <s> as i have no doubt that the noble lord the chief whip has that majority what i called before a silent and dead majority outside i see no point in my pressing the matter to a division <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me <e>", "<cs> my lords if your lordships would allow me i should like to speak again in view of what the noble lord the leader of the house said about the debate on the green paper <e> <s> it was put in on a friday <e> <s> that undoubtedly allowed the lords of appeal in ordinary to attend because they do not sit judicially that day although they do work that day on the cases that they have heard and are about to hear <e> <s>

amendments i rise to express my support for them <e> <s> however if the noble earl would like to <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon habitually puts us in his debt by his cogency and

at this time <e> <s> he has absolutely no need to apologise for the timing <e> <s> not only is the subject most important but it throws a great deal of light on the bill that we have been debating for so long and so late into the night and the early morning the courts and legal services bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not rise to oppose the amendments but merely to point out that this is one of government amendments tabled for third reading <e> <s> the government have tabled of the amendments <e> <s> further your lordships did not start on this business until shortly before four oclock <e> <s> i say that because your lordships have been required to sit very late day after day on the bill <e> <s> by very late i mean after pm and often after midnight <e> <s> according to the order paper the bill will be taken today <e> <s> there is no provision for the motion that the bill do now pass to be taken on a later day <e> <s> but standing orders make it quite plain that there is perfect freedom if the noble lords think it right to postpone the motion that the bill do now pass <e> <s> it is impossible for your lordships to dispose of all the amendments tabled for third reading and still give adequate consideration to the matters for discussion on the motion that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask what the proposals are for the rest of the evening <e> <s> i have to put the question in that way because great enthusiasm has not been shown for deferring to the wishes of noble lords and the house <e> <s> that was especially marked on the final day on report when all parts of the house expressly desired that proceedings should be adjourned <e> <s> if the noble lord the chief whip or the noble earl wish to intervene to say that an extra day will be given i shall sit down right away otherwise i must explain why i am asking the question <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down does he realise that he has been quite implacable about this just as he was on the last day of report stage <e> <s> the noble lord has always a velvet glove which is very acceptable and pleasant <e> <s> however on both occasions he has shown nakedly the iron fist inside it <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the most important amendment to be considered on the bill <e> <s> this debate is even more important than the debate on what is called the cab rank rule <e> <s> i echo what has been said that it is a scandal that the most important issue of the bill has to be debated in an empty house at this hour of night <e> <s> one has only to look around to note the absence of my noble and learned friend lord hailsham who made powerful speeches both at second reading and in committee <e> <s> he is not present very naturally at this hour just as many other noble lords are not present <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to prevent my noble and learned friend from finally settling down but he argued that it is up to the client whether or not he enters into a conditional fee agreement <e> <s> i hope my noble and learned friend will see fit to deal with the second point i made namely that no provision is made for independent advice for a client on the matter <e> <s> does not my noble and learned friend consider that it is inherently desirable that the client should have such independent advice <e>", "<cs> my lords earlier this evening i quoted the observation of disraeli on lord hartingtons speech after the berlin treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill is of limited impact and i venture to support it <e> <s> its limited impact has been argued in cogent and most informative speeches that preceded mine but though of limited impact if raises wider questions in relation to parliamentary democracy <e> <s> a generally accepted description

set out clearly what is involved <e> <s> it is singularly unfortunate that there was a misunderstanding that persisted right up to the end of last week <e> <s> it supervenes on the discussion that your lordships had earlier this afternoon <e> <s> in my view the trouble orginates from the great speed at which we are endeavouring to legislate <e> <s> that is almost a certain recipe for misunderstanding <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to express my thanks to the noble earl the paymaster general <e> <s> as i had not heard from him as i expected to hear yesterday i put down my amendment no <e> <s> just ahead i imagine of the noble earls amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> there are only two differences on both of which i hesitated <e> <s> they concern where the amendments should appear in the bill and whether the cautionary words at the beginning of my amendment are necessary <e> <s> on both those points the draftsman is entitled to have his view maintained and vindicated <e> <s> the noble earl has been good as his word in committee and rather better than his word at report as he merely said then that he would consult <e> <s> i am most grateful to him <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry to interrupt my noble and learned friend <e> <s> not only did the royal commission not come down in favour it came down against the proposition <e>", "<cs> it is with great temerity that i intervene on a scottish bill <e> <s> there is a very important word in this amendment namely the paramount consideration <e> <s> i am not sure whether the noble and learned lord the lord advocate entirely met that point <e> <s> as my noble and learned friend lord mccluskey said the word has a long history <e> <s> it used to appear in the various statutes relating to children when they spoke of the first and paramount consideration being the welfare of the child <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has been good enough to say that he will reconsider the drafting of the clause but i wish to draw attention to an additional matter <e> <s> subsection provides that the regulations under the clause shall be subject to the negative scrutiny <e>", "<cs> there are three potent reasons which speak in favour of this amendment but first i deal with what was said by the noble baroness and answered by my noble and learned friend lord mccluskey <e> <s> i presume to agree with everything he said <e> <s> english law and as i understand it scottish law are quite the same in this respect <e> <s> occasionally but not all that often the law says that if you can prove a and b then result c will follow <e> <s> far more often the law says that if you can prove conduct at a certain level then result c will follow <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble and learned friend and particularly for his allowing me to enter into correspondence on this matter which has its technical aspects and is more suitable to be resolved through correspondence than discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords there were two powerful reasons which spoke in favour of the amendment moved by the noble earl that i confess caused me to favour it at the time <e> <s> the first was that this is in a sense an enabling bill <e> <s> the noble earl has dealt with that cogently today and there is no need to expatiate on it <e> <s> however i do not believe that your lordships disapprobation of a bill of this type a disapprobation that has been clearly voiced in all parts of the house need be vindicated by this unusual provision which has many disadvantages <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in entire agreement on the substance of what your lordships including my noble friend lord adrian did at report stage with regard to graduate students <e> <s> however it seems to me quite unarguable that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all of your lordships who have contributed to the debate for the most important ideas that have been ventilated <e> <s> the very fertility of those ideas points irresistibly to the need for a more ample debate although i venture to say that todays debate has been fully justified <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord underhill has put forward this amendment with his usual fairness and frankness but with respect there are two conclusive reasons why it is unacceptable <e> <s> first it is quite unacceptable that the electoral system should be fixed by ministerial order under delegated legislation <e> <s> that would be so if one simply left it there but one goes further <e> <s> it is still not conceded that it is not a convention of this house that your lordships do not vote against an order in delegated legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords when i ventured to address your lordships in december i submitted that what was proposed in the report was quite unacceptable for two main reasons <e> <s> first that in all probability we could not vouchsafe to the defendant a fair trial <e> <s> secondly viewed realistically the measure was retrospective in effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that the noble lord lord mishcon has raised the matter and in such a cogent way <e> <s> many of the amendments are welcome <e> <s> indeed many are in response to points made in your lordships house when the bill was before your lordships <e> <s> but it is first the sheer bulk of the amendments which is questionable <e> <s> secondly the problem is compounded by continuation of a style of drafting which stands in defiance of the recommendations of the renton committee on preparation of legislation <e> <s> thirdly in this respect the bill does not stand alone nor does this year stand alone <e> <s> your lordships returned one week before the other place resumed <e> <s> we had to deal with three important bills and a
