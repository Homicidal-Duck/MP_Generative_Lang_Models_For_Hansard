["<cs> my lords it was certainly a reminder of delicious eating to hear my noble friend lord forte speak so sensitively of his staff training schemes and i should like to add my congratulations on his speech <e> <s> the ending of a familiar job can leave a yawning gap <e> <s> it may come about not only through direct hire or fire but through illness disability earlier than expected retirement or other factors <e> <s> such happenings leave such a sense of rejection which too easily develops into anguished bitterness and a soured attitude of mind <e> <s> the result obviously is a waste of good material and talent with loss of commitment and an urge to opt out <e> <s> my personal knowledge of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i and other members of your lordships house who think as i do consider it would be wrong to allow this bill to leave this house with apparently unanimous approval <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly <e>", "<cs> my lords i should feel much happier if i were able to agree with the noble earl who i know has worked so very hard on this bill but alas i simply cannot be such a hypocrite as to do that <e> <s> i and other members of your lordships house who think as i do consider that it would be wrong to allow the bill to leave this house with apparently unanimous approval <e> <s> on second reading i made it very clear that it seemed to me that despite its name the bill goes against the interests of disabled people <e> <s> through co-operation on behalf of employers and individuals and especially through chairmen and chief executives to which i made reference in this house last wednesday in the debate on training for jobs much has been achieved in helping disabled people to careers <e> <s> now the national access committee is just starting and it shows good promise <e> <s> various clauses were inserted in the telecommunications bill during its different stages in this house protecting the interests of disabled people <e> <s> these suggest that the director general of oftel should have an advisory body on disablement affairs and british telecom already has such a body at work <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way for a moment <e> <s> i think that the noble lord got me wrong <e> <s> he suggested that i was using access as an excuse <e> <s> not at all <e> <s> i was drawing attention to the new national access committee that shows great promise <e>", "<cs> my lords i give my good wishes to this bill <e> <s> my noble friend lord campbell of croy has worked carefully and most knowledgably and i think deserves our thanks for it <e> <s> he has been working away towards it for quite a long time <e>"]
