["<cs> my lords i really am very conscious of the great privilege it is to be addressing your lordships house on this first occasion <e> <s> may i record my gratitude for the remarkable help and consideration i have received here since i took my place among your lordships <e> <s> my wish today is to welcome this bill particularly clause <e> <s> this says that a child with special educational needs who is educated in an ordinary local authority school shall so far as is reasonably practicable engage in the activities of the school <e> <s> remembering my own experiences as a severely disabled year-old i want to reiterate what has been generally expressed in the warnock report and elsewhere namely that it is to the good of disabled children as far as is possible to mix with able-bodied children <e> <s> i humbly claim that it is very good for able-bodied children to mix with us because in that way normal values and assessments can be made corners can be rubbed off and the common difficulties can be better understood <e>", "<cs> it is with very great regret that i feel bound to support the amendment <e> <s> i saywith very great regretbecause i well realise the difficulty of the circumstances <e> <s> i do so feeling slightly encouraged that my noble friend the minister and the government have chosen such good timing for this bill at a time when we are told the school population is falling dramatically <e> <s> it surely would do less than justice to their skill if there were not suitable ordinary schools where physically handicapped pupils with learning difficulties could be accommodated <e> <s> to have just one such school in an area seems essential if we are to believe that this bill is going to work <e> <s> while recognising all the complications i am hoping that my noble friend the minister may find it possible either to accept the amendment or to seek the best possible good practice from education authorities to achieve this end <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lady faithfull in her remarks on the two amendments <e> <s> i feel very strongly that households in which someone is disabled deserve the clearest possible directions as to where to get the information and counselling they require <e> <s> they need streamlined channels through which to work and any spare capacity that is available for help and ingenuity is badly needed at home <e> <s> life for those families can be very confusing already without receiving inquiries from possibly the wrong department and from more than one department <e> <s> we should hope for the maximum information to be obtained from one clued-up source because too often people find themselves having to tell the same story to several officials each of whom can only deal with part of a problem <e> <s> that is not much fun when the question being dealt with is the delicate and personal one of a young disabled child <e> <s> it will indeed be helpful if the education and social services departments will collaborate more than they do in practice to the very fullest in fact on this particular point <e>", "<cs> i speak against the amendment though i believe that probably it reaches for the ideal <e> <s> i feel that it might have the effect of delaying implementation of the bill <e> <s> i listened with great sympathy to what the noble baroness has just said about the need to have statistics in order to see whether implementation is working out well but surely it is bound to be a question of evolution when it comes to getting it to work properly <e> <s> in the end if an amendment of this kind will hold up the passing of the bill surely it is more important and more essential to get the framework of the bill on to the statute book <e> <s> we have heard from my noble friend lady faithfull that my noble friend the minister is ready to give something on this very point <e> <s> therefore i oppose the amendment and i shall be very interested to hear what the minister has to tell us on this particular point <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that all of us must have been extremely moved by the remarks of my noble friend lord renton obviously he feels most sincerely and deeply on this matter <e> <s> but i noted that he has a very strong belief in the good practice of doctors their willingness to be frank whether or not there is this imposition on the revelations they have to make <e> <s> i wonder how wise it is for the parents <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that as there are those who stick to this misguided belief in the quota system the facts which show it to be ineffective and virtually unworkable should be made better known so that the merits of the mscs review of the system and the alternatives suggested therein are more widely recognised <e>", "<cs> my lords most of us who were born and brought up in the west riding of yorkshire feel very close to the textile and clothing industries and their impact on the community <e> <s> it is not only management and employees and their families who are so closely affected but also the voluntary organisations which have in the past received munificent support from generous and inspired industrialists and from the charitable funds of the trades over many years <e> <s> the real romance of these industries is that they have so often relied on enterprise and dashing initiative to reach success and on cool courage to get through the troughs <e> <s> their manufactured products traditionally are the envy of the world <e> <s> this is part of the very life fabric of many people in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late stage of the debate i put it to your lordships that in this pressurised existence many of us find ourselves treading the tightrope of mental health from which tightrope crashing falls too easily occur <e> <s> what a blessing it is that over the last four decades such real progress has been made in breaking through the awful barrier that formerly surrounded these hazards <e> <s> then it really was a case of them and us where little publicly was done about the lot of for example the cerebrally palsied or spastic except possibly to label them the village idiot the only refuge that could be offered to them was the old gruesome asylum <e> <s> society was so patently mistaken about these people and i am grateful that in this bill the term subnormal is substituted by mental handicap for in todays more humane and emancipated climate we could not expect less <e> <s> it is almost todays climb-down to concede how little we once knew about the troubles of our fellow men <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate humbly my noble friend lady gardner of parkes for putting down this unstarred question <e> <s> those of us who hold orange badges have responsibilities <e> <s> we should be aware of our privileges and not try to obstruct others and to be sensible about it <e> <s> but i find it bothering for <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in congratulating my noble friend the minister on that very encouraging reply particularly in this difficult time and especially in regard to the substantial improvement in the mobility allowance i ask for his assurance that improvement in the benefits for disabled people will still be a priority with the government <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister to state whether the government are satisfied with the present level of take-up of benefits by disabled people <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware that from secondary rental the leading independent radio contractor capital radio has set up the very important national broadcasting school and that for instance capital spends further substantial funds on projects such as operation drake and help line <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend the minister for his reply may i ask him whether he is aware that the disablement income group and the equal opportunities commission are campaigning against the test as being unfair discriminatory and humiliating <e> <s> is he further aware that well over per cent <e> <s> of the decisions arrived at through the test are as i am told reversed on appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords while being grateful to my noble friend the minister for telling us that the whole situation is under review i hope he realises that what really irks many of us is that no male and no spinster is required to take any test to qualify for a non-contributory pension <e> <s> while disabled housewives must continue to go in for this normal household duties test and furthermore they must fail the test to establish their eligibility for pension we must feel that this is unfair <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend the minister for his answer disturbing as it is i should like to ask him whether he is aware that the leaders of labour boroughs in london have warned the glc of the consequences of these substantial rate increases this year <e> <s> would he not consider that the present rising trend could threaten chaos for londons jobs and industry of a kind favoured by the enemies of democracy <e>", "<cs> my lords to declare my very humble interest in the debate i would say that for some years i was secretary of a childrens orthopaedic hospital and then a member of two hospital management committees <e> <s> i am now chairman of a large patients association <e> <s> in the presence of so many distinguished specialists on the national health service i hope to make just two or three points from the worms eye view of the consumer <e> <s> progress of medical science has enabled very many of us to withstand the onslaught of killer virus disease and accident <e> <s> thus longevity offers a new dimension to earthly existence <e> <s> so the governments recent consultative document <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware that this really is a most welcome increase and that freeing the allowance from tax will benefit very many disabled people who go out to work and have other taxable income <e> <s> is he further aware that in this previously deprived area the rise means that by november the mobility allowance will have been increased by over per cent <e> <s> under the present government though sadly deprivation remains for those debarred the scheme on grounds of age <e>", "<cs> my lords t should like to refer to part i clauses to of the bill <e> <s> when i was engaged in remunerative employment of various kinds it was always a great surprise to find that national health insurance operated in what seemed to me a strangely inexplicable manner <e> <s> fortunately like most disabled workers i was off work through illness on only few occasions but each time i was amazed to discover that while my employer continued to pay me in full he refused to accept from me the national health payments that i received <e> <s> i still believe that those payments had to belong to him or at least to someone other than me <e> <s> accountants and establishment officers argued with me and did their best to try to convince me that this strange performance was perfectly in order that the labyrinthian ways of insurance required this to happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords following that very positively encouraging reply may i ask my noble friend the minister to say how many local authorities are making improvement grants to first-time buyers who are willing to undertake homesteading <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister to return to his answer to my supplementary question and tell us how many local authorities are improving properties for sale to first-time buyers <e>", "<cs> my lords by initiating this debate the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs has given us scope to consider the complex and changing problems that beset the parents of todays children and teenagers <e> <s> the noble baroness herself has given us vivid and very useful descriptions <e> <s> in asking your lordships to look at the case of the parents of mentally and/or physically handicapped children i do so with a wish to be realistic and certainly not to be sentimental <e> <s> this problem is somewhat different from the others it refers to situations where a family can be diminished by the anxiety the distress and the tedium of having to give long-term support to what can be the ugly burden of coping and caring for a child who cannot keep up with the fun and games of able-bodied children <e> <s> however much they may wish to include the disabled child if for instance he or she is covered in splints or is in a wheelchair <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend state the prospects of the british apple industrys campaign to promote coxs orange pippins at least on level terms with french golden delicious <e>", "<cs> my lords may i therefore be convinced by what my noble friend has said that apple growers can now rest fairly assured that their wares will be better enabled to compete with foreign imports <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend the minister for his reply may i ask him this could he tell us whether in future such sums might include other facilities for disabled children for example for handicapped adventure playgrounds <e>", "<cs> my lords those members of the house with a special interest in this subject are particularly indebted to the noble baroness lady stedman for initiating this debate <e> <s> if anyone has had to be hauled up into a bus onto his seat and then found his caliper splint firmly fixed in the hinge of the door putting the driver off schedule by minutes he will know too well as i do the crying need for the adaptations which are referred to in the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend the minister for supplying the figures may i ask that they be made better known among members of the nursing profession who may then be more inclined to co-operate with the government in getting pay negotiations for the nursing profession put on to a more sensible basis <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister confirm that all emergency cases are receiving proper care and attention during the national health service industrial dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware that there are disabled residents in kensington who remember the inaccessibility and inconvenience of a far from beautiful town hall and who are pleased to exchange it for relief of a penny in the rates <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether he is aware that dr pinder-wilsons kinsmen and friends are especially concerned on account of his age and frailty as the result of a former attack of poliomyelitis and the fact that he also suffers from a duodenal ulcer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that as letters delayed by this despicable means add quite unacceptable dangers and anxieties for patients and cause unnecessary problems for overworked doctors all effective steps really must be taken to prevent this from happening again <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i was not present to hear the maiden speech of my noble friend lord kindersley about which i hear such good reports <e> <s> however i am delighted to have been present to hear the splendidly fact-filled maiden speech of my noble friend lord rootes and i should like to add my congratulations to the many that he has already received <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend the minister for his reply may i ask for his opinion on the hold-up of sterile supplies which impedes the work of doctors requires operations to be postponed and causes anguish to patients <e> <s> is he further aware that diagnosis of emergency cases by the picket line is farcical and unacceptable to ill people <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister whether if there have to be picket lines in the nhs dispute he does not think that in fairness they should be manned only by those who have themselves experienced serious illness and hospitalisation <e>", "<cs> my lords my first aim today is to convey to your lordships the views of the royal association of disability and rehabilitation on which i serve as a vice-president <e> <s> the association firmly considers that whenever it is at all possible disabled people should wear seat belts <e> <s> indeed through figures provided by the bma it would appear that a higher proportion of disabled drivers already wear seat belts than is the case with the able-bodied <e> <s> however there are cases where the use of a seat belt causes unnecessary pain or creates such other difficulties that the requirement to wear one prevents a disabled motorist from using a car <e> <s> that indeed may cover one of the points mentioned today by my noble friend lord mottistone in regard to the problem of the short person <e> <s> the extra difficulties include those that are experienced by some trike drivers <e> <s> radar believes that these cases small in number as they are should be given a certificate exempting them from wearing a seat belt <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the minister for that reassuring reply may i ask him to <e>", "<cs> my lords for the benefit of the many of us on all sides of this house who care deeply about conditions of work for nurses will my noble friend confirm that to saw a reduction in the working week from hours to hours for nurses and midwives in normal circumstances giving scope for earning more for unsocial hours <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am sure your lordships will agree to perform many tasks in the nursing profession calls for the very finest qualities <e> <s> psychiatric nursing in particular makes huge demands and asks for almost superhuman strength of character <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear very much that some of these amendments are going to place undue restraints on psychiatrists who have such an important part to play in getting people back into ordinary life from the agony of a special hospital <e> <s> i fear that in many ways it is going to restrain them from doing what they believe to be the right thing and at the right time if these amendments are carried through <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend the minister for that very satisfactory reply which surely must be welcome by very many pensioners may i ask him how many pensioners will in fact receive the bonus <e>", "<cs> my lords may i additionally ask my noble friend the minister whether i am right in thinking that the bonus is tax free <e> <s> because that is an important point <e>", "<cs> my lords many of your lordships already show much concern about the needs and aspirations of disabled people <e> <s> the very provision this afternoon of extra space for wheelchairs on the floor of the chamber is proof of this and it is something for which i certainly am extremely grateful <e> <s> so it could seem as though it might almost be belabouring the point unnecessarily to parade our case once again <e> <s> but there continue to be gaps in provision which really do call for attention as we have heard from the two noble lords who have already spoken <e> <s> thus the noble lord lord wells-pestell serves a very valuable purpose in initiating this debate in step with <e>", "<cs> my lords the provisions which the government are seeking to introduce in the health and social services and social security adjudications bill were described by my noble friend the parliamentary under-secretary and i am very glad to contribute to this debate <e> <s> it is so good to note that the main intention of the legislation is to develop methods for caring within the community rather than in hospital for people who are physically or mentally handicapped <e> <s> i believe that your lordships are agreed that generally speaking disabled and handicapped people are better able so far as it possible to lead a full useful and active life if living among families and friends <e> <s> so it is good that the extension of the joint financing arrangements in part i of the bill should encourage further progress in the great work already taking place in that direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my tribute to my noble friend lord campbell of alloway for initiating this debate and for bringing to it the depth of his legal knowledge <e> <s> the reason for my short intervention is to express certain views forged through observation and experience to some degree views that differ from those put forward so far <e> <s> i would make it clear at once that in no way do i seek to belittle the huge burden placed on parents families and the community and perhaps most of all on the patients concerned as the result of the kind of damage that is under discussion <e> <s> i believe that we are all of the same mind in thinking that it is virtually impossible to equate such disasters in terms of cash but as with other horrific happenings it is all too easy to turn on the taps of emotion in powerful doses and so largely submerge logic and reality <e> <s> that course is far from the one that i wish to pursue today <e>", "<cs> the amendment gives me the chance to voice our deep concern about the future of the phipps respiratory unit and i shall try at this late hour to keep my remarks short <e> <s> although this unit belongs to st thomas hospital that illustrious hospital which is going through such traumatic times it is based in the south-western hospital at stockwell <e> <s> the unit is unique <e> <s> it deals with severely disabled cases who also have respiratory problems <e> <s> to see patients in iron lungs on life-support respirators with tracheostomies on the cuirass pump method on rocking-beds and other forms of respiratory assistance appears to encourage those who sometimes visit the unit to describe it as a dump for moribunds <e> <s> of course that is a shocking and quite inaccurate description <e> <s> nevertheless it is clear that it is only those of us who have been treated or worked there who know how far from the truth that description is <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend the parliamentary under-secretary whether he can give us any guidance as to the amount that is recovered by this payment for home help service <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord as to the vital necessity of the service but i feel that everything is comparative and if enough is not brought in by having this on a payment basis then i should have thought that there was a good case for thinking again <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask my noble friend that consideration be given to the inclusion in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend the minister for his reply <e> <s> in view of the sometimes surprising mixture of successful applicants for grants compared with other at least equally worthy bodies which are probably too hard-pressed to discover the right application formula would it be acceptable to make more widely known the correct method of application for these grants <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for his reply can he say to what extent telemessages are proving a substitute for the telegram both for commerce and for hatch match and dispatch requirements <e> <s> further may i ask whether the existence of the service could be better publicised including for instance the -hours guaranteed delivery of the message which compares favourably with the rather different condition in the present postal service even if it has recently improved <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend the minister not agree that the inadequacy of the current provisions for vaccine damaged children only underlines the urgent need for a national disability income or an allowance for extra expenses for disability on the lines of the digs campaign which would of course include all children severely handicapped from whatever cause <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend the minister for that reply may i ask whether he agrees that it is quality rather than quantity perhaps that is needed now for the complex problems that are facing social workers today and also that it is good practice as well as good training that is needed in order to attain the high quality of qualifications that is suggested for general training of social workers on the barclay report <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware that very severely disabled homebound people are really so occupied with daily living that they very much do need advice from high grade welfare workers to help them to know what assistance and what benefits are available to them <e> <s> is he aware also how very much we appreciate the fact that the government have at least homed in on this particularly since many social services departments do not find it possible to send very high grade social workers to deal with disabled people <e>", "<cs> my lords may i chip in there to ask my noble friend whether he is aware that the barclay report has shown that the elderly geriatric and disabled people are now apt to get the less highly qualified since the shortage of social workers has been biting <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord campbell of croy as usual brings before your lordships house a matter that is not only positive but in this case needing to be explained before th march <e> <s> it is as i understand it about th march that local authorities will start to tighten up their issuing of orange badges <e> <s> the aim is of course to control the misuse of badges such as we know at present exists and local authorities are going to get stricter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for that very encouraging answer may i ask him this question is he able to confirm that in areas where harsher penalties are imposed by magistrates there is less violence than in other areas <e>", "<cs> my lords may i further ask my noble friend this question does he agree that one of the most effective penalties is to make offenders spend their time at attendance centres on saturday afternoons <e>", "<cs> being myself a senior citizen spinster it may be thought that i have little right to speak in this committee but i crave eligibility on the grounds of familiarity with this particular subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in welcoming the very good news contained in my noble friends answer may i ask him what steps will be taken to co-ordinate the many developments of this kind both in the united kingdom and in other eec countries and how this information will be disseminated to severely handicapped people and to the medical profession and the ancillary services <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in acknowledging that very interesting reply may i ask my noble friend the minister whether the aim of the inquiry will be to get better value for money combined with better patient care particularly since i understand that in the year the national health service will cost the record figure of frac billion <e>", "<cs> my lords the motion in the name of the noble lord lord wells-pestell leaves very little doubt that the noble lord regards the <e>", "<cs> my lords contrary to the assumption of the noble lord lord aylestone that everyone on this side of the house sees trade unions as a cross that we have to bear in my opinion well-run trade unions can form an important part of the tapestry of the life of the community <e> <s> it is necessary therefore that they should keep and in some cases regain their credibility at every level not just that they influence the wide and important issues that they enter into in the daily lives of the ordinary people <e> <s> i believe that the loyalty of individual members to their unions is determined to a great degree by the support and assistance that they personally can receive <e> <s> this must <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will also allow me to mention some aspects of clause as i see them viewed from the angle of disabled residents <e> <s> the opinions that i hold differ from those put by the noble viscount lord ingleby and by a number of concerned organisations <e> <s> the basic difference is that i am a very firm believer that wherever possible it is best for people to own their own dwellings <e> <s> obviously the number of residences available to rent should not be reduced overall because we do not want to complicate further the homeless situation <e> <s> here i believe that we can take heart from what has happened to the non-charitable housing associations through the act <e> <s> we have heard that at the end of the number of non-charitable housing association tenants who would purchase their homes was yet during the life of this parliament the increase in the rented stock of the housing associations has been in houses and flats <e> <s> that means that for one sale there has been almost a five-fold increase in dwellings to rent <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for that answer may i ask whether this partnership between government and rural areas appears to be promoting the stimulation of the self-help and initiative that is always present but sometimes latent in village areas <e> <s> can he also describe some of the actual projects that have been included in the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an understatement to say that efficient telecommunications are of immense importance to the united kingdom particularly when information technology is growing almost daily in significance in so many spheres including very much from the point of view that i am representing making life simpler for very many disabled people <e> <s> therefore i find it very hard to see that this bill is irrelevant <e>", "<cs> my lords from the tory benches <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that i supported the bill fully and wholeheartedly <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for that very satisfactory reply may i ask whether he can say if the latest figures for february continue this encouraging trend <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister say whether the volume of housing starts varies greatly in different areas of the country <e>", "<cs> i wish to oppose this amendment <e> <s> does the committee really want charitable housing associations not to have the benefit already enjoyed by non-charitable associations <e> <s> after all they would then become the depressed relative <e> <s> the non-charitable associations have sold houses since and in the lifetime of this government they have provided more dwellings in flats and houses <e> <s> some of that success must appeal to the charitable housing associations <e> <s> after all the appeals come in from the charitable housing associations for funds to develop they are received by many of us <e>", "<cs> having heard the ministers reply and the comments by the noble viscount lord ingleby and the noble baroness lady birk i should like to say that i am very grateful to the minister for what he has said <e> <s> i would be delighted if he would take the matter away and consider it <e> <s> before concluding may i say to the noble viscount lord ingleby and to the noble baroness lady birk that to my mind it would be a very great shame if we were to look a gift horse in the mouth <e> <s> housing for the disabled will definitely be at a disadvantage if we do not take what we are offered now in the way of grants and make the most of it <e> <s> i beg leve to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have just two small reasons for wishing to give the bill my wholehearted support <e> <s> first like so many of your lordships at one time i lived in a village <e> <s> the village had a small parochial trust which was quite out of step with the current situation <e> <s> this was the cause of very much thought and concern to dutiful inhabitants and parish councillors who almost wished that it would go away <e>", "<cs> my lords like others of your lordships i am grateful to my noble friend lady faithfull for introducing this compact and attractive bill <e> <s> there seem to me to be among others two reasons why no time should be lost in tackling the present perplexingly obsolete situation <e> <s> one that there can never have been a time when more heartrending appeals for funds professionally launched are pressed on the public <e> <s> the majority of <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords after that very encouraging answer i should like to ask my noble friend the minister what response was received from health authorities with regard to the request from the government to set a date to get mentally handicapped children out of hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister tell me what help is being given by the government to local authorities to provide the small homely units in which some children will be more appropriately looked after <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to your lordships that other business kept me away from the chamber during the early part of the debate <e> <s> change even when for the better can be very uncomfortable in the intermediate stage <e> <s> the fear and apprehension about the cable system springs from a lack of knowledge and understanding of the complex subject plus the view that the telly allows the forces of good and evil to wage battle in the home <e> <s> the charge of evil of course is reinforced by a surfeit of violence and sex films in programmes over recent months <e>", "<cs> my lords in the past your lordships have very often shown favour to an unfair case even when the tide is against it and especially if it concerns those who are badly placed to speak up for themselves <e> <s> it is gratifying that with her usual sagacity my noble friend lady gardner of parkes has put before the house two classic cases of unfairness both of which the disablement income group has fought to correct over at least the past years <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend the minister for that very encouraging reply may i ask whether the government have plans to introduce grants for adapting the office switchboards known as pabx and if so who will administer those grants <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i thank my noble friend for that reply and for the information contained in it <e> <s> can my noble friend say how many of these applications refer to housing <e>", "<cs> my lords referring to my supplementary question can my noble friend say whether it is possible to let us know what proportion of the planning applications for housing are for special accommodation for disabled people <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for that interesting although perhaps slightly disconcerting reply can she say whether the government are entirely satisfied with the existing reciprocal provisions for health available to british travellers in ec countries <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether my noble friend is aware that i was slightly disconcerted about her original answer because i felt we ought to be absolutely sure that as such a large number of people are coming from abroad to this country the reciprocal arrangements are all right for our visitors going overseas <e> <s> further may i also ask whether disabled travellers from this country to ec countries are able to get the same equipment and amenities that disabled patients who visit this country from the ec can obtain <e>", "<cs> my lords the protection of public health is never more plainly to be seen than among patients in orthopaedic and long-stay hospitals <e> <s> in view of the current mind-boggling expenditure on the national health service and the necessarily huge and growing cost of medical science and research it is obvious that everything possible needs to be done to reduce illness and disease so that preventive action

deeply and believe is relevant in dealing with this subject <e> <s> my views are about assessment of awards <e> <s> it seems immodest to refer to my own contribution to an earlier debate but it was in a short debate about a year ago on vaccine damage payments that i spoke of compensation <e> <s> i said then that it is not the cause of disability but the extent of the resulting disablement and handicap which should govern the calculation of what financial help should be awarded <e> <s> such help should be through a national disability income <e> <s> i should hardly have had the temerity today to repeat this theme if my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor had not shown interest and expressed an encouraging measure of approval for it even referring to it again in answering a

informative answer <e> <s> however can he say whether the government will follow this form of categorisation in calculating benefits services and care that in future provision shall be based upon the extent of disability rather than the cause <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might pursue the matter further with the minister <e> <s> indeed i did appreciate the points that he made in answer to my supplementary question <e> <s> but what i really wish to know is whether the government plan to take up these methods of categorisation in listing the different forms of benefit services and care for the different forms of disability <e> <s> impairment handicap or whatever <e> <s> in that way we shall be able to get to the important point of treating the extent of disability rather than the cause

hard of hearing <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt my noble friend for one moment to say that it was described to me by somebody fairly expert as being little more than two bent pieces of wire which happen

to set up a commission call it what you will with the duty to eliminate and investigate circumstances of such discrimination <e> <s> is it truly likely for one moment to catch the real offenders <e> <s> i know i have said this before but i want to stress that <e> <s> it seems to me that there are those who generously discriminate in our favour and it is often a question of the healthy and generous attitude of mind of the other persons which determines this <e> <s> if a transgressor is brought to book by the commission is it likely that that will change his or her attitude at least more than in a tiny minority of cases <e> <s> i believe that to set up a commission will cost million or million and that seems to be an awful lot of money to spend just to bring a fraction of the public to heel <e> <s> that is money i should add which we have begged from scarce resources for other most important assistance areas for disabled people <e>", "<cs> i feel very humble in speaking in opposition to this amendment after the distinguished speakers who have gone before <e> <s> on a number of occasions in recent years i have been told by disabled people that they have unexpectedly found a house to live in suitably adapted to their needs <e> <s> in some cases this has occurred when a family has had to change districts probably because of a job <e> <s> to find a ready-made place

my noble friend the minister aware that since grants totalling have been made towards a sympathetic hearing scheme and that i am told that these grants have been greatly appreciated <e> <s> one hopes

other members of your lordships house who think as i do consider that it would be wrong to allow the bill to leave this house with apparently unanimous approval <e> <s> on second reading i made it very clear that it seemed to me that despite its name the bill goes against the interests of disabled people <e> <s> through co-operation on behalf of employers and individuals and especially through

more suitable moment to say this than between two such important announcements <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend the minister agree that when the procedure for making bids is clearly laid down that procedure should be complied with particularly where it refers to dates and a deadline <e> <s> would he further agree that surely the vendor should be entitled to reject a late bid <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may reinforce what my noble friend the minister said when he expressed his slight disappointment that the disabled section has come through as it has <e> <s> i want to reinforce also what i said previously that i considered this to be discrimination against one section of disabled people and that housing which is adapted for the disabled is not lost to any disabled people provided it is there <e> <s> i want to put that view on record <e> <s> it would be wrong to let this pass because many disabled people feel the same way as i do on this point <e>", "<cs> i am a little surprised by the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> my name also is down to these amendments and i do not wish to go the way that he is suggesting <e> <s> in fact we seem to have traversed such a long way under that first amendment that i wish now to outline what that amendment actually asks for <e> <s> the object of the amendments is to ensure that one member of the london regional transport corporation will have special responsibility for ensuring that the transport needs of disabled people are properly met <e> <s> properly met please note unlike the conditions suffered under london transport <e>", "<cs> i have been told that it would be as well to speak now since i put my name to this amendment but presumably because there were four names to it already it was not included <e>
