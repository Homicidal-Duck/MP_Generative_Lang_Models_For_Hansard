["<cs> my lords perhaps i may first thank my noble friend lord mishcon and the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for his kind words in anticipation of my participation in this debate <e> <s> i trust that the anticipation will not be greater than the event deserves <e> <s> i am told that the previous lord macaulay who was also of hebridean stock and an historian politician and scholar had the ability to talk for hours on end <e> <s> but i can assure your lordships that i have not inherited that trait and that i shall abide by the normal conventions of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no opposition to the approval of this order which in fact brings a measure of civilisation to the very controversial field of divorce law <e> <s> it gives me great pleasure to rise on this occasion to congratulate the noble and learned lord lord fraser of carmyllie first of all upon his appointment to the office of lord advocate and secondly upon his excellent and short maiden speech <e> <s> we look forward to hearing his future contributions in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the position in this case the learned sheriff who presided over the proceedings reached the conclusion of guilt on the part of the accused by a process of elimination <e> <s> it could only have been the man or woman living with the child who caused the injuries <e> <s> can the noble and learned lord explain to your lordships house why that principle of law could not have been applied in a jury trial where the sentence would have been considerably higher than three months <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset of my contribution to this debate perhaps i may say that it is unfortunate that those of us with a scottish interest in the privatisation of electricity will have <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make a short contribution in support of my noble friend lord carmichael on this particular amendment <e> <s> it is clear from the approach which has been taken to the privatisation of electricity and from the information that has been supplied and obtained that while scotland plays a role in the supply of electricity in the united kingdom and will play an expanding role as time goes on scottish electricity supply is a self-contained unit for operational purposes <e> <s> in that context there are different issues to be dealt with and different problems from those affecting england and wales <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may also speak in support of the amendment of the noble lord lord ezra <e> <s> clause as it stands is most unsatisfactory and in parts is almost unintelligible <e> <s> it refers to persons being appointed having experience and having shown capacity in matters relevant to the provision of electricity supply services <e> <s> of course <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down perhaps i may say a few words on amendments nos <e> <s> and to which she has just replied <e> <s> the object of these three amendments is to remove the phrase <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say that there is a degree of sympathy with the amendment on this side of the chamber <e> <s> it has our support <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to put on record our thanks from this side of the house to the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey for making possible what has been an interesting and informative debate <e> <s> likewise it was a particular pleasure to have a powerful contribution from the noble and learned lord lord jauncey of tullichettle who spoke very persuasively in a distinguished maiden speech <e> <s> he reminded your lordships house that professionalism is at the core of an efficient legal service and by inference anything that weakens that professionalism should be resisted <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord sanderson of bowden could clarify where he envisages the end result of all these proceedings <e> <s> i say that because there is provision in clause which means that any dispute can be referred to the director by either party but it is not a reference by both parties of mutual consent <e> <s> the end result of that according to subsection b is <e>", "<cs> i think that the point was made by another noble lord that snags can arise as the work progresses <e> <s> it may be that a person is prepared to take the risk initially but during the course of the work anxieties arise as to whether he can cope with the cost <e> <s> it goes even further than that because it is stated later in the bill that the decision of the arbiter cannot be referred to the court of session by stated case <e> <s> therefore the consumer in scotland is stuck with the decision of the arbiter if the supplier takes the case to the arbiter without the consumers consent <e>", "<cs> i suggest to the committee that the last two amendments show the clause to be very badly drafted <e> <s> it might be a better idea for the government to take the whole clause away and for subsections and to be seriously considered with a view to redrafting them <e> <s> i may not be speaking precisely to the amendments proposed but what puzzles me are the tenses used in subsection <e> <s> it reads <e>", "<cs> a matter arises in connection with clause and and the interrelation of these subsections <e> <s> the problem arose on the last committee day in relation to clause with reference to the arbiter <e> <s> the clauses do not lie happily together so far as the consumer if concerned <e> <s> if we take it in stages clause states <e>", "<cs> i believe that the question was directed towards me <e> <s> if it was not i shall add nothing further <e>", "<cs> it was interesting to hear the explanation of the noble lord lord sanderson of clause but with the greatest respect i may be better informed but i am none the wiser as someone said on another occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords given that a new family policy studies centre survey has found <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down perhaps i may ask her to point out where in the bill it is made a necessity on the part of the supermarket to have a separate authorisation point where a queue would form <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so that is perhaps the imagination of the large stores at work <e> <s> if the noble baroness cares to look at section bb the only requirement is that the authorisation has to be made other than at a point of sale <e> <s> the point of sale is obviously the check-out <e> <s> therefore there is no need to have any special expenditure in order to build authorisation points <e>", "<cs> my lords initially i put on record my congratulations to my noble friend lord stallard for introducing this bill <e> <s> up to this point we have had an interesting and valuable debate on what is behind the bill and how it would be operated if it became law <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is stretching my suggestion beyond the area that i am envisaging <e> <s> it is easy in large shops to identify members of staff <e> <s> emphasis has been placed on the expense and the building up of a queue by those with the supermarkets interests at heart but they are exaggerating the problem <e> <s> they are creating a problem that does not need to exist in the operation of this bill <e> <s> nowhere in the bill does it say that there has to be a separate authorisation point <e> <s> all that has to be done is for the sale to be approved before it reaches the point of sale <e> <s> there is no reason why members of staff should not do that <e> <s> it is for the supermarkets to put their own house in order <e> <s> if they wish to build a separate authorisation point and create queues <e>", "<cs> my lords there are various ways in which it can be authorised <e> <s> for example a suggestion was made that a piece of sticky paper could be attached or a rubber stamp used to mark the bottle <e> <s> in that event the person has an approved sale within the store <e> <s> i do not want to get bogged down in the technicalities of this matter <e> <s> it is for the stores to work that out if the bill becomes law <e>", "<cs> my lords the sticky label is only one suggestion that has been made <e> <s> members of staff would have access to it <e> <s> all one has to do is identify the member of staff and ask for him or her to approve the sale and it is done either by a sticky label or a stamp <e> <s> that does not seem to be an insuperable difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the noble lords view on the matter <e> <s> i am saying that the <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a most interesting debate and although we have been few in number the quality of the contributions made by noble lords and in particular the noble baroness lady carnegy have given the government some food for thought <e> <s> i too should like to add my protest that this major piece of legislation should be dealt with at this time on a friday <e> <s> it is difficult enough to get members of the house interested in scottish legislation during what one might call the normal days of the week it is far more difficult to get people to come here on a friday to hear what we have to say about the situation over the border <e> <s> the noble earl lord perth voiced the protests of us all much more eloquently than i can do and i do not propose to take up any more time of the house on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not saying that it is an english bill <e> <s> i said that what is good for england is not necessarily good for scotland <e> <s> no more am i prepared to say that because something is a success abroad it is either necessary or will be a success in scotland <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether i heard the noble lord lord jenkin correctly when he talked about research which appeared to compare liverpool with kirkcaldy <e> <s> i do not know whether he said that kirkcaldy was regarded as the centre of the drinking universe of scotland <e> <s> it has various other claims to fame indeed it used to be famous for making linoleum although the people have perhaps given that up now and are turning their attention to drink <e> <s> while the research may be interesting to take tile study on one scottish town the size of kirkcaldy and draw any inferences from that is really not a wise thing to do if i may say so <e> <s> it is only an indication of what might happen in kirkcaldy <e>", "<cs> in this session indeed yes <e> <s> it would not receive royal assent this session <e> <s> that would be to say the least unfortunate <e> <s> that is the way the timescale has worked out <e> <s> the opposition will oppose the amendments <e>", "<cs> the amendment states <e>", "<cs> they do not have clocks in supermarkets so one never knows the time <e> <s> it is one of the devices they use to keep people in <e>", "<cs> as i said on second reading it is not my responsibility to tell supermarkets how to implement the law <e> <s> no one else is told how to implement the law <e> <s> the law is on the statute book and people affected by it have to obey it <e> <s> it is not for me to tell supermarkets how to organise themselves <e> <s> there is adequate provisions for supermarkets in subsection a <e> <s> that is being ignored by the bills critics <e> <s> if a sale is completed at a point of sale used solely or mainly in respect of alcoholic liquor paragraphs b and c of subsection do not apply <e> <s> there is a way out for supermarkets in the bill as it stands <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his courteous reply to these matters raised by the amendment <e> <s> i find it strange that the minister is in possession of a definition of school education when the act from which that definition emerges is not referred to in the interpretation clause of the bill or that school education is not for the purposes of this bill clearly spelt out <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> may we therefore take it that although the bill does not say so the bodies responsible for prescribing the standards and general requirements will not be the boards of management of the schools <e> <s> in fact what we have here is a measure that characterises this bill from beginning to end <e> <s> although the government are preaching freedom and opting out freedom of choice and so on whatever education platitudes they to care use throughout the bill we find the heavy hand of the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i must apologise for asking the minister to do the physically impossible <e> <s> if he were swimming against the tide and he shot himself in the foot he would drown <e> <s> i noted that the minister used the word constraint which goes to the very heart of my criticism of this subsection <e> <s> does constraint involve the hand of the government constraining the acts of the board of management of the school to which freedom of operation is said to be given within the terms of this bill <e>", "<cs> i hope that by putting forward the amendment i have at least focused attention on the problem <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for his most considerate reply to the observations i made <e> <s> i agree as would anyone involved in the education process either as a parent or a teacher that the whole issue is a matter of degree and of striking a very fine balance between the various considerations <e> <s> it is really quite a horrible problem when such matters arise <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will assist the committee on one matter that concerns this side of the chamber regarding small schools and primary schools <e> <s> i appreciate that the figure is variable but the figure of has been picked upon as being a reasonable one for the peculiar geographical and population problems in scotland <e> <s> will the noble lord tell the committee how he envisages costing within a school with fewer than registered pupils so far as concerns the provision of education <e> <s> he is well aware that in the highlands for example we have peripatetic music teachers and art teachers who require access to the services of the education authority <e> <s> does he envisage that if a primary school is allowed to opt out with such a small number the provision of those services will be adversely affected by the withdrawal of the services or is he satisfied that that can be compensated for by the operation of clause <e> <s> clause states <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment <e> <s> i find it rather strange that the only justification for the government interfering with the running of special schools in scotland appears to be one document from the scottish parent teacher council <e> <s> i may have misheard the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that additional information <e> <s> it does not deal with the point that i wish to make at this juncture <e> <s> has the noble lord received complaints <e>", "<cs> the powerful contribution of the noble earl lord perth gives some satisfaction to this side of the committee as also does the contribution of the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> they both give powerful support to this very important amendment which we consider to be fundamental <e> <s> i shall not refer to the position of the secretary of state because it has already been hinted that i have made a second reading speech and i do not wish to make the same mistake again <e> <s> perhaps we may discuss the matter informally at some time <e>", "<cs> on the issue of parents and ballots i note that the minister mentioned amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however i do not propose to go into the matter now because i believe that we have discussed it before <e> <s> i seek information under <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> it is of course in keeping with the reasonable consideration of the amendments which have been proposed by those of us on this side of the committee <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the minister for that reasonable answer <e> <s> reasonableness abounds in the chamber at the moment <e> <s> in the light of the generous undertaking that the minister has given i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i understood that it had been agreed that amendments nos <e> <s> and would be discussed together <e> <s> it might be convenient for the committee if i were to speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect i do understand what the noble lord means <e> <s> i do not know whether he wishes to press the amendment in the light of any criticism <e>", "<cs> given that undertaking i shall move on to amendment no <e> <s> on the assumption that amendment no <e> <s> will not be pressed <e>", "<cs> i find the reference to what is happening in england quite extraordinary <e> <s> if i heard the observations of the noble lord correctly we have a figure of up to per cent <e> <s> it would be very useful if those of us who are involved in this piece of legislation could be informed first what criteria the secretary of state applied in these cases and secondly whether there is any public information available to us to consider how this bill if it becomes an act as it inevitably will will be applied in scotland <e>", "<cs> is it not the case that clauses and taken together give people a double chance at changing characteristics <e> <s> clause states <e>", "<cs> that is a most unsatisfactory reply to the question posed by this amendmentthe relationship between the teacher and the employer goes to the heart of the education system in scotland <e> <s> it is essential that there should be consensus on both sides as to what is to happen to a teacher <e> <s> this clause has the air about it of a unilaterial alteration of the terms of contract of the teacher without the teachers consent <e>", "<cs> is the minister giving a guarantee on behalf of the government that if a teacher decides not to be under the aegis of a self-governing school he or she will be guaranteed a contract of employment with the local authority even if there is no vacancy <e>", "<cs> that was not the suggestion at all <e> <s> i was raising a point concerning teachers terms of contract <e> <s> teachers have started out as employees of a local authority in which the concept of opting-out schools never existed <e> <s> as i said at the beginning of my remarks concerning this amendment there is here an echo of a unilateral change of contract <e> <s> i know that the minister has promised to take away this amendment to look at it very carefully as i am sure he will <e> <s> he has demonstrated that he always does <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his answer to the propositions which i put forward in support of the amendment <e> <s> i am pleased to hear the government saying in terms that unregistered teachers will not be qualified in self-governing schools <e> <s> i have no doubt that the government will ensure that that policy is carried out to the full <e> <s> in the light of the noble lords undertaking i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the draft regulations state that the grant will include allowance for expenditure on services provided centrally from the education budget whereas in the case of the regional psychological service the authority will have a continuing responsibility to provide for pupils at self-governing schools <e> <s> it is not clear whether the self-governing school requiring the psychological service will be operating in terms of clause which deals with the provision of services <e> <s> i wonder whether amendment no <e> <s> should read section instead of section <e> <s> perhaps the noble baroness will confirm that she meant to refer to clause because clause does not appear to have much to do with the provisional services <e> <s> the side note to clause is <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that clause as amended do not stand part of the bill <e> <s> however i too wish to add my own congratulations to the noble earl lord strathmore and kinghorne on his first appearance on the government front bench <e> <s> i wish to echo the sentiments that have been expressed by the noble lord lord carmichael on behalf of those of us on this side of the chamber <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his explanation of the governments position <e> <s> on this side of the chamber we ask that the government take this particular clause away and rewrite it <e> <s> we do not wish it to be excised <e> <s> we accept that not every clause will be perfect <e> <s> that has been demonstrated in bills throughout the ages which have had to be tested in the courts <e> <s> however those of us on this side of the chamber feel that this is such a vital area of the bill that we wish to take the opinion of the committee <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a word or two in support of this amendment <e> <s> consultation should be of the essence in the operation of this act and what the noble baroness has said has gone to the root of the question <e> <s> the two amendments go to that matter <e>", "<cs> those are consequential amendments <e> <s> i do not think i need say anything about them <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the minister for his very full answer <e> <s> in the light of the various undertakings that he has given i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the amendment proposed draws attention to a very important part of the schedule <e> <s> the fact that parents will have to answer yes or no to whatever the question may be makes the consultation and the information process even more important for the proper operation of the bill once it becomes an act <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> what is fair and what is reasonable <e>", "<cs> life is full of hope and expectation <e> <s> one hopes that that will be the end result <e> <s> i am obliged to the noble lord for that explanation <e> <s> i shall take the matter away and have another look at it <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like some guidance from the government as to the consequences of clause in relation to the disposal of land by the board of management <e> <s> as the clause stands an education authority might have to buy back its own land <e> <s> subsection says <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the minister for his explanation of the governments position and for the fact that he said he will have another look at the provisions of clause to see whether there are any unforeseen snags in the disposal of property covered by clause <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for that contribution <e> <s> i am not complaining about a teachers performance record or contract of employment being transferred but i am worried about what i called tittle-tattle being transferred for example matters concerning a teachers personal life <e> <s> the noble lord lord addington very clearly focused on this matter as involving civil rights <e> <s> the minister made the point that when a person moves from one employer to another the new employer makes up his mind about the man or woman as he sees him <e>", "<cs> i heard the minister say that was not correct <e> <s> however when a person changes from employer a to employer b employer a does not necessarily send a dossier on the employee to employer b employer b must make up his mind and form his own view as regards whether a job candidate is acceptable to his firm <e> <s> however the teaching situation is a special one involving an education authority teachers pupils parents and now a board of management <e> <s> the amendment is put forward to help rather than to hinder and to focus attention on the fact that there could be real difficulties if a piece of information which is entirely unfounded in fact reaches a board of management <e> <s> that information may surface when a teacher has transferred to a new school <e> <s> the information which is perhaps detrimental to the teachers character in a personal sense rather than a working sense could lead to court actions and serious repercussions on a local authority <e> <s> i ask the minister to follow the line suggested by the noble baroness lady carnegy and have another look at the principle behind the amendment although i acknowledge that the amendment could be tighter <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that assurance <e> <s> however i must point out that we are not necessarily talking about formal records and that is one of the difficulties <e> <s> clause c will have to be very tightly framed <e> <s> the clause refers to all information and not just to written information <e> <s> it concerns any information <e> <s> a director of education could phone up a head master for example and suggest things about a transferred employee <e> <s> however the minister has assured us that he will have another look at this matter <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> to take up the observation made by the noble baroness lady <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the minister cannot see his way to giving this matter further consideration because the committee has had powerful contributions from the noble lords lord addington and lord mackie of benshie in support <e> <s> we were rather disappointed by the contribution made by the noble baroness lady carnegy taking the attitude which seemed to come over to this side of the committee that it was all about politics <e> <s> she suggested that we should get rid of these local authority people because they do not do anything else but talk about politics <e> <s> let us get the pragmatic men she says <e> <s> that is a very interesting word <e> <s> is she suggesting that employers representatives do not think pragmatically in politics as well <e> <s> of course they do <e> <s> it is not the kind of argument that we should get into at this stage <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the minister for that information <e> <s> if he is satisfied that the matter focused by the amendment is covered under existing legislation i beg leave at this stage to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the minister for that reply and gratified by his assurances that the government can see no real problem in the progress of the academies <e> <s> it is perhaps unfortunate that the word academy has been used because it tends to carry with it an aura of elitism in education <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> i appreciate the distinction between registered teachers in ordinary schools if i may call them that and these technology academies which will be run on an independent basis <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that very full reply which satisfies me at this stage <e> <s> the amendment being a probing one and the answer having been given i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in his reply can the minister indicate to the committee on what basis primary four and primary seven were chosen as being the only times at which a child should be tested <e> <s> if we are introducing the principle of testing in two limited subjects then we may as well go the whole hog and give pupils a test every year in english and mathematics <e> <s> then it would be possible to assess how the child was progressing <e>", "<cs> in the light of that answer can the minister confirm that by different classes of teachers he means different categories of certificated teachers within the system <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the minister for that reply and to the noble lord lord mackie for his contribution <e> <s> it is nice to see the minister and the noble lord agreeing with each other <e> <s> i accept what the minister has said <e> <s> i wish to <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that very full reply <e> <s> i take it that the principle he has given is that he is in sympathy with the concept that parents should be funded in circumstances where it would be advantageous to the child and his or her development <e> <s> accordingly i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> however i am not sure as yet what nationally means <e> <s> i shall read his reply with care and consider the position before the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that that is a very restrictive way of appointing a principal teacher <e> <s> i thought that the minister was referring to an education authority as a whole being irresponsible <e> <s> there may be circumstances in which an authority has a surplus of teachers and a falling school roll <e> <s> there is no reason why it should not use the surplus teachers if they are suitably qualified and pass the requisite examination for selection <e> <s> there is no reason why they could not appoint such a teacher without going to the trouble of advertising nationally throughout scotland <e> <s> i heard what the minister had to say and shall consider it with care <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we have discussed this definition of parent at length on previous occasions <e> <s> i am not clear where the bill stands in relation to the definition <e> <s> we have the definition <e>", "<cs> i may have misheard the minister <e> <s> does that mean that although technically a child can have six parents only one parent will be entitled to vote in respect of that child <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the minister for that clarification <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that full explanation <e> <s> i am not altogether informed as to the experiment in ullapool but i noted that the minister said that that school was being established with help from the highlands and islands development board <e> <s> that is an entirely different matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the minister <e> <s> however that help may not be available to small schools elsewhere <e> <s> of course it will be a matter of waiting to see once the bill is enacted how the situation will develop <e> <s> the test of viability will be difficult and no doubt those advising the minister will go into all the various fluctuations in school needs and the population of the schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i heartily endorse the remarks of the noble lord lord addington <e> <s> the comments made by the noble baroness lady carnegy demonstrate the problem being faced by the amendment namely that administration within the school process is a learning process <e> <s> the amendment merely seeks to give people <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for taking note of what was said in committee on a clause which could have important financial repercussions on local authorities <e> <s> we on this side of the house are glad to see the word any disappearing and the word reasonable coming in <e> <s> in the circumstances there is no opposition to this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that full reply <e> <s> we put forward the amendment because of our concern that once this step is taken the chain of events which leads ultimately to self-governing status will be set in motion and parents will lose control <e> <s> it will then depend on the good will of the secretary of state to take note of objections <e> <s> we have found that the use of the term self-governing has tended to beg questions as the debate has proceeded <e> <s> however the noble lord has given a full reply <e> <s> if notes for guidance as to what is to be published are to be given to the school boards i would hope that in keeping with his approach to the bill the minister will bear in mind the terms of the amendment <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking for myself i should briefly like to say that i support the spirit of the amendment but unfortunately it would be very difficult with respect to the noble earl lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> one of the reasons for <e>", "<cs> my lords this is obviously a matter which occasions some degree of serious consideration on the part of us all <e> <s> in his reply the minister appeared to be saying that diagnostic testing will as i suggested it might have its place alongside the national testing in primary and primary <e> <s> i took that from his reply and certainly that the development to diagnostic testing will not be stopped so to speak by the existence of the national test at primary and primary <e> <s> it gives hope to those who inspired these amendments if it is not to be excluded from the system <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble baroness lady carnegy if we thought that the bill was tailor-made for the education system of scotland we would not be opposing the bill on all fronts as we have done <e> <s> whether the suit will fit scotland only time will tell <e> <s> i hope that the government will understand that the amendment now before your lordships house for the third time has the positive merit of giving a specific guide to the secretary of state when he is considering the matters referred to in amendments nos <e> <s> to to which the minister will be speaking in due course <e> <s> we shall discuss them when we come to them <e> <s> however the word simple has now been omitted from the bill for reasons that are not quite clear to me because i do not see much difference between a simple majority and a majority <e> <s> if the government are deleting the word simple preceding majority it could mean that where a school has only a simple majority it will not achieve self-governing status <e> <s> it is one way in which the removal of the word simple complicates the issue even more <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise what the minister says in relation to these amendments <e> <s> i also recognise that he is attempting to adopt an equitable approach to the consideration of these very important issues in the educational system of scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my congratulations to the noble lord lord nathan and his committee on the comprehensive and informative report which they have produced within their terms of reference <e> <s> it was a painstaking exercise which makes fascinating reading <e> <s> it has produced a series of recommendations which in due course will lead to considerable debate when and if legislation follows in order to implement those which the government accept <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to make my contribution which will be considerably shorter than it might have been earlier in the day to this interesting debate <e> <s> perhaps i may express my own thanks to the noble earl lord ferrers for calling attention to the report and giving your lordships house an opportunity to consider this very important topic <e>", "<cs> as a scottish lawyer i rise with some hesitation even to speak about english law about which regrettably i know very little far less would i attempt to interfere with its progress <e> <s> however on this occasion i venture to speak because this is not a purely legal issue <e> <s> the reasoning behind it has a socio-political dimension <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may thank the noble and learned lord lord fraser of carmyllie for his detailed introduction to this important piece of legislation affecting many areas of scottish life <e> <s> i should say at the outset that i am pleased as i am sure the house will be that the topics have attracted a large number of eminent speakers with no doubt varying viewpoints including members of the scottish judiciary and particularly the recently appointed lord president of the court of session the noble and learned lord lord emslie <e> <s> his contribution to the debate based on his vast experience as a practitioner judge and administrator in the supreme courts of scotland is keenly awaited by us all <e> <s> that is not to say that we <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to make my contribution to this very interesting debate i first add my congratulations to the noble lord lord crook on his very informative and interesting maiden speech <e> <s> i am sure that we all look forward to his further contributions in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to be facetious about a most serious matter <e> <s> however the bill and the interesting debates remind me of the story of an old new orleans trumpeter who in his later days could not hit the top notes <e> <s> when an admirer asked what he did when required to do so he said if i cant make it i just fake it <e> <s> i believe that we are seeing a government who have now reached the stage where they cannot quite reach their top notes and this bill is if i may say so a fake <e> <s> that point has been very well covered by previous speakers in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for that explanation and for his assurance to your lordships committee that he is satisfied that he has sufficient powers under the clause <e> <s> i take on board the points made by the noble lord lord morton and the noble earl lord balfour <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what has been said by he noble earl lord selkirk concerning amendment no <e> <s> and by the noble and learned lords lord campbell of lochbroom and lord morton of shuna <e>", "<cs> this amendment is grouped with amendment no <e> <s> which is in similar terms and also with amendment no <e> <s> which covers the same ground <e> <s> with the leave of the committee i speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that amendment makes an amendment to clause about where applications should be made <e> <s> instead of the court of session it suggests that in addition a sheriff court should have jurisdiction over the place in which the trust has its principal place of business at the time of the application <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for that explanation <e> <s> but it seems to me to be a rather unusual state of affairs when one compares subsection with subsection <e> <s> in subsection the lord advocate <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that reply and i am satisfied with that explanation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as regards small charities members on this side of the committee support the amendment <e> <s> the figure of about a year seems to be reasonable <e> <s> it has the added advantage with reference to the earlier part of the debate of excluding these small charities <e> <s> the register that was discussed would become a little smaller <e> <s> it would make it easier for the government to establish their own records <e>", "<cs> this amendment raises an issue which arises in later parts of the bill <e> <s> speaking from this side of the chamber i oppose the amendment <e> <s> i think it is proper that if we are setting up a statutory code of conduct so to speak people examining it should know precisely from reading the bill just what they can or cannot do and what the penalties would be for contravening the provisions of the bill <e>", "<cs> the amendment standing in my name is amendment no <e> <s> and the same principle applies <e> <s> perhaps i was reading it slightly differently from the noble and learned lord lord cameron of lochbroom <e> <s> i was reading the word may in the sense of having been required in terms of the subsection because it follows on from <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make one observation <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord morton said that i endorsed this clause with enthusiasm <e> <s> i must say that i was endorsing the principle of having statutory offences within the bill not necessarily with enthusiasm but as being necessary <e> <s> having heard what the noble and learned lord had to say about the use of the word concern i must express some reservations <e> <s> i should like to think about what it entails <e> <s> the use of the word which governs the body rather than the person any person who holds the body out as a charity <e> <s> that may be the point which the noble and learned lord lord morton is making <e> <s> speaking for myself having heard the argument i can see some substance in that criticism <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord lord mackie of benshie for that observation <e> <s> that was precisely the point i was trying to make but perhaps i made it rather badly <e> <s> i am not very happy about the proposition of equating charities particularly the charities that might be under investigation with large companies <e> <s> i shall not press the amendment but the lord advocate may wish to give the period some further consideration between now and the report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for that explanation <e> <s> if the charity is to have a leeway of months it is difficult to see what criteria the lord advocate might apply when judging whether an extension should be allowed what the length of that extension might be and the reasons for it <e> <s> with the greatest of respect that is something which the court being neutral in the matter might be better fitted to determine rather than to leave the decision to be made by the parties who have failed to comply with the legislation and the lord advocate who may be interested in investigating the body <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for that explanation <e> <s> however i should say that the purpose <e>", "<cs> i am obliged for that explanation <e> <s> however i still think it might be worth while as on so many other clauses at this stage to give consideration in the absence of a definition to including the word funds in this clause and if necessary throughout the bill <e> <s> but in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> to put the matter briefly it seems to me that we are dealing with a question of natural justice <e> <s> no person should be in the position of being landed with what might be considerable expenses without being informed first that there is a hearing <e>", "<cs> there is one other point to be raised <e> <s> the tabloid press is quick to jump on the issue of the mismanagement of charities in what it sees as the exercise of the public interest as opposed to curiosity <e> <s> it could do considerable damage to a party to have his alleged activities in the running of a charity canvassed in the press without any contradictor being in court at the time <e> <s> for that reason i support the observations of the noble and learned lord lord morton of shuna on this point <e> <s> there should be no hearing on the matter until intimation has been made against two persons who are likely ultimately to be found liable for expenses for mismanagement or miscontrol <e>", "<cs> the amendment is grouped with amendment no <e> <s> which is an expanded version of the amendment of the noble earl lord selkirk <e> <s> it may be convenient for the committee to discuss both amendments at the same time <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may take up the point raised by the noble lord lord grimond <e> <s> the amendment is phrased as an alternative <e> <s> the management and control which would cover the trustees is already there <e> <s> the word or is there for a purpose <e> <s> it is to catch the second layer of management <e>", "<cs> will the noble and learned lord the lord advocate take the point on board by widening the definition <e> <s> he has given his interpretation of the restrictive nature of the amendments <e> <s> however it could easily read or from participation in any activities including acting in the capacity of agent <e> <s> that would be a wide-ranging net to catch anyone who was running a charity having been caught by clause <e> <s> it does not need to be restrictive <e>", "<cs> this particular clause a clause which has been rewritten has a rather ghostly air about it <e> <s> it starts off at the top of page of the marshalled list of amendments with the words <e>", "<cs> i accept that <e> <s> i am obliged to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for that explanation <e> <s> in the light of it i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall make two points <e> <s> the basis of the board appears in paragraph which states <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for the answers given to the various contributions to what has been an interesting debate <e> <s> i should say that not only does the scottish consumer council back this proposal but the cab is also anxious that there should be an independent body set up to oversee professional standards of education and training requirements <e>", "<cs> i support the noble and learned lord lord morton on the use of the words may and shall <e> <s> it seems to me that if the government are bent on introducing this new legal animal into the scottish conveyancing and confirmation services there should be a compulsion as regards the procedures contained in the amendment <e> <s> otherwise before it comes into operation the public will not know the standards to be applied in terms of the paragraphs <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down perhaps he will answer the question of the noble baroness lady carnegy about costs <e> <s> who will bear the cost of the interview <e> <s> will it be borne by the purchaser or the seller <e> <s> i am not clear <e>", "<cs> surely the offence <e>", "<cs> i support the noble and learned lord lord morton of shuna on this amendment <e> <s> surely the offence in subsection goes to the very heart of the relationship of trust between the client and the practitioner <e> <s> anyone who wilfully and falsely pretends to be a conveyancing practitioner and harms a client certainly i believe deserves a penalty more than a fine on the standard <e>", "<cs> this is a strange amendment if i may say so <e> <s> it tends to ignore the fact that conveyancing practitioners will be special creatures of statute <e> <s> written into clause are the regulations which shall apply <e> <s> the statute creates the conveyancing practitioners and lays down the guidelines for them <e>", "<cs> in the light of that undertaking i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i endorse what the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey said on this matter <e> <s> i seem to recall that on the committee stage of the courts and legal services bill protests were made as the time wore on because people were getting tired <e> <s> we have been going at a considerable pace and i agree that this is not the time to enter the realms of rights of audience as some noble lords may be feeling the pace more than others <e>", "<cs> in view of the direction in which matters have moved and the major area of consensus between the noble and learned lords the lord advocate and lord emslie i welcome what has happened <e> <s> we on this side of the committee accept as has been made clear all along that there is a high standard to be attained in the supreme court <e> <s> the law society and solicitors recognise that the practice in the supreme court requires different techniques and new knowledge and methods <e> <s> accordingly we welcome the governments acceptance of the amendment of the noble and learned lord lord emslie <e> <s> i shall reserve my position on other related matters until i see the final shape of clause when the bill returns on report <e>", "<cs> it may be of assistance to the committee if i say that i do not propose to move the amendments up to amendment no <e> <s> which stand in my name and that of my noble friend lord carmichael as those matters are now covered by the amendment which has been accepted by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e>", "<cs> in moving the amendment on behalf of the law society it was <e>", "<cs> i understand that the amendment is the result of fairly prolonged discussion between the law society and the department of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> the spirit behind the amendment is appreciated <e>", "<cs> in case the wrong impression is getting around i should add that it should not be thought that advocates do not have administrative troubles also when they are called upon at the last minute and have to cancel meetings with clients at great mutual inconvenience <e> <s> it should be borne in mind that the advocate solicitor is a creature of statute <e> <s> anyone who seeks that status will know precisely the difficulties in administering a practice and appearing in the high court <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord answers perhaps i may make a short point on the content of this amendment <e> <s> i suggest that it is too draconian in its terms at the moment <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord will reconsider it there should be some basis for the suspension rather than a complaint because a solicitor could be bedevilled with complaints suggesting that he was guilty of professional misconduct when he was nothing of the kind <e> <s> at the end of the day he could be suspended from practice and suffer considerable loss <e> <s> i should have thought that there should be some reasonable basis for accepting the complaint before suspension otherwise all sorts of damage could be done to perfectly honest individuals who are carrying out their practice <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down is he saying that clause is nothing more than a prompter or reminder <e> <s> is that not a new concept in legislation <e> <s> if that is all it is it is surplus to requirements and no doubt the responsible persons appointed to do these jobs will not require reminding <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down perhaps i may say that the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey has raised the spectre of what he calls i think five ex-bare-footed pleaders sitting in this house judging a scottish case <e> <s> it is a very interesting thought <e> <s> i do not think that the question has been answered <e> <s> i must say i had not thought about it until i heard the noble and learned lord raising the point if that is what he was raising <e>", "<cs> the side note to clause reads <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for that answer <e> <s> to reply to the observation of the noble lord lord renton i made the point that a person has to be educated before he can be trained <e> <s> if the amendment were to be taken on board that could be corrected <e>", "<cs> in answering amendment no <e> <s> moved by the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey i believe that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate made reference to subsequent amendments which have not been moved at the moment <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> in so doing i draw attention to the fact that in schedule paragraph in setting up the scottish conveyancing and confirmation practitioners board it is said that <e>", "<cs> in putting the amendment forward i was not suggesting that there was anything clandestine in the actions of the government <e> <s> i am happy with the answer that has been given by the noble and learned lord and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment moved by the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey <e> <s> this section of the act introduces a new feature into the legal system <e> <s> as time passes and problems develop it is almost inevitable that lay representatives will seek access to the courts <e> <s> that access should be carefully controlled <e> <s> it may be that the wording of this amendment is an unnecessary refinement because one always hopes that the

discussing this clause at an earlier stage in relation to the use of the words or other body in clause i suggested that we should tread carefully in relation to the speed with which such innovations

grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for his attitude towards this amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> as i understand the position of the noble and learned lord the lord advocate in relation to clause it is the following <e> <s> i hope the noble and learned lord will correct me if i am wrong <e> <s> although he has moved amendment no <e> <s> a which sets out the proposed new clause i believe he has agreed to reconsider various matters <e> <s> as i understood the position he will take into account the position of the lord president when he reconsiders all these matters <e> <s> it would be rather nonsensical at this stage of the proceedings to treat this amendment as the proposed final form of clause <e> <s> any further discussion of it would be a waste of <e>", "<cs> in the light of observations made by my noble friend lady phillips and before the claymores start swinging north of the border i wish to indicate that the contribution of the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey on the grammatical construction of the clause indicates that not only do we speak english north of the border but we understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords this was an extremely well thought out plan <e> <s> the noble earl said that the trouble spread quickly from the starting point o the remand section <e> <s> how many of the prisoners who have not surrendered

any rule of conduct he means any rules made under the legislation or is he referring by that to the already existing code of conduct for the faculty of advocates <e> <s> i gather from the answer that he gave to the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey that that particular rule will make life easier for the advocate rather than more difficult <e> <s> but like the noble and learned lord i should like time to think about this point <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just add something to the remarks of the noble and learned lord lord morton <e> <s> another object behind the deletion is to make the new section a correspond with clause in its application to advocates <e> <s> as the committee will note clause deals with the offer of professional services to the public and it contains no restriction

covered at an earlier stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this amendment has the advantage that it does not lay down an absolute rule <e> <s> the qualifying words in the first sentence <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but it may help if i say that i have <e>", "<cs> i should also like to express my support for this amendment <e> <s> by insisting upon the exclusion of the groups mentioned in paragraphs a to d the noble and learned lord the lord advocate is cutting out a considerable body of people who possess the very qualities which are required

i would find it surprising if the person appointed to this important post was someone who was incapable of assessing compensation in the kind of matters which would come before him <e> <s> i appreciate the argument advanced by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate on the distinction between the two countries <e> <s> no doubt in the short time that will be left to the government in office after the bill becomes law they will keep a close eye on developments <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in giving his answer the noble and learned lord if i heard him correctly seemed to concede that the period of five years i hope i quote him accurately was in real terms very low <e> <s> to my simple mind at least that suggests that the noble and learned lord accepts that five years is not a proper qualifying period <e> <s> apart from commenting that the period is in real terms very low he says that the five years are there as an incentive to those who are coming into the law to show that they can become senior high court judges but that they will not get an appointment after five years it will probably be years or years <e> <s> if that is the case why not accept or at least think again about this very low period <e>", "<cs> i am obliged for that piece of advice from the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i shall consider it for a later stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that answer <e> <s> we had agreement as to qualities for people being appointed as judges in the court of session and

drinking the question is one of equity <e> <s> the licensed trade feels that it is being badly done by <e> <s> the refusal even to consider an adjustment of the figure means that the reality of life

for as long as they like just as they could in a place of entertainment <e> <s> there is such a proliferation of places dealing in alcohol now that the licensed trade association for which i hold no brief has suggested the amendment for the governments consideration <e> <s> it feels badly done by at this exclusion from the general provision on the sabbath <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that answer <e> <s> it would appear that the greater includes the lesser as far as the authorities are concerned <e> <s> in the light of the answer i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i suggest with great respect that the clause that the government propose may arise out of the long debate we had on what has been referred to as jimmy hoods bill <e> <s> however i think it is right to remind the committee that that bill was the remnant of other legislation and it was under severe procedural attack <e> <s> no amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that answer <e> <s> one of the reasons for asking for this particular type of approach is that when a person is in a club he really is sometimes in an extension of his home and in fact some people might live life the other way round <e> <s> but in any event it is nice to know why the privacy of the club is being invaded so to speak by the police and clubs are not really akin to public houses which are open for entry anyway <e> <s> that

necessarily a club member or a member of the management of the club <e> <s> that means that the club management which would know nothing about the activities of a drunk in the club who should not be there but who obstructs entry by the police would be vicariously liable subject to the defence of due diligence <e> <s> the words any person may be rather wide and if vicarious liability is to be imposed on the management that should be limited <e> <s> for example in a factory accident vicarious liability applies only in relation to the actions of the employees of the factory <e>", "<cs> we on

to destroy it <e> <s> i say that in a rather flippant way <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has carefully and fairly set out the governments position in relation to this very important amendment <e> <s> i share the same reservations as previous speakers concerning the timing of the amendment <e> <s> although it is a general amendment there is a deep suspicion that it was tabled for the specific purpose of covering any impending war crimes trials <e> <s> the noble lord lord campbell spoke about the amendment having been in the war crimes bill <e> <s> i should have thought that it would be much more objectionable to put this provision into the war crimes bill and to make an exception of war crimes <e> <s> it makes more sense on a broad basis that if such changes are to be made in the law of scotland they should be made in the way that is being suggested <e> <s> in saying that i am not saying that i accept the government amendment <e> <s> like the noble and learned lord lord morton i am not happy about the phraseology and the protection which would be required for the operation of this type of evidence <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that explanation of a delicate area of public life dealing with young people and trying to provide them with accommodation at reasonable rents <e> <s> we all know that in the past there was excessive

practicability <e> <s> there would be no harm in the government thinking again and taking the wording proposed by the law society <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble and learned lord the lord advocate in reply give an indication as to whether any further thought has been given to the definition of professional <e> <s> in times past the professions were easily recognised as being the ministry medicine law and so on <e> <s> however all kinds of people and i say that in no disrespectful sense various categories of workmen call themselves professionals <e> <s> a plumber is quite entitled to call himself a professional plumber and he is indeed a professional when one is in trouble if ones house is flooded <e> <s> there are publicans in the licensed trade which is called a profession <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for that explanation and for the care and consideration he has given to what is an important aspect of the bill <e> <s> we shall await the terms put forward in another place but in the meantime in the light of the undertaking given i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have some reservations about the amendments <e> <s> taking this step takes away a right that is given to people under the clause <e> <s> to remove that right in the way that is being done might smack of elitism and some kind of secret court procedure <e> <s> i am not happy with the amendment as it stands <e> <s> i agree that the interpretation of clause b leads to a rather absurd situation <e> <s> but that is a matter for the government to take into account when considering the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for his consideration of the amendment <e> <s> i appreciate that it was tabled at a very late stage and understand that time will be required to consider the implications <e> <s> in the meantime no doubt his words will be noted in another quarter dealing with legal aid <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment states <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reasoned reply <e> <s> i am pleased to hear i am sure that it will be noted in the quarters affected by those activities that the eligibility review will be of assistance <e> <s> we look forward to hearing in due course the outcome of the inquiries <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the minister making a large presumption in assuming that people who go to off-sale premises buy their drinks and leave <e> <s> is not one of the troubles that off-sale premises attract people who do not go to public houses or hotels and whose very intention is to linger about in the vicinity of the off-sale premises <e> <s> does he agree that to make that requirement for off-sale premises would do no harm in the public interest <e> <s> it will not cause the applicant a great deal of inconvenience to submit a plan to the licensing board for consideration and approval to ensure that the premises will be suitable for the function lor which they are intended <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord carmichael and the noble lord lord campbell of croy have said most of what can be said in favour of this amendment <e> <s> however i should like to add a few comments <e> <s> we are not discussing the principle of whether pubs should be open on sunday or indeed whether off-licences or places of entertainment serving alcohol should be open on sunday <e> <s> whatever may be ones view that is past praying for <e> <s> i know that many people prayed that it would not happen but it has happened <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the minister for his extensive and courteous reply to my amendment <e> <s> there may be some misapprehension about what is required <e> <s> my understanding is i may have it wrong but we all make mistakes that if a justice of the peace is satisfied by evidence on oath it does not mean that the police officer has to have a piece of evidence in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if the minister has misunderstood me <e> <s> i was not suggesting that the measure was put forward solely on the representations from the police but there is certainly a heavy overlay of police representation among the many representations made <e> <s> the noble lord has not answered my questions <e> <s> why is this measure necessary for scotland <e> <s> where is the abuse taking place <e> <s> what sort of clubs are abusing the privilege of having a certificate <e> <s> the minister has not put forward one solid shred of evidence to justify this imposition on the civil liberties of individuals which is the other issue involved <e>", "<cs> my lords the absence of right of entry without a warrant does not with respect make the law unenforceable <e> <s> the necessity to obtain a warrant was built into law for the protection of the citizen <e> <s> the citizen behind the <e>", "<cs> my lords on this side of the house we welcome the provision which is another weapon in the armoury to stop the sale of drink to those under <e> <s> this issue concerns all noble lords <e> <s> we shall have to see how it works in the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an interesting new clause <e> <s> it deals with the maximum number of persons to be allowed on licensed premises and is designed to ensure their safety on such premises <e> <s> we are now very safety conscious following the disasters that have stricken the country over the past few years <e> <s> in various areas drink has been involved <e> <s> the taylor report has now been implemented to minimise numbers so that there is safety in the crowds gathering at football matches <e> <s> if one goes to a football match one can see that the ground is never full <e> <s> there is usually room for people to move around <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say briefly that this appears to be a very useful step towards keeping fine defaulters out of prison <e> <s> this is one of the great problems we have as the prison population in scotland is very heavy <e> <s> we hope that what is proposed will meet with practical success in the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee i said that i had received no representations from any church body <e> <s> since then i have received a letter which is an advance from the christian action research and education organisation <e> <s> the letter is basically in favour of the proposals but it puts rather neatly the problem faced by all of us who are interested in that area of life <e> <s> in the letter the following sentence appears <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the principle and the detail of the amendment and endorse the view expressed by the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey <e> <s> the problem of obtaining agreement and the essential facts in the case before the trial starts has been with us in scotland for many years <e> <s> one of the problems is that the accused person is the arbiter of those matters and if he says that he intends to agree nothing then nothing is agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply which clarifies the reason behind the amendment <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i am grateful to the minister for his answer in response to the amendment <e> <s> since the explanation was the same my response will be the same <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that reply as i was in relation to the previous amendments <e> <s> i am sure the noble lords words will be noted by those affected by this legislation <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the lord advocate for that explanation <e> <s> although i do not have the act with me at the moment i recollect that there is not in fact a monopoly for the preparation of moveable writs in the solicitors scotland act because an unqualified person provided he does not ask for a fee could prepare some of these writs <e> <s> therefore there is an open door <e> <s> in reading the act i found that surprising <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not oppose these amendments <e> <s> at this stage i shall simply express my concern that the question of imprisonment has been removed altogether <e> <s> there are ways of levelling playing fields <e> <s> as i have a level playing field it would be unfair to ask the government to leave imprisonment in force for solicitors <e> <s> personation or impersonation whatever the correct word is of practitioners is a very serious offence <e> <s> i find it extraordinary that it shall be dealt with by way of a fine when the acts of a person can have grievous effects on a persons estate <e> <s> a person may be left penniless whereas the perpetrator of an evil deed in respect of another persons money gets away with a fine of up to <e> <s> i express my concern at this stage but i do not oppose the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords those of us who have been involved in the consideration of this extensive and as the noble and learned lord the lord advocate said exhausing piece of legislation are probably glad to have reached this stage in the bill which covers many aspects of legal and social reform for scotland <e> <s> as was anticipated at the outset and as the noble and learned lord indicated being a miscellaneous provisions bill its long title became longer by the day <e> <s> for that reason alone we are glad to have reached this stage <e> <s> the title must be one of the longest currently on the statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an important debate relating to the present condition of british industry and to its future structure and supervision <e> <s> i thank my noble friend lord williams for bringing the issue to the attention of the house <e> <s> i echo his concern about the lack of interest shown on the government benches in this important matter <e> <s> i am afraid that the efforts of the noble lord lord lyell who is now signalling to me from a far distance are not sufficient justification for that particular lack of interest <e>", "<cs> my lords before we move to the consideration of the commons amendments perhaps i may lodge a final protest about the form of this very important bill in relation to the affairs of scotland <e> <s> it does not relate only to legal affairs <e> <s> at the outset of consideration of the law reform miscellaneous provisions scotland bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my welcome to this new provision <e> <s> i agree with what has been said by the noble and learned lords lord cameron lord morton and lord mccluskey <e> <s> it is a large clause with great implications <e> <s> however it is an imaginative step which could lead to the uncovering of much money in the bank vaults of scotland which is presently being lost to charities <e> <s> within a short time now that could be rechannelled and put to positive use in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add a brief welcome for this deletion <e> <s> the government are wise in recognising not only the matters raised by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate but the various difficulties in interpretation contained within the clause as it existed <e> <s> it is clearly an issue which may need to be faced at some future time but this was not the way to resolve it <e> <s> i am glad that the government recognised that <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a peculiarly worded amendment the purpose of which is perfectly clear as the noble and learned lord the lord advocate explained <e> <s> we all agree that cult-like bodies a phrase used at an earlier stage in the consideration of the bill should not benefit along with what may be called legitimate religious bodies <e> <s> perhaps the lord advocate could identify not necessarily by name but by number and constitution each cult-like body which exists in scotland at the moment and which would not benefit from the clause <e> <s> it is always difficult to draw a dividing line between a legitimate body and a cult-like body <e> <s> a cult-like body does not necessarily become irreligious because it is a cult <e> <s> it may therefore be a circular argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make some observations on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it appears to be a rather dangerous amendment and to make intrusions into the present law of scotland as i understand it <e> <s> the object of clause of the bill is clear as to the supervision of charities <e> <s> subsection of that clause reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome these amendments which are very much in the public interest <e> <s> they clarify the disciplinary situation between the two sets of operators <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is also linked with amendment no <e> <s> a which stands in my name <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has correctly stated the amendment standing in my name seeks to except the tribunal from the requirement to publicise decisions in cases where solicitors are found to be innocent <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene on a point of information <e> <s> is there not a distinction between the two suspensions <e> <s> the member of a body subscribes to the rules of that body or association and to the rules of conduct <e> <s> he therefore knows that if he contravenes the rules of the body it may or may not suspend him <e> <s> there is a difference between that and the lord presidents intervention <e> <s> the lord president will presumably have a matter brought to his attention or he will have witnessed a matter which is so serious in his view at the time that he recommends suspension of the person from that body until that body has determined within its rules of conduct which have already been approved in terms of the bill whether that complaint is justified <e> <s> i am not trying to uphold one or other approach <e> <s> i raise the matter as a point of information <e>", "<cs> my lords i support what has been said about the omission of the high court of justiciary sitting as a court of first instance <e> <s> is it an error which has made deliberately to see if we can spot it <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a fairly simple order bringing in minor boundary changes <e>", "<cs> my lords without discussing the principle of drinking in public houses on sunday i am grateful that the government have taken notice of the arguments that were presented in your lordships house some time ago <e> <s> it is a sensible amendment <e> <s> i am gratified to know that the licensing board has the power to refuse to grant the extension of permitted hours if it finds that such an extension would cause undue disturbance or public nuisance in the locality <e> <s> that is a provision that we all sought <e> <s> we must recognise that not everyone and perhaps a minority at the moment is in favour of sunday drinking <e> <s> it can cause great disruption perhaps more in rural areas than in the city which can absorb noise and disturbance more easily <e> <s> there is a broad enough test built into the amendment in the hope that the licensing boards will exercise the discretion sensibly in the best interests of the communities which they represent <e> <s> i welcome this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is recognised that the government are trying to streamline this particularly difficult area of licensing law where temporary transfers take place <e> <s> the one criticism which i make is that the proposals do not deal efrectively with the time when a person has entered into a commitment to take over licensed premises <e> <s> it appears and representations have been made that the timescale as regards the new amendment is rather too long particularly in scotland where there are not many tenancies <e> <s> people tend to buy the premises <e> <s> that means that large sums of money can be at stake on one side or the other for long periods of time <e> <s> nowadays large sums of money are paid for licensed premises and the interest rate is currently high <e> <s> that can cause great difficulty to both parties involved <e> <s> perhaps the government would consider conducting a further investigation to see whether there is an even quicker way of dealing with the temporary transfer of licences <e>", "<cs> my lords for the record perhaps i may say that reservations were expressed also in this house on two occasions <e> <s> the matter was stoutly defended by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate on the basis that the power of entry sought was the same as the power of entry to a public house <e> <s> the matter went to the other place and we welcome the omission of this provision <e> <s> it appears that people power in the other place was sufficient to make the government forget about that matter for a while <e>", "<cs> my lords we are dealing with an important innovation into the law of scotland and it is recognised as such on this side of the house <e> <s> we realise that we must move with the times and take advantage of modern means first of obtaining evidence and secondly of recording it <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise also simply to express my support for the motion of the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords on this side of the house we have made it clear on more than one occasion that any reasonable steps to keep young people in particular out of prison are welcome <e> <s> for that reason we welcome the new clause and the supplementary clause relating to standard of proof <e> <s> i know that there is an amendment against that proposal but it would be an evidential nonsense to require two people to certify that a person has breached an order because in any event only one person might know about it <e> <s> as i understand the matte - the evidence concerning a breach is to be given on oath by a supervising officer <e> <s> in that respect the situation is no different from a police constable obtaining a warrant from the sheriff on showing reasonable cause <e> <s> the proposal is welcome and it will be interesting to see how it works out <e> <s> i understand that he lord advocate will consider whether there should be no financial consequences to local authorities over the implementation of the provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to say a few words about the amendment which removes the divorce provisions which were contained in this bill when it left your lordships house <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate valiantly defended the proposals before your lordships house which went into the bill <e> <s> he appeared to be quite confident that they would stay in the bill <e> <s> can the noble and learned lord tell your lordships whether the proposals have disappeared because the government succumbed to the time pressure in another place or is it the case it is an understandable case that the issue of divorce law has been at least temporarily affected by the views expressed by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> is it the case that consideration is being given to adopting a unified united kingdom divorce law <e> <s> there is a lot to be said for that in view of the size of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment is welcomed on this side of the house <e> <s> indeed i think it emerges from opposition proposals in another place <e> <s> it is well known that in paternity cases in the sheriff court and even the court of session a great deal of distress and acrimony is brought about when the proceedings are prolonged because of the inability of the legal process to present positive evidence which might point one way or the other as to the paternity of the child <e> <s> this is one way in which that difficulty can be overcome <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships house is grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for his explanation of the order <e> <s> from this side of the house there is no objection in principle to what is regarded as being a useful piece of legislation governing many aspects of enforcement of rights between contracting states as the noble and learned lord outlined <e> <s> the new civil jurisdiction and judgments bill soon to go through your lordships house will incorporate most of the order in the schedules <e>"]
