<e> <s> first however i too should like to say how enjoyable it is to serve on sub-committee f under the vigorous chairmanship of the noble lord lord sherfield and to thank him for initiating this debate on our report <e> <s> the report itself and several noble lords have stressed that in matters of energy policy the community has too close a time horizon <e> <s> its vision extends no further than only years away <e> <s> to be sure there are very serious short-term problems as the noble lord lord tanlaw has said but we must not be entirely mesmerised by that <e> <s> allowing for all the

takes years to open up a new colliery <e> <s> it would prob <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that one of the most difficult problems facing the universities in the present financial framework in which cash limits are imposed is the uncertainty arising from salary claims and the effective value of their block grants <e> <s> if so would she further agree that an early settlement of academic salaries would benefit not only the university teachers themselves among whom i should declare myself to be one but <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords <e> <s> an answer would very greatly help the universities to make the most effective use of the limited resources now placed at their disposal <e>", "<cs> my lords i am no forester <e> <s> although over the last few years i have had planted a goodly number of new trees at imperial college our campus remains more of a glass and concrete jungle than a bosky extension of hyde park <e> <s> but if i do not follow the noble lord lord dulverton

opportunity to do so as i am indeed for his splendid chairmanship of your sub-committee is a few words about the nature and organisation of research funded from the public purse especially as it relates to forestry <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to apologise to the house and particularly to the noble baroness who opened the debate for having been unavoidably absent during her speech and most of the ministers speech <e> <s> i should like also to welcome an old friend the noble lord lord swann and to congratulate him warmly on his delightful maiden speech <e> <s> in order to avoid repeating what has already been said at this late hour i propose to confine myself to the subject of engineering education in the universities and the additional difficulties which we now face in that respect as a result of government policy <e> <s> i do not intend to indulge in special pleading <e> <s> i accept that in the present economic recession the universities must bear their fair share of the misery but surely the education and training of scientists and engineers who eventually will take their place in industry and commerce is an essential part of the recovery that we all hope for <e>

great pleasure and i am delighted to be the first to congratulate her on her elegant stimulating and authoritative maiden speech <e> <s> the experience that she brings to us as chairman of the essex county council education committee will i am sure be extremely valuable to us <e> <s> i am sure too that i speak for the whole house when i say how much we look forward to hearing her again and

member through a minefield or vested interests to a handful of proposals for reform with which we could all readily agree <e> <s> his secret he has often confided to me is that he never tries to achieve too much at one go <e> <s> this time at least i think that he has been too modest for he has achieved a great deal <e>", "<cs> my lords there was a time when sir hermann bondi used to say with considerable <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to continue the debate on coal and the environment i must first express my profound gratitude to the noble lord lord kearton for arranging this debate and

associate the liberal party with what i have <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl would forgive me that is exactly the point i made in my speech and it is also the point that is made in the report itself <e>", "<cs> my lords anyone who has visited the prototype fast reactor at dounreay will regard that reactor as an outstanding example of modern technology <e> <s> until february of last year i was like the noble lord lord kearton a part-time member of the atomic energy authority and i should like to say that the staff of dounreay never fail to impress by their competence and dedication <e>

congratulate the noble baroness lady nicol for her gracious and thoughtful maiden speech <e> <s> it is always a privilege to follow a maiden speech and on behalf of all quarters of the house i should also like to congratulate the noble lord lord hemingford who has interested us greatly who like the noble baroness has struck just the right note and who has brought a particular and important expertise to bear on our debate an expertise of which i hope we shall often have the advantage in the future <e> <s> the freedom of the press is after all a vital aspect of working democracy <e>", "<cs> my lords those of your lordships who like myself had the honour to serve on your sub-committee under the chairmanship of the noble lord lord kings norton can say quite sincerely how much they enjoyed the experience and how grateful they are to him for introducing the debate today in such a comprehensive fashion and for explaining the jargon we found it necessary to use <e> <s> i am very happy also to follow the noble lord lord strabolgi with whose speech i was in very substantial agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords as former chairman of the commission on energy and the environment i am particularly grateful to the noble lord lord nathan for putting his question <e> <s> i also greatly appreciate the kind words that have been uttered tonight about the work of the commission and in the

boston because the measure is an unfortunate necessity and therefore we on this bench also support it <e> <s> i wish i could simply stop there your lordships would be pleased for once by my brevity <e> <s> there remain however some cautionary remarks with which i feel i must detain the house and a question to ask the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble baroness lady robson of kiddington will forgive me if i do not follow her speech except to say how important was the point that she raised about acid rain but at the same time to add how misleading it is to try to discuss it unless one also refers to the enormous cost of replacing the high-stack policy to which she referred with a policy which removes the sulphur pollutants at source <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down would he agree with me that the unified inspectorate proposed in the fifth report was modelled very closely on the working practices of the alkali inspectorate which centralised or otherwise in principle has as its most important officers the individual alkali inspectors in the field who operate with a very considerable amount of authority and therefore in a rather decentralised way <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble earl lord bess borough for the way he has drawn public attention to important developments in technology <e> <s> i am delighted to follow him today and not only because i agree with what he said <e> <s> there could be few more important matters for us to debate now than the alvey report and its implementation <e> <s> information technology

have done so from the earliest days of computing from babbage onwards and we are doing so today <e> <s> the efforts of the right honourable gentleman mr kenneth baker and his colleagues ably led by mr brian oakley in the department of trade and industry are greatly to be welcomed <e> <s> it is one of the few really bright spots in an otherwise dismal economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to

<s> i apologise to the noble lord most sincerely <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in the least irritated <e> <s> i would propose that we now return to our debate <e> <s> in doing so i should like to say that we on these benches are extremely grateful to the noble lord lord annan for proposing this debate and for setting the stage so comprehensively <e> <s> we also look forward to the maiden speech of the noble lord lord wilson of rievaulx and i hope he will not feel too constrained by the customs of this house because it is obviously going to be one of those occasions when there will be no holds barred <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount the leader of the house <e> <s> i too was privileged to be a member of the sub-committee that produced the report on remote sensing and digital mapping under the chairmanship of the noble lord lord shackleton <e> <s> i learned a lot from the experience and i am grateful to the noble lord for the opportunity to talk about our work today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord and i do not entirely disagree with what he has said <e> <s> i feel that i myself am in part to blame for not having put sufficient emphasis on it <e>", "<cs> i should like to accept a little bit of blame for not having brought sufficient attention to this project in our committee because it had its beginning when i was chairman of what was known as the science research council <e> <s> had we given more attention to the janet project i do not think it would have altered our recommendation that the remote sensing network should be managed at farnborough what else is a national remote sensing centre for <e> <s> but we should certainly have wished to draw attention to the highly relevant experience of janet and for myself i should have wished to recommend that those concerned should be fully consulted in setting up the newly-dedicated network <e> <s> it is not immediately obvious to me now that some of the facilities of janet could not be used jointly especially if increased computer power could be included somewhere in the network <e> <s> perhaps the minister when he replies would care to comment on this point for i am sure that he will have been adequately briefed on it by serc <e>", "<cs> my lords everyone who has ever been a member of the royal commission on environmental pollution there are about of us by now owes a tremendous personal debt to the noble lord lord ashby <e> <s> the noble lord lord nathan has said that it was my noble friend who provided the initial leadership and who charted a course that

of the university of london he asked me to help him a bit with the medical schools <e> <s> shortly after i finished my work he had the good sense to retire <e> <s> rumour has it that he presented the university with two ceremonial urns one to bear his ashes and the other a notice which reads no flowers by request <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a serving vice-chancellor at the present time <e> <s> in spite of what the noble lord lord mcintosh has said it is upon the likes of me that the duty proposed in amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches thank the noble lord lord sherfield for initiating this debate and for so effectively leading the inquiry that gave rise to it of which i was so honoured to be a member <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord sherfield for initiating this very timely debate <e> <s> your lordships select committee asked that science and technology should be given a higher profile both pure and applied and both civil and defence <e> <s> we also asked for the personal commitment of the prime minister <e> <s> in the new advisory council on science and technology we have been given essentially what we asked for and are delighted that the prime minister herself is to take such a close interest in its work <e> <s> that has been confirmed today by the noble viscount lord whitelaw and it is most encouraging <e> <s> from these benches i should like to wish sir francis tombs well in his new responsibilities in the chair of acost <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make four limited points <e> <s> first i believe that i speak for all currently active vice-chancellors in welcoming the principle of a national core curriculum <e> <s> i do so essentially for the reasons given by the minister in her opening speech and providing that it is flexible enough which now appears to me to be more likely to allow ample room for the expression of special interests and talents of both pupils and teachers <e> <s> a coherent national curriculum is an essential concept towards broadening the academic basis of school education and of entrance to higher education for those so inclined <e> <s> i also support regular pupil assessment provided that its main purpose is contrary to the noble lord lord annan to diagnose difficulties encountered by the pupils <e> <s> i do not believe that raw assessment data can or should be used to rate the performance of schools without reference to many other relevant factors <e> <s> i hope that that will not remain the intention behind clause <e>", "<cs> my lords as vice-chancellor of the university of london which has over full-time students i am naturally concerned at the impact on students welfare and therefore on their ability to study of various government measures including the recent changes in housing benefits <e> <s> however the proposed so-called poll tax causes me the greatest concern partly because of the inequity that is likely to result and partly because of the complexity of the administrative arrangements that are now in prospect <e>", "<cs> at the risk of rubbing it in a bit i support what the noble lords who put their names to the amendment have said <e> <s> it is a question of the level at which a contract is drawn up that is to say the extent to which it is aggregated or disaggregated <e> <s> after all the contract could be a block grant to a whole institution to produce so many students at such and such an average price each for a given subject at a given level <e> <s> that is very much like the present ugc block grant system <e> <s> the ugc gives us block grant <e> <s> it says that we can do what we like with it with rather broad conditions imposed but those broad conditions include an indication of the number of students that we are expected to produce in major subject areas <e> <s> alternatively it could be this is perhaps rather extreme a collection of contracts to educate individual students or for individual courses or individual research projects or some combination of all those which would of course bind us hand and foot <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble and learned lord is aware of the extent to which the bureaucratic detail demanded of universities over the past let us say five years has grown exponentially <e> <s> we are therefore very much afeared that whatever the secretary of state may intend and i am sure he intends what the noble and learned lord has said will simply be dismissed by the bureaucrats who are demanding more and more detail of us every month <e> <s> i am also afraid that under a contract system we shall be totally overwhelmed by detail and shall be totally controlled by it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for the assurance that schedule does not apply to universities and therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies i confirm that i heard him give an assurance <e> <s> he mentioned the word violence and i accept that it would be covered <e> <s> however i mentioned other things where the person concerned may not be afeared for himself but for his family at home <e> <s> it may not be a question of violence but of interferences of various and lesser kinds which are nonetheless quite obnoxious <e> <s> i should like to hear from the minister about the concerns i have expressed and not just about violence which has been covered <e>", "<cs> the minister has given a full assurance which i am inclined to accept <e> <s> however i have some sympathy with the view of the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> i very much hope that it does not come to pass that one has to be dead before one can plead that ones life is in danger <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh has a point <e> <s> nevertheless it is clear that the ministers intentions are as i would wish them to be <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> of course i must support the noble baroness lady seear in what she says <e> <s> i must confess i am amazed at the lack of contact which noble lords seem to have with student life these days perhaps it is a long time ago that they were in contact <e> <s> i may also be somewhat tainted by my experience with london where as the noble baroness says students tend to move around rather a lot unlike some of the country villages where some of our universities reside <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my good fortune to follow the noble lord lord johnston of rockport <e> <s> therefore in accordance with our ancient traditions <e> <s> i congratulate him on behalf of your lordships on his most interesting stimulating and moving maiden speech which if i may say so was a model of its kind <e> <s> the noble lord brings to the house a wide knowledge of business and politics both at home and abroad <e> <s> we shall hope to hear from him many times <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the report of the royal society showed that in terms of numbers only perhaps the problem of scientists leaving this country had been a little exaggerated but that when one takes quality into account it is an entirely different story <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall comment very briefly on what the noble lord lord trafford said <e> <s> i cannot see that the phrase full-time and part-time education and research sets anything very much in concrete <e> <s> after all it is not making a choice between two things <e> <s> it merely makes the provisions which the funding council has to provide all-inclusive <e> <s> that is not setting anything in concrete i respectfully suggest <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment refers to persons not to students <e> <s> i spoke about students but the amendment relates to overseas persons <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for unwittingly attempting to mislead the house <e> <s> the minister has put us right on that point <e> <s> it is clear that the governments intentions which have been even more clearly spelt out this time than in committee are entirely at one with what i and my noble colleagues have been suggesting <e> <s> everything will of course depend on the regulations and the instructions given to registration officers <e> <s> i for one shall watch with great care what goes on in that respect <e> <s> however with the assurances that have been given i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord peston had not spoken first i should have said exactly what he said <e> <s> i support the amendment <e> <s> i would only add one further point namely that the university grants committee itself is very sensibly trying to arrange regional groupings of universities for obvious purposes <e> <s> it is a very trivial extension of that to accede to the request in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add a few words of support for the amendment <e> <s> it may appear strange to your lordships that all noble lords who have spoken so far are from the university of london <e> <s> it is not really so strange because at london we have carried out more restructuring than anywhere else has <e>", "<cs> my lords it may not seem entirely inappropriate if an active living vice-chancellor says a few words before the house moves on <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome the timely initiative of the noble lord lord hunter of newington <e> <s> i also welcome the governments commitment to the national health service as clearly expressed today by the noble lord lord belstead the leader of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great privilege to follow the right reverend prelate the bishop of bradford and therefore to congratulate him on his maiden speech which i do according to custom on behalf of the house as a whole <e> <s> i am sure that i can say that we were moved and charmed by what we heard <e> <s> the right reverend prelate lists many special interests in <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak with considerable diffidence wishing to pretend to be expert neither in medical science nor ethics nor in house of commons procedure i am a simple physicist and there is little left for an ignoramus to say <e> <s> however i should like to state my position <e> <s> i consider it extremely dangerous even sinister to attempt to prohibit research in any subject whatever provided that it is carried out in an acceptable manner if necessary under licence <e> <s> nowadays there are many cases of prior approval being required from an independent body in order to protect the researcher third persons the environment or later generations <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house and especially to the minister for the fact that a long-standing speaking engagement later this evening means that i must leave the debate before it has ended <e> <s> i hope that i shall be forgiven <e> <s> on behalf of the select committee i also wish to thank the noble and gallant lord lord carver for leading our study of the greenhouse effect <e> <s> he did so with characteristic persistence and charm <e>", "<cs> i wish to support this group of amendments and i shall briefly say why <e> <s> there has been almost no opportunity for the universities and i speak as a vice-chancellor to discuss the details of the governments proposed loans scheme <e> <s> that discussion depends quite a lot upon the details <e> <s> the government did not release <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord addington and thank him for drawing our attention to the problem of the extra regional costs which are most pronounced in london <e> <s> as a vice-chancellor in london i speak with some feeling on the matter <e> <s> i know how difficult it is for many of our students to cope with the situation <e> <s> the noble lord put the essential case and the facts and figures extremely well and clearly <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may be excused for interrupting for just one moment <e> <s> will the minister accept that many of the difficulties that some of us have with the bill arise from the almost simultaneous withdrawal of social security benefits <e> <s> if students could once again become eligible for such benefits the problems that we are debating at the moment would go away <e>", "<cs> i intended to raise exactly the same point <e>", "<cs> will the minister also bear in mind one further point before he replies <e> <s> he said that a year is not so much to think of paying and maybe it is not for many people <e> <s> but what many of us assume is that it is the governments intention that the loan element will as the years go by form a much greater proportion of the total maintenance support of the student so the figure might rise from to or something of that sort <e> <s> when levels of that kind are reached there is a case for graduated repayments according to ones ability to pay which does not apply with such force to a mere <e> <s> we are not talking about the exact sums but about the principle in the expectation that the amount will get more important later on <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene to say that there is no ill feeling between the heads of universities and the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> this is a question of what one means by consultation <e> <s> by consultation i mean sitting round a table arguing it out talking about the ifs and buts and the details and discussing what would or would not work <e> <s> it is not a question of somebody throwing out an idea to this house or in a letter to a minister and civil servants and the des considering the matter and advising the minister that the idea will not work <e> <s> that is not consultation <e>", "<cs> may we take it that nobody shall have his name used as a referee without his permission <e> <s> quite often i am asked to give references <e> <s> usually the person who wishes me to do so approaches me first and asks whether i would mind if he gave my name <e> <s> i say yes or no according to my whim <e> <s> but some give my name without consulting me they get a very bad reference <e> <s> i hope that it would be understood that when the names of referees are given on a form the referees signature will also be on the form to indicate his consent <e>", "<cs> that is very easy <e> <s> on the form on which the student gives the names of his referees the proposed referees also have to sign to indicate their agreement <e>", "<cs> this is another case where proper consultation around a table would have shown up the problem at an early stage <e>", "<cs> i wish to support this group of amendments because i believe that the governments proposal can be improved upon <e> <s> to make my position clear together with that of my university senate i should much prefer that there was no scheme at all <e> <s> however if there is to be one i should prefer some more equitable variant of what is proposed <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord beloff is no longer present in the chamber perhaps i may say a word on behalf of the universities <e> <s> i consider such monitoring to be most important <e> <s> i say that because our main concern all along with the scheme has been that it will frustrate the governments other excellent intentions to broaden access to higher education <e> <s> i very much fear that such a scheme will not have that effect <e> <s> in any event it must be monitored to see whether it produces the desired effect <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perhaps not unreasonable for a noble lord to speak from the cross-benches <e> <s> i played a fairly active part in the committee stage of the bill and i spent part of the weekend in telephonic communication with other members of the house considering some of the government amendments before us today <e> <s> this amendment was not mentioned <e> <s> i had not seen the significance of it and i presume that those to whom i was speaking also had not done so <e> <s> therefore even though i have done my best to follow what is happening over the weekend i am totally unprepared on this matter <e> <s> having heard what has been said about it it seems to me to be something which deserves a fair amount of thought <e>", "<cs> my lords i also have a question about the company <e> <s> it has been set up in order to give loans to students at a zero real rate of interest <e> <s> that is all well and good <e> <s> it is set up under the companies act to do that <e> <s> the only shareholders are the government so the shareholders can insist upon that <e> <s> but if as the noble baroness suggested it is privatised at some time in the future and if the government agreed on that course because they wanted to for some reason i presume that the company would be free to do what it liked about the rate of interest and could charge real interest at real rates <e> <s> would that not run somewhat counter to the whole idea of the student loans scheme <e> <s> it seems to me that in the event of privatisation the whole concept of student loans as introduced into this house with all the assurances we have received from the minister could be totally frustrated <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the company be governed by the companies act and not by this legislation if it were privatised <e>", "<cs> my lords i supported the noble lord lord addington at the committee stage <e> <s> i still do so today at least to the extent that if a provision such as that in amendment no <e> <s> does not go into the bill there must be some allowance for regional costs <e> <s> i therefore wholeheartedly support the noble lord lord addington <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl finally sits down perhaps i may ask him to clarify a point that he made which i did not understand <e> <s> he said that the top-up scheme is only an addition to what the student already receives and that therefore the cost of administration will not be very great <e> <s> the cost of administration is exactly the same whether the students receive or <e> <s> surely the amount of administration involved is the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the noble lord lord beloff <e> <s> he has stated the general case very thoroughly and i do not want to repeat it <e> <s> however i should like to highlight what is involved <e> <s> on report the minister said something about the process that is required but since then we have had the des press release of nd march which amplifies that process <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl accept the phase audited costs which means that they are real <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt again <e> <s> however the minister is saying that at the meeting we shall form the estimated costs <e> <s> i think that the house would be satisfied if the minister undertook that the audited costs after the event would be met <e> <s> of course we must estimate the costs at this meeting which he has promised us and i am glad that he has done so but the real costs are the audited costs after the event <e> <s> we need an assurance about them <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this group of amendments so ably proposed by the noble baroness lady young <e> <s> members of the committee have made many of the points that i would have wished to put <e> <s> however i want to speak for the university of london and its peculiar position with regard to the national health service <e> <s> i thank the noble lord lord jenkin of roding for his kind remarks about our herculean efforts to put our medical affairs in some semblance of order <e>"]
