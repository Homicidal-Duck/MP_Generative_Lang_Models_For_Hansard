["<cs> my lords i ask your lordships indulgence for a maiden speech in which i should first like to thank all those who since my introduction to the house have been so helpful and welcoming to a novice <e> <s> my reason for contributing to this debate is that for more than years i have been the vice-chancellor of the university of warwick a new university with experience of technology transfer especially but not exclusively in the manufacturing industry which lies in a belt from telford through the west midlands to rugby <e>", "<cs> my lords i have had two recent opportunities of seeing one sector of higher education namely the universities from particular viewpoints <e> <s> first as a member of the jarratt committee for efficiency studies in universities and then as deputy chairman of the committee on the review of the university grants committee under the chairmanship of lord croham <e> <s> that committee is in the middle of taking evidence <e> <s> i thought it might be helpful if i were to look this afternoon at the problems of higher education and particularly universities from the point of view of the jarratt committee <e> <s> in doing so i should like to stress throughout that i think our concern here should be with higher education as a whole and by no means exclusively with the condition of universities <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not a member of this committee and i should therefore like to thank <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to confine myself to one aspect of my noble friend baroness coxs motion the infringement of freedom <e>", "<cs> i shall be brief in making a point that may be of some importance in view of the way in which the argument has been developed this afternoon <e> <s> we are agreed on the need for a general statutory prohibition <e> <s> the difference between us is on the nature of the tests to be applied <e> <s> whatever form of words is used to make the statutory prohibition there will be difficult cases at the edge where decisions have to be made <e> <s> it would seem to me reasonable to use tests which have been applied successfully over a long period of years <e> <s> both those tests ultimately depend upon the test of reasonableness <e>", "<cs> i have problems with this clause which i suspect cannot be cured by amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that its operation would not further the principle upon which i think we are all agreed namely to create in the schools a partnership between essentially three parties the parents the leas and the headmaster and his staff <e> <s> a subsidiary purpose would be to create a governing body which was no longer dominated by the local authority <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment and speak briefly to two points <e> <s> following what the noble lord lord stewart has said i think we are on the edge of something which is potentially important and using his word revolutionary <e> <s> i prefer to think of this side of the chamber as being the truly radical side and that in the bill we should have this important role for the secretary of state for education which i am sure is very important <e> <s> indeed in my view with the ability to have guidelines from the secretary of state not merely in schools but for the benefit of universities polytechnics and colleges of higher and further education we could be on the edge of a development which is potentially very important <e>", "<cs> i shall not take up much of the time of the committee at this late hour but i feel i must intervene in particular on behalf of the institutions that have been subjected to criticism this evening <e> <s> i must try to assure the committee that the universities are deeply committed to the principle of freedom of speech <e> <s> their function could not be carried on without it <e> <s> it is the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to the noble baroness lady seear for giving us this opportunity of debating education this afternoon <e> <s> her timing is clearly impeccable because i am sure that she recognises that education is moving firmly to the centre of the political stage <e> <s> i should like also to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord kirkwood upon his excellent maiden speech and to pay him the compliment of taking his first theme as i understood it why it is that our education system does not provide those whom industry needs those whom industry requires <e> <s> i only hope that i can deal <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i can perhaps try to help on the drafting point <e> <s> if you look at the words in the bill the present wording is very restrictive because the transfer to the company is <e>", "<cs> may i try to give an example from birmingham which i hope might be helpful <e> <s> my noble friend the minister said a few moments ago that the intention of the bill was to set up companies with every prospect of commercial viability <e> <s> i very much agree with him in that objective <e> <s> but it would not be to the advantage of the airport companies the local authorities or ourselves if that were done at the expense of the ratepayers <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl is it not because of the existence of all these difficult questions that we entrust the division of funds to the university grants committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for that full reply but although the scheme to which she refers has provided additional places in special subjects like information technology and computing it has recruited mostly from orthodox engineering courses and indeed from the polytechnics <e> <s> may i ask whether the government have any plan to tackle the problem of increasing the total number of engineers by tackling the problems in the schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support my noble friend lord beloff <e> <s> the difficulty about this clause is that it divides freedom of speech into two <e> <s> there will be one definition of freedom of speech which will operate on the campuses of this country and another freedom of speech which will operate elsewhere <e> <s> i can elaborate the consequences of this which in my view would be disastrous <e> <s> i would therefore wish to see this matter of freedom of speech not immured in a bill which is concerned with education governing bodies curricula and the like <e> <s> later this month we shall have a public order bill and that is where clauses about the freedom of speech should be placed <e>", "<cs> i hope that we shall accept the clause because i regard it as extremely important in the armoury of the police against hooliganism <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that as a result of mr priestleys inquiry into the royal shakespeare company he found that the company was palpably under-funded and that in consequence the government made funds available so that the grant for that year could be increased by no less than per cent <e>", "<cs> i shall be very brief <e> <s> it seems to me that we are at the moment on very dangerous ground <e> <s> we are about to change some of the fundamental principles of the english law if i may put it this way by a side wind before dinner <e> <s> the right to protect the right of assembly is unwritten and depends upon the right that every citizen has to undertake such conduct as seems to him to be proper subject to not breaking the ordinary law of the land <e> <s> the danger if we pass this clause is that we shall leave <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for that full reply <e> <s> may i ask her what <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak tonight about the contribution which universities can make in collaboration with industry to the industrial base of this country <e> <s> but first i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord derwent upon his speech which seemed to me to achieve the almost impossible twin virtues of being non-controversial and extremely penetrating at the same time <e> <s> i should like to take a leaf out of his book in a few moments and look at the american experience <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say something briefly about the performing arts but i must declare an interest <e> <s> for some years i have been a member of the council and of the finance committee of the royal shakespeare company <e> <s> as with the royal opera house we too were investigated by mr clive priestley an investigation which resulted in the judgment that we had been inadequately funded <e> <s> we were given an increased grant with the similar experience that the grant has not kept pace with inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we would all like to thank the noble lord lord annan for giving us this opportunity to debate the peacock report and to thank him especially for the way in which he highlighted the main questions that are before us this afternoon <e> <s> at the same time i must confess to being a little surprised that i am speaking so early in the debate for i wish to confine myself today to sound broadcasting in relation to peacock <e> <s> as chairman of mercia sound the local radio station serving coventry and warwickshire i must first of all declare an interest <e> <s> however i hope to make a contribution to the debate about local radio in particular and its relationship with the bbc <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness speaks perhaps i may add two points which she may care to take on board when she replies <e> <s> the amendment says <e>", "<cs> i think we are coming much nearer to an understanding of the problems that lie behind this set of amendments <e> <s> i found myself very much in agreement with what the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby had to say and i differed from him on only one conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the house to reject the amendments on three grounds <e> <s> first the advisory committee on school teachers pay and conditions is flawed because by giving the secretary of state the power only to limit central government expenditure it attempts to make an important and fundamental constitutional change by a side wind by something in the teachers pay and conditions bill <e> <s> if parliament were to be concerned to alter that control it is my submission that this would not be the right or proper way to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord dainton upon his excellent maiden speech which was as authoritative as it was graceful <e> <s> i am delighted that he has been able to join one of the committees of the select committee on science and technology <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make three main points this afternoon <e> <s> first if britain is to achieve a national income sufficient to maintain the expected standard of living of the whole community we must be successful both in the regeneration of certain established industries and also in a number of high-tech industries <e> <s> in both sectors success will generally depend upon very similar qualities especially the pursuit of appropriate technology in each field <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of the croham committee i have already had my corporate say <e> <s> therefore i should like to confine myself this afternoon to two points which seem to have caught your lordships interest namely the new organisation within the council with the new post of chairman and the scottish universities <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the independent local radio stations are convinced that if national commercial radio is introduced they will suffer a very severe reduction of their national advertising <e> <s> while many of the bigger stations will be able to recoup that loss by bidding for the franchise of the new national commercial stations many of the smaller local radio stations which now produce a very valuable local service are convinced that if the national commercial stations go ahead they will face bankruptcy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house will agree with me when i congratulate the noble baroness lady blackstone on an excellent and confident maiden speech <e> <s> those of us and i know that there are many who regard adult and continuing education as of vital importance at present will have found what the noble baroness had to say imaginative and moving <e> <s> the noble baroness has the widest experience not only now of birkbeck college but going back through the ilea of some excellent reports from the think tank <e> <s> we look forward with the greatest pleasure to her future contributions <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to deal with three points raised in the document <e>", "<cs> my lords does it not seem strange that on this of all days lady day so many of your lordships should attend on a friday in a chamber which is always dominated by the male to consider whether the legal rights to abortion so recently granted to women should be curtailed <e> <s> i submit that the select committee of which i was a member has rendered a particular service in that it has brought together for the first time since the act evidence on abortion <e> <s> at this moment that evidence may prove to be of particular usefulness <e>", "<cs> my lords by way of explanation i should like to point out that i said that a substantative issue was raised in this house by the former bishop of birmingham <e> <s> we subsequently found that he chose the wrong legal vehicle to bring it into effect <e> <s> however his intention was to bring before this house a particular issue which the select committee was charged to investigate <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of the select committee i too should like to add my thanks to the noble lord lord shackleton <e> <s> he could hardly have chosen a better date for this debate having regard to the decisions that have to be taken in the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords will notice that i am th on the list of speakers and therefore when i sit down more than half of the days business will have been discharged <e> <s> therefore at this hour i shall confine myself to one subject only academic freedom <e> <s> your lordships will notice that those words have been used today in two senses first referring to individual members of staff and secondly referring to the institution <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment very strongly <e> <s> there is one point i wish to add arising from my experience <e> <s> it is very difficult for one student when he has to return and face the other students <e> <s> the communication between the students and the governing body is enormously strengthened at that delicate point if one has two students <e>", "<cs> if one looks at the charter and statutes of almost every university in the country one will find that there are at least two student representatives never just one <e> <s> i think experience has shown that that is much the best and most efficient way of having student representation <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may try to help on this point <e> <s> the proposal in the bill translates the recommendations of the croham committee and in particular it organises a smaller body than the present ugc with a proportionately greater lay representation <e> <s> the committee made that recommendation after considerable thought <e> <s> there was evidence that while a number of lay members of the university grants committee were extremely useful it was often extremely difficult for lay members to give sufficient time in order to get efficiently into the interstices of the work being undertaken <e>", "<cs> i am attracted to the idea that the vice-chancellors committee and the officers of the universities funding council should work out ground rules for a contract so that all parties can have confidence in it <e> <s> i intervene only to say that it is not quite true that croham made no reference to contract <e> <s> i wish to quote one short paragraph from croham paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord kearton for his guidance and skill in steering this report to its successful conclusion <e> <s> the report of the committee states that <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether in about three sentences i may attempt to clear the confusion which we went through at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords reference has been made this evening to the fact that sub-committee i of the science and technology committee is undertaking an inquiry into the future of agricultural <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to pay a tribute to the skill and industry of the noble lord lord kearton in bringing the report to the house this afternoon and to thank him for his chairmanship of the sub-committee <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the croham committee envisaged that an executive committee should be set up under the council and that academic interests would be represented on it <e> <s> the committee would be responsible for setting the recommendations on financial matters which we hope would encapsulate the highest academic standards <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all those who have contributed to the debate today <e> <s> in introducing the debate i expressed the hope that it would be informative and further illuminate the report <e> <s> we have not been disappointed <e> <s> we have heard a most interesting and wide range of views <e> <s> i trust that my noble friend the minister and the departments concerned will find what has been said today helpful when they come finally to settle the <e>", "<cs> my lords returning to the community and japan i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord kearton on producing for us such an important and in many respects novel report <e> <s> as a member of his committee i should like to thank him for the masterly way in which he revealed to us the excellent evidence in a series of really splendid and enjoyable meetings <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate and thank the noble lord lord kearton because he led me as a member of the committee skilfully through the thickets of economic and monetary union <e> <s> i differ from some of my colleagues in that i regretted that a date by which britain should have joined the emu was placed in the report <e> <s> there was no doubt that the weight of evidence was in favour of britain joining sooner rather than later <e> <s> many witnesses were convinced that we should be more effective arguing from within rather than by remaining outside the erm <e> <s> many of the arguments were political <e>", "<cs> my lords listening to the debate this afternoon i am beginning to come to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i heard that the debate was to take place this afternoon only when i returned from lesotho at the weekend <e> <s> i have an inescapable engagement tonight and must therefore apologise if i am not able to stay until the end of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to remind the house of the words of the consumer credit act <e> <s> section states <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever view we take it seems clear from everything that has been said today that a convention has been developed to regulate procedure in relation to statutory instruments <e> <s> over a long period of time there has been a continuous move to prevent the chaos that would result from the creation of different forms of statutory instruments to meet particular situations <e> <s> the statutory instruments act made the most determined effort to introduce general provisions for statutory instruments to promote uniformity of procedure and avert the chaos which might otherwise result <e>", "<cs> i very much hope that the minister will find it possible to accept the principles which have been expressed in the amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord lord dainton explained there was no difference between the view of the select i committee on science and technology on the one hand and the department on the other <e> <s> they are united in the view that the nhs should do more to identify and meet its own research needs and that it should be brought into the mainstream of medical research <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of the committee i should like to thank the chairman for his skilful guidance in the matters that we are now considering <e> <s> i wish to make two main points <e> <s> first i am very much in favour of further agreement being achieved with the efta countries on the european economic area <e> <s> but secondly the agreements must be settled in such a way that they do not become damaging precedents and obstacles which might make it difficult for the community to create new kinds of relationships with other countries at a later date <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of the sub-committee i wish to join all those who have expressed thanks to my noble friend lord aldington <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate him on so skilfully presiding over the production of a report the character of which may well permanently have shifted the british argument in this area <e>"]
