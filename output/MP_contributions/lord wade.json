["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord first be good enough to accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that this matter is being considered but would the noble lord agree that one of the relevant points here is the public interest and that that should be taken into account before there is a private prosecution for criminal libel <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to render the provisions of the european convention for the protection of human rights enforceable in the courts of the united kingdom <e> <s> i beg to move that the bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join in thanking the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for making this statement <e> <s> i am impressed by the amount of work carried out by the benson commission <e> <s> i have only one question to ask namely when the recommendations have been studied may we take it that priority will if possible be given to those recommendations that are most urgent <e> <s> finally as i have retired from practice may i wholeheartedly join in applauding the statesmanship and wisdom of both branches of the profession <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join in thanking the noble lord for repeating the statement <e> <s> i should like to join most heartily in paying tribute to the members of the committee and of course in addition to the chairman mr justice may <e> <s> i would again pay tribute to the prison services <e> <s> as to the recommendations it is difficult to suggest degrees of importance but would the noble lord agree that high priority should be given to the recruitment of staff suitable for this type of rather specialised work and secondly to pressing on with a new building programme <e> <s> it is true that all this costs money but is it not also a fact that it would be a wise economy to incur this expenditure and that in the long run it would be for the benefit of the life of the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> in recent years there has been a groundswell of opinion in favour of some form of bill of rights <e> <s> i think that there are a number of reasons <e> <s> there is growing unease as to whether we enjoy adequate protection against encroachments on individual liberties <e> <s> then there is a belief that our parliamentary system is not entirely satisfactory <e> <s> for example governments may and often do come into power not representing a majority of the electors <e> <s> they may nevertheless claim to have a mandate and introduce legislation to which perhaps the majority of the electors are opposed <e> <s> there are no special safeguards apart from public opinion against measures affecting what some would regard as their basic liberties <e>", "<cs> my lords in order that noble lords may be quite clear in their minds the noble lord is referring to the fourth option namely a written constitution which is a very controversial matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with the noble lord in thanking the noble lord the leader of the house for making that statement <e> <s> we said from these benches yesterday that we would be happy to consider the bill and consider it very carefully in one d ay on monday <e> <s> we see no reason why we should not do so in one day on tuesday <e> <s> we realise that a change of business causes a great deal of inconvenience for noble lords but we feel sure the house will wish to co-operate as far as possible in clearing the ground for a possible settlement in zimbabwe-rhodesia <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very sincerely to thank all those who have taken part <e> <s> it has been a very important debate and the subject matter has been as distinguished as those who have taken part <e> <s> i have made copious notes with the intention of making appropriate comments on each speech but there comes a time when one has to assess what it is wise to do <e> <s> i feel that the house will forgive me if i do not make those appropriate remarks and utter words of thanks in regard to the speeches that have been made <e> <s> i am awfully tempted to start thanking the noble lord lord carr of hadley for his first point with which the noble and <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add just a few words to the remarks of the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts <e> <s> i simply want to emphasise one point and i shall put it in the form of a question <e> <s> is it not important that not only should we press both sides to cease the conflict which is taking place but we should be seen to be pressing both sides equally <e> <s> there might be some uninten <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into a committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i had not anticipated when i referred to the letter from the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor that it would lead to such an interesting discussion <e> <s> my reason for referring to this point at all was that the noble and learned lord had stated at second reading that he would be writing to me and others and i felt it would be only polite to acknowledge the fact <e> <s> i was authorised to say that what he had suggested was receiving very serious consideration by my colleagues <e> <s> that was obviously as far as i could go at the moment <e> <s> i think i should also add in fairness to the noble and learned lord that his remarks were very tentative because he was not yet in a position to go further <e> <s> but i welcome the initiative which the noble and learned lord took in that respect and the matter is being considered <e> <s> nevertheless i hope that whatever may come about in the way of all-party discussions the committee may think fit to proceed with and i hope approve the bill <e> <s> it is with that in mind that i move the first amendment <e>", "<cs> as regards the point raised by the noble and learned lord lord gardiner speaking off the cuff i think that it would be appropriate if it were in the singular rather than the plural <e> <s> i do not know whether or not that is an oversight <e> <s> i should have thought that government would be appropriate <e>", "<cs> i can only hope that it was a misprint and not my own mistake <e> <s> i take the point of the noble and learned lord lord gardiner and think that he is right <e> <s> the general point raises the whole question of the bill <e> <s> i hope that the committee will not wish to divide against this amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not quite follow that point but i shall look into it <e>", "<cs> i am obviously torn between two very distinguished points of view <e> <s> first i should like to remove any misunderstandings about the powers of the courts to strike out anything that parliament has done <e> <s> i am not suggesting that the noble and learned lord intended that anyone should misunderstand it but that word does give an impression that <e>", "<cs> i am always impressed by anything that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor says <e> <s> that does not mean that everything he says politically always carries me with him but on legal matters as we all know he is extremely knowledgeable <e> <s> in these circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> that means that the clause will remain as originally drafted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord morris <e> <s> i agree with the amendment and i suggest that it be accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i should like to thank the noble lord lord morris for the interest that he has shown in the bill <e> <s> his comments are most helpful and i am genuinely thankful for his interest <e> <s> i have studied his amendments and i entirely agree that they should be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords this being report stage with your lordships permission perhaps i may be allowed to speak again <e> <s> so far as the wording of these amendments is concerned i have studied it and compared it with the wording of the bill as it stands at the moment after it left the committee and i cannot myself see any difference in effect between the wording of the amended bill and the wording of the amendments which the noble lord lord morris has put before us <e> <s> therefore i do not think there is any difference in principle at all <e> <s> i would agree that the bill as amended in committee and as further amended if it is at this report stage deals with the articles by reference to their numbers and not by setting out verbatim the content of the articles <e> <s> that was a matter which i and others had to consider very carefully <e> <s> but i think it only fair to the noble lord lord morris to say that in my humble opinion there is no difference between his amendments and the bill as we have it except that he has devised a shorter way of putting the same thing <e> <s> i hope i am right but perhaps the noble and learned lord on the front bench will consider that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e> <s> this is an occasion for appropriate thanks to be expressed to all those who have taken part in the debates on the bill and that i gladly do <e> <s> but more than conventional thanks are called for today <e> <s> i have not only appreciated the courtesy that i have learnt to expect in this house but i have felt greatly indebted to the constructive and helpful criticisms that have come both from those who are doubtful about the bill and from those who support the bill <e> <s> at the same time i think that a few words of gratitude should be expressed to my colleagues on the select committee for the work that they did which lasted for over a year <e> <s> i have recently been told that the report and the volume of evidence including that given by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor is now compulsory reading for students in some establishments of higher education <e> <s> what the students have to say about that i do not know but the information might be of interest to those who served on the select committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the kind remarks that have been made <e> <s> i shall resist the temptation to say anything more except that i hope the bill will receive your lordships approval and be read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to have this opportunity of expressing my support for the case put forward by the noble lord lord seebohm namely the setting up of this world commodities centre in london <e> <s> we are indebted to the noble lord lord seebohm for raising this subject in this house and i think i can safely say that the whole house is also indebted to the noble lord lord shackelton for taking part <e> <s> we always give great weight to his remarks and i am sure that the government will take very seriously what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords may i start with a procedural point <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that if this motion is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord for explaining what he had in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e> <s> may i apologise to the house and to the minister for a clerical error <e> <s> the words article should read article <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome that answer by the minister which i hope will end recent uncertainty about the position of individual petitions <e> <s> will the <e>", "<cs> my lords while not lessening my welcome would the noble lord agree that there are cases where there is a breach or alleged breach of one of the articles and the complainant cannot find a <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to render the provisions of the european convention for the protection of human rights enforceable in the courts of the united kingdom <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> as some of your lordships know the object of the bill is to incorporate in our law the principles contained in the european convention on human rights which have already been ratified by the united kingdom government <e> <s> a year ago i moved the second reading of the same bill and i explained that i was doing so for the third time <e> <s> i am now moving it on second reading for the fourth time <e> <s> therefore i shall not attempt to go over all the same ground again <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all those noble lords who have taken part in this second reading debate <e> <s> in my view it has been a most important debate and every one of those who have taken part is a peer of great distinction <e> <s> the speeches which they have made have been not only worth listening to but i believe worth reading afterwards <e> <s> each speech deserves a full reply but if i were to attempt to do that i should spoil the whole debate <e> <s> i am well aware of that <e> <s> may i therefore make just one or two brief comments and be forgiven for not <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord morris for the brevity with which he discussed the amendments and i agree with him that it would be convenient to discuss both together <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for the great care and interest he has shown in the bill throughout and i echo his references to the noble and learned lords who took part in the second reading debate <e> <s> the support of such distinguished noble lords was significant undoubtedly there was a galaxy of talent present at that stage and i have been encouraged <e>", "<cs> first i should like to say how much i appreciate the helpfulness that the noble lord lord blease has shown throughout the discussions on the bill and i know that he has the aims of the bill very much at heart <e> <s> as to the amendment when i hear a reference to the sovereignty of parliament i am very tempted to deliver a lecture on that subject and when i hear a reference from the government front bench to technicalities i am very tempted to deliver a lecture on technicalities <e> <s> however in view of the time and the desire that the bill should proceed may i just say the following <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e> <s> it seems a long time since i first embarked on this subject <e> <s> as to the bill itself if today this house approves the third reading i calculate that i shall have gained a second reading in this house four times and a third reading twice and in due course if it finds its way to another place it will twice have been sent to the commons <e> <s> i hope that that is an augury for the future <e> <s> i am certainly grateful for the patience of all those noble lords who have taken part whether for or against the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt for a moment i should be very surprised if there were no amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to your lordships <e> <s> i will of course study what the noble lord lord boston of faversham and the noble and learned lord the lord advocate have said <e> <s> i have the impression from comparing remarks that were made a year ago and those made today that although perhaps cautious there is indicated some movement in the course of the year <e> <s> to that extent i am gratified by what has been said <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness lady white for introducing this debate and for outlining her report <e> <s> i am well aware of the amount of time and work which has been devoted to producing this report <e> <s> i think that it would be fitting to pay some tribute to the valuable work of the eec committees in this house <e> <s> they provide if i may say so evidence of the usefulness of a second chamber and i think that that is true whatever ones views may be about the composition of the second chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that the use of these flags of convenience has become a serious abuse and is there no prospect of some early agreement particularly among maritime nations to bring this abuse of flags of convenience to an early end <e>", "<cs> i hope the government may think fit to change their mind with regard to this amendment <e> <s> obviously this is not the time to go over the ground <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may join in the debate from this end of the chamber <e> <s> at the beginning of a committee stage of a bill of this importance it is not unusual to go a little wider than the actual wording of the first amendment and i think it helpful to have a somewhat general discussion of this nature <e> <s> if i am at fault in that respect i hope that i shall be forgiven but i think most noble lords realise that this happens on the first amendment and i am only trying to be helpful <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree <e> <s> the purpose of the first amendment is whether or not the word commons should be replaced by lords but i think that before the committee stage gets under way one must have some indication of the background <e> <s> however i have dealt with that and noble lords have been been kind enough to listen to what i had to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to say a few words in support of the amendment moved by the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> i do so partly because he has put the case very reasonably and persuasively and also because the amendment recognises the need to uphold the european convention on human rights which britain has ratified <e> <s> this is a subject on which i have spoken on other occasions but not during this particular debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a point for the sake of clarification because i am sure that all this may sound rather confusing <e> <s> i am looking at column of the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask which ministry is responsible for ufos <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may try to reduce this discussion to its simplest form <e> <s> do i understand that as a result of government policy there will be cuts which will involve suffering <e> <s> when the noble lord speaks of equality he really means that we are being asked to accept equality in suffering <e> <s> secondly when we talk about capital investment is it not very unwise taking the long-term view to indulge in cuts in capital investment when that will be so vital to the revival of industry in this country <e>"]
