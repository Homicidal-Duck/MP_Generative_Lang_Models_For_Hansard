["<cs> my lords the brevity which is understandably required by your lordships of a maiden speaker precludes me from touching other than very briefly upon the contents of this bill and its provisions and it certainly prevents me perhaps fortunately from entering upon any long dissertation about the history and the future of the landlord-tenant system <e> <s> furthermore it is now some years since i ceased to have any direct connection with the organisations and political side of agriculture though of course i have continued to be involved in the practical side both in farming myself and in letting land to tenants <e> <s> since then i have been engaged in various other activities some of which have kept me rather busy <e>", "<cs> i think it is generally recognised that the amendments which stand in the names of other noble lords and myself amendments nos <e> <s> and are neither probing nor wrecking amendments they are genuine attempts to improve the bill which is before us today <e> <s> they apply of course primarily to settlements which are proposed and reached by valuers with tenants because as the noble lord lord walston has reminded us there are very few arbitrations indeed in the agricultural field <e>", "<cs> i am an unrepentant and unreconstructed englishman in this matter <e> <s> i do not wish in the least to adopt any scottish provisions <e> <s> we have here a statement about the holding and its productive capacity and we then go on to talk about what the competent tenant might do with it <e> <s> it seems to me that these two things are so different that they ought not at any rate to be included in the same paragraph at this stage of the proceedings <e> <s> they should be separated <e>", "<cs> it is nice to have the support of the noble lord lord middleton <e>", "<cs> could i have one more go at this because everybody including myself seems to be getting into a frightful muddle about what this is all about <e> <s> i am trying to think in simple terms not in terms of tenders and the rest <e> <s> i am thinking of the case where in fact and in practice a small piece of land which is contiguous to your own is worth more to you than to anybody else in the neighbourhood <e> <s> therefore you are willing to offer more for it <e> <s> our amendment seeks to say that the arbitrator should not ignore that fact of life when he values the farm as a whole in particular the piece of land which is contiguous to yours <e> <s> as the bill stands at present the arbitrator has to ignore that fact of life and imagine that the land is some miles away and has got nothing to do with you <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i want to correct one fact which came from the noble lord lord john-mackie <e> <s> he made the statement that an increasing <e>", "<cs> the president of the rics told me only last week that the institution deals with between and commercial arbitrations per year and that although he does not personally appoint all of them they all come under his jurisdiction <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the number of noble lords who wish to speak this afternoon and this evening i hope that i shall be able to limit myself in inverse ratio to the number of years i have spent on my gubernatorial duties at the bbc and take only a few minutes of your time <e> <s> i should preface this however by saying that for many years i have believed that the two houses this chamber and this ancient parliament are the centre of our democratic life and that without them our democracy would soon perish <e> <s> what happens in this chamber in the other house and in the surrounding committee rooms is of immense importance though at times extremely dull <e> <s> it is not telegenic <e> <s> nevertheless it ought to be available and i have said this for many years <e>", "<cs> my lords the cost would be great <e> <s> i am not sure that the home secretary would be willing to give those channels because i imagine that if the other house was to be televised as well as our own two channels would be required for this purpose <e> <s> no doubt the leader of the house as a former home secretary will have his own observations to make on this subject <e> <s> it is perfectly practicable particularly with the advent of cable <e> <s> i doubt whether the noble lord lord home of the hirsel will be able to receive it at his home in scotland as i doubt whether cable will ever reach where he lives but that is neither here nor there <e> <s> i do not wish to anticipate the second reading of a bill which will be put before us very soon <e> <s> nevertheless it is practicable and that is the issue to be resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to make a factual correction <e> <s> what was described as the bbcs complaints commission is a programme complaints commission appointed by government and nothing whatsoever to do with the bbc except in so far as the bbc has to answer it and to publish the results of the adjudications <e>", "<cs> it is precisely because the previous system worked well under clearly understood simple guidelines that we feel that what is now going to be an extremely complicated system needs some method of interpretation which is not dependent upon i will not say when because that will convey the wrong impression the individual thoughts of a single arbitrator however highly qualified <e> <s> i very much regret therefore that i cannot ask the leave of the committee to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> it is precisely because we do not know that i wish to press it at this stage <e> <s> we have two further stages yet to come <e> <s> if in fact on report we get a beautiful new clause it is perfectly open to us to remove the obnoxious new clause which i have moved on third reading <e> <s> i am afraid i must stick to my decision and divide the committee on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i sail tonight in what i believe are largely uncharted waters <e> <s> i first heard of the dreaded addison rules when i was <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the time that remains to us i shall try to speak in shorthand as far as i possibly can <e> <s> first <e> <s> i much regret that i cannot congratulate the noble lord lord hanson since unfortunately at that moment i was upstairs in this house and did not have the opportunity to hear his speech <e> <s> i indeed regret that since the noble lord joined your lordships house at the same time as i did <e> <s> it was a great sorrow to me that i could not be present when he spoke <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord has succeeded in expressing in extremely plain speech what is by no means in his mouth gobbledegook <e> <s> but i am still not absolutely and completely happy about the point which i raised almost <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down may i inquire with the utmost respect whether she is answering the amendment i have just moved or a new clause which i shall be moving somewhat later in the proceedings relating to theft <e> <s> i was merely referring to the positive and negative procedures which are so well known to members of your lordships house <e> <s> we know perfectly well that if the government have to go through the positive procedure they have in fact to come to us and justify what they are doing <e> <s> they do not have to do that if they go through the negative procedure <e> <s> it was purely on this issue that i was speaking to your lordships not on something that is somewhat more complex <e>", "<cs> it is so bald that it almost suits me <e>", "<cs> i think that by now i cannot possibly press my amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to intervene but this amendment raises certain wider issues which relate to the community as a whole <e> <s> i referred very briefly to this point in my second reading speech <e> <s> one of the problems about television has always been that it is too large in its present form with the independent television companies and the regions of the bbc to do anything for communities which is really meaningful <e> <s> the areas are too big and the number of inhabitants is too great <e> <s> we see a much better picture of what might happen in <e>", "<cs> as the committee may have noticed i have not rather unusually for me put down an amendment on this clause <e> <s> the reason is that i cannot for the life of me think of one that is workable <e> <s> what i would ask is that the government think again very seriously about the possible consequences of a flood of cheap american material <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can save the time of this committee by saying that i do not intend to press these amendments <e> <s> if i said they were a bit crumby i might be thought to be speaking in derogatory terms but the noble lord the minister himself used the term crumbs <e>", "<cs> this of course arises under the must carry rule <e> <s> we are therefore dealing with public service broadcasting and public service broadcasting considerations should apply rather than purely commercial broadcasting or narrowcasting considerations <e> <s> therefore the broadcasting authority is the correct and proper organisation to make that determination <e>", "<cs> i should be delighted to do so <e> <s> i beg leave to move this series of amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> not altogether surprisingly i have got myself somewhat confused too <e> <s> we have here and much later and but really and are the ones which go with <e>", "<cs> i hope that even if the minister cannot accept the amendments i have put down on this occasion he will at least consider the possibility of from time to time the minister specifying such other services as might be subject to this rule <e> <s> i do not believe that one can draft on ones feet <e> <s> i certainly believe even less that a minister can be expected to accept amendments which are drafted on the feet <e> <s> however i ask that the minister and his advisers should again consider the questions for the future <e> <s> we are all looking to the future <e> <s> we are all trying to look beyond the immediate period of this year or next year and to what will happen in the s what the shape of broadcasting narrow casting broad band cable and so on is going to be <e> <s> all i ask is that he goes back and looks again at this <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i was unnecessarily brief <e> <s> i had been urged earlier to speak as sharply as might be so that your lordships may get home <e> <s> but if i was so brief as to be incomprehensible i apologise to the committee <e> <s> it seems to me that this government do not always know on their right hand what their left hand is doing <e> <s> the noble lord the minister has said that he does not want to see a list of criteria which the person making this determination should be required to observe <e> <s> if he would speak to his colleagues in the ministry of agriculture he would find that that is precisely what they are doing under the agricultural holdings bill <e> <s> they are issuing an enormously long list of criteria when previously there were no criteria at all except for a definition of what was the rent properly payable <e> <s> i suppose one must not say that there is one law for the rich and another for the poor though as a landlord perhaps i am entitled to say that <e> <s> anyway i hope that the department can look again at certain aspects of what i have suggested <e>", "<cs> may i inquire whether the minister is referring to all the amendments that come under this clause including those which relate to seven days rather than hours and so on <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to press this <e> <s> above all i do not wish to restrict competition unduly <e> <s> as i stated earlier we have a difficult position <e> <s> we wish sport to be better funded in this country <e> <s> one way it can be better funded is through television and radio <e> <s> so anything that restricts competition in this field in itself is not necessarily good for sport <e> <s> i keep coming back to the high proportion of the population who will never be able to receive cable <e> <s> i ask that all your lordships who have occasion to consider these and other amendments at a later stage should think of those people <e> <s> of course not everyone can get everything as of right <e> <s> i would not pretend that they should <e> <s> but where for many years they have been accustomed to receiving all or the greater part of a <e>", "<cs> i should like to add that the snippet versus whole-event argument applies equally to dbs <e> <s> i have always seen one of the great advantages of dbs as being that it can show the whole event as opposed to edited highlights <e> <s> whatever sporting event it may be that particularly interests <e>", "<cs> i believe there should be the reserve power to make regulations for protected events <e> <s> we were in a way discussing this matter earlier when we debated whether the authority or somebody else such as the home secretary should make up the list <e> <s> i believe that there ought also to be a reserve power for the home secretary to do so because this would be a very stong inducement for others to do so and not fall under this terrible imposition <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord the minister have any views on the period of seven days as opposed to hours <e>", "<cs> precisely <e> <s> the bread is still just edible after hours but it will have gone mouldy after seven days <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord accepted the amendment wonder of wonders <e> <s> is that not so <e>", "<cs> wonders will never cease <e> <s> i am most grateful <e> <s> in view of that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg to speak also to amendment no <e> <s> which stands in my name <e>", "<cs> i fear i am not convinced but this is no time to press a matter such as this to a division <e> <s> we have a very thin and unrepresentative house <e> <s> nevertheless i feel very strongly that in the way of bureaucracy pelion is being piled upon ossa and that we should do very much better at the end of the day with one statutory programme complaints commission which would achieve more uniform standards and all the other factors which i and others have mentioned <e> <s> if the government remain unmoved by my pleas i shall certainly return to this matter at a later stage of this bill <e> <s> at the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am delighted that we have started in this way <e> <s> with the assurance given by the noble lord the minister i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am still not entirely happy that there may not be a conflict of interest <e> <s> the telecommunications bill itself says under clause <e>", "<cs> i should like to read in <e>", "<cs> i speak in semi-support of lord mishcon but not for the same reasons <e> <s> my reasons are that the clause in the act is obscure and that that obscurity has been carried over by using virtually the same words in the bill <e> <s> nobody knows in this context what the word change means <e> <s> does it mean a change in the identity of the shareholders so that the clause will only bite when a sells his shares to b <e> <s> does it mean a change of any kind whatsoever in the shareholders nature so that the clause would bite if shareholder a diversifies his business into new fields or there was a change in the identity of the shareholders for example <e>", "<cs> i hope that the format is not laid down in too rigid a form <e> <s> i do not quarrel with the noble lords proposition that there should be the fullest information about complaints and the way in which they are met <e> <s> when i was filling that post i did my best to achieve that objective <e> <s> the trouble is that this is not a matter which can possibly be dealt with on a statistical basis <e> <s> numbers alone mean almost nothing and therefore the wording must be very carefully considered <e> <s> i am not in any way opposing the amendment but merely suggesting that the wording must allow for a certain fluidity in the reporting <e>", "<cs> i rise to support what has just been said <e> <s> i do not think that either amendment no <e> <s> or amendment no <e> <s> b satisfactorily deals with what is a very difficult problem <e> <s> it has a genesis although i do not want to go into the history of all this and has arisen from the fact that we have two quite separate departments each having separate motivations and introducing two separate bills which do not appear properly to interact <e> <s> i believe that it is time they sat down again and thought about what on earth they want to do <e>", "<cs> i have certainly no intention of pressing the amendment <e> <s> we tried to lay it out in full in order to show the various aspects that need to be dealt with <e> <s> i think a shorter amendment would not have dealt with the problem in quite the way we believe it ought to be dealt with because it is very important that we should have both civil and criminal remedies <e> <s> that is an essential part of what we should seek in order to safeguard the interests of the cable operators and of the broadcasters who provide the pay services in the future <e>", "<cs> subject to that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i find both sections of the noble lords reply extremely helpful <e> <s> the only other point that comes under the same heading is the question of other rights owners such as the authors either of computer programs or books <e> <s> they ought not to be deprived of copyright protection against the cable distribution of their works if the transmissions do not consist of sounds and so on <e> <s> it is the same old point <e> <s> if a computer program is downloaded over a cable or where a book is accessed by a subscriber from a data base which is controlled by a cable operator there ought to be copyright protection <e> <s> it is i think one of the most difficult areas in which we are dealing in the whole bill <e> <s> if your lordships will allow me to continue on this basis because we seem to be getting the answers as we go along the other point is contained in amendment no <e> <s> but your lordships may prefer to leave that until we have dealt with the amendments up to amendment no <e> <s> c <e> <s> may i withdraw amendment no <e> <s> a and also not move the other amendments up to amendment no <e> <s> c <e>", "<cs> with all respect to the noble baroness i would say that there is a precedent for this kind of definition which is contained in the british telecommunications act and it also appears in clause of the telecommunications bill which we are shortly to consider <e>", "<cs> i cannot say that i find that an entirely satisfactory reply when we already have such a definition in other legislation <e>", "<cs> i am sorry the noble baroness says that it could easily be legislated for but i know how long ministries have to wait for legislation <e> <s> it may well be that by refusal to accept such a definition it will not be possible to get dbs on the air <e> <s> the only hope of getting dbs on the air may be to have some type of consortium of this nature between either the commercial companies in itv or the iba itself and the bbc <e> <s> there may be no other way of doing it <e> <s> if we are going to do it we have got to move fast <e> <s> it is no good waiting for further legislation to allow us to do it <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for saying that she will take the matter back and have a further look at it <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as the night advances the noble baroness becomes more and more accommodating <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> he is so inclined <e>", "<cs> the answer to the first amendment was absolutely splendid the answer to the second i shall read in <e>", "<cs> this is a case where i am particularly glad to have the governments reasoning and thoughts on it because they are to me quite convincing particularly those in relation to the different timings of particular programmes <e> <s> no doubt all broadcasters will consider carefully when it is suitable to repeat a programme which has been originally broadcast very late at night but they cannot be at all sure that cable programmers will necessarily exercise the same care <e> <s> in any event they have no control over what they do with the thing when they have got it <e> <s> with your lordships leave i will withdraw amendment no <e> <s> zb <e>", "<cs> new as i am to the procedures of your lordships committee i am not sure whether this is the correct moment for me to rise but at the nod of the deputy chairman of committees i believe it is to tell your lordships why i believe that clause should not stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> for my part i have been very interested to listen to the answer by the noble lord who has spoken for the government and i shall certainly want to consider very carefully what he has said <e> <s> at this hour i should not wish to invite any of your lordships to proceed through the lobbies <e>", "<cs> i certainly would not wish to press this amendment <e> <s> i thought the matter needed clarification but it has been suggested particularly by those many societies and associations which do admirable work in the protection of and prevention of cruelty to animals that this act does apply to broadcasting <e> <s> this is one of the reasons why we wish to see this matter clarified <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke at considerable length a great many times during the committee stage of this bill <e> <s> on this occasion i do not intend to repeat that performance but there are one or two comments which should be made from these cross-benches on what has been said this afternoon <e> <s> first <e> <s> i wish to join with others in thanking the noble lord lord belstead for the extreme courtesy with which he has treated all of us and for the way in which he has tried to reconcile often irreconcilable positions <e>", "<cs> my lords at an earlier stage of the bill there was a good deal of discussion of the fact that one of the reasons why we had to have the bill at all was that arbitrators and valuers generally were completely ignoring what the law said in other words that they were deciding themselves what they were going to do without any guidance from the law <e> <s> fears had been expressed that at some stage those same arbitrators or valuers might be taken to court that the full rigours of the law would start to bite and that we should get huge rents and so on <e> <s> this was one of the reasons put forward for the bill <e>", "<cs> excuse me my lords i was looking in despair downwards <e>", "<cs> may i inquire whether this means that we are going to get i am not sure how many telephone directories exist for the country perhaps directories each <e> <s> if so i suspect that the majority of subscribers will not have the shelves to sustain the great weight of these directories <e> <s> if the amendment was confined to local telephone directories there might perhaps be more reason to support it <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to intervene on this amendment but surely one of the very considerable problems that we face in discussing radio frequency allocations in particular and these problems are allegedly enhanced by satellite frequency allocations is that these are agreed at international conferences <e> <s> one of the very real problems which we have faced in this country is that at one stage we were dare i say it <e> <s> not as forcefully represented in these international conferences as we ought to have been <e> <s> we asked only for what we needed instead of what every other country in the world did which was to ask for three times as much as it needed with the result that we had only one-third of what we needed on the usual principle of scaling everybody down <e> <s> thereafter until recently it has been up to the home office to allocate those frequencies in the appropriate quarters <e>", "<cs> like the noble earl i do not trust assurances <e> <s> governments change different parties come to power and the assurances of one government are as nothing to the next <e> <s> we are already in a thorough organisational muddle over cable <e> <s> this has recently been enhanced by the transfer of the radio regulatory department which one might think has nothing to do with cable whatever but which in fact does from the home office to the department <e> <s> at times one is tempted to ask is this a private fight or can anyone else join in <e>", "<cs> i rise for one minute to say that my definitions in the amendment to which we are coming shortly are much more specific and specialised than are the definitions of the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> this does not mean that we are not in many respects trying to cover the same ground it merely means i think that he is a generalist and in this <e> <s> i am a specialist <e> <s> i think that we are both trying to achieve the same kind of object and therefore i would commend his amendment to the government in saying that it may be that the one or the other the more specialised or the more generalised description may be appropriate in this case <e> <s> i do not presume at this stage to judge <e>", "<cs> with all respect this is telecommunications apparatus exceeding metres in height and if i am right that is about feet <e> <s> that is a great pylon in other words <e> <s> that is what that refers to <e> <s> there are the words an agreement which can be an agreement of the occupier it is not necessarily an agreement of the owner <e>", "<cs> may i be of some assistance to the noble lord <e> <s> i think that he will find that the majority of leases already include a prohibition against the occupier granting a wayleave without the landlords consent <e> <s> often it says after that which shall not be unreasonably withheld <e> <s> it is very nearly standard in most leases <e> <s> i see a lot of noble lords nodding at what i have said <e> <s> i hope that that in some measure answers the question <e> <s> i have to try to deal with it when we come to a later amendment <e>", "<cs> having withdrawn my paving amendment no <e> <s> a i think it would be impossible for me to divide on no <e> <s> b <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> it would appear to me from what has been said so far that they are going to be able to wipe out practically everything planning agreements management agreements planning consents and all sorts of other things <e> <s> i would not put it past them to obliterate all our beautiful landscape <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment in view of the assurances that have been given to me by the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to intervene in this little semantic argument and this dancing on the head of pins for which i am not best fitted physically <e> <s> but i am very interested to be reminded that the noble earl in winding up used the words not insignificant because the word significant in place of either appreciable or substantial is precisely what i suggested not in a formal amendment but in a more private discussion with the noble lord who is in charge of the bill and he rejected it as being a further interference with the formula which could only lead to further trouble <e> <s> may i therefore suggest that he might like to look again at exactly what his noble colleague on the front bench replied in an earlier debate in terms of the word significant <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to speak to this amendment but in view of the breadth of discussion which has been engendered by it and with the greatest of respect to the noble earl who sits in front of me we heard a second reading speech on the amendment which defines disability i believe that this matter ought to be looked at again <e> <s> it is very broadly drawn <e>", "<cs> there may possibly be a way forward here <e> <s> we have heard the wise advice of the noble lord lord houghton as to what should have happened to this bill after its unopposed second reading <e> <s> i was not here for that second reading <e> <s> i suspect that many people did not wish to divide the house because if one opposes any measure directed towards the alleviation of the problems and the <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to ask a simple question if i may <e> <s> i gather that this does not overlap with broadcasting because presumably the service will not be for general reception <e>", "<cs> my lords may i confine my brief remarks to the question of public meetings <e> <s> i have been to a good many of them in connection with the bbc and it has not been my experience that you get nothing but extremists and pressure groups there <e> <s> you get some people with eccentric opinions you get some people with complaints but you also get a lot of genuine public participation where people feel they can actually question directly those mysterious people the broadcasters who are responsible for programmes which they see over the air <e> <s> some of those people are themselves public figures others are the so-called grey-faced bureaucrats who are responsible for the programmes that are produced <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to contribute to this debate but i wish to add only a word and it is this <e> <s> the most important part of this amendment without any doubt whatsoever is the statutory requisition for them to consult <e> <s> if it is not written into statute it will not happen <e> <s> we have got to ensure that it is written into statute so that they are forced to consult whether they like it or not <e> <s> whether or not the reasons should be given to the applicant is a matter upon which there can be different opinions but there cannot be any member of your lordships house except those who have to speak for these two fiefdoms who could possibly back a situation in which there is not a statutory duty for the two to consult <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the government for being so responsive to what i had hoped were my persuasive arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords i was trying to say before the noble lord sits down but he almost succeeded in sitting down before i rose to my feet <e> <s> the salient words here are satisfactory alternative <e> <s> surely the responsible minister must be satisfied before he dispenses with the must carry rule on existing cable that a satisfactory system is being supplied <e> <s> clearly if it is not he must not waive the must carry rule <e>", "<cs> my lords i must oppose this amendment <e> <s> it would create a two-stage procedure of a negotiation followed by a ministerial <e>", "<cs> my lords particularly because of the delay in the noble lord the minister seeing the amendment i do not wish to press this matter tonight <e> <s> i would ask however that the government at least look again very carefully at the position which could arise if particularly under a subscriber variable system the dbs operator is put in the situation where whatever he does and perhaps the more subscribers he gets the more money he loses <e> <s> there must be some form of escape clause perhaps equally devised for the cable operator himself <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that the future will be with us rather sooner than the noble lord accepts <e> <s> maybe then the government will sit down think again and say that perhaps these methods of delivery should not be subjected to the must carry rule despite the fact that by then quite obviously the multi-watt channel wide band cable will be with us and will have ample accommodation for such services <e> <s> nevertheless i do not at this hour of the night want to divide the house <e> <s> however to say the least i think that this is extremely short sighted <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may join in the discussion i would say that being able to read what the noble lord the minister has said would repay us <e> <s> i understand that what has been suggested is that at this stage we should wind up as it were and come back to it all with fresh minds on thursday <e> <s> if that is the proposition that the chief whip is putting to the house i for one would warmly support it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord elton looked around the house to see whether i was in my usual place to move my amendment <e> <s> bearing in mind where i am at present standing i would say that i am not intending to try to dominate him by height on this occasion <e> <s> it so happens that the bench on which i usually sit was rather full <e> <s> we are discussing a rather complicated interlocked series of amendments and if by mischance i move slightly astray from what is strictly germane to <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed i was merely seeking an opportunity to say a word or two legitimately about this amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that it did not make programmes i said that it had a regulatory function <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank the noble lord for what he has said and for his shall i say <e> <s> rather unexpected conclusion after repeating the arguments which he had used in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall unfortunately not personally be in a position to put anything down if the date of the third reading is when i think it is because i shall be enjoying a few days sun in a sunnier clime than this <e> <s> nevertheless i am sure there are other noble lords present in this house who will listen carefully to the noble lord the ministers remarks and would be willing to assist by doing so in their own name <e> <s> under the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment standing in my name <e>", "<cs> my lords i am here <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that what the government are able to produce in the way of anti-theft provisions will do the trick <e> <s> i agree that it is extremely complicated to try to do it by what are almost back-door means relating to copyright <e> <s> if the ingenuity of those who have assisted me in the drafting has been somewhat overstrained i can only apologise <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that they are groundless <e> <s> i am certain that if the noble lord has anything to do with it i need have no fears at all <e> <s> i am and remain afraid of precedents which may be carried over into other fields <e> <s> it was for that reason that i hoped to be able to improve this particular clause <e> <s> having given this an airing which will be reproduced in print i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the very swift advance to which he has referred and the many changes which are taking place are the very reasons legislation is urgently demanded to cope with these new and extreme difficulties which were not envisaged in previous years <e> <s> i fear that the report to which reference was made earlier is not now wholly relevant because so much has happened in between <e> <s> i ask the noble lord to use every ounce of his well-known persuasion to persuade those sitting near him and others who sit in another place to introduce legislation at the earliest possible date <e>", "<cs> my lords i only want to add one or two words to the many that have already been spoken on this bill and in particular i wish to support my lifelong friend the noble baroness ladv lane-fox <e> <s> i cannot describe her in technical <e>", "<cs> my lords contrary to the usual practice i believe that i should start by declaring that i do not have an interest in the subject of this bill inasmuch as it cannot affect the methods and the kind of worship which takes place in the chapel which replaced the original parish church where i reside <e> <s> there is no parochial church council to hold forth about it because we are and this may well be news to the mot reverend primate of england in whose diocese i reside an archbishops peculiar <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not suggest that one had to have and nothing but <e> <s> i said that i was not sure that all those who talked about really appreciated what they were talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise on only one small aspect because it illustrates the real difficulty which parliament as a whole has been in over this whole field <e> <s> it concerns the difference between films as shown in the cinema cassettes which may be hired or bought and broadcasting as a whole <e> <s> i should like to remind the noble lord that the bbc did not show the war game precisely because it was thought that it would or it might considerably alarm in particular people living alone old people and perhaps children <e> <s> but in fact during all that period the war game has been available as a film to groups of people who wished specially to get together to view <e> <s> this illustrates the real difference between what is broadcast into the home and what is available on video cassettes for the home and what is seen in the cinema <e> <s> therefore the same criteria do not necessarily apply <e>", "<cs> my lords may i with the leave of the house reply to one or two of the points that have been made <e> <s> i have personally been convinced during the course of discussions that it is essential to classify not perhaps in a complicated way videos that are for sale or for hire and that to do so by the time at which those videos were originally broadcast may and i only say may not be entirely satisfactory <e> <s> i do not believe that the present classifications that the bbfc operates are entirely satisfactory <e> <s> i should not like to see them applied as they stand at present to video cassettes <e> <s> nevertheless there is much to be said for some similar system <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say that the corporation with which i was formerly connected has some anxieties about the lack of any such protection for works moving between various parts of it and therefore i am grateful to the noble lord for proposing these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to continue the short debate which we are having on the arts and in doing so i shall try to confine myself to as <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i rise after what i can only describe as a diatribe to say that although there may be many things on which i disagree with the noble lord on this matter i have more than a good deal of sympathy for him <e> <s> this bill should never have been a private members bill it should have been a government bill <e> <s> with all due respect to the noble lord lord nugent and perhaps on this occasion i may be allowed to describe him as my noble friend lord nugent because i have known him for many years although we do not sit on the same benches he has piloted this complicated difficult problematical bill with considerable skill through this place <e> <s> but he has had it is true enormous help from the government in its drafting and the government should have taken it over <e>", "<cs> my lords if i seemed to be verging on a third reading speech i apologise but frankly the whole of this business has made me very unhappy indeed <e> <s> we do not seem to have made any progress at all <e> <s> i have taken the whole of my amendments together so that we can have a general discussion <e> <s> it has been a discussion in which on the whole there has been more endorsement of what i have had to say and the position i have taken in regard to the amendments i have moved than there has been opposition to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i want merely to thank the noble lord lord elton for further improving this situation <e> <s> we had a great deal of difficulty over it <e> <s> first of all i fear that those of us who know something about the subject had quite a lot of difficulty in teaching some of our fellows as to what it was all about including the noble lord lord elton who knew clearly what it was all about <e> <s> the noble lord has been of considerable assistance <e> <s> although i would not say this for the whole of the bill i think we have ended up with a greatly improved collection of words on this very knotty problem <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord for all the personal effort he has put into getting it right <e>", "<cs> my lords if i remember rightly this was one of the amendments in which i was associated with the noble lord <e> <s> i am delighted that the government have seen sense on this matter and that we have one body who will establish their own precedents and deal with these extremely difficult questions of unfairness and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to delay your lordships unduly but i merely enter a caveat that i do not think that the matter is as easy as that <e> <s> i think we shall run into further problems on copyright in the future and some very difficult ones indeed <e> <s> i merely enter that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a simple question <e> <s> will the three governors from the bbc and the three members of the authority be appointed by the home secretary <e> <s> if so will the chairman be elected from among them or will he be a supplementary member thus making the number into seven <e>", "<cs> my lords but he will be appointed by the home secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords you will observe that being an optimist as always i am dressed in a fashion in which i am not usually dressed in your lordships house <e> <s> i am hoping to attend the farewell dinner of two of my most beloved governors at the bbc <e> <s> i hope that it will still be possible for me to get there at any rate while they are drinking port and drinking their health <e>"]
