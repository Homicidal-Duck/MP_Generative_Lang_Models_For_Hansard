["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for that reply because it clarifies a position which is very often obscure and also fluid <e> <s> can my noble friend confirm that if the italian government or any other government disregard the eec rule payments for over production of milk and its products must be made by individual producers and not by the governments themselves out of their own funds <e> <s> then the whole scheme would become unacceptable to us because there would not be parity on equal terms throughout the community <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord hood has put his finger on a most iniquitous and desperately unfair situation as regards the direct sale and wholesale position <e> <s> does my noble friend the minister not agree that in these circumstances where a producer has both wholesale and direct sale quotas and there are many of these i believe of them the damaging inflexibility which exists will not be fairly and fully remedied unless there is backdating to nd april <e> <s> i ask what the government are proposing to do to right this very grave wrong from its first inception <e>", "<cs> my lords may i please say that i fully support my noble friend lord stanley of alderley in what he says and perhaps i may add just one or two remarks of my own <e> <s> is not the cart being put before the horse by this bill <e> <s> a date is selected for what amounts to complete prohibition except under licence on the burning of straw and stubble <e> <s> that date is selected completely without reference to the alternative methods of disposing of the straw including the method of incorporation which no doubt will take its place <e>", "<cs> my lords i wholeheartedly support the noble lord lord raglan as the introducer of the proposed instruction to the committee to which this bill will presumably be committed <e> <s> the noble lord gave us a full detailed and forceful line of argument <e> <s> i know that he has visited the bay and has therefore seen it at first sight <e> <s> that was quite a large undertaking because he lives a long way away <e> <s> that shows me i live nearer that he has first-hand knowledge of the problems <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord greenhill of harrow who has just spoken have known swanage for a very long time <e> <s> it was in fact years ago that i first went there as a boy of camping with the scouts <e> <s> i have continued to visit swanage at irregular intervals i admit because of my way of life but the fact is that i have kept in touch <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to confine my remarks to the situation created by the move into the prohibited weapons class of self-loading rifles <e> <s> these rifles are the basic army weapon of today <e> <s> they have been in existence as i believe my noble friend lord swansea said for years <e> <s> what i have to say bears a little on that <e> <s> other noble lords have spoken to some extent about self-loading rifles but only sporadically <e> <s> i wish to emphasise differently some of the points made <e>", "<cs> my noble friend the minister has once again used the phrase enormously dangerous <e>", "<cs> i believe that the reference to the united states is a red herring <e> <s> that is a very different matter <e> <s> i shall divide the house on the issue <e>", "<cs> i find it difficult at the moment to gather up all the arguments from the minister <e> <s> i did not hear him clearly <e> <s> i do not see why this amendment should be smeared with the accusation that it is not what it says it is <e> <s> it provides very considerable additional safeguards <e> <s> however i should like to read the record of these exchanges <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to express strong support for the words which were used by my noble friends lord renton and lord middleton in their argument of this case <e> <s> this is perhaps a more widespread and important problem than some noble lords realise <e> <s> there are very great differences between those who have always known mains supply and those who have never known such supply and have always had to rely on private supplies <e> <s> the one may not be fully aware of what the other has been doing perhaps over hundreds of years <e> <s> so i make no excuse for taking a little of the committees time to enlarge on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the noble baroness lady stedman in her amendment in the strongest possible terms <e> <s> i confirm everything that she has said resulting from her meeting yesterday with dr hayes the commissioner for local administration in northern ireland <e> <s> i was present myself at that meeting <e> <s> he described to us exactly how the situation works today in northern ireland and has worked during his time in office there <e> <s> he was full of praise for the good practical effects which were experienced by all the interested parties and for the availability to him of the civil court as a last resort though it was seldom used <e>"]
