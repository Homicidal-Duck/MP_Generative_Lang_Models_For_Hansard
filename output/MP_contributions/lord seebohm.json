["<cs> i have been referred to as the president of age concern which is perfectly true but a more relevant qualification i have if any is that of chairman of the trustees which owns the new earswick village in yorkshire where we have done a good deal of experimentation in looking after old people both in building groups of houses which are an enormous success and in residential homes <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could bring some further comfort to the noble earl and say that the industrial and commercial finance corporation which is the largest specialist institution dealing with small companies financed in the financial year which is just ending well over start-up companies which is per cent <e> <s> more than last year <e> <s> it has put out or will have put out in the next few days about million to small businesses which is over four times what it did five years ago <e>", "<cs> i apologise for intervening but in our plans every worker must be a member and must have a stake

noble lord lord mishcon has said <e> <s> i had hoped that we should get more encouragement than we have had from the front bench <e> <s> it is perfectly easy for legislation to do what i have put forward <e> <s> but unless there is some positive encouragement from the government by way of stating the case by no means do i say that this evening has been wasted the government will not have done what i wanted <e> <s> i do not believe that a single person has spoken against my amendment <e>", "<cs> i agree with that and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i confess that i am puzzled <e> <s> i fully agree with lord lloyds motives but there are three amendments which seem to have precisely the same objectives amendments no <e> <s> and the amendment in my name no <e> <s> <e> <s> the amendment i am putting forward has been approved and is strongly recommended by the council of securities industries which is the watchdog in the city for these matters <e> <s> i have also had a letter from the chairman of the stock exchange saying that he is strongly in favour of the amendment in my name <e> <s> i wonder whether these amendments should be taken together or whether the government have a view as to which is the best one <e> <s> if we pass this amendment do we automatically cancel the other two <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment very strongly <e> <s> i joined barclays bank in the year in which section of the companies act came into force <e> <s> ever since that time it has been a plague for those operating in the banking field <e> <s> the points have been well made by the previous speakers <e> <s> i hope we can get this amendment through today <e>", "<cs> i want to make only one more comment and that is that in view of the strong feeling that has been expressed by a number of people i hope that every effort will be made by the government to bring forward the amendments to your lordships house so that we may perhaps see them at the report stage <e> <s> if that can happen i shall be very happy <e>", "<cs> perhaps all priority will be given to it and in that case i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to put forward any of the arguments i have said quite enough loud and clear already on the subject <e> <s> although i am disappointed that the amendment will not be accepted i am grateful for the way in which the government have expressed their willingness to help to publicise the matter with possibly the publication of demonstration memorandum and articles and giving publicity through the small businesses advisory service the scottish development agency the welsh development agency and probably cosira although we did not mention that at our meeting <e> <s> the general help that was offered us was i am sure genuine and will be of great assistance to my colleagues when they start preparing the demonstration model <e> <s> i am also grateful to the many noble lords who supported me in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i welcome this amendment no <e> <s> to remove section which has always been such a nuisance but i find paragraphs <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask for a little more clarification on that <e> <s> if as a banker which i used to be i am lending money in the ordinary course of business to a company and they then use it for improper purposes am i in the clear <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had some serious criticisms of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment purely from a practical point of view having been in the seat of lending money for very many years and having had to contend with section and its predecessor in the act for a very great number of years <e> <s> if a company decides to buy another company it will very probably be necessary to borrow part of the purchase price from its bankers <e>", "<cs> my lords i must make it clear to start with that i am no longer chairman of icfc <e> <s> i retired last year and handed over to the noble viscount lord caldecote who is very sorry that he cannot be here <e> <s> he has however authorised me to speak on the various figures i hope not too many regarding the present experience of icfc <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a very brief intervention <e> <s> my excuse is that i lived in yorkshire for years <e> <s> for the last six of those years i lived in the east riding and my two great loves were york minster and beverley minster <e> <s> i have a feeling that as is so clearly marked on the map of the district plan which i hold in my hand on the very site we are talking about the letters pos standing for public open space have some considerable significance in this argument <e> <s> it may well have been that the original vendor believed that there was no chance that this site would be developed and that he was really contributing to the permanent open space around the minster <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wolfenden has explained in his normal skilful way the feelings and findings of the committee and i do not think it is necessary for me to make a long speech <e> <s> i should also like to take this opportunity of congratulating the noble lord on the skilful and charming way in which he handled our witnesses during the process of our examination <e> <s> it was extremely well done and he managed to extract from these distinguished people all the information that he required <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking as a banker i naturally welcome clause as amended very much indeed and the death of section of the companies act is something for which we have all looked for very many years <e> <s> what worries me about amendment no <e> <s> a is in connection with the financing of management buy-outs which is now becoming extremely important <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he is aware that a number of people including myself are very sceptical about this scheme believing that to overload small businesses with ever increasing debt at exorbitant rates of interest can be quite dangerous when they really need more equity and that the success of this scheme cannot be judged for quite a long time yet <e> <s> there have already been failures even in the first six months <e>", "<cs> my lords i must add my thanks to the noble and learned lord lord scarman for his report which i found very fair and excellent although of course tragic <e> <s> having read it i must confess that i came to the conclusion that we are dealing with a crisis situation which needs immediate remedies without any necessary relevance to any long-term plans <e> <s> i think that things are extremely serious not only in brixton as the noble lord says but all over the country <e> <s> we have seen that again recently in bristol <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to congratulate the noble viscount lord chandos on his splendid speech <e> <s> in fact i should like to congratulate both the maiden speakers whom we have heard this evening <e> <s> they did not exactly seem to agree with one another but i think that it will be all to the benefit of the house if we hear them both again in the future very likely taking opposite views <e> <s> they will certainly be well worth listening to and i congratulate them <e>", "<cs> my lords i must lend my voice to this amendment which i strongly support <e> <s> first i take the view that if there is some doubt about the statutory obligation then the amendment makes the situation abundantly clear <e> <s> that is my main reason for supporting the amendment <e> <s> however other points have been made which are also very important especially the point made by the noble lord lord redcliffe-maud <e> <s> it has been very distressing for me since the act in which i was involved to see how difficult it has been to get the national health services and the local authority social services working closely together <e> <s> i believe that this amendment will help <e> <s> i think that it is necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that the developing countries constitute the worlds greatest reservoir of food production that each country therefore has an obligation to pursue a food strategy which has a realistic chance of meeting basic internal needs and that international aid should be conditional upon its being used primarily for this purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord very warmly for his welcoming our report and for what he has said which encourages us to realise that considerable studies and thought are continuing on this particular subject <e> <s> i should like to leave with him two points about which we feel very strongly as will be evident from what has been said today <e> <s> one relates to the position of the radiographers and the other is concerned with the position of the people who are so inelegantly and inappropriately called paramedics <e> <s> apart from that i should like to thank very warmly my colleagues who have put such good flesh on the very bare bones of my remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a very interesting debate indeed and it would be quite improper for me to start another speech at this time of night although i could blow a number of holes in a number of things said by the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i hope that he will read the <e>", "<cs> my lords as the evening goes on there is less and less for me to say <e> <s> i should like first to express my thanks to the noble lord lord benson not only for having explained so clearly to your lordships house what the main points of the directive are but also for the part he took in the final drafting of the report itself <e> <s> i find that it is now actually comprehensible <e> <s> as has been said the object of group accounts is to give creditors shareholders and employees as reasonable a picture as possible of the financial state and profitability of the undertaking <e> <s> this is where i cross swords with the noble lord lord hirshfield who seemed to think that the shareholders were the only people interested whereas as an ex-banker i would say that the creditors and the employees are equally important <e> <s> as a banker i would say that the creditors are the most important <e>", "<cs> may i just add my comments on that <e> <s> since the seebohm report if i may so call it <e> <s> probably one of the most important documents has been the barclay report which came out very recently <e> <s> i have in fact been talking about that today in another place <e> <s> i really think that the urgency for additional training at the present time in view of the barclay report and the changes in social work likely to take place in the next year or so makes this amendment very important and i sincerely hope that we shall give this amendment serious thought <e>", "<cs> i am in a little difficulty over this but i shall speak to my amendment <e> <s> if the previous amendment is passed mine may become slightly superfluous <e> <s> the appointment of the members of the central council for education and training in social work is very important and i feel that what is in the bill which is <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief <e> <s> i find it very difficult to believe in spite of comments that may have been made by the noble lord lord houghton or perhaps in the other place that anyone who knows anything about the cdc could possibly object to this bill <e> <s> over the years the cdc has acquired a unique expertise and experience in tropical agriculture and what is even more important has gained the confidence of the governments concerned <e> <s> there have i think been many well-intentioned projects in the past which have failed to do any good for the particular reason that they do not have the confidence of governments <e>", "<cs> my lords could the minister let me know whether the recommendations of the barclay report require legislation <e> <s> if not will it be the intention of the department to issue guidelines <e> <s> how will they be dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be quite improper for me to make another speech now so i shall not do so <e> <s> my only plea is that i think it is time that the talking stopped and more action started <e> <s> i must say how immensely grateful i am to everybody who has supported my motion <e> <s> my little match seems to have lit quite a fire <e> <s> i think it has been a splendid debate <e> <s> i am most grateful to everybody <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that all the members of the select committee should consider themselves extremely lucky that the noble lord lord barnett was introduced into your lordships house in time to join this debate <e> <s> we are most grateful for his wise remarks and we shall look forward to hearing him on many occasions in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl very much for what he has said and for the interest he has taken in this problem <e> <s> i think there are only two things on which i have reservations and on them i shall read <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl agree that considerable sums are now being received <e>", "<cs> at this late hour i shall not delay your lordships for long but i must refer to the words used by the noble <e> <s> baroness lady trumpington when she moved the second reading of this bill on th december last <e> <s> i quote from col of the <e>", "<cs> how certain is the minister of what he has just stated <e> <s> i daresay that some building societies have that rule but in the west end of london leases of up to years are perfectly satisfactory security for any bank <e>", "<cs> it just does not happen to be true <e>", "<cs> my lords i too must congratulate the noble lord lord obrien of lothbury for the way he has handled this complicated report and investigation <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate him on behalf of the select committee on how well he has put our case forward to the house today <e> <s> i think the time has come for short speeches and i do not propose to make a long one <e> <s> i shall not go over any of the ground that the noble lord lord obrien dealt with so ably but i want to make certain comments particularly why i think that it is absolutely essential that the resources of the community should be enlarged <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord lord plowden has explained so clearly the extraordinary and drastic situation that we have now reached regarding the cap <e> <s> which is completely out of control do not think that there is any need for me to say anything more about that <e> <s> but i feel that it is probably just worth pointing out that the cap has done an enormous amount of good <e> <s> we now have throughout the whole of the community an agricultural industry that is highly efficient <e> <s> we are no longer short of food we can produce all that we need <e> <s> not only do we have a fine agricultural industry but it has brought along with it prosperity in all the other industries at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i say what a pleasure it was to hear my noble friend although we are not sitting on the same bench i think that i may call him my noble friend lord forte make his maiden speech today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships will all agree that the noble lord <e> <s> lord beswick is a past master at asking very difficult questions <e> <s> i think that your lordships will also agree that his charming and innocent way of putting a question might lead one to fall into the trap of thinking that it is fairly easy to answer <e> <s> in fact when he speaks one realises that he has done a great deal of homework and that it will not be easy to answer all his questions <e> <s> i agree with him entirely about the evil of high interest rates but i do not agree with his analysis <e> <s> it is that topic with which i intend to deal <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister has already made clear his attitude to all these disregards and the noble lord lord ennals has said enough in his speech to melt his stony heart if that organ were in any way soluble which i doubt <e> <s> i should nevertheless like to make one or two comments in supporting this amendment which from my long experience in the voluntary sector i think are pertinent <e> <s> the local authority which has to make considerable reductions in its expenditure will go for the easy targets and this is obviously an easy target <e> <s> it will not cause any unemployment among local authority employees <e> <s> it seems to me that this is probably a great inducement for this to be one of the first things that they would tackle <e> <s> on the other hand it is important to realise that this particular expenditure made to the voluntary <e>", "<cs> i agree entirely with the intentions of these amendments <e> <s> i agree very much with what was stated by the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> as an ex-chief executive i would be furious if someone started peeling off my responsibility and placing it in the hands of some non-executive director <e> <s> this responsibility must be the responsibility of the chief executive <e> <s> there is no doubt that if anything goes wrong he must be responsible <e> <s> otherwise he can shed his responsibility on to some weak member of the board <e> <s> i do not think that this foray is on <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not repeat the arguments that i put forward at committee stage <e> <s> the noble baroness lady faithfull has enlarged on the most important of them and i only want to point out that this amendment would in no way restrain local authorities from looking at charities with an eagle eye and supporting those which are genuinely giving a service to the community and ensuring that they are still aided <e> <s> i strongly recommend this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords although i am a member of the select committee i was not on sub-committee b so i think it is quite appropriate to say how much i value this report <e> <s> in fact i think it is one of the best we have produced in the last few years <e> <s> i am sure the house would agree that lord brimelow deserves much praise not only for producing this report but for the amount of work that he personally put into it to which i was a witness <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i thank everybody who has spoken in this debate <e> <s> they have supported the report in on the whole an encouraging way <e> <s> secondly i thank the noble lord lord young of graffham for his efforts on his initiation day <e> <s> we were delighted to hear what he said <e> <s> this may be the end of the debate in this house but it is only the beginning of the debate outside <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody could possibly disagree with the rather vivid description given by the noble lord <e> <s> lord cledwyn of penrhos regarding the tragedy and horrors of unemployment but i do not think we are going to get very far unless we are absolutely clear what the causes of unemployment are and i do not agree with what he said on that particular subject <e> <s> in the short time that i have i should just like to say what in my view i believe to be the main causes of unemployment and where that leads us so far as the cure is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that since after that oil hike never in the history of the money markets has there been so much money sloshing around owned by international bodies and individuals <e> <s> would he further agree that if we had adopted the policy which i imagine the opposition benches wish us to adopt and intervened in the market we could very well have used up our entire reserves with very little effect <e>", "<cs> i have put my name down in support of the amendments that have been sponsored by the noble lord lord benson not because i object to the bill as a whole but because i think it is high time that we had something like this to protect the ordinary creditors in business <e> <s> the noble lord lord benson himself has immense experience in the currency field and also as a director of companies <e> <s> i do not propose to repeat the i think very convincing arguments that he has made to show that some amendments are certainly necessary to this bill and particularly to clause which practically all businessmen in your lordships house will find in some ways at least objectionable <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord let me know whether the new system will help or hinder closer co-operation between local authority personal social services and the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i may be allowed to make a very brief comment <e> <s> i must say that i have an interest because i live in dedham which is the centre of constable country and within a mile or so of my house is an old-established scrap merchants <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i should like to thank everybody who has spoken in this debate <e> <s> it has all been most helpful <e> <s> i am very sorry that i cannot agree with the arguments put forward by the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i am not convinced at all and we all know that unless there is legislation it will not happen <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness let us know whether anybody has bothered to ask the black africans what they think about the american initiatives <e>", "<cs> as my name is on the amendment perhaps i may be permitted to speak <e> <s> i shall be very brief <e> <s> i shall not risk being accused of verbosity or filibustering <e> <s> i should like to start by saying how strangely unmoved i am by the speech of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> he is probably the most brilliant debater in this committee but he uses a very different crystal ball from the one that i use <e> <s> moreover i think he has largely misinterpreted the intention of the amendment in using such phrases as it is going to be small and trivial or large unimportant <e> <s> it is going to be small and very important <e>", "<cs> my lords am i not correct in saying that our exports are at an all-time record <e>", "<cs> the difficulty for me lies in the tremendous difference that there always is between london and the metropolitan counties <e> <s> most of the metropolitan counties have an overwhelming majority in one district which makes it very difficult to see how this will apply if manchester wants to do it and the other boroughs do not though it has an overwhelming majority not only in numbers but also in problems <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord lord lucas <e>", "<cs> my lords my question has partly been answered in that it is impossible at the moment to say what will be the local content of xx machines on which we are placing so much hope <e> <s> if we do proceed with making engines at swindon under japanese plans will that put longbridge out of work <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief <e> <s> i have in fact torn up my prepared speech but there are one or two points i feel i must make <e> <s> i have read the report with great care <e> <s> i rather wonder whether everyone else who has spoken has done so <e> <s> i find it logical soundly argued and the conclusions convincing <e> <s> i believe that while comparisons are odious as they say in the report one has to compare permanent secretaries salaries with something <e> <s> in my view the difference between public sector and private sector salaries has become altogether too large to be tolerable <e> <s> the crucial question is the extent of the discount of the public sector which one needs to have in order to ensure that there is not too great an incentive to leave or not go into the civil service which must attract people of the highest calibre <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord obrien has included in his resume of the select committees report everything that needs to be said <e> <s> it was an excellent report and it is something which your lordships house will certainly have appreciated very much indeed <e> <s> i do not think that it is important at this stage for me to make a long speech <e> <s> therefore i shall confine my remarks entirely to the particular aspect of the fountainebleau agreement which affects the finances of this country and which to me sends out strong danger signals <e> <s> indeed that is due to the fact that the agreement to reduce the contribution for the united kingdom was an <e>", "<cs> my lords my own interest in this particular bill which i welcome very much is that for many years i was a director and for some time chairman of the barclays overseas development corporation and we worked very closely with the cdc but very much in its shadow and were involved in joint projects with it <e> <s> i formed a very high opinion of its efficiency which has been proved over the years to be quite correct <e>", "<cs> i shall be very brief this time <e> <s> i feel that somehow local authorities must be brought into this bill <e> <s> i am not quite sure how you do it and i do not think that this amendment is necessarily right <e> <s> i speak as somebody who lives in dedham one of the most beautiful villages in essex <e> <s> since a covered market has opened there seven days a week it has been ruined <e> <s> the traffic is terrifying <e> <s> the market people have advertised all over east anglia and now we can hardly get out of our front doors <e> <s> one day there were coaches in our tiny village which is only a few <e>", "<cs> my lords having spent the whole of my working life in a commercial bank may i ask two questions and make one comment <e> <s> my comment is simply to agree with the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe that million is a very small figure nowadays particularly in the new set-up after the big bang <e> <s> it is tiny <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i should like to say how grateful i am to the noble lord lord walston for allotting this particular lucky dip that he had in the ballot to this subject <e> <s> i should also like to thank him on behalf of the committee of which i am afraid i was a very poor member for his tremendous energy in going abroad and finding out the facts for himself <e> <s> he has not been talking in any sense from an academic point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to be able to say that it is not customary for the proposer of a motion to make two speeches and i shall not do so <e> <s> however i must thank all the members of your lordships house who have spoken in what became to my mind a very important debate in fact far better than i thought it would be <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief for two reasons <e> <s> first the noble baroness lady serota has introduced this debate today so clearly that many of the points we might have made have already been made <e> <s> i may say that her clarity and the way in which she introduced this subject were typical of all the meetings we held in sub-committee c the second <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief your lordships will be glad to hear <e> <s> i have been impressed by the arguments of the noble baroness lady platt <e> <s> there is however an additional point that is well worth making <e> <s> in a debate not long ago i pointed out that there are over million workers who work part time <e> <s> they work part time voluntarily because of strong interests elsewhere mainly for family reasons <e> <s> someone in the family may be disabled or perhaps there is an elderly relative <e> <s> to these part time workers it is vitally important that their hours of work should not change without serious consideration <e> <s> these million people who are not unionised must be given particular attention <e> <s> few of them have anyone officially supporting them <e> <s> i support the amendment strongly <e>", "<cs> my lords my problem in making a speech appropriate to a second reading is that we are now living in an entirely different world from that which existed when the present social security system was devised <e> <s> the main weight of the problem is no longer principally in alleviating the special needs of the disabled the handicapped the old and very young or even those who are in difficulties from unexpected or temporary unemployment <e> <s> although these people are as numerous as ever they fall into insignificance compared with the mass of unemployed who through no fault of their own and having no physical or mental disabilities find themselves among the poorest in the land <e> <s> a majority of these are first-class workmen <e> <s> many have considerable skills acquired over many years which through structural or technical change have become obsolete <e>", "<cs> i added my name to this amendment because i have seen recently such an enormous expenditure on advertising by british gas on television and elsewhere <e> <s> the public gas supplier will be in a rather difficult position if in order to maximise profits it has to say use our gas but not too much <e> <s> this amendment will perhaps balance the arguments that we are making so strongly about economy in energy <e> <s> it does no harm and calls to the attention of everybody that efficiency must be borne in mind all the time <e>", "<cs> i wish to intervene with a very few words <e> <s> i cannot believe that the government in their new plans really meant for these few people to slip through the net of care <e> <s> to me it is quite astonishing if that were so particularly if it were for purely administrative reasons <e> <s> it seems to go right against the whole policy of community care <e> <s> i strongly support this amendment <e>", "<cs> like everybody else i am immensely grateful to hear the news of the change in policy of paying cash direct to the wife <e> <s> this is absolutely splendid <e> <s> it will save me a lot of emotion in various speeches that i was proposing to make later on <e> <s> but i am still worried about what happens on the ground <e> <s> does the mother give the child on monday morning to take into school for the weeks food or p a day or how is it to be done <e> <s> can a young child be relied on to hand it over to the school will the child buy jelly babies and chips on the way or possibly spend it on some other amusement <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness agrees with me may i first say how much i disagree with i must call him my old friend who is a typical chancellor of the exchequer <e> <s> i wish to make it absolutely clear that i have not asked in real terms for one more penny <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed in that reply though there was a glimpse of light in it at one stage when the noble baroness said that the government intended to continue with child benefit <e> <s> i have with me sheets of ammunition which we do not have time to go into tonight and so i think i shall have to bring this matter back again on another occasion <e> <s> in the meantime i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief <e> <s> i do not think there is any point in talking about the evils of south africa and its present regime <e> <s> everyone on all sides of the house understands and agrees on that <e> <s> however before this debate ends we should mention something about the influence of the private sector <e> <s> although many improvements have taken place in the status of black south africans they are not appearing quickly enough to satisfy everyone <e>", "<cs> my lords may i point out what i think is a mistake in what the noble baroness has just said <e> <s> all we are asking is to have a two-year period in which it is maintained so that we can see whether or not what the noble baroness says is true whether the family credit system works <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally i am very disappointed <e> <s> we have had a fairly gentle debate in <e>", "<cs> my lords while the carrier pigeons are still at work perhaps i might add a few words to those of the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs <e> <s> the government have shown that they are very willing to see that school meals are provided particularly in the holiday season and right throughout the year and it seems to me that if they put that importance and that weight on school meals they ought probably to agree to this amendment <e> <s> i beg to support it <e>", "<cs> i should like to make a very brief intervention on this amendment because i have been in the city for a very long time and i believe that the <e>", "<cs> as president of age concern a position i have held for years i feel i must add my voice in support of this amendment <e> <s> of course a great many old people would want to buy <e> <s> in five years time they could make a handsome tax-free profit to pass on to the next generation <e> <s> of course they will want to do it <e> <s> but very few people in the committee seem to have thought about the landlord <e> <s> he she or whoever it may be has put in considerable effort to modify the property and to make it comfortable and suitable for old people and i think they would be bitterly disappointed and shattered to find that after all that effort even though it has not necessarily cost vast sums of money the property was no longer going to be available for old people <e>", "<cs> i think this must be the most complicated and comprehensive debate ever initiated by a select committee and i am glad i do not have to make comments at this stage <e> <s> we have discussed everything from higher education to dangerous teddy-bears and i think that is enough <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not agree that all that has been said recently shows the enormous need for rented accommodation <e> <s> is it not time that the housing corporation was topped up again so that the housing associations may continue to make a major contribution towards curing this tragic situation <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the fact that the building societies seem to feel that they have a divine right to meet any requirement whatever to lend for house purchase and the fact that now if they have no deposits they are allowed to dip into the market are major causes of the inflation in house prices <e> <s> does he also agree that the fact that they now use the money market is probably one of the causes of high interest rates <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not keep your lordships long but i was a very strong supporter of your lordships amendment when it was passed at an earlier stage <e> <s> i have not had a great deal of time and nor has anyone else to consider the lords amendment <e> <s> however today i have once more been able to get in touch with age concern of which i am president <e> <s> i had a talk with the director and i return to what i said before that this lords amendment is the right one <e>", "<cs> my lords i was particularly glad to hear the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe speak about the north <e> <s> i spent nearly years of my working life in the north starting in in sheffield where i worked until the war <e> <s> at the time i went there one in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that the noble lord lord harris of high cross introduced this particular subject because i believe that bad government policy in rent restriction and in housing policy generally since the war has done as much damage to the social structure of this country as any other actions that have been taken <e> <s> i do not believe that noble lords will disagree that now there is an enormous need for rented accommodation <e> <s> anything that can be done to remedy the situation is desirable and must be looked at very carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords when i read the words of the motion i had a feeling that the noble lord lord mccarthy was going to make a speech which perhaps might be more suitable for a party political broadcast <e> <s> listening to him for minutes i knew i was right <e> <s> i shall try to be as objective as possible <e> <s> it is just as well that there are three cross-benchers speaking <e> <s> we have the misfortune of having to make up our own minds <e> <s> it is hard work at times but your lordships will never hear us on these benches start by saying we believe <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am coming to that later in my speech which will not be long <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is very simple <e> <s> in fact all countries managed to recover after the hike by fairly massive methods <e> <s> unemployment was going down everywhere including germany and here but the hike which as i said was absolutely drastic had to work through <e> <s> it did not come in the next morning it worked through and in fact months to two years later every country was in the same boat <e>", "<cs> my lords i make no apology for speaking once more about housing <e> <s> i do not propose to go into any details of facts and figures because that has been done <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a comparatively short report and i strongly recommend anyone who has not done so to read it <e> <s> it gives a fairly clear explanation of how the commission got into this state and the recommendations seem to me not only sensible but much in line with government thinking <e> <s> there is one point that i ought to make right at the start <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this is a very appropriate day on which to ask the government the questions we are asking tonight <e> <s> the report has not been out very long and i have read it with great interest <e> <s> i believe that it is a very valuable document indeed <e> <s> i was very relieved when i reached the last page to find that the financial requests and suggestions it makes are very modest <e> <s> it is not an extravagant recommendation at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not rising quite as quickly as i should have done <e> <s> my excuse for speaking at all in this debate which is overcrowded is that not so long ago i was invited by sir charles troughton who was then chairman of the british council to enquire over a period of about months into the administration and affairs of the british council with a view to increasing its efficiency decreasing the cost of administration and generally perhaps to get more value for money <e> <s> in those months i was able to get a very close insight into the working of the british council <e> <s> i say straight away that i came away thoroughly convinced of the value of what it was doing not only for britain but for many other countries overseas as well <e> <s> that is a point that we should be proud of <e> <s> we should not look askance at the money we spend on the well-being of other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords time is very short so i shall omit the courtesies and not repeat any of the figures that have been given today <e> <s> they are well known <e> <s> they are horrific <e> <s> they have been known for so long that i am surprised that such a debate is necessary <e> <s> the government should have taken crisis action quite a long time ago <e> <s> i also believe that in addition to the horrific figures that we have been given there are a great number of people for whom the government do not acknowledge that they have any responsibility the people one finds sleeping in cardboard boxes when one goes home on the underground those sleeping in the backs of cars and <e>", "<cs> my lords would i be right in thinking that this fund is very similar to the family fund that has been operated for about years by a charitable organisation <e> <s> it has a very similar amount of money and has been a complete success <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether it would be of any use if i said a few words about the <e>", "<cs> my lords that was not normally its job but some things go on for quite a long time for example before the mobility allowance came in we had to provide for the cost of taxis and transport for a regular weekly visit or something of that nature before we started buying cars which was cheaper <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of what the noble lord lord banks said my name does in fact appear on the marshalled list <e> <s> i was unfortunately unable to speak in committee as i was abroad and i am today speaking on behalf of the noble baroness lady faithfull who had to leave the chamber for an important engagement <e> <s> i should say that i have pursued the matter for some considerable time but i still feel rather bitter in view of the statement made by mr john major during the pre-election period when he said most clearly <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i just ask him in view of what he has just said whether he is proposing to abolish the married womans allowance <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has not succeeded in convincing me of his argument <e> <s> i consider that the issue is far wider than he believes it to be <e> <s> the nation is in danger and the commitment undertaken by these people is one which we cannot afford to lose and which we must keep <e> <s> i am afraid that i must press my amendment to a division <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> the word irreversible has been used a great many times today and i do not see the logic of it <e> <s> if one can opt out then one must be allowed to opt back <e>", "<cs> i have put my name down to this amendment because i was fortunate enough with the noble baroness lady faithfull to have quite a long interview with a teacher in a secondary school who had carried out quite a lot of research on this matter <e> <s> the teacher had found about regular truants to play ball and give her a great deal of information <e> <s> it transpired that there was at any one time about per cent <e> <s> absenteeism in that school <e> <s> at another school nearby the figure was i believe per cent <e> <s> that makes a nonsense as the noble baroness lady young said of the curriculum <e> <s> those children will miss out <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make just one comment <e> <s> a lot of people blame the teachers <e> <s> it so happens that in the school about which we have been talking in which absenteeism from the french course was particularly high the teacher i spoke to said that the teacher involved was one of the best french <e>", "<cs> my lords my family has been connected with rowntree for several generations <e> <s> noble lords may therefore be surprised to hear perhaps that i entirely agree with what the minister has just said <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister consider making some small amendment to the financial services act so that in the event of a hostile bid and i mean a hostile bid the fund managers would have to refer to their board before selling their shares or accepting the bid <e> <s> that would at least slow down to a certain extent unsatisfactory dawn raids and such activities <e> <s> the same would apply to the fund managers of trusts who would have to refer to their trustees <e> <s> i also think that before decisions are taken consultations should take place with the directors of the company under attack <e>", "<cs> such consultations would not in any way interfere with the shareholders rights to sell and it seems to me that it would give considerable satisfaction to people to know that there is at least some chance of the long view being taken rather than the short one <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment for two reasons <e> <s> first throughout the whole of the bill i do not believe that enough consideration has been given to people with special needs <e> <s> secondly the previous amendments that we have been talking about and which have been turned down show that there will be very little flexibility so far as i can make out in selecting school numbers <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment for the simple reason that i believe it to be entirely illogical for schools to opt out but never be able to opt back <e> <s> it may be that five years is not the right period and that it should be longer but it is illogical once a school has opted out for it not to have the right to opt back <e>", "<cs> my lords i put my name down to speak to this amendment because i have done a certain amount of research first with the school which the noble baroness lady faithfull mentioned and also with a certain professor at southampton university <e> <s> it is perfectly clear to me looking at it not so much from the education side but from my experience in the social services that something has to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment for a reason that has not been given by the noble lord lord graham <e> <s> he usually turns over every stone but i believe he has missed one <e> <s> the importance of this amendment is that those who pay only per cent <e> <s> will be recompensed not from the local authority but from the social security system based on per cent <e> <s> of the national average <e> <s> that means that in our old friend camden the poor people will be short which they cannot pay <e> <s> in the deprived areas where the needs are greatest and there are large numbers of poor they will be severely taxed whereas in the more prosperous areas they will make a profit <e> <s> that seems to me to be not only unfair but absolute nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down i should like to ask him whether he realises what the situation will be in camden <e> <s> approximately per cent <e> <s> of those people in receipt of social benefit will have to pay more than if it were based on the local charge <e> <s> they are not paying the local charge but a charge which is connected with an average across the nation and over which they have no say at all <e>", "<cs> my lords having been a chief executive i must say that if someone had told me that i had no authority over one of my junior officers i should have been absolutely furious <e> <s> i think that this amendment is absolutely right <e> <s> i hope very much that it will be agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords you probably all remember the story of the irishman who came up before the beak and said mlud before i speak may i say something <e> <s> i should like to say that having listened to the noble baroness lady fisher i was very impressed and minded of what she said when speaking about homes we are not talking about bricks and mortar or houses even <e> <s> i also remember that sonic time ago we used to speak about accommodation units <e> <s> that so infuriated winston churchill in another place that he burst into song and said <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to understand from what the minister has just said that interest rates are the only weapon that the government have to control inflation <e>", "<cs> this is an interesting amendment <e> <s> i have had the same experience <e> <s> i was turned out of my accommodation because of the danger from asbestos and all the floors had to be taken up <e> <s> however i had a right of re-entry <e> <s> perhaps the amendment is not absolutely correct and the noble earl might consider whether an amendment is required to give a right of return when the necessary work is completed <e>", "<cs> i strongly support the amendment <e> <s> in view of what the noble baroness lady faithfull has said and the fact that the consultative document has now been issued it may be better to hear what the minister says before considering whether it is worth pressing the matter tonight <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness replies i should like to add that i believe the whole situation relating to bed and breakfast accommodation and the condition of the houses in london in particular is so serious that i hope it will not be said that an amendment will not be put forward at a later stage <e> <s> we must do something rather than wait for a year or two years <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the amendment <e> <s> it is the result of long conversations which we have had with the national federation of housing associations and it seems to me that it is in accordance with that which the government want <e> <s> it is more in the nature of a tidying-up amendment than anything else <e> <s> otherwise there is nothing fundamental about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey has covered the subject very well but there are certain points that i wish to emphasise strongly <e> <s> the first is that the housing association movement is not part of the private sector and it is not part of the public sector though it is largely supported by government funds <e> <s> it is an entirely different animal <e> <s> its objectives have always been clear to provide affordable rents for those people on low incomes in good quality housing at no profit <e>", "<cs> my lords once again this is an attempt to drag the housing association movement into the private sector <e> <s> it is bound to increase rents <e> <s> as i understand it even with housing benefit certain people now covered by housing associations will pay over per cent <e> <s> of their income in rent <e> <s> that does not make any sense at all to me <e> <s> housing associations are to provide affordable rents and we must stick to that principle <e> <s> i think that something like per cent <e> <s> of income might be an acceptable figure but per cent <e> <s> is not <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter i am sure unintentionally is completely misleading the house <e> <s> there is no question of voting again <e> <s> it is simply that the choice given to every other tenant to stay put is extended to those who did not vote <e>", "<cs> that is not so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i am unconvinced by the arguments of the government <e> <s> there is a principle here which i still cannot stomach <e> <s> i propose to divide the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i remember the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor saying on th november that this bill <e>", "<cs> i am most impressed by the remarks of the noble baroness lady david as regards prevention <e> <s> i think that we must concentrate as much on that aspect as we do on cure <e> <s> when one considers clause a which reads <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady david has made the case for this amendment extremely clearly as she always does <e> <s> obviously i shall not again go into all the details which she has covered so well <e> <s> however it seems to me that the intentions of the government as regards corporal punishment are already determined as is evidenced by the education act to which the noble baroness has referred which abolished corporal punishment in state-supported schools and i understand is committed to banning it in most child care institutions <e>", "<cs> i wish to add that the issue of a court order is a very traumatic experience not only for a child but for the whole family <e> <s> it is traumatic also for brothers sisters and parents <e> <s> to my mind it is so serious that we cannot stress too strongly somewhere in the bill that full inquiries must be made before action is taken <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to express my admiration of the way in which our chairman the noble lord lord kearton conducted our examination and inquiry <e> <s> he sometimes went at a great speed which left us somewhat breathless but i am sure that all members of the committee are most grateful for the way he conducted the meeting and for the report he produced <e>", "<cs> i shall not speak for long i never do but i think i have the authority to speak on this matter <e> <s> in nearly years ago i was a founder member of the national institute for social work concerned with training <e> <s> this was formed as a result of the younghusband report <e> <s> there was a massive report on social work training showing the inadequacies of the work at the time <e>", "<cs> this amendment has caused the most extraordinary interest rather surprisingly so in the media <e> <s> i thought that perhaps we would have the television cameras on but they seem to have been switched off just in time <e> <s> i have had private correspondence as has the noble baroness lady elliot and no doubt other members of this committee and i describe some of the letters as coming from enthusiastic whackers <e> <s> there is clearly a misunderstanding of the interpretation but they show what a strong belief still exists in the beneficial results of corporal punishment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there are two sides to the question <e> <s> as has just been said under present regulations corporal punishment is to be banned in community homes <e> <s> it therefore seems quite illogical for the ban not to be extended to foster homes as well <e> <s> if the regulations were extended as they may well be to all children in care they would cover children in foster homes who would still be in local authority care <e> <s> meanwhile foster parents have not been prohibited from using corporal punishment <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not wish to speak again <e> <s> i just wish to say that to my mind all that we are putting forward is government policy <e> <s> we are simply extending it to a logical conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not need to make a long speech having heard the very clear way in which the principles were expressed by the noble lords lord campbell of alloway and lord mishcon <e> <s> i believe that everybody in this house agrees that the independence of the guardian ad litem is an essential part of the children bill <e> <s> i should like to concentrate on one aspect namely the question of finance <e> <s> i believe that unless it is properly financed there is no hope that we shall get this off the ground <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may add one more remark about finance <e> <s> the report by the british association of social workers said that the lack of specific financing more or less ensured the patchy nature of the whole service <e> <s> now that there is strong pressure on local government to spend less this may be one of the vulnerable sources for saving money <e>", "<cs> my lords my name does not appear against the amendment although it appeared against a previous one <e> <s> for what it is worth i should like to make it clear that i still strongly support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support those remarks <e> <s> i was for some time chairman of barclays bank dco <e> <s> no doubt the noble lord lord williams <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak to this amendment because it is very similar to one which was tabled in my name about eight years ago <e> <s> that amendment was welcomed by all sides of the chamber especially by the noble lords lord boyd-carpenter and lord mishcon <e> <s> it seemed to me that if those two noble lords agreed then it was a jolly good amendment <e> <s> however the amendment was not accepted <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate said at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage of the debate most of the points which i planned to make have already been made so i shall be brief <e> <s> personally i have no particularly close knowledge of the nhs so i propose to make my remarks from the point of view of the personal social services about which i know a little <e>", "<cs> my lords i find that at this stage of the debate almost all the points i wished to make have already been made <e> <s> i shall be brief and make only two points <e> <s> first a number of speeches have been made outside your lordships house about fraud and other matters <e> <s> they give the impression that the commission is staffed by many bureaucratic pen-pushers earning tax-free salaries with expense accounts doing little and winking at fraud <e> <s> my experience is entirely different <e> <s> i visited brussels before i retired from business and i have visited it several times as a member of the select committee <e> <s> my impression of people working in the commission is very different and i wish that fact to be made more public <e> <s> they work extremely hard and are committed to trying to make work what some people call an impossible system <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has just said that under the children bill local authorities have a duty to provide pre-school teaching or to make other arrangements for children in need <e> <s> how does one define need for a four year-old child and how does one discover it <e>", "<cs> my lords i must declare an interest as president of age concern <e> <s> i consider the principles behind the bill to be very good indeed <e> <s> i shall not go into the details because i am quite certain that if the bill comes to committee it will need considerable amendment <e> <s> however i believe that the general principles are absolutely right and should be given considerable attention <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl replies perhaps i may ask him one question <e> <s> if the order is approved today and there is a debate in the comparatively near future which shows that without any doubt the house is in favour of making changes are we tied to or could we make the changes before then if they are considered important <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike the last two speakers i find quite a great deal to praise in this bill <e> <s> there is one matter that i find very disappointing indeed that is the take-up of the social security system benefits <e> <s> i well remember years ago when i was appointed chairman of a committee looking at the social services as opposed to financial services and social security <e> <s> we were told early on that if we wanted a successful and effective social service three factors had to be put right <e>", "<cs> i think that we are all now convinced after what we have heard that there is no doubt that families with children are financially considerably worse off than those who have no children <e> <s> we cannot escape from that fact <e> <s> however by removing tax benefits under the provisions of the act we relied from then on on child <e>", "<cs> i do not even need to argue about that <e> <s> i believe that i have made the case and i do not need to say a great deal more <e> <s> it is absolutely tragic that one of the best bills in the past for family life and children in this country will be overturned for reasons which i cannot understand <e> <s> i hope that everyone will support the amendments <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i put one point to him <e> <s> he said that the new clause would not help child benefit at all because the total would come down <e> <s> what he should have said i suggest is that the whole package would not alter <e> <s> certainly the child benefit would increase and that goes to the mother <e> <s> the problem about these families is budgeting and she will get these payments <e> <s> that is terribly important <e>", "<cs> i agree entirely that one has to be responsible in matters of unemployment and the working of the system <e> <s> i support the three amendments because unemployment is a horrible thing <e> <s> as far as possible the system must try to preserve a human face <e> <s> that is all the amendments seek to do <e> <s> they do not make any great changes but seek to make the system a little more human <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> the real problem behind it is housing <e> <s> for the young people about whom we are talking there should be hostel accommodation similar to student accommodation at universities and such places <e> <s> once that happens an amendment of this nature would be unnecessary <e> <s> given the desperate shortage of housing that now exists there is no alternative to doing precisely what the amendment suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief <e> <s> i speak in my capacity as president of age concern <e> <s> the announcement that we have heard today comes as a very great relief to me and i am sure to all my colleagues in age concern <e> <s> my main worry is whether we shall have sufficient funds to undertake all the training and retraining that will be necessary as well as the other facilities that will be required in setting up this new system <e> <s> i think that that will be very important <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to add little to what i said last time <e> <s> the problem is mainly one of housing <e> <s> with the best will in the world it cannot be cured within three or four years even if the government were to have an advanced building programme <e> <s> what are the people to do during that time if they have no money for food <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment strongly <e> <s> no doubt noble lords will recollect that the government white paper entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords i too congratulate the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale on presenting the report so clearly and well <e> <s> my own comments which will be brief are from the point of view of someone who has had to operate pension schemes in the past rather than someone on sub-committee c of the select committee <e>", "<cs> in view of what the minister said earlier and just now i feel it is not appropriate to divide the committee <e> <s> i was rather sorry that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter spoke as if i had known he intended to speak i should have given some more figures and statistics and made a longer speech <e> <s> there are figures for instance which show that about per cent <e> <s> of those who are entitled to apply at present for house repair grants do not do so <e> <s> thirty per cent <e> <s> of those aged over who are entitled to the grant do not apply for it <e> <s> such people may not be disabled but they are in a different category <e> <s> that category does not stop at the age of <e> <s> we are not just talking about people who are years old but about a whole range of people from to <e> <s> i believe my case is much stronger than i made out at the outset <e>", "<cs> i shall do so <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that during the next decade there will be a great shortage of skilled labour and that we want people to retire later rather than earlier <e> <s> any legislation that will hinder that aim would seem to be very harmful to the general economy <e>", "<cs> my lords the position of voluntary bodies within local authorities is important and will become even more important if this bill is implemented <e> <s> to my mind it is essential that the proposals in the amendment should be on the face of the bill <e> <s> this aspect is now a vital part of local authorities <e> <s> it is essential that the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord hayter should be accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that reply <e> <s> it is not quite what i had hoped for but on the other hand it is promising that we should get something to help these old people <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage of the debate when so many aspects have been fully covered i shall confine my remarks to the subject of young children <e> <s> to some extent i shall be following upon what was said by the noble baroness lady faithfull in making an interesting proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late stage of the debate i shall miss out the compliments although had i made them they would have been just as <e>", "<cs> my lords i also apologise for not having put my name down on the list of speakers in time <e> <s> i shall be very brief <e> <s> when i heard about this motion i spoke to my neighbour who has a schizophrenic son <e> <s> she said that she would consult her son and ask what he thought of the proposal that compulsory admission should be available in the interests of the health of the schizophrenic on the application of a relation or doctor <e> <s> he was in complete agreement that it should be clear that that was the right thing to do <e> <s> he admitted that he had discharged himself from hospital before he should have done <e> <s> this is anecdotal but he confirmed that a friend of his in the same situation agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords we have at last reached the stage of discussing community care <e> <s> the doctors who have spoken thus far have virtually ignored the subject <e> <s> indeed so far as i know there has been no reference whatever to parts iii and iv although it is possible that the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes may have mentioned them <e> <s> i was most interested in two speeches which touched upon the subject <e> <s> one was the very moving speech made by the noble baroness lady ryder <e> <s> however most of her speech concentrated on social security and not on the nhs or community care which are the subjects of the bill <e> <s> nevertheless she mentioned another matter to which i shall return later <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the treasury solicitor in his evidence to the committee pointed out that the amount of the penalties was entirely a matter for the members themselves to decide <e> <s> they were in many cases so small that they could not possibly cover the cost of prosecution <e> <s> that seems most unsatisfactory and i wonder whether the situation has changed <e> <s> from the evidence we received certain countries have undoubtedly kept those penalties low in order not to interfere with farmers <e> <s> will the minister say whether any approach has been made through diplomatic circles to put those extraordinary matters right <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord carter has put the matter very fairly <e> <s> i wish to make a few comments as general points quite apart from this particular amendment <e> <s> none of the amendments that carry my name and practically none of those in the names of other members of the committee is intended to knock the bill <e> <s> this bill represents probably the finest and biggest move forward for social care that we have seen in all the years during which i have been involved with social problems <e> <s> therefore it is absolutely vital that these provisions are carried out <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that the noble lord lord jenkin of roding understands how this scheme will work <e> <s> the secretary of state made a statement quite recently to the effect that the first task of every local authority will be to make a review of all the existing services in its area <e> <s> the plan then has to include what extra services are required <e> <s> that will involve a fairly straightforward assessment of the additional costs that have to be met <e> <s> after talking to local authorities the secretary of states answer will be the state is behind you in meeting this additional finance <e> <s> that is all that is involved <e> <s> unless the secretary of state gives that kind of answer no responsible local authority will begin putting these packages into effect <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has not answered my first point on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it was a question about the relationship between the health and social services <e> <s> it is a very dicey issue <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> stands entirely on its own quite apart from who will pay and who goes where <e> <s> has the noble baroness given that thought <e>", "<cs> in that case before i take counsels advice on the long statement i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak to amendment no <e> <s> za which is grouped with that standing in the name of my noble friend lord allen <e> <s> i am at a great disadvantage because i have never been a permanent <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i must confess that i am vice-president of the association of county councils which is doing an enormous amount of work in co-ordinating the views of the various local authorities <e> <s> it has a wealth of information which i think should be tapped <e>", "<cs> before i decide what action to take on this amendment perhaps the noble baroness will give an assurance that there will be something like this written on the face of the bill whether that is by an amendment brought in by the government or by acceptance of a similar amendment at a later stage <e> <s> without that i do not believe that the committee will be satisfied <e>", "<cs> i am not satisfied and i feel that i must ask the committee to express an opinion <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness replies i should like to make a suggestion <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord mottistone and myself could get together and produce another amendment which may be tabled on report <e> <s> however we would of course submit it before that time to the minister to see whether it meets with her approval <e> <s> i make that suggestion on the assumption that the spirit of what <e>", "<cs> i feel that what we have heard is not quite sufficient <e> <s> the local authority knows nothing about it <e> <s> these people either discharge themselves and walk out of hospital or they are discharged by the hospital without reference to the local authority because it may think that they do not need care and it pushes them out <e>", "<cs> i shall not divide the committee at minutes to oclock <e> <s> on the other hand it is important that the housing problem should be raised whenever possible in the bill <e> <s> it has been raised only once so far <e> <s> we shall want to look at the matter again <e> <s> in the meantime i beg to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> do i understand from the ministers reply that the guidance if guidance is the right word will contain rules that the outcome of such assessments will be given in writing <e> <s> can i take it that there will definitely be guidance in this respect <e>", "<cs> in the circumstances i think that i should beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i was interested to hear the comments of the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> in the world in which i earn my living there are always internal and external auditors <e> <s> it is right and proper that there should be an external body in this case so that it can make a general supervision of community care in the country as a whole <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to prolong the matter any longer <e> <s> i am sorry to make the minister get up sit down and get up again <e> <s> i have discussed this matter with my local authority <e> <s> the director of social services is worried about the small homes <e> <s> the bill allows him to inspect only where the services are provided by the local authority <e> <s> the small commercial homes are not provided by the local authority and so do not come under the bill <e> <s> that is the trouble <e> <s> there must a completely new approach to get this matter right <e>", "<cs> i must say that i was glad to hear what the minister said <e> <s> it is clear that apart from tower hamlets some other local authorities are in breach of the act which clearly states <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord was not here when i spoke <e> <s> i ask him a direct question <e> <s> if the noble lord had not preferred child benefit and had left it as a tax allowance would he be reducing that benefit now until it withers away <e>", "<cs> i get awfully tired of a long-playing record which is as scratched as the one i have heard today <e> <s> none of the arguments is new and half of them are fallacious <e> <s> we are not asking for any increase in the proportion of child benefit to gnp <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter spoke as if we were seeking to increase only one side of the expenditure and were not looking at the increase on the other side <e> <s> i do not propose to continue arguing about it <e> <s> we have had it over and over again <e> <s> i am completely unconvinced <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord the leader of the house takes the view that he does <e> <s> i sympathise in many ways <e> <s> i know that he has a difficult task and that he will have a very difficult one if i divide the committe on the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should point out that in industry nowadays for security and other reasons more and more salaries are paid monthly in arrears <e> <s> one sometimes has a long wait after starting a job before one is paid <e> <s> i should point out quite independently of what the noble lord lord jenkin said that there is a general tendency now for rent to be paid in advance <e> <s> if one has to wait a month for ones salary that is rather a long wait <e> <s> this amendment is only a permissive amendment <e> <s> it does not mean that grants will necessarily be given in a great number of cases <e> <s> however i think grants should be permissible in view of the great change in the way that salaries are paid <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no answer to that <e> <s> i must say that i am not only disappointed at the reply from the government benches i am horrified and for a number of reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to divide the house on the amendment tonight <e> <s> i hope that the information which i gave on the strange effect between the department of the environment and the department of health has not been overlooked <e> <s> i doubt whether the departments ever communicate with each other <e> <s> that is what is so disturbing <e> <s> they cannot possibly have realised the situation that they were creating at county level by divorcing housing from social services <e> <s> that was quite absurd <e>", "<cs> my lords i find that a very airy-fairy explanation of why the amendment should not be accepted <e> <s> i believe that it is important for the amendment to be included on the face of the bill for another reason <e> <s> we shall come to amendment no <e> <s> b which is about complaints <e> <s> very often the complaints are that there has not been proper <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposal here was in the nature of a probing amendment <e> <s> it is very important that there is some form of appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords when i brought forward amendment no <e> <s> a about complaints we were persuaded by the noble lord lord henley that there was sufficient provision for complaints without any additions in the bill <e> <s> this amendment drives a horse and cart right through that statement <e> <s> in the bill as it now stands clause section b states <e>", "<cs> my lords this is another instance where these responsibilities could be included on the face of the bill <e> <s> directions are all very well but clarification of the act is necessary because of the concern of the directors <e> <s> if the position was clear they would not be so concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i strongly support the amendment because by chance i spent a full day last wednesday at a seminar on community care <e> <s> there was a lady speaker on the platform who spoke from her wheelchair <e> <s> she spoke about case management and said the first thing i want to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not only the mover but also the inspirer of this amendment <e> <s> after more than years in the housing field i realise that housing is the basic infrastructure for welfare <e> <s> i talked this over with the ama which combines both the social services departments and housing authorities <e> <s> it was enthusiastic about the proposal <e> <s> the ama wants it <e> <s> it seems rather strange that it should not be allowed to have it if it is the body concerned with this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down there is nothing in my amendment about consulting <e> <s> my amendment requires that such provision should be part of a plan <e> <s> there are a number of draft guidelines about what plans should contain <e> <s> this is one extra element that plans must have <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not delay the house but merely ask for one figure <e> <s> i take into account the welcome increase in child benefit for the first child <e> <s> it will be interesting to know how much less in real terms families as a whole will be able to spend on their children <e> <s> i reckon that the figure is between million and million <e> <s> i believe that in real terms we are now allowing families to spend far less on their children than last year <e> <s> can the minister confirm that figure <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord aldington will forgive me i shall keep my compliments short in view of the lateness of the hour <e> <s> nevertheless they are very sincere <e> <s> it must be over years ago when i was employed in the international money business that i and my colleagues came to the conclusion that a common market did not make any sense without a common currency <e> <s> we were very relieved when a few years later great britain joined the common market and was committed to monetary and economic union <e> <s> the problem then as now was how and when to achieve it <e>", "<cs> my lords it has already been pointed out that the question of fraud and negligence there is very little difference between them was <e>"]
