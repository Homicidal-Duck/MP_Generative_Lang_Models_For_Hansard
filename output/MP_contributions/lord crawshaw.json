["<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that there might be a strong case for making stoke mandeville a supra-regional hospital funded directly by the dhss <e> <s> might the fact that his right honourable friend the <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words in support of the noble lord lord banks because for the people that this amendment concerns living costs do rise and earning capacity decreases <e> <s> you do not have to be a senior wrangler to work <e>", "<cs> my lords i detect a strong sense of reunion this evening in our debate on the international year of disabled people <e> <s> over the years i have had good reason to congratulate my noble friend who started the debate for her performances on our behalf and on behalf of many other people but this evening i am bound to say that my first impression and reaction is to congratulate her on her remarkable stamina having been in this chamber now for nearly seven hours and looking like being here a little longer <e> <s> i feel that it is entirely right for your lordships to debate this subject because of the political element inherent in physical and mental handicap <e> <s> and that is a theme to which i will return in a moment <e> <s> i believe that there is more direct experience of these matters here than in any other political assembly in the world <e>", "<cs> the argument is almost complete but i feel i must say a few words in support of my noble friends over these amendments <e> <s> first may i say how pleased i am that my old friend lord mansfield is answering for the government <e> <s> he may or may not <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be read a second time <e> <s> last wednesday i was one of people who were fortunate enough to be on epsom downs to see a superb english racehorse win the most famous flat race in the world <e> <s> the sight of the son of one of this countrys best sires giving a display in front of probably the largest gathering of people on earth was reassuring in these otherwise doubtful days <e> <s> i am concerned that this scene and many others like it up and down the country although smaller in many cases should be repeated for tens and hundreds of years all over the land <e> <s> i believe that this small bill before us today will help to enhance all aspects of the sport and industry of horseracing and i strongly commend it to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords it only remains for me to thank your lordships for the two things for which i really asked one was support and the other was speed <e> <s> i have managed to receive both and i am grateful for them <e> <s> i should like to thank my noble friend lord belstead speaking on behalf of the government for his support and for his explanation of the bill which was probably more lucid than my own <e> <s> i was grateful for his views about bringing any <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief because your lordships have heard quite enough from me today <e> <s> i must say a few brief words in support of my noble friend and her bill <e> <s> a close study of the form will reveal that my mind is more full of the odds against horses than against wheelchairs <e> <s> nevertheless i am something of a practical expert in obstacles against wheelchairs <e> <s> therefore i must say a few words about it <e> <s> i have been following closely and took part in the debate on the committee stage of the local government miscellaneous provisions scotland bill and therefore i have followed closely the development of this bill in conjunction with that bill <e> <s> it is my hope that neither of these bills will fall <e> <s> as much as i welcome this particular bill if it is in order now to say so i particularly welcome what the government intend to put into it as an amendment <e> <s> it is my belief that to bring the planning laws into the subject of the disabled needs is a great step forward and one which could be used in several instances <e> <s> i look forward to hearing what the noble baroness lady young will have to say on this <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> it might be helpful if i were to comment briefly at this stage <e> <s> i wish at the outset to thank the committee for the general support that has been given to the bill and i understand that noble lords are intending to continue that support <e> <s> i thank my noble friend lord sandys for his valuable contribution and i am delighted to see the noble lord lord wigg well enough to take part in our debates and i know that a lot of what he says is derived from great experience of racing and i assure him i appreciate that <e>", "<cs> i would certainly support as much resources as possible being made available for racing <e> <s> i know perfectly well <e>", "<cs> as i say i certainly support what resources can be made available because i know perfectly well what could be used by the racing industry particularly as the noble lord lord wigg himself mentioned aintree <e> <s> that is a perfect example of where greater resources could be used <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e> <s> this is not the occasion for a long speech or indeed to repeat what i said on the bill on second reading <e> <s> but i thought that it would be appropriate to thank your lordships for the general support which you have given the bill which although small will do something to enhance the sport and industry of racing which certainly in certain quarters is hard pressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to keep the house long but i thought it might be useful if i raised a local voice at this stage to stress one or two aspects of the bill <e> <s> i hope that i have the great honour <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to say a few words in support of my noble friend lord henley who so ably moved this bill and of the bill itself <e> <s> first of all i am extremely pleased to see that the local council the epsom council and the racing authorities are in pretty well total agreement over this bill because i think that augurs very well for the future of racing and training at epsom <e> <s> as i understand it in point of fact all this bill is doing is to put on to the statute book practices which are going on at present <e> <s> we have had many instances of this sort of thing in the past we had one last summer on the bill to do with bookmakers contributions simply to put what is a current practice on to the statute book <e> <s> that is how i understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that his encouraging and enlightened response will be of enormous help to thousands of people outside military circles who so often look to the armed forces <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> in so doing i wish briefly to explain why it is that i am forgoing the delights of your lordships restaurant at this hour to introduce this modest bill this evening <e> <s> in spite of the fact that this is the second time in two or three years that i have introduced a bill on roughly the same subject i do not altogether wish to give the impression that i am a compulsive and inveterate gambler on horses or any other appropriate and available medium for a bet <e> <s> nor do i wish to encourage others to indulge in this exercise beyond reasonable bounds <e>", "<cs> my lords it remains for me to thank all noble lords who have spoken in this debate for their interest in the subject <e> <s> the bill has had something of a mixed reception but nevertheless it has been an interesting debate <e> <s> i can only hope that the speech of my noble friend lord elton will have reassured those who think rather like the noble lord lord airedale because i accept that the bill does put quite a lot on the home secretarys plate <e> <s> i also hope that my noble friend reassured the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my solution would be a plc but that does not seem possible at the moment <e> <s> this amendment has some merit in it <e> <s> i certainly would be prepared to support it and i urge my colleagues to do the same <e> <s> possibly it seems to have more merit because it has so many more attractions than the scheme the government are putting forward <e> <s> i must say that it appals me to think that the company will be comprised of bodies and nothing else <e> <s> there was a time in liverpool when we ran the docks on bodies the welt system in which people went round and hired men day by day <e> <s> this will not be day by day but the fact remains that the governments legislation means that from time to time these people will be taken over or possibly taken over by someone else <e> <s> i cannot for the life of me think that that will result in a settled workforce <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to say a few words to support my noble friend lord wyatt who is always a first-class entertainer as i know from having heard him frequently at functions to do with the tote <e> <s> i am only sorry that there were not more noble lords in the chamber to hear him tonight and in particular no representatives of the churches <e> <s> i thought at teatime that this event might be something of a walkover so i did my best to encourage the noble viscount lord tonypandy to come and speak but i am afraid i was unsuccessful <e>"]
