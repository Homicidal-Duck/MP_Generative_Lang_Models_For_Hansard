["<cs> my lords my noble friend has moved <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a quotation which i have and which i can show to the noble lord if it was about the terms of the quotation that the protest was being made <e> <s> i am saying that if we kill million people in half an hour before they have fired a shot then i personally hope that no young man would be such a damned fool i choose my language carefully as to join the church as by law established but would turn aside and pray for a new pentecost <e> <s> it is because our conjectured million know this that they say we are just not playing whatever the consequences are for ourselves <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may inform the noble earl that i shall finish in precisely one minute <e> <s> however i wonder whether it is his impatience about the time i am taking or about the contents of my speech which have made him rise to his feet <e> <s> these three young idealists decided to put up this money to buy shares so that they could go to protest against money being used for <e>", "<cs> my lords in an opening sentence as sincere as it is short i also should like to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord strauss on his maiden speech <e> <s> as <e>", "<cs> my lords if my purpose was to repeat the invocations and injections which have come from so many places regarding what we ought to do about russia i would not speak at all and let it stand because of the number of people who have spoken in vituperation about the entire russian situation <e> <s> i stand because i agree with the noble lord lord milford and i think i even go further than the noble lord lord milford <e> <s> i should say in passing that i speak in the name of other people <e> <s> i speak in the name of ministers of the church of scotland of laity in the church of scotland of members of the international fellowship of reconciliation of something like members of the society of friends the quakers right across the world <e> <s> i am speaking for at least a million people when i urge two things the first is to stop moralising about russia and the second is to start fraternising by renouncing nuclear weapons now <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to delay the debate for any length of time not being an expert in the subject in which we are involved <e> <s> but it has been my lot for nearly years to spend summers on the little island of iona eight miles long by two miles wide which lies off the coast of mull <e> <s> whenever i am on the island the farmers have livestock for the market <e> <s> the livestock has to be ferried across to oban <e> <s> that means that it has to be put on one ferry for one mile <e> <s> then it has to go miles across mull and then travel for miles by another ferry to oban <e> <s> the livestock has to undertake a -ferry journey before being disposed of in england or abroad which means going over the sea again <e>", "<cs> my lords i would be very tempted at this late hour to withdraw from making a speech even a very short speech were it not for the fact that christian action and also the british council of churches have hoped very much that there would be a debate about this and that it would be the state speaking in terms of what christian action are saying and in terms also of what the british council of churches are saying <e> <s> because they have both of them i think i am safe in saying this come to the conclusion that they must deny the present government in el salvador and that they must make it perfectly clear that they are doing so and that no good can come from attempting further to speak with them <e>", "<cs> my lords were he present my opening words as brief as they are sincere would be to thank the noble lord lord elystan-morgan for his maiden speech and his insight into the essence of the bill and i hope we shall hear him often <e> <s> my main reason for speaking is that i wish to be associated as i do without difficulty with the motion in the name of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> i wish to be associated with it not only in my own behalf but as a minister of the church of scotland and because it is a member of the british council of churches and the british council has spoken about this and because the general assembly of the church of scotland has set up a special committee on this very subject i can almost say that i am speaking in their name also <e> <s> we are all speaking for the obvious reason the dangers between black and white people <e> <s> it is universally desired that in our now small world there should be an end of this real danger a danger which in my view is increasing <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a bill to assist the abolition of pornographic literature and pornographic devices <e> <s> i make no apology for speaking in directly christian terms <e> <s> after all we cannot exist as a house we cannot legislate without a previous obeisance to christ <e> <s> that christ is king of kings lord of lords and the only ruler of princes is part of our constitutional agreement <e> <s> it is in this sense in the light of his teaching that we are to legislate in all things <e> <s> yet we sometimes and i believe increasingly at the present time seem in our legislation to defy even two or three of the ten commandments such as thou shalt not kill thou shalt not covet and thou shalt not commit adultery <e> <s> it is the declension in our common judgement that makes this bill an absolute necessity <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this house will have grasped that i endeavoured to speak in a more proper place before lord mayhew <e>", "<cs> my lords on a point of order is it not in order to make a speech without being on the list provided it is made before the main speakers of which lord mayhew was the first speaker <e> <s> is it not possible for somebody to speak then more particularly when they are going to speak for only two minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a minister of the church of scotland and for the three years and we voted for a multinational solution <e> <s> but last year for the first time we voted not for a multilateral but for a unilateral approach <e> <s> it is in their name that i speak and i do so because it was by votes to votes a margin of that we decided the church would be unilateral <e> <s> i believe that in two or three years this will also be the decision of the church of england in its synod <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first place may i express my appreciation of the promoter of this bill the minister in allowing me to speak although my name is not on the list <e> <s> i shall reward him by speaking only very shortly but i am speaking here mainly because of my interest in the tourist situation <e> <s> i happen to belong to a group of people who in the island of iona are responsible for an abbey and from the end of may to the beginning of september people usually work out that tourists come to the island of iona every week during that period so perhaps i can speak on behalf of the tourist industry and the proposition <e> <s> it is simply to say that on behalf of the tourist industry and on behalf of the tourists who come we very much appreciate this bill <e> <s> we appreciate also the extent to which the authority in england still continues to be concerned and at the moment is prepared to give a grant to scotland and to allow scotland to speak in its own name in this regard <e> <s> i simply rise to say that and i should have preceded it by saying how much i appreciated the speech of the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove and how we hope he will often speak to us again <e>", "<cs> my lords i also intend to be brief <e> <s> i speak as a minister of the church of scotland and on behalf of nearly ministers who have in writing declared themselves unilateralists <e> <s> i am perfectly certain that i also speak in the name of at least an equal number of clergy of the church of england who are in this position <e> <s> thirdly i speak for the literally millions of people who are demonstrating and demonstrating and if one adds all the demonstrations together one realises that millions are demonstrating in this country simply so that the government of our country may make a statement which is definitely our own statement and not just a silent acceptance of what the president of the united states says on all these issues which we know to be terrifyingly more difficult than what is being said by the russians <e>", "<cs> my lords in the time at my disposal i want to say only two things <e> <s> the first is about the challenge of the gospel to all active christians in the nuclear age and the second is about the tragedy of trident <e> <s> first the christians only answer to the dangers of holocaust is for our country to adopt the way of non-violence the way of unilateralism now <e> <s> we are a christian country in the sense that we cannot legislate in either this house or in the other place without opening with christian prayer <e> <s> yet as soon as we mention unilateralism and non-violence good christian folk say but that is all very foolish and that is all very weak <e> <s> they forget surely that the gospel says <e>"]
