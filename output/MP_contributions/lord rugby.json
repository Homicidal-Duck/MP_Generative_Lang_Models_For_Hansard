categories is at present leading to the wholesale exploitation of the nations eyesight <e>", "<cs> my lords should not the word patient be used with the greatest circumspection since a great number of

ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> i am in fact asking about simple reading glasses which have no connection whatsoever with eye diseases <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord does he think that the great number of people today testing eyesight are qualified to diagnose eye disease <e> <s> in fact are they licer sed to diagnose eye disease and if they fail to diagnose it are they held responsible for their failure <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for referring specifically to section of the opticians act <e> <s> many people today feel that that confers not only monopoly rights but also a form of legal infallibility in all such cases <e> <s> i should like him to say must anyone who tried to bring similar simple lenses into this country inevitably face a case which they cannot hope to win <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to repeal section of the opticians act <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill he now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> in rising to my feet to introduce this bill it is difficult to know where to start <e> <s> there has been so much water under this bridge since i introduced an unstarred question about two years ago in your lordships house and it seemed that from that moment the subject was anything but dormant <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt for a moment <e> <s> is the noble lord saying that because something is made in the far east it is shoddy <e> <s> because i believe that some of the finest lenses in the world are today made in the far east <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord cullen for giving us his summary <e> <s> i do not myself altogether feel that the public at large are going to have many of their fears allayed as a result of this debate <e> <s> all too often i have heard the-word patient used whereas we have also heard that per cent <e> <s> of the people who require spectacles are people who merely need reading glasses they are in truth perfectly healthy people merely suffering from increased age requiring standard spectacles which as a noble lord has said are immediately available somewhere in the opticians shop and are withheld officiously on the basis of an eye test and a lot of mumbo-jumbo in order to pretend that that person in fact has something wrong with his eyes <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be assured by the minister that under the disciplinary powers conferred on the general optical council under the act they in fact exercise those powers to prosecute their own <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord has there not been a very considerable degree of purchasing of cheaper lenses and appliances from far east countries and then the sending in of accounts to the department of health and social security as though those items had been purchased from prescription houses in this country as a result of which a large number of highly skilled workmen have been laid off machinery has been unused and generally speaking the prescription houses which rely on this particular work from the department of health and social security have been done out of their legitimate profit <e>", "<cs> my lords i got these assertions from the newspapers <e> <s> it was very widely reported and nobody at that time secured a libel action against the newspapers <e> <s> if it is true that opticians are in fact falsifying the accounts may we be assured that such people will be brought to court and that the due processes of the law will be brought about <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been a tribute to the wide-ranging versatility of your lordships house that such a high degree of expert knowledge can be brought to bear in a debate concerning this enormous subject the nuclear dimension <e> <s> the noble earl lord halsbury has contributed so much in the pure research which has brought this country to its present <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware of the recent survey which was conducted through the ophthalmologists society which came out with a clear majority view that reading glasses should come hack on to the shop counter <e> <s> very largely because the prescription which is given does not carry with it any guarantee that the eyes have been checked for a number of diseases including glaucoma <e>", "<cs> my lords should it not be fully understood that opticians are not medically qualified despite what other members have said <e> <s> there is no medical qualification needed to be an optician <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord consider that to be an englishmans disease that they should go along with the act <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be true to say that agriculture has developed over the past years into an enormous asset-stripping exercise in which the amalgamation of land has virtually prevented any young man from getting his foot on the ladder at all <e> <s> this is because the arbitration system that has existed has worked totally in favour of the landlord and totally out of favour of the tenant <e> <s> it is a well known fact that anybody who wishes to dispute an arbitration claim dare not do so because he is told straight away that the arbitrator will be upset and will only increase the arbitration figure against him <e> <s> consequently one has the situation of people accepting almost anything that is put on front of them rather than face that music <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it is perfectly true to say that these big institutions and financial houses come in very largely from the point of view of using the land as a method either of safeguarding capital or of improving their capital position <e> <s> that is what i am really saying <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had the act we have had the act and now superimposed we have the agricultural holdings bill which is trying to readjust a serious imbalance in the industry resulting directly from the operation of those preceding acts <e> <s> the bill as put forward is to say the least difficult to understand especially to farmers who will i think be totally bemused by it <e> <s> i doubt that arbitrators will fare much better <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister whether it will now be possible for people over the presbyopic people who virtually all take the same magnification and who break and lose their glasses fairly constantly to get immediate replacements instead of having to be subjected to the appalling delays which the opticians have put upon them and the quite ludicrous prices they have charged for replacements <e> <s> does this statement cover the presbyopic like myself and many others who simply uses simple magnification <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to address myself to the opticians act <e> <s> the bill before your lordships house is intended to re-examine and amend where necessary an act which was introduced in by a private member <e> <s> it was never introduced by government <e> <s> willingness now on the part of her majestys government to carry out some amendments represents to me at least a chink of light at the end of a dark tunnel <e> <s> after hearing the speech of the noble lord lord glenarthur i regard it as positive sunshine <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord perhaps say what the delays are in being able to obtain reading glasses which sometimes can be as much as three weeks so that people have had to buy private ones <e> <s> they have been cajoled into buying private ones at a figure of round about or simply because they cannot wait for that period of time <e>", "<cs> if i may refer to what was said by the noble lord <e> <s> lord somers he confused the committee by introducing a medical question with regard to spectacles when of course spectacles have absolutely no relationship to medicine whatsoever and neither do the sales of spectacles <e> <s> his particular prescription is probably for a major eye defect which requires very powerful lenses <e> <s> it may have no relationship whatsoever to the low-power lenses equal for both eyes which the presbyopic person will require at about years of age due to the ageing process simply in order to magnify the printed word <e>", "<cs> there is a very big difference between testing eyesight and dispensing spectacles <e> <s> if a person has a prescription that prescription has to be made up and it will be made up probably by an optical manufacturers prescription house which will operate within very exacting limitations according to the prescription <e> <s> the dispenser is simply the person who sends the prescription off to one of these houses and receives back the lenses which have been entirely made up according to the standards which are laid down <e> <s> they could be prosecuted for producing equipment which is not within those limitations <e> <s> therefore the dispenser is simply a dispenser of glasses which are made up by someone else <e> <s> he puts them in a frame and sells them <e>", "<cs> the matter of the prescription is only important in certain respects <e> <s> the main one is to get a properly prescribed lens <e> <s> it has nothing whatever to do with a medical check <e> <s> i stress that the whole tenor of the legislation was to state that by no stretch of the imagination were opticians to be accorded a medical <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i must dissociate myself from this amendment because i misread it and i thought that this amendment was concerned purely and simply with the other amendment relating to reading spectacles <e> <s> i have already stated and have gone on the record as stating that the dispenser of optical appliances is nothing more or less than a seller of optical appliances <e>", "<cs> i was not here when this debate started but understand that in fact the noble lord lord cullen acts as president for the optical corporate bodies which are highly commercial concerns <e> <s> i am sure he will admit that he is involved in a commercial exercise in putting forward their points of view <e> <s> if <e>", "<cs> i was not putting forward an argument <e> <s> i was trying to make a statement of fact <e> <s> we have the optical corporate bodies who now occupy prime sites in the selling end of optical appliances in all the major city centres <e> <s> they occupy a privileged position because they now dominate a monopoly position <e> <s> that is what i am trying to bring home <e> <s> in order to get competition into the market i believe that other people should be allowed to advertise in the same way that is their privilege at the moment <e>", "<cs> with that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have been told by a doctor that perhaps one of the worst things that can happen to <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that <e> <s> he must remember that many people do not carry briefcases <e> <s> they live very far away in the country and sometimes especially in agriculture in which i am engaged it is very important that they should be able to see properly <e> <s> we can easily have accidents with these very fragile things and we are not within miles of opticians shops <e> <s> often we cannot get to a person who can do repairs <e> <s> i think this is something which the noble lord should look at carefully because life can sometimes be difficult and dangerous situations can be involved <e> <s> for instance electricians are perhaps engaged in circuitry in very uncomfortable positions and wearing perhaps only a pair of slacks and a sweat shirt <e> <s> where do they keep a spare pair of spectacles <e> <s> the standard spectacles supplied by opticians are very fragile and break very easily <e> <s> they are for self-employed people and i do think that first aid for spectacles is vital and important and i hope that the minister will look into it <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> are we talking about cataracts <e> <s> i understood that cataracts were dealt with by ophthal-mologists who are fully qualified medical people <e> <s> the lenses supplied after a cataract operation are standard lenses of fairly high magnification or of complex magnification <e> <s> nevertheless they are the same for all people who have had cataract operations <e> <s> i am wondering whether cataracts come under ophthalmic opticians <e>", "<cs> i would apologise if i got those figures slightly wrong <e> <s> i think that to most of us the general optical council is a sort of secret society and we do not really know what goes on inside it <e> <s> as regards dollond and aitchison as we all know it is now virtually in the hands of a very large tobacco consortium and i myself feel that it is rather contrary to the whole spirit of the act as laid down originally by the crook report that these corporate bodies should exist at all <e> <s> it was stated <e>", "<cs> i have before me two pages of qualifications which are required to register as an optician <e> <s> there are altogether different types of letter that you can have after your name in order to come into that register <e> <s> i feel that this is really overcomplicating the issue <e> <s> i cannot help being reminded of the statement that when things really get too complicated they tend to become insignificant simply due to their complication <e> <s> if we are going to have the title of optician surely only one type of requirement is necessary and not in order to satisfy the public that that man is qualified <e>", "<cs> my lords i should very much like to second what my noble friend lord northfield has just said <e> <s> it is far from being as far as he is concerned a deathbed change of heart because i have followed what he said in another place many years ago <e> <s> he has been entirely consistent in everything he has said <e> <s> it is a very great pity for if he had not talked the debate out at that time we would not now have this problem in front of us <e>", "<cs> my lords would not this amendment require an inspectorate to be set up to follow up all the opticians and to make quite sure that people who go to opticians to obtain glasses were getting precisely what was required for their eyesight <e> <s> at the moment there is no inspectorate of any description and i would imagine that there is a danger that if we carry this amendment to that length it will create a demand for an inspectorate <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that i do not think this tightens it up from the point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i should very much like to associate myself with the unstarred question of the noble lord lord irving of dartford <e> <s> the noble lord has raised a very important point not only for the urban area of london but for the whole country <e> <s> i am a countryman and perhaps one of the biggest areas where we have an accumulation of scrap metals of all kinds is actually in the countryside where we can also find other materials such as straw <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that the wording of the order is somewhat obscure to me because i am not very good at being able to interpret these documents <e> <s> i feel that if it had been in clearer english i might have been better able to do so <e> <s> i understand that as the noble lord lord ennals has said no particular training is needed to sell complicated lenses provided that a prescription is available <e> <s> i presume that the prescription has been made out by a qualified optician and that it will be made up by one of the optical manufacturers houses or association <e> <s> consequently the only check that is needed to ensure that a prescription is correct is a focimeter <e> <s> in that respect the person selling the glasses needs merely to check that they conform with the prescription <e> <s> on the other hand i am not sure about reading glasses <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will advise me about what is happening there and how differently they are being treated because i am not entirely clear about that in my own mind <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill before your lordships house is based upon a proposition that there are a sufficient number of road/car accidents caused by failing or inadequate visual acuity of car drivers to warrant what is tantamount to a universal eye test <e> <s> in so far as the whole subject of motorists and accidents is concerned it would seem somewhat superficial to bring before your lordships house one narrowly-circumscribed bill on which we are expected to draw one narrowly-circumscribed conclusion yet ignoring the vast complexity of contributory causes which go to make up the mass of divergent reasons to which accidents are attributable generally and specifically <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say how pleased i am to be the first to put a question to the noble baroness in her new role <e> <s> i should like to congratulate her and also to share her concern for her noble colleague and friend lord avon <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble baroness in her new role whether she or the department is aware of efforts by opticians in order to prevent people from taking away their prescriptions <e> <s> various actions have been taken by opticians such as intimidation tearing up the prescription and from certain reports which i have given to her also giving a prescription which is knowingly wrong <e> <s> if there is any <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether it is right that now that we have more competing market forces in the production of these lenses the likelihood is that the price will in fact come down <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister if it is not the case that the germans plastics industry is more advanced than our own <e> <s> they may have a better plastic for this particular application <e> <s> perhaps that is something that could be looked into because their <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a certain amount of weight to what the noble earl has said because as a consumer of water i have bought that water from the authority <e> <s> consequently i am perhaps also entitled under the trade descriptions act to know whether <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot claim any very great knowledge of chemistry and my recent introduction to the committee has brought me face to face with a new chemical terminology with mnemonics with which many people are familiar but which were unfamiliar to me and with quite a considerable degree of technical jargon <e> <s> therefore to begin with i have had to adjust myself to this unfamiliar language in order that i could start thinking in the wider context of the european and the global problem of lead pollution and the gas emissions with which it is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister recall that at the setting up of the opticians act one of its most important pillars was that there should be a separation between the two functions of testing eyesight and selling spectacles entirely in accordance with the same kind of act to which medical doctors had to conform <e> <s> will he tell us now whether there is not a suspicion that the taxpayers are funding a prescription which with a very small addition can be slanted in the direction of the sales department of the opticians <e> <s> in fact there is a suspicion that the prescription is nothing more than a chit which will have to be spent at the companys store <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl will have received a paper from me yesterday showing how the association of optical practitioners has been operating a restriction on what it describes as magnifying spectacles in the form of twin lenses of indentical power <e> <s> these are used extensively in industry and the different magnifications are applicable to different jobs <e> <s> does the noble earl agree that it is extremely important that people in industry should always have access without prescription but by choice to these particular magnifications <e> <s> will he assure the house that within supplies to industry these optical applicances will be available <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl very much for that reply <e> <s> does that mean that they can be obtained without a prescription <e>", "<cs> my lords it is as a layman that i took part in the deliberations of the committee and so it would be inappropriate for me to say anything scientific especially in view of the high quality of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness the minister very much for that reply especially with regard to reading glasses <e> <s> is she aware of the fact that a european company is now marketing reading glasses and has been doing so for about a year <e> <s> it has sold in the region of pairs and this figure is now escalating <e> <s> that is very economic and this must surely be of very great benefit to those who can select their reading glasses and also to the exchequer in being able to do away with sight tests for those categories of glasses <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount the minister envisage any chance of there being a direct express rail link between the two airports which will not stop anywhere in london <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness very much for that reply <e> <s> before the government decide how the matter will be conducted i wonder whether she will take note of the editorial in the <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a danger that we are arriving at a state of paranoia over the libyans and laying the blame for every single act of terrorism at the libyan door <e> <s> other people commit acts of terrorism <e> <s> from the way we are going at the moment is there not a very grave danger that when they commit them those acts will be attributed to libya exclusively <e> <s> i think there is a grave danger <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to congratulate the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne on introducing this bill <e> <s> am i allowed to make a statement at this point <e> <s> i thought i was entitled to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords all i have to say is that i feel it is important to look carefully at the wording of the bill especially at the word safeguards <e> <s> it may so happen that eyes are taken for commercial purposes by fringe medical people and so they could be turned to a commercial purpose <e> <s> that is all i have to say at the moment <e> <s> i think that we shall have to wait until the report stage in order to make quite sure that the correct people will obtain these eyes for medical education and experimentation <e>",

name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> i presented a paper to the noble baroness lady trumpington showing that the ophthalmological society had done its own investigation and found that something like per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that some per cent <e> <s> of children of that age are being put into glasses when

months which is an intolerably long time <e> <s> if the noble baroness will accept that people who wish to make decisions with regard to leases and all the rest of it are entitled to and should obtain much earlier decisions i shall leave the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble baroness is inclined to state exactly why the pharmacists are there in the first place <e> <s> it seems to me that what the committee would require of them would be of a technical description <e> <s> i cannot see that it would want anything else <e> <s> the committee is perfectly capable of subpoenaing people to come along to give it such technical advice as and when it is needed <e> <s> so far as i and i think most other people are concerned the fact that pharmacists are there can simply declare an interest and then be accepted as though their hands are clean is utterly unacceptable <e>", "<cs> one of the problems with this question is that the capital sum of having been acquired it can then be moved or transferred possibly to another member of the family or someone with a different name in a different format and interest can still be maintained in a business by someone who having accepted
