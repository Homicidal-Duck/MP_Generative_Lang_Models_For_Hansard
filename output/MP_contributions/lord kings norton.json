["<cs> my lords there is no time for me to comment on the excellent debate that i feel we have <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble earl i said the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i have anything more to say <e> <s> i am very satisfied with the reply <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a short debate <e> <s> therefore much as i should like to i shall not elaborate my congratulations to the noble and learned lord lord bridge of harwich on his quite delightful maiden speech <e> <s> my congratulations are none the less sincere <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to those which the noble lord lord sherfield has already had not only for the way he has introduced this important report but for the way in which he conducted a very difficult and complicated inquiry <e> <s> i have called the report important my lords but for me one part of it transcends the rest in importance <e> <s> this is the section on the civil service four pages which i hope her majestys government will study not only with sympathy and understanding but ultimately with the determination to take action difficult though i know this must be <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess to the noble lord lord wynne-jones that we did not consider that possibility but it is one which now he has mentioned it <e> <s> i will bring before the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords the house has a lot of business still to do this evening and i do not propose to delay it any longer except to thank the noble lord lord skelmersdale for his comprehensive comments on the debate <e> <s> i shall read <e>", "<cs> my lords the hour grows late and still the house has a great deal of business before it so noble lords will be relieved to know that i intend to make no comment beyond thanking all noble lords who have contributed to a most interesting discussion the highlight of which undoubtedly was the maiden speech of the noble viscount lord hood <e> <s> i feel that i have to study the speech of the noble lord lord energlyn tomorrow morning <e> <s> i do not feel equal to studying it any more this evening <e> <s> i have too to look very carefully at what the noble lord lord trefgarne has said to discover the degree to which the government disagree with the conclusions of the report <e> <s> i hope that my judgment this evening that the disagreement is not too serious will be borne out by further examination <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that all that remains for me to do is to thank all who have contributed to what has been a most interesting and informative debate <e> <s> i say informative because half the speakers were members of the committee which conducted the inquiry and half were from outside that committee <e> <s> the support evidenced in those speeches is the source of some gratification i know to all members of the committee who are here <e>", "<cs> my lords i had the pleasure as a member of the committee whose report is before your lordships this afternoon of seeing the noble lord lord gregson conduct the inquiry upon which the report is based <e> <s> i should like to follow the noble earl lord bessborough in paying a tribute not only to the great knowledge of the research and development field which the noble lord lord gregson displayed but to his skill in conducting this inquiry and eliciting the knowledge which was vouchsafed to us by our witnesses <e> <s> the result is a comprehensive document of great value <e> <s> i hope that both government and industry will implement the reports recommendations even if there is some slight adjustment of them as a result of the limited criticism which we have so far heard <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say in conclusion with what satisfaction the select committee particularly sub-committee f will learn of the governments reaction to our report <e> <s> i too was very pleased to hear what the noble lord lord lucas said about the way in which we conducted our enforcement of the regulations <e> <s> i am glad that he commented on the remarks of the noble lord lord mottistone about <e>", "<cs> my lords we are now in the last stages of what i think we shall all agree is proving to be a most interesting and valuable debate a debate in which we have to thank the noble lord lord sherfield not only for his motion and his speech today but for the extremely valuable spadework <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understood the minister correctly he was saying that the minister would take a decision before the report was published <e> <s> if that is so may i ask him whether he is aware that this will be disconcerting to between and people living in the area at bearley and stratford-upon-avon because they have grave apprehensions that if this project goes through there will be serious interference with radio reception in the area and that local industry which has a large number of computerised systems and apparatus will have them badly affected <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister ask his right honourable friend when considering this matter to consider the other sites which would be equally suitable from the bbc point of view and which if adopted would cause interference on a much smaller scale than the bearley site <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the great disparity in scale between british airways and british caledonian which will still exist despite the exchanges now being arranged will the government consider implementing the old recommendation of the edwards committee that when a new route is instituted the first refusal to operate it should go to what the committee called the second force airline <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i should like to thank all those who have contributed to this debate this evening <e> <s> they are not numerous but they are all distinguished and all knowledgeable <e> <s> coming first to my old friend lord lloyd of kilgerran i enjoyed his pleasant references to the distant past so distant that the grandfather of the noble lord lord brabazon was a minister to whom we were responsible at the time <e> <s> he was a distinguished member of this house <e> <s> i rather feel that the noble lord will emulate his distinguished forebear <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> it is the firms that have the per cent <e> <s> and not the three british ones <e>", "<cs> that means the my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not make another speech this evening <e> <s> however first i should like to thank the noble lord lord lucas for what he has said <e> <s> quite clearly he understands the scene which we have been discussing and he had the right ideas about it <e> <s> the only matter which causes one disquiet is the possible timescale for improvement <e> <s> indeed that was the anxiety behind paragraph of our report which we put in black letters and to which i particularly drew the attention of the noble lord lord lucas <e> <s> i hope that we shall hear more about that paragraph later and will be told what specific plans there are for changing what we describe as the lack of political will on the european scene <e>", "<cs> my lords let me first add a word of congratulation to what has already been said <e>"]
