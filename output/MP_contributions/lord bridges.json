["<cs> my lords i begin by asking your lordships to extend your customary indulgence to a maiden speaker <e> <s> in my case the indulgence is perhaps rather greater than your lordships realise it was some years ago that i took my seat in your lordships house but i have not been able to make a speech until now not because of any lack of respect to your lordships house or any lack of interest in its proceedings but rather because of the rules and <e>", "<cs> my lords like others who have spoken in this debate i should like to thank the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead for introducing this motion <e> <s> unlike many other discussions on foreign policy in your lordships house where we generally tend to concentrate on the substance of foreign policy we are here invited to consider the methods by which foreign policy is conducted <e> <s> i believe this to be <e>", "<cs> my lords my contribution to this debate will be rather brief <e> <s> however i should like to intervene in the discussion to make one or two points that seem to me to arise on this important <e>", "<cs> my lords the part of the bill which i wish to address i shall do so briefly at this stage in the proceedings concerns the transference of responsibility for flood defence from the present water authorities to the proposed national rivers authority <e> <s> this matter is covered in part iii chapter iii of the bill <e> <s> it is not by any means the most controversial part of the bill and it is understandable that most of the attention in our debate today has concentrated on the broader aspects of privatisation <e> <s> however i think the part of the bill which i now address will be important in laying down long-term arrangements for future defence against flood <e> <s> i should like to suggest that in some areas the bill leaves me with the feeling that some further clarification and improvement are desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to intervene briefly in the debate to support the motion introduced by the noble lord lord middleton <e> <s> as he explained i was not formally a member of his sub-committee although i was invited to take part in its deliberations as a member of the sub-committee on the environment <e> <s> i fully share the conclusions reached in his committees report which i believe to be a thorough examination on the best evidence available and a fair appraisal of the commissions proposals <e> <s> i also thank the noble lord for his kind remarks about my participation in his work and for his lucid introduction to the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> i too wish to declare an interest in that i am an independent board member of the securities association one of the five statutory self-regulatory organisations recognised under the act <e> <s> i should tell the house that i have consulted the association about the amendment <e> <s> my remarks will reflect what i have been told <e>", "<cs> my lords members of the sub-committee who have preceded me expressed many of the thoughts that i wished to declare myself so i can be very brief <e> <s> the issues addressed in this report are rather different from those found in reports customarily circulated to your lordships house by the select committee <e> <s> they are normally issues such as employment community trade finance agriculture and the like <e> <s> nevertheless i <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to explain at the outset that although i was a member of the select committee and fully endorse its report i was not a member of the sub-committee which wrote that document and the remarks which i am about to make are entirely personal <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister explain how the government intend to exercise their jurisdiction over non-domestic satellites <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the motion introduced by the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead <e> <s> it will lead to a timely and useful debate <e> <s> i suggest that it is timely for two reasons <e> <s> first although the general issues posed by economic political and monetary union are well known the particular international context in which we examine the issues has changed profoundly in recent months <e> <s> secondly between now and december when the first inter-governmental conference will be held in italy the government will no doubt be examining the issues afresh <e> <s> therefore this is an appropriate moment for your lordships to consider them <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of growing anxiety throughout east anglia at the effect of the high level of abstraction from underground aquifers <e> <s> will he invite the national rivers authority to publish regular statistics which show the current state of our aquifers and the proposed rate of decline or increase so that we know what we are talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate on the future relations between the ec and efta may sound to many people like another battle of acronyms or a fantasy struggle in the style of jonathan swift or a bowl of alphabet soup but noble lords know better than that and will recognise that such a matter is an important one even on a friday morning <e> <s> i should like to invite the house to look at the larger horizon for a few moments <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the need for proper scrutiny of the convention by her majestys government before ratification <e> <s> however would it not be possible to accelerate these processes somewhat considering that it is now nearly one year since the convention was opened for signature in the united nations <e> <s> will the government not support the prime minister in her unanimous approval as one of the heads of state and government who approved the recent plan of action at the childrens summit in new york which i witnessed as a representative of the british national committee of unicef <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord selsdon i find this a remarkably interesting debate <e> <s> we had the benefit of an excellent maiden speech from my noble friend lady dunn which i heard with great pleasure <e> <s> a number of other noble lords remain to speak <e> <s> therefore i shall concentrate on what seems to me to be the most immediate and important issue before us namely the gulf crisis <e> <s> i shall approach it from a rather different angle from the speech of the noble lord lord soper whose views i heard with respect <e> <s> i have a rather different approach to his <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister reconsider the information that he just gave the house that the resolution would have to meet with the approval of all members of the security council <e> <s> does he not mean that it would have to be approved by the security council <e>", "<cs> my lords like other members of the <e>"]
