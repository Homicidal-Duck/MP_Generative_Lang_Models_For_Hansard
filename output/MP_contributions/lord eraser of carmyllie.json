["<cs> the idea that the law society should seek to achieve uniformly high standards of conduct on the part of solicitors regardless of the court in which they are practising is clearly one with which i agree <e> <s> but i can conceive that to relate effectively to the rather different practices of the sheriff and supreme courts it may be necessary to have different sets of rules with slightly different provisions <e>", "<cs> certainly this provision is not meant to be insulting to any of those who are required to discharge duties and functions under this clause when it comes to the granting of rights of audience to solicitors in the supreme courts <e> <s> i have little doubt that all those mentioned will deal with the matter promptly <e> <s> nonetheless the scheme for granting rights of audience and maintaining proper procedures in relation to how these rights are exercised is necessarily a little complicated and involves several office holders or bodies <e> <s> the provisions about prompt dispatch of functions have been inserted as a reminder to all concerned of the importance of securing in practice the extended rights of audience conferred in law by these clauses <e> <s> i appreciate as the noble and learned lord said that the supreme court of scotland has operated without solicitors for some time <e> <s> nevertheless it seems to the government correct that there should be proper dispatch in this matter <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly respond to that <e> <s> no <e> <s> if there are those who become members of this house and sit on appeals that come from scotland it has never been the practice to look behind their elevation to the highest court in the land to discover whether or not they have had any experience either as judges or as pleaders which would help them to decide upon the law of scotland <e> <s> the opposite also holds true <e> <s> i find the prospect of five of those so-called barefooters sitting in judgment in this house a little on the fanciful side shall i say <e> <s> however if they have by their experience and abilities come all the way up through the courts to sit here in the highest court it does not seem to me as a scots lawyer that i should look behind that experience and ability <e>", "<cs> i readily understand my noble friends confusion <e> <s> however as was said by the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey if a new clause is introduced it is correct that various points which may re-emerge should be discussed at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already indicated on an earlier amendment the government intend to bring forward amendments in another place to deal with the position of established churches and i use that description in a loose sense for scotland rather than in any particular sense <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that the regulations made under the clause are of considerable interest not only to those in the existing legal profession but also to those who have a keen interest in protecting the consumer as regards the provision of new conveyancing services <e>"]
