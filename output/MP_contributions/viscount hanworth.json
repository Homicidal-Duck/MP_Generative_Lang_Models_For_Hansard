["<cs> my lords in considering this subject i start with one fundamental and simplistic proposition that the more people who can work efficiently and usefully for the longest time the richer the nation should be <e> <s> we cannot afford many of the things which are important to all of us such as improved hospitals better social benefits and so on <e> <s> we ought therefore to consider why this simplistic proposition does not work out in practice and decide what can be done to improve matters before considering such palliatives as the abolition of reasonable overtime the acceptance of over-manning and early retirement <e> <s> if any noble lord wishes to dispute the truth of the fundamental proposition that i made at the start i will give way but i would emphasise the caveat working efficiently and usefully <e>", "<cs> i am no classical scholar but there is a story about <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not so very long since we had a debate on much the same lines as todays debate and i do not want to repeat at length anything that i said then so i am afraid that the remarks i shall make will be somewhat disjointed <e> <s> in the first place i cannot understand why with the accent on energy saving nobody yet seems to have done very much about house insulation certainly not in new houses <e> <s> we have not yet got a good standard of insulation and bearing in mind that extra insulation is cost-effective in two or three years this would seem to be one of the first things we should do in order to try to save energy <e> <s> it has practically no disadvantages <e> <s> i should therefore like the government seriously to consider drafting some further legislation on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him a question <e> <s> i avoided interrupting him in the middle of his speech <e> <s> i think he said that we should use our oil revenue for propping-up the standard of living when most of us think that it ought to be put to more useful purposes in investment for the longer profitability of this country <e> <s> would the noble lord comment on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down does he agree that in the unfortunate case of this country being attacked by nuclear weapons a trained force might be extremely useful in helping to clear up what would be i know an intolerable mess <e> <s> trained personnel might help <e> <s> does he agree with that point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall also be extremely brief tonight <e> <s> i think that on this question we should ask ourselves why the use of largely unmedically qualified chriopractors has grown to such an extent <e> <s> the answer must surely be that they provide a service which is not <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> can he say why there has been such delay in this consideration and when his right honourable friend hopes to come to a conclusion <e> <s> can he assure us that there will be higher standards of insulation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to say whether my interpretation of what he says is correct that at the moment there is no immediate intention of doing anything about raising the standards of insulation for new houses <e> <s> if that is the case does he realise that a very large number of people and i think i can say they are represented in this house think that that is a simply shocking situation <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that although the spray comes from both the rear and the sides if one eliminates what is coming from the rear with flaps that at least helps lessen the problem because if one is over-taking a relatively slow-moving lorry one is blinded only while overtaking <e> <s> would he consider this point because there seems no logical reason why we should not go half the way <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree first that one of our problems is that the shop stewards appear to be wholly unrepresentative of the opinions of the workers and secondly that the unions are totally unable to take any action whatever against a situation and against shop stewards where this situation pertains <e>", "<cs> my lords my speech is going to be disjointed because there are several matters which i wish to mention briefly but i should be able to do this in well within minutes <e> <s> first i should like to support the view that the public at large should be brought into the energy debate <e> <s> this does not mean more public inquiries they are expensive and i think a waste of time partly because they are usually dominated by extremists who decide emotionally what they feel and then look round for one-sided arguments to support their view <e> <s> what is wanted is a continuous dialogue so that when the government have to make a decision it will be seen against an informed background <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble viscount for that reply may i ask whether he would agree in the first place that the exploration grants are not very successful in encouraging firms to do the work no doubt because they are afraid of not getting planning permission to exploit something that they have found <e> <s> would he secondly think that perhaps the right policy might be to tend to leave our resources in the ground until they are really needed because there is a world-wide shortage and if so does he also agree that it is important to press ahead with exploration to a greater degree than we are doing today <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble viscount a further question to do with smelting <e> <s> does he agree that if we can promote more smelting in this country it will be a safeguard against the time when supplies of smelted ores may not be available from abroad while the ores themselves might still be available <e> <s> therefore does he regard it as a good insurance if it is possible to encourage more smelting here <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl realise that many of us believe that unstarred questions make up some of the most interesting proceedings of your lordships house and that they certainly appear so to the people visiting this house <e>", "<cs> i take a slightly contrary view to that of the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> with the increasing seriousness of crime we really have to take some measures which otherwise we would not wish to take <e> <s> i think it has been sufficiently publicised to allow us to realise what is happening in the courts today the criminal is unfortunately favoured for one reason or another to an extent which is limiting the effectiveness of justice <e> <s> i therefore wholly support the government in what they are trying to do <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord think that contractors and others will build to higher insulation standards <e> <s> surely the only people who are likely to do this are those who are getting their own private houses built which is a negligible number <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose tonight to deal with one subject only and that is industrial relations and it certainly will not take me more than five minutes to do so <e> <s> it is sometimes said that a week is a long time in politics and if what one says is topical even a day may sometimes be so <e> <s> however i think that when it comes to considering fundamentals seven years has brought little change in dealing with most of the problems particularly in the industrial field <e> <s> i said at about that time that if certain things happened the country would become ungovernable and so it has in terms of what people then said <e> <s> i appealed to the unions to bring themselves from the th into the th century <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i now find it extremely difficult to get a smoking carriage on the railways and that when i go to a meeting or a conference i very often find that i cannot smoke because there is nobody else smoking <e> <s> would the noble lord take the view that possibly it is only the young who are increasing the smoking habit and would he think it wise to direct more attention to them than to those of us who have smoked all our lives <e>", "<cs> my lords as a cross-bencher i have been fortunate in hearing a talk given to us by sir montague finniston himself <e> <s> everything said in the report on the present state of affairs would i think be agreed by most people <e> <s> the report is one of many stretching back nearly to the beginning of this century <e> <s> they all analysed our defects in much the same way but few of their recommendations were ever implemented <e> <s> as an inventive nation we still hold our own but in developing new ideas and in marketing them we fail <e> <s> the development of new ideas is of course the responsibility of engineers but the right climate for their work is essential <e> <s> radar is a classic instance <e> <s> it had to go to america to produce a usable product <e> <s> admittedly this was in the war but nevertheless it is typical of our later performance <e>", "<cs> i am surprised <e>", "<cs> frankly i am rather surprised that this suggestion comes from the opposition because i had a feeling that they were all for setting up appeals under all conditions <e> <s> but i think that if we are going to get anywhere in life we have got to realise that there is a limit to how far one can go on the appeals procedure however much one might possibly in theory want to go <e> <s> i think that from every point of view and it has been said far better by others this just is not going to lead to something better <e> <s> do not let us forget that in so many cases the people who take advantage of appeals procedures are not really those who ought tothey are so often the smart alecks the barrack-room lawyers and so on <e> <s> i really would appeal to the government to withdraw this clause and to think again <e> <s> there may be a way to provide what they have in mind in a far simpler form but this clause is simply not on <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that economies and important economies can be made by simplifying administrative procedures for example social benefits and that that may be even more important an angle than cutting staff which always causes some inconvenience <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree first that small companies are vital to our national economy and secondly that they have the greatest difficulty in getting adequate credit <e> <s> does he realise that in many cases when they have a bill prompt payment is demanded whereas settlement and i am not saying from whom is very long delayed <e> <s> this has a most unfortunate effect on our burgeoning small companies <e>", "<cs> my lords as has already been said this budget is part of an overall government strategy of curing our ills by a monetary policy and by reducing public expenditure and it should in my view be seen in that context <e> <s> the criticism of it made by the opposition elsewhere follows the usual practice of trying to gain political advantage on matters which are of relatively little importance seen against the broader canvas of the governments strategy <e> <s> to be fair the opposition ought to acknowledge that in many cases efforts are being made to help the poorer sections of the community and in the case of higher prescription charges i understand that two-thirds of those people who might be liable to the higher charges are exempted <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that helpful reply <e> <s> would he agree that whereas there is a potential saving of energy from combined heat and power of perhaps per cent <e> <s> or more the loss in efficiency between a large and small generating station is of the order of per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl say whether i am correct in thinking that newcastle have carefully studied the problem and asked for a chp scheme in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that in looking at the economics what really matters is the economics over the life of the power station and not necessarily at the present time <e> <s> would he also agree that costs of fuel will almost certainly rise and that what is not now clearly economic will be economic in a few years time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that reply may i ask whether he appreciates that having to reply to two separate demands first of all means two stamps of p and for most of us who pay by cheque an additional charge of p <e> <s> if there are perhaps million households in england that conies to well over million <e> <s> surely any administrative inconvenience would be far outweighed by that amount <e> <s> would the noble lord agree that the definition of a civil servant must be one who serves the public and not his own administrative convenience <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down may i ask her whether she realises that proportional representation can be arranged to give one party a clear majority <e> <s> as i understand it that is precisely what is happening in germany <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the noble lord lord foot for introducing the debate <e> <s> for me it occurs on a most unfortunate day <e> <s> i should now be in the committee on consolidation of bills and there is always the question as to whether that committee has a quorum <e> <s> furthermore i am to host a party in the cholmondeley room and therefore with your lordships indulgence i should like to leave immediately after i have made my speech <e>", "<cs> what matters to many of us is that the consumers should have a reasonable transport service <e> <s> of course since the beeching axe in many cases they have not had one <e> <s> it seems that what the railways provide could often be improved by a bus service which would be linked in with the railway timetable <e> <s> i can appreciate the view that one does not want to start the railways running their own buses which in a way is diversifying and this might be a temptation <e> <s> but it seems to me that it would be perfectly reasonable to allow them to do so as long as they did not run their own fleet <e>", "<cs> one must realise that many bus services are in fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble lord for that reply and in spite of the small amount of help that he tells us the government have given would he think it unfair to say that the government really seem to have <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that matters cannot always be left to local authorities and others <e> <s> if that could be done we would not have had planning regulations and all the rest <e> <s> we are building new houses for the future and it is not good enough to say that it is simply to be left to the people on the ground who are under many other pressures <e> <s> will the noble lord not agree that this is a useless sort of approach <e>", "<cs> it really surprises me that in these days of unemployment in view of the fact that we have not enough small firms compared with other countries and that most of us recognise the importance of small firms and their difficulties we should have an attack on that sort of scale from the opposition <e>", "<cs> it is surely desirable that small firms should be able to take on people not that they should <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the amendment for the same reasons as i gave earlier in the evening <e> <s> if one is setting out in a new small business one is taking a considerable risk and of course no one will receive compensation if the company does not succeed <e> <s> with unemployment at its present level i believe that the balance falls on encouraging the employer to take on as much labour as he can and i do not believe that anyone for one moment does not realise the risks involved in joining a small firm <e> <s> so on balance i think it right to support the amendment as providing more employment than would be possible if small firm are circumscribed by these regulations <e>", "<cs> one should not intervene having just come into the committee unless one has heard the whole debate on the amendment <e> <s> nevertheless having heard what the last noble lord said i cannot resist intervening <e> <s> he really must realise that in many cases the workers are called out to strike and strike by loyalty not because they want to do so but simply because their shop stewards who in many cases are communists and disruptives call them out <e> <s> i really think that the last noble lords speech should be seen in that context <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord wells-pestell referred to me personally and i am sorry i did not hear his speech i must tell him that i know the arguments very well <e> <s> one must say first of all that there are far too many strikes <e> <s> this we must admit and we must also admit that what is currently occurring is and has become more and more the law of the jungle <e> <s> unless we have the sanctions to prevent people from going on strike without reasonable cause when they could have avoided such action by discussions and arbitration it will remain intolerable that the state of our nation should be let down even further by the number of strikes we are now having <e>", "<cs> unemployment is something that is worrying us <e>", "<cs> my lords although i stand here i am a member of the cross-benches <e> <s> having initially supported an amendment to clause and having attended one of the meetings to discuss it i am now convinced that we should be guided by the government and support them in the lobby <e> <s> i will stick my neck out and say that many peers of whatever party who put the national interest first would in principle support these amendments <e> <s> this is because union power is in many cases unrepresentative undemocratic in the popular sense of the word short-sighted and not in the national interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very strongly to support this amendment from these benches <e> <s> my only doubt about it is that it is so moderate and does not go nearly as far as many of us or certainly i think it should do <e> <s> it seems to me extraordinary when there is this shortage of old persons accommodation that we should allow it to be sold particularly as it has been designed to help old people <e> <s> i should have thought it was better if they were not able to buy it at all <e> <s> this amendment does not go anything like as far as that <e> <s> what it does do is to remove from the bill a very restrictive provision which states <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to thank the noble lord lord bellwin for his very nice approach to this amendment particularly after the rather caustic remarks i made about the bill as a whole at report stage <e> <s> he will know that what he has said does not meet the point <e> <s> i do not want to delay the house but i would say first that it is inconceivable that the charities who take these people in on a short-term basis would be liable to throw them out on to the streets <e> <s> he has admitted that if you apply to the courts you have to have alternative accommodation available at that time and bearing in mind that it might take months to get the case heard in court any accommodation that you may have lined up is unlikely to be available at that time <e> <s> there we are <e> <s> i am afraid that most of these charities and there are a large number of them indeed are very unhappy about this <e> <s> they feel that it strikes at the roots of all that they are trying to do and that is something which the government cannot do for them <e> <s> they regard it as the government kicking them in the face <e> <s> i am afraid that with all respect and thanks for all the trouble that the noble lord lord bellwin has taken over this matter i cannot withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we really ought to see what are the effects of the bill as it stands at the moment <e> <s> i believe there are hardly any pensioners who want to purchase their house themselves <e> <s> they know that they will have to move out sooner or later they may have to move to an old peoples home <e> <s> no it is not them at all <e> <s> the people who will purchase it are of course the relatives <e> <s> they will put up the money <e> <s> they may see it as a good investment <e> <s> but it really is of no benefit at all to almost any pensioners to purchase their house except to have something to leave possibly to their family <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to spoil the euphoria on this amendment but i think there are some things which we might consider in the future as a result of this <e> <s> i am afraid i am going to refer to three it will take me only about two minutes to do it <e> <s> the first is that i deplore as i said before the somewhat doctrinal legislation that the government have put forward not only in this bill but again in the agricultural orders and elsewhere <e> <s> what i think they ought to realise is that unless they are quite certain of making a substantial improvement by the legislation it will take a very long time before any improvement arrives and therefore they should not do it <e> <s> i also think they have lost a sense of pragmatism <e> <s> finally i would ask them to consider whether in the present state of the nation some of their legislation we are all agreed that there is too much legislation is too detailed to be acceptable <e> <s> is it not simply fiddling while rome burns <e>", "<cs> i should also like to support this amendment <e> <s> what i was going to say has been said more ably by the last speaker <e> <s> it seems to me extraordinary when we have to import so much food and at a tine when there are difficulties financially in doing so that we should not do everything we possibly can to increase our own production <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the arguments put forward and i really do not think that any principle is involved in this <e> <s> there is the question of finding the money to do this planning and i think it is perfectly reasonable with the reasonable fees that have been asked that the people who want to build should pay <e> <s> i really do not think this need become a major issue <e> <s> we have got to have the money <e> <s> it is reasonable that those who want to build should pay <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble viscount for that helpful reply <e> <s> it only remains for me to speak to him outside the chamber <e> <s> i will give him particulars about the firm i have in mind which i do not think would be appropriate at the present time <e>", "<cs> most of us agree that to make industry work it must be a partnership between shareholders management and the workers <e> <s> although <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that indexing is not adequately taken into account in comparability studies <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that possibly the reason why peers are asked to have passes is that they come in different entrances whereas their wives always come in the same way and are therefore known <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the noble lord must realise by his own admission that if some licensing authorities are less rigorous than others a factor of safety already comes into the equation and i do not think that my own amendment after what i have said would increase this unsatisfactory situation from a safety point of view <e> <s> i think really one can almost dismiss the ministers argument on that subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply although it does not really seem to answer my question at all <e> <s> first would he confirm that allowances given to people for fuel can be spent on other things and frequently are <e> <s> secondly is he aware of the number of cases of hypothermia which have occurred in recent years <e> <s> thirdly surely he would think that investigation of a proposal on the lines i am suggesting would at least be worth while <e> <s> does he further realise that in addition to the suggestion that i had put down on the order paper there are other alternatives which might be very welcome if they were on the market <e> <s> in the war there were heated flying suits <e> <s> one can imagine an armchair similarly heated <e> <s> would the noble lord take this matter a little more seriously and investigate it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this is a very difficult subject indeed and i hope that we can keep it out of the emotional and party political field <e> <s> first of all i should like to pay tribute to the royal commissions report which am sure most of your lordships will know is a very worthy document at least two inches thick but it has considered very carefully and without bias all the problems that this legislation raises <e> <s> i should also like to say how excellent i think is the report of our select committee <e> <s> i think it might be useful at this stage to look at what our present legislation is and why we really must make some change or logically should make some change <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also ask the minister how he would deal with a thalidomide case having once accepted a state of the art defence <e>", "<cs> my lords some of your lordships will remember that over the past five years i have stressed the need to make gradual as opposed to revolutionary changes in our parliamentary and party systems if our democracy is to endure <e> <s> i have stressed how the enormous changes which have occurred in our society in the past years make such changes essential <e> <s> moreover our present system is not working at all well <e> <s> i would dearly like to elaborate on these statements but the point which is relevant to this debate is that we have not made the gradual changes when we ought to have done <e> <s> the fairly recent proposals for some reform of this house are a case in point but you only have to look outside to see that the cause of this nations decline in most areas is because even obvious change has not taken place and been resisted <e> <s> this has often been with the remark <e>", "<cs> my lords this subject has been discussed several times in your lordships house <e> <s> i suggest it has been one of the few issues on which the house has not distinguished itself because emotionalism and personalisations have tended to cloud the issue <e> <s> after all that has been said i suggest there are really only two major factors which have any real importance in deciding the point of view which each of us adopts <e> <s> the first is the fact and we must face it that the compulsory wearing of seat belts would be a major inroad into personal free choice <e> <s> it is perhaps only to be compared with the fluoridation of water <e> <s> we must not let ourselves get into a position where in major <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will excuse me for intervening i would say that i admitted that i was being illogical <e> <s> i shall not weary the house at this time of night by explaining why i was illogical except to say that the accent on the holocaust on the roads which was going on to a major degree a few years ago made me feel so fed up that i became willing to go along with any reasonable suggestion in order to shut up that propaganda <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that if we are saddled with this new size something should be done to provide envelopes which fit it rather than that we should have to use envelopes of enormous size which are the only ones now available in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that it frequently happens that what a party advocates in opposition when they have further knowledge proves quite impossible when they are the government <e> <s> would he not further agree that the worsening of the economic situation which of course was worsening when the last government left office may alter a great many attitudes to what is practical and what should be done <e>", "<cs> from this side of the cross-benches i too should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i really do not think it is good enough to have this excuse once more that it could be better put somewhere else if that means years hence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am at a loss to understand why considering that this only gives an enabling provision the minister should have been against it <e> <s> i do not think that he has succeeded in making any satisfactory case as to why electrical appliances are different from gas <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that our present stocks of uranium and plutonium in this country if used in a fast reactor exceed the energy from known reserves of coal <e> <s> secondly would he also agree that though there may not be a uranium famine worldwide until the beginning of the next century one always has to consider a political situation when one examines the continuing supply of any mineral <e>", "<cs> surely the noble lord appreciates that these international conferences frequently produce a result which is the lowest possible denominator <e> <s> surely we are interested enough in conservation to take a lead in advance of a conference <e> <s> this is one way of achieving our object at a conference <e> <s> it is quite extraordinary that the government should shelter behind an international conference and will not take any action over these species where clearly the law cannot be enforced <e> <s> it is a mockery <e>", "<cs> we are agreed that this is a complicated matter <e> <s> i believe the minister has missed the point i was making and i am not sure i have the points he was making <e> <s> it would therefore seem sensible if he would look in <e>", "<cs> i should not have thought that the situation envisaged was very likely to arise <e> <s> i can understand the farmers point of view <e> <s> on the other hand i consider that the proposal is unduly restrictive and is not in the spirit of clause of the bill <e> <s> therefore i hope that the government will not agree to the amendment <e> <s> although i have sympathy with the farmers there are other points of view <e>", "<cs> i shall not be appreciably longer than some other noble lords have been i think <e> <s> i should like to speak to amendment no <e> <s> and to the consequential one amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> they seek to restrict the types of evidence which can be brought forward by the surveying authority to justify the downgrading or deletion of a way already shown on a definitive map <e> <s> prior to the countryside act there was no provision at all for making amendments to the map in this way <e> <s> it is important i think to realise that <e> <s> section of the national parks and access to the countryside act provided for periodical revision of maps and statements only in so far as higher rights of way could be shown or rights of way over paths which had not been shown at all on the definitive map <e>", "<cs> the strange thing is that this bill in this particular clause has now gone way over towards the landowners whereas before it was the other way <e> <s> i think the noble lord really has to consider why he has done this because the situation was perfectly satisfactory under the previous legislation <e> <s> he really ought to consider my argument that it is particularly unfair that it having been decided that the whole question must be opened again the onus and this is the important point of producing the evidence then is on the person or organisation who is trying to show that right of way exists <e> <s> if the onus is put the other way on the landowner this would be much more sensible <e> <s> as i have said it is too much to have to try to prove a right of way when all the people who could have come up to give evidence have probably died <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support everything that has been said on this amendment and add one further point <e> <s> it is idle to suppose that an appeal to the high court is a practical proposition for most people <e> <s> the cost is very great and even if you win you still have to pay something <e> <s> in consequence it is no answer to say you can appeal to the high court it is impractical for most people <e>", "<cs> i promise not to speak for more than five minutes at the most <e> <s> i do not propose to move my own amendments nos <e> <s> a the paving amendment and a which is the key amendment <e> <s> i have much sympathy with the government because they have about cases unresolved and are managing to deal with them at the rate of some a year so clearly something had to be done <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> this is merely a question of seeing that the local authorities go about the map-making in a reasonable kind of way <e> <s> therefore it is not a vital amendment but it is i am afraid another of those that i should like the noble lord to consider to see whether he thinks that something useful could be included in the bill <e> <s> it is not a matter that i consider should be brought back again by myself at report <e> <s> so i hope that if the minister feels that something useful can be done he will produce an amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords for my benefit and perhaps that of the house can the noble earl define what are small businesses from the point of view of this question and of his statistics <e>", "<cs> i think we shall largely find that this is covered in the next amendments <e>", "<cs> i put down this amendment originally and thought of saying that i was so pleased the noble lord and his advisers had seen the light <e> <s> but on mature consideration i thought it wiser with the possibility of future favours that i should thank him most sincerely and merely remark that this is an excellent amendment <e> <s> i hope no other noble lords will find it necessary to oppose it because then i shall have to speak <e>", "<cs> i would strongly oppose this amendment <e> <s> a number of county councils have done this voluntarily and i see absolutely no reason why an exemption should be made <e>", "<cs> i would oppose this amendment on the same grounds as have just been stated <e>", "<cs> i think one has some sympathy with the problem raised here but the amendment as it stands goes far too wide and could be used for other purposes <e> <s> i suggest that this is one of those areas where further consultation outside would be desirable and that the noble lord should come back with perhaps a much narrower amendment later <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy with what is behind this amendment <e> <s> i certainly and many others do not like pressure groups i do not like people who do things purely on principle <e> <s> but i am afraid that in this age it is something which we have to some extent to live with <e> <s> pressure groups are perhaps today the only way of getting anything done <e> <s> but this amendment is not acceptable <e> <s> you cannot define when a thing is done on principle because the person who puts it forward has only to produce a reason and it falls to the ground <e> <s> also i think it would be open to a good deal of abuse <e> <s> i would say to the noble lord that he must be a little tougher and accept the rub of the green to this extent <e>", "<cs> i promised one noble lord to whom i spoke that i would consider the farmers point of view <e> <s> what i told him i would say was that as on so many other issues there is a good deal to be said on both sides <e> <s> the first point i would make is that the bill as it is simply will not do <e> <s> paragraph <e>", "<cs> it seems to me there is a danger when you ally a rather simple problem to a major one concerning other problems such as highways that in the end you find that the problem is insoluble and precisely nothing is done <e> <s> now <e>", "<cs> most certainly but i hope that he will bear in mind what i said as well <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what lord melchett has just said <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening without having put my name down but what i have to say will not take very long <e> <s> i was <e>", "<cs> my lords this evening i shall be even briefer than i usually am <e> <s> i have read the <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two matters on which i should like to speak today first approval of company names and secondly the abolition of the registry of business names <e> <s> these two matters have been dealt with already by a great number of speakers and i am therefore faced with cutting down a fairly tight-drawn speech otherwise i shall simply repeat what they said <e> <s> but there are a few additional points i think i might make <e> <s> may i first say that i agree with everything that has already been said on this subject <e> <s> approval of company names is a valuable government service and its abolition would mean that we would have to rely on the secretary of states power to direct a company to change its name from which there is an appeal to the courts or an action under common law by anyone who is prejudiced <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that reply <e> <s> does he realise that he has made exactly the points that i wanted made <e> <s> may i therefore leave it to any other noble lords to ask further questions i shall not ask a supplementary question on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords having forgone my supplementary question may i now ask the minister this will he confirm that the neutron yield is probably four or five times that of the conventional bomb but bearing in mind that the blast effect and other effects go as a square we are still getting from the neutron bomb a very substantial blast effect and effects from other factors of the bomb <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> first would he agree that the size of power station which the cegb is thinking of for chp combined heat and power is never really likely to come into being in the foreseeable future simply because of the very great costs <e> <s> secondly would the minister agree that if one is thinking seriously of civil defence the very limited number of large power stations which we have and which we are planning is not a very good idea <e> <s> if there is a possibility of <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i do not particularly enjoy making a speech from my new position in what i would term the choristers stalls and having made my speech i am afraid that i shall return to something a little more comfortable immediately below me <e>", "<cs> my lords i would simply say that so far as i know there is nothing between the government and ourselves as to the intention but if this has been looked at rather carefully by a solicitor and a barrister and i think there has been other legal advice and that is the way they read it there surely is a clear case whether or not the government think it is covered to make the situation utterly clear <e> <s> i know that the objection sometimes raised against doing this is that it is repetitive but there is absolutely no excuse for not making a bill as clear as it can be <e>", "<cs> my lords proof of right of way often depends on local knowledge going back a long way <e> <s> in a number of cases the people who would be able to provide the information that that right of way really was there are likely to be dead <e> <s> that is one reason why one has to be more careful in abolishing a right of way than in establishing one <e> <s> the other aspect was the thinking for years and years until this bill came up that it was <e>", "<cs> my lords if my understanding is correct that is that a bridleway automatically includes the rights of a footpath i think that that answers part of the question that was raised <e> <s> i shall not waste the time of the house as the minister does not agree with this but shall simply ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in my opinion this is one of the two key amendments in part iii of the bill <e> <s> we discussed this at considerable length in committee so i shall not go into it in great detail <e> <s> but one has a great deal of sympathy as i said earlier with the position of these objections and the fact that the secretary of state is able to deal with only a year <e> <s> but what has been done is simply to pass the buck regardless <e> <s> the government have even gone so far as to talk about savings which they will make in whitehall <e> <s> what they are doing is putting the work back if it is to be done at all on the county councils <e> <s> we know that today they are extremely tight on finance <e> <s> we may therefore conclude that the work will not be done and that a lot of people who have spent a great deal of money on the cases will find that money wasted <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord very much for that reply <e> <s> i do realise the problem of making these things mandatory particularly if for some perfectly good reason the county council in fact breaks the law <e> <s> anyway i thank the minister very much for the way he has considered this <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make one last point <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not spoken at all <e> <s> that has wasted two minutes anyway <e> <s> i was going to say that this amendment tends to prevent something happening in other words it recommends or insists that dogs should be kept on leads under certain conditions <e> <s> that is a very different thing indeed from prosecuting after an accident has occurred with a sheep <e>", "<cs> i find it really rather extraordinary that what is very nearly a wrecking amendment should have been produced right at the last moment bearing in mind that this is a very simple bill and there has been ample time for tabling amendments <e> <s> i saw this amendment only when i came into the chamber because in fact i had asked for the amendments yesterday <e>", "<cs> for goodness sake <e> <s> let us get back to practicalities <e> <s> most people faced with this type of situation would simply live together <e> <s> the people who we are considering are basically those who are religious and highly moral and who are prevented from marrying <e> <s> there was the idea of course in older days that if people were living in adultery one encouraged them to marry <e> <s> it is no good talking about this in highfalutin terms <e> <s> the plain facts are that in most cases they will simply live together <e> <s> what you are doing is denying the possibility of marriage to people who are doing just that <e> <s> i appeal again to noble lords on the opposite bench really to consider this matter from the practical point of view and not as i think they have from the idea of the church going back which of course appeals to many of us <e> <s> we must face where we are today and we must make the best of what we have got and i think that this amendment certainly does not do that <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy with the objects of the amendment but if one gets down to the practicalities i think it will be seen that it would be impossible to apply <e> <s> i say that for two reasons <e> <s> the court is being asked to open up a whole matrimonial case or potential matrimonial case whereas long ago <e>", "<cs> i never speak for more than about one and a half minutes and what i should like to say in a second speech will take just that length of time <e> <s> we must recognise that this amendment as it stands and i said that i had some sympathy with it would be a lawyers paradise <e> <s> we would not know which way it was going to go until there had been a great deal of case law and of course any case might be opposed by a number of interested parties <e> <s> finally it is no good saying that the present situation has been there for a number of years <e> <s> the trouble with britain today is that we have not made the gradual changes when they were required <e> <s> for those reasons i think that we should vote against the amendment <e> <s> i hope that that satisfies the noble lord because i have taken only one and a half minutes <e>", "<cs> i will add one brief note <e> <s> do people realise the cost of applying to the high court particularly if a case is opposed <e>", "<cs> my lords most of my speech will be concerned with what i would term the hadfields case <e> <s> hadfields are not a small company in the accepted sense but they are when compared with british steel <e> <s> i think that some useful conclusions which are relevant to this motion can be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords years ago i might have thought that passing this bill could have had an adverse effect on the institution of marriage and the family and i might have voted against it <e> <s> today i believe that just the opposite is true <e> <s> most of the people that we have in mind will simply live together hardly something which helps promote the sanctity of marriage <e> <s> the persons who will suffer if this bill is not passed are those with high moral or religious principles and the children who may be born out of wedlock <e> <s> rightly or wrongly we no longer try by legislation to make people conform to what we may think is right <e> <s> only when their actions adversely affect others or the nation as a whole is this now considered acceptable <e> <s> we should not try to do this by opposing this bill which now gives freedom only to mature persons over years old <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say why the government do not make perfectly clear to people overseas the likely results of moving the army out of northern ireland <e>", "<cs> as one who is interested in the waterways and who is also interested in trying to promote the greater handling of cargo i think that this is an important amendment and i should like to support it <e> <s> if the government do not like to be involved in any way there is of course another alternative which has been suggested to put into the bill some provision for independent arbitration <e> <s> unless one or two of those suggestions are accepted the situation is highly unsatisfactory <e> <s> the government who i <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment but if i had listened to most of the speech of the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby i should have taken a completely different point of view <e> <s> no the motorist is persecuted <e> <s> there is still the red flag mentality <e> <s> many of us think that the penalties are far too great for relatively innocent offences which are not in any way deliberate but purely accidental <e> <s> yes punish those who drive deliberately dangerously <e> <s> however to make the allegations which have just been made about the motorist is the greatest mistake <e> <s> the tendency has been far otherwise <e> <s> governments faced with high accident rates have tended to produce more and more legislation as the cheapest way of dealing with the situation and showing that they were doing something <e> <s> we really must set the offences of the motorist which sometimes are purely technical against the punishment handed out to other people <e> <s> if you hit an old lady over the head very often you will simply be told not to do it again or you will be put on probation <e> <s> i know that the points system is probation but there are other cases where motorists are punished far more harshly than those who have deliberately committed violence <e>", "<cs> would the minister agree that the law as it stands says that if you can exchange insurance <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> we all know of cases where originally a stretch of road was at mph and is then put up to mph and maybe even to mph <e> <s> one can argue that there is breaking of the law <e> <s> but let us be more practical because we all know that if you drive at mph in a mph limit you will almost certainly be passed <e> <s> the accepted norm is somewhere around to mph <e> <s> i do not think that the argument of just breaking the law and enforcing the penalty is a reasonable one <e> <s> what we are after is safety on the road and not just convicting people <e> <s> therefore i think there is everything to be said for not just relying upon technicalities but giving the courts some scope for giving a higher penalty where the offence was not a purely technical offence <e>", "<cs> i do not think the minister fully appreciates that from the motorists point of view humps are objectionable <e> <s> they may be necessary but i fear that there will be a fatal tendency particularly from a local point of view to put them in when they are not justified <e> <s> it is no good asserting that it is all a safety precaution <e> <s> one may think that in fact in many circumstances it does not do anything for safety except being a convenient method of reducing the speed to almost nothing and very often without sufficient warning quite apart from that there might be considerable damage to somebodys car <e> <s> i and many other noble lords are afraid that there might get to be a habit of putting in humps locally which is very nice for local people no doubt as long as you do not live in the road which are really a menace and a danger <e> <s> that is the reason why we wish to tie this down to an extent which so far the government seem unwilling to accept <e>", "<cs> i must come back on that <e> <s> there is a very big difference <e> <s> the others are inconvenient but unless you have adequate warning and if you get these humps distributed all over the place you can very easily do considerable damage to your car if you are caught unawares <e>", "<cs> the minister must realise there are too many road signs on the road and there are occasions when these signs can be missed particularly if the humps are put in unreasonable places <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment and to say that it seems perfectly logical that these waterways should be put on the same footing as the railways <e> <s> i can quite understand the governments reluctance to agree to this because of the matter of finance <e> <s> on the other hand the grants are discretionary and it would do a very great deal to promote this use of our canals and rivers for increased load-carrying <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> does he realise first that the repairs to blisworth tunnel are estimated to cost million which is far beyond what anybody originally budgeted for <e> <s> secondly does he realise that the only alternative route north is the oxford canal that maintenance of that canal is poor to say the least that it suffers from water shortages in a dry summer making it virtually unusable and that this factor makes the repair of blisworth tunnel vital <e> <s> can the noble earl at least give some hope of helping in this very expensive repair <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl confirm that the british waterways board are getting about one-quarter of what was considered necessary according to a report made some years ago to bring the canals back to a state in which they could be properly maintained <e> <s> therefore as has already been pointed out the situation is extremely serious and unsatisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that long and erudite reply <e> <s> however i should like to ask him whether he realises that a great many people think that the governments public relations statements have been inept to say the very least that they have failed to get over some of the very simple facts of economics and that the impression still remains that what they are doing is wholly doctrinal and not really related to trying to put this nation on its feet <e> <s> i think that there is lacking completely the slightest churchillian touch <e>", "<cs> i wish very strongly to support the amendment <e> <s> it seems to me extraordinary that whereas in the past we encouraged people to go out to various parts of our empire and today we encourage them to earn foreign currency abroad nevertheless we treat them in the way that we have heard about <e> <s> i appreciate the problems regarding the bill <e> <s> we are trying to make the situation absolutely fair for people immigrating to this country but important though that is we have a right to look after our own people first as far as we can <e> <s> to kick them in the teeth and that is the only way to describe it for giving service to this nation and to make them or their children possibly into second-class citizens is simply not acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he realises that it has been reliably estimated that it costs the country something approaching per cent <e> <s> as much to have people not working and getting unemployment benefit as it would if they were actually in a job <e> <s> this being so and if the government are prepared to look at their accounting it surely creates great possibilities as to what could be done not only by way of work sharing the government getting the per cent <e> <s> which they would otherwise have to lose but also of course in cutting down overtime were they to subsidise by some means firms which are at the moment in fact relying on overtime <e> <s> would he not agree that this is an area which it would be well worth looking at in conjunction with the unions on the basis that everybody would have to give up a bit to decrease the unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may take up one point that the minister has i think failed to answer there is per cent <e> <s> which one way or another the government have to spend on unemployed persons that is including the tax they do not get and so on and it really is up to them to put that per cent <e> <s> to some useful purpose in solving this problem <e> <s> could the noble earl deal with that point which i thought i had made clearly at the start <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak very briefly on this as well because at one point i had an idea of tabling an amendment on much the same lines <e> <s> but if i had done so i would have made the conditions rather more strict so that it was not just a question of paying and getting your exemption the exemption would probably have had to be carried on the person witnessed by a commissioner for oaths and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down could i make it clear that from my point of view at any rate the idea of paying was really in order to compensate for the extra cost to the nation of the injuries which would be incurred by not wearing safety belts <e> <s> that was my thinking <e> <s> i just wanted to put the record right on that point <e> <s> it was not quite as the noble lord had said with regard to the amendment <e>", "<cs> before i decide what to do i wonder whether the noble earl can elaborate a little <e> <s> when he says the government have to have power to raise a terminal levy if need be at whose discretion is it going to be <e> <s> is it going to be discussed with the treasury in which case i do not believe anything will ever happen <e> <s> under what circumstances do they want to raise it <e> <s> i should like to know before deciding <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for trying so hard to put the case across on this <e> <s> in the absence of complete support from his back benches i think the sensible thing would be to withdraw the amendment and think about it before report <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> does he agree that in all such cases it is desirable where possible and a certain penalty might be necessary to buy british <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that reply does he realise that he has not really answered the question <e> <s> might it not appear that his planning and research department is suffering from <e>", "<cs> my lords i really must come back once more to the noble lord <e> <s> if he will read the question he will see that i do not ask what is happening at the moment <e> <s> i am asking about the future if this government are successful and get back into office <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there should be a question from this side <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord whether he realises that many of the fire extinguishers which do not conform to the new aerosol standard are ineffective do not work when required and give a very false sense of security <e> <s> this being so will he take steps to ban all those aerosol fire extinguishers which do not conform with the new british standard <e> <s> will he at the same time try to inform people that if they want full protection they must have a more expensive type of conventional fire extinguisher <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my question does the noble lord realise that for nearly years i have been endeavouring to get the standard for aerosol fire extinguishers which has just been published and that the standard for the ones which do not work has been in existence for years <e> <s> will the government therefore seriously consider now that the standard is there doing something about banning those which do not conform <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this statement <e> <s> some noble lords may remember that a few months ago i raised the very difficult situation of one company and the most unsatisfactory method which the government had pursued in relation to them <e> <s> would the minister not agree that at least a large proportion of the trouble with our steel industry has been due to adversary politics between the two parties nationalise steel denationalise steel and renationalise steel <e> <s> how can any firm look ahead when its future has been as uncertain as that <e> <s> that is one reason the fact that adversary politics of that nature are no longer tolerable why i sit where i do today on the sdp benches <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that this statutory instrument has been through another place already and therefore at this late stage all that i can ask for is an explanation of the points that i am going to raise or possibly for the minister to give earnest consideration to them <e> <s> in the department of trade issued a document <e>", "<cs> my lords the two cases quoted are not the only ones or of the only type that are disturbing the public at the moment <e> <s> may i therefore ask the noble lord if he will consider other aspects which may need looking into as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i had in mind last nights television programme on rape <e> <s> many of us are very worried about that programme and the method of questioning and so on which went on in it <e> <s> i did not wish to raise a different issue <e> <s> that is why i put the question in the form that i did <e> <s> i am sorry <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i accept what the noble lord has said and thank him for it he does <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble viscount agree that while most of us do not like the stationing here of american nuclear missiles we nevertheless feel it to be our duty to have them and that therefore an opinion poll is not really very satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very moderate bill and it is not making any major reforms but it is of enormous importance to archaeologists <e> <s> that point has already been made today <e> <s> treasure trove which they may rely on for getting evidence in anything that is for example buried only helps to a very limited extent because the archaeologist is not primarily concerned with let us say the gold coins he is just as interested if they are not made of gold and he might be just as interested in the container because what he is trying to do is get the evidence for reconstruction <e>", "<cs> my lords if i am to be certain of reaching home tonight i shall have to leave at nine oclock and if the debate is not finished by that time i hope the house will excuse me <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord bear in mind that if one does not pay ones rates one is soon taken to court <e> <s> the period is very brief indeed <e> <s> therefore it is only fair that interest should be paid on what is now becoming quite a long-standing debt <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord realise that mobility of labour is vital in obtaining the maximum employment we can with industries dying in one area and another <e> <s> does he also agree that council houses and new council houses are a very important factor in making mobility possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to as <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that reply may i apologise for the short notice of this question <e> <s> it was put down only on monday and this was the slot that was allocated to me <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether he has really looked into this problem <e> <s> there are miles and miles which are coned off no work is proceeding and the carriageway is in perfect condition <e> <s> would the noble earl not think that all that has been done is to let a contract without any consideration whatsoever for the motorist so that as soon as the contract is let the whole of the area is coned off and that this really is intolerable and has been done for administrative convenience without any thought whatsoever for the motorist <e>", "<cs> my lords may i finally ask the minister whether he would seriously look into the position as it stands today bearing in mind that i came down the road on monday and that nothing that he has said today satisfies me as a true explanation <e> <s> could the noble earl look into what is in fact happening at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the seriousness of the situation will the government consider setting up if they have not already done so some means of inter-party consultation so that so far as possible the nation can speak with one voice independent of party <e>", "<cs> my lords i think your lordships will be relieved to know that my speech should take well under five minutes <e> <s> i think that the situation which has arisen in the falkland islands should transcend all party boundaries <e> <s> some noble lords may be aware that a week ago i put down a starred question asking the government to establish machinery for inter-party consultation and it appears that at that stage at least they had not done so <e> <s> today although speaking from the sdp benches some of the things i am going to say may not be popular and certainly should not be taken in any way as representing my partys policy or thinking <e> <s> it does not do so <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that the differentials in the communist countries are very little and possibly less than they are here and that the hardest thing in the world is to decide exactly what differentials there should be between different kinds of work <e>", "<cs> my lords if the national trust had not agreed would it have been possible to have requisitioned the land <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his answer <e> <s> may i ask him whether or not he thinks that the halfpenny coin is totally artificial <e> <s> there is no detriment to the consumer while we have inflation because it is purely a question of the interval before firms put up their prices <e> <s> if any notice is given it will make no difference at all to the consumer <e> <s> finally may i ask the minister to give an estimate of the cost of keeping this wretched coin in circulation <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to speak briefly in support of the noble lord lord nugent of guildford <e> <s> i am afraid i must say that i disagree with almost everything that has been said by the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby in the past minutes <e> <s> i cannot help wondering although it is no business of mine why it is that the noble lord takes the view he does because it is never quite apparent from his speeches <e> <s> sufficient of that i should move on but i might say that i hardly enjoyed minutes of his speech which i thought added nothing to this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to deal with only one aspect of the subject under discussion tonight <e> <s> it is the importance of providing greater opportunities for part-time work for qualified married women <e> <s> i stress the word qualified <e> <s> i raised this matter in a wednesday debate about years ago and fortunately i was able to combine the motion with one proposed by the noble lord lord shackleton who was then a senior minister <e> <s> after the debate he very greatly improved the conditions for married women working in the civil service <e> <s> although i had the full support of noble baronesses in the house i never subsequently managed to get any real interest from the industrial peers and to make some impact in their field <e> <s> later with unemployment rising the climate was much less propitious and i am afraid that i did not continue the campaign <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble baroness agree that it is unfortunately true that many teachers go straight from university into teaching and <e>", "<cs> my lords very late in the debate it is always difficult to make any new points <e> <s> however my appproach will be slightly different although it will reinforce a very great deal of what has been said <e> <s> the history of atomic energy in britain is a sad one <e> <s> we were the first in the field using atomic energy to produce electricity <e> <s> harwell was well ahead with examining and trying out on a small scale different types of reactor <e> <s> but we have gained little commercially fom our pioneering efforts <e> <s> we are now trying to adopt the pressurised water reactor which has been developed elsewhere <e> <s> surely we should have foreseen that this type of reactor would be required in submarines <e> <s> we were also the leaders in fast reactors and produced a megawatt prototype at dounreay unfortunately delayed because of mechanical problems by a year to months before it became critical <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i said that at all <e> <s> could the noble lord repeat what he thinks i said because i do not believe that i said that at all <e>", "<cs> my lords what i intended to imply was that we had not really reaped any important reward from our lead in the field from exports abroad <e> <s> that was the shorthand of what i was trying to say <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly and very strongly to support this amendment <e> <s> first the point i want to emphasise is that the existing system is not working well <e> <s> it seems extraordinary that the safeguards rigorously applied elsewhere are almost totally absent in committing children to care <e> <s> the social services committees seldom question their social workers recommendations nor are the possible methods of appeal by parents likely to be known by them and used <e> <s> it appears that hardly if ever has a parents point of view been put before the social services committee <e> <s> secondly i believe that most social workers would welcome shifting some of the very invidious and difficult decisions to a juvenile court <e> <s> i venture to think that the unfortunate mistakes which are given wide publicity are in part at least due to a reluctance by the social worker to take the major step of taking a child away from his or her parents <e> <s> we all know that this is <e>", "<cs> it is always dangerous to set out <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i am very grateful for this instrument <e> <s> the problem which i can describe quite briefly is that the royal society of chemistry which is the chartered professional body for chemists and the pharmaceutical society of great britain which is the chartered professional body for pharmacists both wish to ensure that the confusion about the meaning of the word chemist is reduced and eventually eliminated <e> <s> we are one of the very few countries where colloquially chemist means both the person working in chemistry and the person working in pharmacy <e> <s> anyone who goes abroad will know that in most countries there is this clear difference <e>", "<cs> i find it extraordinary that a difference should be made between the museums and the commission <e> <s> so far as i can gather the best that the government can do to justify it is to say that the functions of the commission are not the same as those of the museums that it will be much more executive and managerial with a strong public voice and that ministers have been at pains to ensure that it has an adequate degree of independence <e> <s> i should have thought that the whole of that was almost irrelevant it is certainly no justification for it <e>", "<cs> that is what they are doing and i feel that in fairness to those people the amendment should be agreed to <e> <s> i know what the government are going to say <e> <s> they are going to say that the terms of the offer of pay should be taken as a whole not less favourable to the person to whom the offer is made than the terms on which he is employed on the date on which the offer is made <e> <s> well that sounds all right <e> <s> what price an indexed pension <e> <s> something which one might have relied upon throughout almost the whole of ones service career <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what has already been said <e> <s> i cannot understand why the government have proceeded in the way in which they have <e> <s> surely this bill is not extremely urgent <e> <s> it should have been possible either to produce consolidation as has already been said at the same time or to cancel those passages in the previous bill and reproduce the amended version in schedule so that everybody knew what was going on <e> <s> bearing in mind that i do not wish to be unkind i point out that it is apparent that the government have not given sufficient thought to this bill before introducing it in this house because time and again the minister very kindly said that he would like to have another look at various points <e> <s> i think the government are to blame for the way they have brought forward this bill <e>", "<cs> on the one hand the government are saying that the commission should be as independent as it possibly can but in many areas of course it is merely reproducing the civil service procedure and the treasury procedure <e> <s> i understand that the government cannot accept this amendment as it is <e> <s> but i think what must be realised is that if they are to do their very best to make the enterprise as a whole profitable and all that happens is that this goes in or is deducted from the grant that they will make next year there will be no commercial incentive whatever <e> <s> i hope that the minister can take this point on board and see that some incentive at least remains <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his answer <e> <s> may i ask him what other policies are likely to induce the oil companies into exploration in a very difficult area <e> <s> does he agree that at the moment it looks extremely unlikely that there will be any further major finds in our existing oilfields <e> <s> therefore the possibility of finds on the continental shelf are extremely important for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth will agree that no research is necessary to show that the use of headlights on a motor cycle in daylight is beneficial and that instead of waiting until the end of this year we should get on with some legislation that would make that compulsory now <e>", "<cs> my lords at this time of night one ought to consider three alternatives first to remove ones name altogether from the list of speakers secondly not to use ones speech but to refer to other speeches with which one may agree or disagree thirdly to give the speech one originally intended with possibly some alterations <e> <s> i am going to adopt the third alternative because although much of what i wish to say has already been said it has not been said in the same way and that will probably be the quickest way for me to complete my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell me whether i am correct in stating that the liability to brain damage is just about the same from the vaccine as it is from actually getting the disease <e> <s> or am i wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords this subject tends to be an emotive one in which some people take extreme positions often not in the best interests of what they are trying to achieve <e> <s> it is now generally agreed that any increase in the lead intake by the population particularly by children is to be avoided <e> <s> how far the present average intake is producing undesirable effects is still very debatable <e> <s> some recent research tends to show that the present position may be unsatisfactory and that the uptake of lead from the air might represent more than per cent <e> <s> of the bodys total lead intake which of course comes largely from food as has already been said <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that these items are not weapons that they are only part of a weapon at the most and that if we did not supply them it is perfectly clear that someone else would <e> <s> might we not just as well get the commercial benefit of doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness think that much the same applied to congratulating the mover of a motion <e> <s> i have noticed that over the years it has become more common for half the speakers at least to thank the mover <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord very much for that reassuring reply <e> <s> can he say what steps if any the government are taking to ensure that british high technology industry gets a really good share of government and public sector requirements <e>", "<cs> my lords i ought to apologise first of all for coming into the chamber only a few minutes ago <e> <s> i have been on a private bill committee which without much warning decided to sit this morning as its last day <e> <s> i do not think it very profitable to take up what the previous speaker has said in this debate but i will make one point now that i think the important thing always is to make gradual changes in <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness agree that quite apart from the savings made by denationalisation real savings could be made by simplifying a great deal of legislation taxation benefits and so on <e> <s> as a result there would be real savings in administrative staff as opposed to those which come about by denationalisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this bill <e> <s> i am speaking from the liberal benches on this occasion i think it is a good thing that on occasions one should show that we are an alliance <e> <s> i should like simply to say that i think that one of the nice things about britain is our care and concern for animals <e> <s> that we may be way in advance possibly of some continental countries is a good thing <e> <s> we can show the way <e> <s> i believe that this care is even more important because it represents perhaps a care of other things and of people as well <e> <s> i very much hope that this bill will succeed <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say to what extent the houses which have been sold to tenants are being replaced <e> <s> furthermore would he agree that with the importance of mobility as a means of reducing unemployment it is very important possibly for the future to have an adequate number of council houses so that mobility from one area to another area can if necessary be arranged <e>", "<cs> my lords i was a member of the committee and nothing has been said in the house this afternoon which was not carefully considered by the committee over a period of some seven days sitting <e>", "<cs> my lords i owe a profound apology to the house and to the minister <e> <s> it so happens and it does not often happen to me that i have to attend a dinner in the cholmondeley room which was a long-time prior engagement <e> <s> therefore i have not been here for the other speeches and i must leave immediately after this speech <e> <s> the rational use of energy and saving energy are really two sides of the same coin <e> <s> as in the domestic field the better insulation of industrial buildings is probably the most cost effective if not the most dramatic way of saving energy <e> <s> however i do not want to pursue this topic today but to concentrate on combined heat and power which i shall refer to as chp <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that the evidence that we have so far from a number of sources is that the amount of lead uptake from the soil varies very greatly with the type of vegetable in question but there is little doubt that some vegetables in particular brussels sprouts and lettuce take a large amount from the air <e> <s> will he also agree that if they are not adequately washedwere grown in an area near a road and were subject to a large amount of lead from vehicle emissions they would most certainly exceed the permissible limit by quite a margin <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to deal with two aspects of the bill <e> <s> the first is the statutory provision in clause and i am afraid that very little of what i shall say will be new on the subject though i may express it in a somewhat different way <e> <s> at first sight the clause may not appear unreasonable but there are two matters of principle involved and even more importantly side effects which give cause for concern <e> <s> whatever the minister argued in another place to the contrary the measure is in some respects at least retrospective because charitable bodies and housing associations have for about eight years accepted public grants at their face value and have planned accordingly <e> <s> had they known what is proposed in the bill they would often have made quite different decisions <e>", "<cs> i hope that financial viability will be considered broadly <e> <s> there are after all enormous variables <e> <s> first one must rightly decide whether the plant or whatever it is is going to be viable over its expected life <e> <s> especially with chp financial viability depends enormously on interest rates <e> <s> if interest rates are fairly low it is easy to make a very good case <e> <s> if on the other hand interest rates are high the reverse may be true <e>", "<cs> my lords the first point that i should like to make is that nothing we can do on energy conservation or in using renewable energy sources will produce an immediate and dramatic effect <e> <s> however for this very reason we should take all reasonable measures in both directions now <e> <s> it is unfortunate that the fright we had on energy shortages a few years ago has subsided <e> <s> nothing has really changed in the meantime only that due to the industrial recession there is an oil surplus and the subject is no longer news <e> <s> there will of course be a period of energy shortage at some future date if only because the needs of the developing countries will increase and world oil reserves and our own north sea gas in particular are declining assets <e> <s> i know the argument that reserves declared by oil companies are restricted to what it is commercially necessary to investigate but this does not really affect the argument only possibly the timescale <e>", "<cs> i spoke at length on second reading and covered most if not all of the points that i should like to make tonight <e> <s> i believe and my party believes that this clause is so wrong that what matters now is to put the question to a division while so many noble lords are still present <e> <s> therefore i will say no more <e>", "<cs> my lords whether we look at it from a christian or other ethical point of view we cannot ignore the plight of the third world <e> <s> millions are dying of starvation or are so undernourished that the children suffer permanent disability <e> <s> the who statistics should really bring us up short some million with leprosy million or more with preventable blindness and untold millions with debilitating diseases which make life hardly worth living <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking from these benches we naturally welcome this statement <e> <s> i was going to make the point that has just been made from the liberal benches about the limit of per cent <e> <s> for industrial firms <e> <s> it seems to me that there may be cases where no one will undertake the work without perhaps a larger subsidy <e> <s> therefore perhaps the minister would consider not closing the door on this completely because to get a vital bit of work done is worth paying for <e> <s> one is not convinced in all the areas that bearing in mind that information has to be disseminated it will necessarily attract a suitable firm to carry out the work <e> <s> may i ask the minister how the participation of individual firms academic and research bodies will be decided <e> <s> will they apply in certain cases or will they be approached or has that already been done <e> <s> how does the scale of this programme compare with what i <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> if i have understood the noble lord aright he is really saying that what i want here is already in the bill in some other way and the safeguards provided in the bill are quite as adequate as the ones i am moving <e> <s> am i correct <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister very much <e> <s> i am only referring at this stage to amendment no <e> <s> but i did make the broader point that safeguards in the bill were in my view inadequate <e> <s> we shall certainly come on to this point when i deal with my other amendments <e> <s> i should be most grateful if the minister could satisfy himself that broadly speaking what i am trying to achieve in this amendment is already in the bill or perhaps would be put in the bill if the minister was not satisfied that he had safeguards of this type <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this amendment covers precisely the point that i was making in very general terms <e> <s> one is really very worried that adequate safeguards are not being preserved in this bill <e> <s> as i shall argue a little later one is not asking for more bureaucratic procedures one is simply asking that when something is delegated somebody is there to overlook it if it proves to be necessary <e>", "<cs> i just want to make one point here <e> <s> it is very drastic to make an order to remove a body which has probably been doing some quite good work just because something has gone wrong or is going wrong <e> <s> one wants to improve matters rather than take such a drastic step <e> <s> do let us be sensible <e> <s> who on earth will take away the charter from as responsible a body as the british standards institution <e> <s> much the same applies to other public bodies <e> <s> unless something has gone very seriously wrong one could not do it <e>", "<cs> i am not quite certain what to do because a great deal of what the minister has said covers points that i was going to make in my own speech <e> <s> i think therefore that the sensible thing would be for me to deal with one or two points which the noble lord particularly mentioned <e> <s> this will shorten my later speech <e>", "<cs> perhaps the bill is not clear but i and a number of other people who have read it understand that the government can delegate powers of approval of these deemed to satisfy documents probably to the bsi and the agrment board <e> <s> if that is so and the government retain absolutely no right of approving those documents then when they are passed by the british standards institution or whatever body has been nominated they will have legal status <e> <s> if the minister says that is not so that is a very different matter but i can hardly believe it because the bill has been read as meaning that by many people who are more competent to judge than i am <e>", "<cs> i am rather disappointed because i took the precaution of writing out my speech and sending a copy to the minister beforehand <e> <s> i would have hoped at least since the whole of my speech was concerned with this particular point that we could have had it clarified tonight but perhaps it may come up with my amendment <e>", "<cs> it was just a matter of information <e> <s> it was sent personally to the noble lord lord bellwin and it contained everything that i propose to say tonight on the amendments which i shall move in a minute <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for taking so much trouble <e> <s> as he realised he has not really <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment from these benches <e> <s> the points which are really important have just been made by the last speaker <e> <s> there is a move of course to try to use refuse for producing power and it really needs a bit more incentive to make it a practical realisation <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i should like to speak today on union reform and although i speak from these benches my concern is not with any proposals that the sdp are formulating but with a personal attempt to analyse and define the difficult problems facing the unions and any government <e> <s> what distresses me is that the labour party and the unions as a whole should set their face against any reform except perhaps those which increase their powers and immunities but not their essential role in <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to echo what the noble lord lord baker has just been saying about engineering <e> <s> as i develop my speech i think you will find that i feel exactly the same as he does <e> <s> i believe that there is a tendency to put much too much emphasis on research and development instead of the product development and it is at that stage that the engineer is absolutely vital <e> <s> we are very very good at inventing things but very poor at developing them to the product stage <e> <s> i think that if there is a criticism of this report it is that it fails to take that fully into account <e>", "<cs> my lords in the th century we had a network of canals of over miles of navigable waterways covering most of the country <e> <s> the reason for the decline of the network as a commercial proposition was primarily that most of the canals could accommodate only narrow boats with a carrying capacity of about tons <e> <s> the decline was hastened by often quite unscrupulous competition by the railways who usually built their new tracks on alignments adjacent to the canals <e> <s> today there are still some miles of usable narrow or fairly narrow gauge canals which are being used for an ever-increasing number of leisure craft <e> <s> some people hope that to some small extent they may again be used for commercial purposes but this would make very little difference to the overall national transport position <e> <s> there is however a tremendous potential for the wider waterways leading from the humber the mersey the severn and the thames and for bringing such wide waterways further inland <e>", "<cs> my lords i made the point i thought that in many cases transhipment could be entirely avoided by the -tonne ship being able to go directly to where it wanted to unload <e>", "<cs> my lords on two previous occasions i wanted to give the speech that i am going to give on much the same lines as it is today <e> <s> today i almost wondered whether i was going to be able to give it because i have either a very bad cold or flu <e> <s> i start with the proposition which i believe cannot be challenged by any economist <e> <s> it is that the more people can work usefully for the longest possible time the richer a nation should be <e> <s> theword usefully of course needs to be underlined <e> <s> it is therefore clear that there is something unsatisfactory in the working or the side effects of our western capitalist system <e> <s> economists should focus their attention on this problem and also on the still wider problems of the world economy in relation to the developing and poorer nations <e> <s> if we cannot at least alleviate the latter situation on a permanent basis then our western monetary system and much else in my view is doomed <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that <e> <s> i said that there were side effects and we ought to go on considering whether these side effects were acceptable <e> <s> i did not say that they were acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down would he agree that this is a short debate and that he has not really dealt with the contributions of individual speakers in any great detail <e> <s> all that he has usefully said could really have been said in minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords there is merit in preserving old traditions even when they are for all practical purposes nonsense with reality <e> <s> i submit however that there is absolutely no merit in continuing out-of-date traditions where they are misleading to the general public and more importantly a slight not understood by those directly concerned <e> <s> i have some sympathy with the scottish practice of sometimes giving a verdict of non-proven but those who know about this would draw conclusions between this and our own idea of free pardon <e> <s> the feeling there of course is that the person is not guilty and has merely been pardoned <e> <s> it may be that some people would consider that this issue is not of great importance bearing in mind the number of people concerned and that they would not have raised it themselves <e> <s> but the noble lord who has raised this motion has done rightly in my view and our support for him should therefore be wholehearted <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may because i think that the noble and learned lord is saying that what was meant before implied that the person concerned had been guilty of a crime <e> <s> what we are saying is that the pardon we want does not imply there was any crime beforehand <e> <s> those concerned are completely discharged <e> <s> everything that the noble and learned lord has been saying implies that they had a crime and they committed a crime <e>", "<cs> i am really rather surprised <e> <s> normally in this house we say that acts are not clear because they do not say precisely what they mean in terms which are intelligible to the layman <e> <s> we are always told that to do so means redundancy <e> <s> having listened to the arguments at last it seems to me that here we have a bill that does say what it means <e> <s> it may be redundant but should we not applaud this just for once instead of carping from the opposition benches on this particular point <e>", "<cs> time and again i think it was on another occasion about this time of night we come to a conclusion that there was possibly something in a bill which was unnecessary <e> <s> but in the main we criticise bills because they are not clear <e> <s> we cannot have it both ways <e> <s> if there is a certain redundancy and it might make it a little clearer we should leave the bill alone <e> <s> with the number of amendments we have to deal with i do not think it is very profitable to raise this sort of amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords far too often governments seem to produce legislation which may superficially appear reasonable but which has potentially disastrous side effects <e> <s> somehow and i do not know how or why they continue blinkered and regardless of all warnings and proposed changes to avoid the unfortunate side effects are ignored <e> <s> i am afraid that this bill and the act are almost classic cases in point and this is well illustrated by the two defeats the government suffered here in the act <e>", "<cs> my lords would the government consider putting a requirement in the building regulations that the floors of new domestic houses should be insulated particularly if they are made of concrete <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press the noble earl a little further <e> <s> can he say whether when a decision has been taken it will be to select one of the nine cities investigated in the atkins report <e> <s> in other words has he decided to go ahead with one of them or is that still under review after months <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i have not listened to the whole of this debate but it occurs to me that there might be a compromise by putting in the words unless new circumstances arise which although it does not define what they are would at least show what one is trying to achieve <e>", "<cs> if i have understood it correctly the ministers case is largely based on the fact that it is a matter of chance whether somebody seeking accommodation finds it with a housing association or with the council <e> <s> he is therefore trying to he fair to see that people who find it with a housing association are not prejudiced <e> <s> that is all very well in its way but we also have to consider that the possibility of housing with a housing association is small because there are enormous waiting lists <e> <s> whereas he is trying to ameliorate one problem there are those who have to find their accommodation outside which is the vast number who will receive nothing of this and can be even more upset by it <e> <s> if one is faced with a situation such as that <e> <s> i think one is entitled to look at the financial costs bearing in mind that we can never afford what we would all like to do <e> <s> what i fear will happen is that the treasury will not honour the cost of doing what is down in the bill and where will the money come from <e>", "<cs> in a way this amendment is a paving amendment for clause <e> <s> i cannot help going back to the second reading debate <e> <s> it seems to me doubtful whether all these provisions for outside inspectors are necessary or whether the system could not be left as it was <e> <s> however i do not think at this stage that this is very important except to say that it seems that the government are pursuing a doctrinal policy <e> <s> it is a doctrinal policy with utter disregard for the side effects <e> <s> it is these side effects on which the government have been defeated three times in this bill <e> <s> it is strange that they should be so purblind as not to look at the issues with common sense <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i should like to make one or two points <e> <s> first i realise that when i used the word doctrinal i was being a little unkind to the government <e> <s> what i mean is carrying forward what may well be a perfectly good policy into areas where it is just not applicable <e> <s> i used the word doctrinal to refer to that <e>", "<cs> the minister said that if an inspector was too lenient the local authority would sack him <e> <s> this could occur only in extreme cases <e> <s> we are thinking about collusion between an inspector and a builder <e> <s> if there is collusion it is very easy quite quickly to cover up shoddy work <e> <s> what the noble lord has said does not therefore cut very much ice <e> <s> we still come back to the point that something must be done to ensure not only that there is no open invitation to collusion but also that there is no open invitation to all sorts of bribes for the inspector <e>", "<cs> i certainly agree to that proposal <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down can he answer one or two questions <e> <s> first can he give some indication as to how many bodies are likely to be designated to approve the inspectors <e> <s> if as i imagine there are a considerable number does he suppose that they will co-ordinate what they are doing without somebody maybe the government themselves co-ordinating or helping to co-ordinate <e> <s> secondly who will deal with the discipline and the complaints because throughout professional bodies we always have someone who takes complaints possibly not effectively as we consider with the solicitors but <e> <s> at least there is somebody <e> <s> who on earth will do it in this instance <e> <s> i suggest that unless they appoint a council or keep the designated bodies to a minimum somebody it may be the government or perhaps they can persuade one of the bodies will have to perform the co-ordinating function <e> <s> clearly the system will not work with more than say four designated bodies unless that is done <e>", "<cs> the minister must realise this <e> <s> if there are or even more bodies heaven help the consumer who has to find out which body to approach all of which will have different arrangements unless there is co-ordination <e> <s> the minister simply has not satisfied anybody that this is a sufficiently thought-out scheme which is sufficiently co-ordinated to work <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his answer <e> <s> there is only one point i should like to put to him and it is this assuming that this proposal is still a possibility will he ensure that its possible environmental effects will be included in the study which is now being made for what i term the bondi barrage which is much lower down the severn <e> <s> if the government did decide on the scheme it would seem to be a pity to have to make vet a further study with a further waste of time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not answered the question that i asked <e> <s> can he confirm that a contract has been let for the study of the environmental effects on the severn silting and so on of the bondi barrage <e> <s> if that is the case will the noble lord add to the contract a study of the higher barrage with its possibility of a bridge crossing <e>", "<cs> my lords the subject of this debate is a very wide one <e> <s> when one realises that today one-third of marriages founder the plight of broken families is very important indeed <e> <s> but what i have to say today is limited to a narrower field namely the provision of better working opportunities for married women <e>", "<cs> my lords i must give my most humble apologies to the house for putting down my name to speak at the end <e> <s> in fact i had my name down on the list of speakers but due to transport difficulties when i thought the debate was going on until one oclock or so i cancelled it <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been extraordinarily little time between the committee stage and the report stage <e> <s> this has not allowed us to give adequate consideration to the matter <e> <s> as has just been said even if one groups the amendments and speaks to them it is still up to any back-bencher who has not been consulted to speak <e> <s> it should not be passed just on the nod if somebody wishes it not to be so <e>", "<cs> my lords i would support the amendment but i would like to say how much i agree with what the noble lord lord hylton has said <e> <s> whereas the government seem only too willing to look at the academic aspects of the bill they seem to fail to see what is happening on the ground or its side effects <e> <s> i think that that is what the noble lord lord hylton was saying <e> <s> anyway one must be grateful for this amendment because it does set the record right and prevent the odd case of abuse of legislation which none of us likes to see <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support the amendment <e> <s> one of the worries is where is the money coming from <e> <s> one is almost certain that in the future it will mean a reduction in the amount of money available for housing as a whole <e> <s> most people consider that the governments estimates for this proposal are far too low <e> <s> council houses are terribly important for helping people when they cannot find something on the private market <e> <s> there is also another factor <e> <s> bearing in mind the unemployment situation people ought to be able to be moved from one area where they are in council houses to another <e> <s> from that point of <e>", "<cs> my lords we support the amendment <e> <s> i think that the noble baroness lady birk has covered everything which should be said about it <e> <s> the ministers case is based largely on only one thing the difference for the tenants between living in a local authority dwelling and living in a charitable housing association dwelling and the fact that it is unfair on the latter <e> <s> to an extent it is but we must see things in proportion <e> <s> the vast majority of people live in private rented accommodation <e> <s> this bill will do nothing at all for them <e> <s> we must keep a sense of proportion and realise that in certain cases there is a slight disadvantage for charitable housing association tenants but it will do nothing to decrease the general unfairness in housing by selecting a very small proportion of the total <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the minister has said almost nothing new and almost nothing that i have not already dealt with <e> <s> there was however his last point that a contract might perhaps exist between an inspector and a developer but there still remains the possibility of the inspector himself resigning <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that the noble lord is aware that any amendment one puts forward is always defective in one way or another <e> <s> certainly if i am lucky enough to win the division i shall take any necessary steps to tidy up the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first instance i apologise for not having put down my name on the list of speakers <e> <s> manning my front bench and having listened to the arguments i should briefly like to make one or two points <e> <s> first of all there is no doubt at all that the sdp and the alliance are in favour of reforming the house of lords but in the meantime i think that we should be making a grave mistake if we tinkered with the existing set-up which is working really very well <e> <s> we depend to a great extent on those noble lords who are still in very important positions and who are in the main hereditary coming here and vol <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is a last attempt to make the government realise what they are doing and to come to terms with the overall picture <e> <s> at the report stage the noble lord lord bellwin talked about the old guns firing against the target of the right to buy <e> <s> as one who for many years sat on the cross-benches i assure him that that is not the case <e> <s> i think that at the report stage the noble baroness lady birk covered all the things that worry us <e> <s> at this stage i select only two <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister say whether there is any reason why traffic wardens should not check on licences at the same time as they check on illegal parking and report back to the police <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl say how much money is now being allocated to wave energy bearing in mind that it does not look very hopeful from the economic point of view but might be useful at some time <e>", "<cs> my lords would i be correct in thinking that there is less trouble with the disposal of fission products with a fast breeder reactor than there is with our normal reactors <e>", "<cs> some of us even on these benches feel that this bill may be necessary <e> <s> but we are extremely concerned that the government are taking what we would consider draconian powers and that apparently every amendment which seeks to give parliament some control over this is negatived for reasons which i think are wholly inadequate <e> <s> this is being put to the country by a government who have far too large a majority for really getting a useful parliamentary feeling on matters and they are simply saying that the secretary of state will decide <e> <s> if noble lords on the government side want this bill to get a certain measure of approval by the country they will be wise to consider amendments of this sort <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble baroness agree that in the circumstances there really is no point in pursuing this matter and that that in fact it may be very harmful to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords today i propose to speak in the main about combined heat and power abbreviated as chp as it concerns district heating using our national power stations as a source of energy <e> <s> i think it may be helpful to give a brief explanation of what this means <e> <s> because of fundamental physical laws at present our best steam power stations whether coal oil or nuclear are approaching only per cent <e> <s> efficiency in generating electricity <e> <s> about per cent <e> <s> of the energy put into the steam boilers appears as waste heat in the cooling water used to condense the steam after it has passed through the turbines <e>", "<cs> i should like to make one brief point <e> <s> i think that many of us feel that for the reasons already stated this is an important position in this bill <e> <s> but if we do not put the provision in the bill now we cannot after a decision has been made on the police bill reasonably put it in <e> <s> the other aspects does not apply as we have been told <e> <s> if in regard to the new bill this kind of proposal is not agreeable then it can come out but i do not see how in practical terms it could be inserted later if at the moment it is not left in the bill before us <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> i think she appreciates that i did in fact find that out after putting down the question <e> <s> but for my benefit and for the benefit of the rest of the house can she tell us precisely what the regulations are <e> <s> might i further ask her whether she does not feel as i feel that the english pub is something unique and that nothing should be done to destroy that pub by widening the opening hours <e> <s> would she not think it would also have an adverse <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> is a paving amendment for amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> no <e> <s> is one way of dealing with the problem arising with federated unions <e> <s> they are those which are registered trade unions with smaller groups within the union <e> <s> it seems very cumbersome and expensive if ballots have to be conducted at all levels <e> <s> moreover there is the other objection that there is no guarantee that the smaller groups will be adequately represented on the main executive committee <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and raise the same point <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> also seeks to avoid this duplication of balloting by making such ballots unnecessary at the smaller group level <e> <s> if the government do not like the proposed amendments and personally i like this one very much as the last speaker has dealt with it in some detail i hope that they will seriously consider the problem which i have raised and will come forward with a proposal at the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> does he agree that the tests which are shortly to take place on the carrying flasks for nuclear rods are important in so far as they will tend to reassure the public who are in my view quite unnecessarily worried by this risk <e> <s> but will he also try to persuade the public that as a long-term measure the dangers of transporting these nuclear fuel rods even if the flasks were not as substantial as they are pale in significance beside the other dangers of chemicals transported by road of which i shall give only two instances first petro-ethyl lead which is used in petrol three drops of which on the skin can be fatal <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever criticisms are made of this bill i believe that we must all welcome its intent <e> <s> nearly all the points which i was intending to make have already been covered by the noble lord lord graham but i should like just to repeat some of the figures which i think have already been given <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make only one point <e> <s> the minister must realise that one must know what question to ask but without the information one cannot know <e> <s> it is like yes minister and all that <e>", "<cs> i think on the whole i would support this amendment <e> <s> our problem today is that we just do not have enough money to do what we would like in the housing field <e> <s> it is no use preferring one section of housing people to another <e> <s> this amendment is really saying that if a local authority cannot afford to cope and the situation is not extreme and the government are not willing to help then perhaps one cannot undertake this at that moment at all <e> <s> that is what i understand by this amendment <e> <s> if i am right then i think the amendment is reasonable <e>", "<cs> i oppose this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that the opposition is really tumbling over to help the local authorities <e> <s> surely we have got to strike a balance between their interests and those of the tenant <e> <s> in this case i should have thought that the government are right in what they have said and we should give the benefit to the tenant <e> <s> therefore this amendment should not be accepted <e>", "<cs> in general we must be thankful to the government for having shown flexibility in this bill which is not always apparent <e> <s> however having said that i think that one can draw only two <e>", "<cs> there is only one thing that can be said about this <e> <s> it seems that the government are introducing legislation the housing and building control bill was another instance which requires extra expenditure all of which presumably comes out of the same vote in the end without any guarantee that this vote will be increased <e> <s> one must point this out again and again and again <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that nitrous oxide emissions may be just as harmful as sulphur emissions and that the two together may be even worse than either <e> <s> therefore would he not think it unwise to concentrate entirely on the sulphur emissions <e>", "<cs> my lords this report highlights far wider long-term issues <e> <s> i say highlights because the issues involved are highly emotional but <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down has he seriously considered and gone into the question of the children of surrogate parentage <e> <s> does he realise even with adopted children the emotional importance of trying to find out who were their parents and so on <e> <s> it does not matter to me but it seems to matter emotionally to a lot of people <e> <s> has he really taken this into account in making his speech <e>", "<cs> my lords before the right reverend prelate sits down may i say that i agree with much of what he said <e> <s> does he realise that there are many in the unions whose sole objective is to destroy our existing society as we know it <e> <s> does he take that into account in his assessment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness satisfied that our public relations from our embassy and elsewhere with the americans as a whole are satisfactory <e> <s> if so does the noble baroness understand that most of us consider they are not <e>", "<cs> my lords i join this debate rather lightheartedly simply because i want to make the point that some people like me ask for pound coins and not notes but it is sometimes quite difficult to get them <e> <s> why do i say this <e> <s> it is because i have a purse which has a pocket which will take only tightly-folded notes and it is always a little on my conscience when folding those notes <e> <s> it is rather anti-social <e>", "<cs> my lords it is often interesting to look back at the opinions expressed some time ago <e> <s> when unemployment had exceeded million it was almost an ethic that if the figure reached million it would begin to destroy the fabric of our society <e> <s> with hindsight that view may have been overstated but a gradual erosion is now taking place and that is quite clear to nearly everyone <e> <s> it is only when people have a real grievance that extremists are listened to <e> <s> surely the spectre of unemployment is a major cause of the miners dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say why the postal codes are not put into the telephone books <e> <s> this would lead to their greater use in quite a number of cases <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that there are a number of possible scenarios and that it is very difficult to adopt any one of them <e> <s> they might range for example from an all-out nuclear attack to an attack by one nuclear weapon or a conventional attack <e> <s> does he agree that it is a mistake to concentrate on one scenario only <e>", "<cs> my lords could they not be asked to include that with the bill once or twice so that everybody is aware of it in the easiest possible way <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend this evening to be even briefer than usual <e> <s> i want to make what amounts to just one major point and give my views on a fifth terminal at heathrow <e> <s> we have been talking about a new airport or at least increased capacity for about years <e> <s> always there has been fierce opposition to and lobbies against any possible solution <e> <s> the opposition arises because there is no ideal solution and anything that we might do hurts someone or does not meet someones aspirations <e> <s> in such circumstances a decision means weighting the pros and cons impartially <e> <s> this i believe is to a great extent what this house can do <e> <s> judging from the speeches this evening i am not sure that we have not had too many partisans <e> <s> personally i believe that in his report the inspector did weight these pros and cons impartially <e> <s> another place did not do so <e> <s> it really is absurd that we should waste quite substantial funds and time on an inquiry and then seem to go back to the first square <e>", "<cs> my lords two hours ago the best estimate i had for my unstarred question was oclock and i thought it would be kindly to your lordships that i should withdraw it which is what i have done with agreement from the only other two speakers who put their names down <e> <s> my unstarred question has now been put down for thursday of next week when i am told that the house does not have very much business <e> <s> i very much hope that those who are interested in pensions and the possible taxation of pensions will find it possible to speak <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i have finished <e>", "<cs> my lords broadly speaking i think the report is excellent as are most of its recommendations <e> <s> unfortunately our problems in this field have their roots in the distant past and have only recently become so acute that they are obvious to all <e>", "<cs> my lords in i read the report of lord pearsons royal commission on this subject and i prepared a speech <e> <s> however in the event i was unable to deliver it <e> <s> unfortunately i cannot trace my notes and without sufficient time i have been able only to glance at the report again <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that the real sticking point of course is the design of the engines some of which at present require lead in the petrol <e> <s> would it not be a good thing if he pressed manufacturers rather harder to produce cars which could use lead-free petrol as soon as it is produced rather than lagging behind in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say first of all that i think the noble lord lord pitt has introduced his bill in a very moderate way although i disagree with it root and branch <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this amendment is very reasonable <e> <s> however what worries me about it is how the unfluoridated water could reasonably be made available <e> <s> were it not for that fact i should support the amendment completely <e>", "<cs> my lords five years ago i would without any doubt have supported this bill <e> <s> but since then there has been more evidence that just possibly fluoridation might have adverse effects <e> <s> as we know it is a form of compulsory medication and it must be justified as such <e> <s> therefore a review in the light of all the facts and particularly the medical facts must be made <e> <s> it is important to place a time limit on doing this because otherwise it goes by default <e> <s> i strongly support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords there are just two points i should like to raise <e> <s> the first concerns the drinking water <e> <s> it is of course normal for drinking water to come direct from the main and not from the roof tanks <e> <s> can part of the investigation assure us that for cooking and everything else there is adequate drinking water available direct from the main <e> <s> one has a suspicion that that may not be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords may i again return to the subject of drinking water and raise one point <e> <s> as one who has been concerned with the model by-laws for water may i point out that drinking from a tap which is connected to a roof tank is in fact discouraged because if the tank is not adequately covered one gets bird mice and other droppings in it <e> <s> therefore the water purity depends partially on what protection <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say why it appears so difficult for a large firm to design and manufacture a new engine whereas a very small firm like aston martin to the best of my belief produced or gets produced an engine without any trouble at all <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister say what progress is being made in the common market on research and whether or not they are ahead of us <e>", "<cs> i have listened to most but not quite all of this debate and it seems to me perfectly clear that we are right to take every precaution that we can to prevent innocent people being convicted but i think it is equally clear that unless we take a fairly bold line then this bill will be a completely dead letter <e> <s> i believe that far too much has been made on amendment no <e> <s> about the dangers of innocent people being committed <e> <s> after all i think that sensibly any motorist except possibly a stranger to a district must realise that in red light districts and districts where prostitutes are if one keeps stopping a <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that perhaps a very important reason why the places should be named is that if there is to be an investigation into the hotels and boarding houses as he said there will be unless people know what is happening and know that other places are involved and unless there is a free statement of the whole position absolute panic will be created <e> <s> to my mind the situation could have been absolutely disastrous had the statement not been made <e>", "<cs> my lords first i must apologise and ask the indulgence of the house and the government for now making a speech which clearly should have been made on the first day of the debate <e> <s> i wrote the speech and then found that other engagements prevented me from delivering it when i should have done <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the greatest admiration for the noble lord lord mishcon and he puts forward his case which really tears our hearts <e> <s> but i think that what he is really doing is producing a bill which is totally ineffective <e> <s> he is trying to show the dangers which there always are of wrong conviction <e> <s> but i would think that they are almost minimal <e> <s> in the first place i do not think that the police will he looking anywhere except in areas where prostitutes are common <e> <s> therefore most sensible people will not crawl down the kerb in those areas <e> <s> that is one point <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> does he realise that when i went up the a the other day from here it took me five-and-a-quarter hours to get to hull instead of the normal three-and-a half <e> <s> surely he would agree that his answer is unsatisfactory in so far as that while it is difficult to lay bitumen in the winter there is a large portion of the year when it can be laid <e> <s> can he give me an assurance that in future whoever is responsible will try a little harder to produce some other sensible course rather than close two important and to some degree alternative roads at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that there were about eight areas on the a up to doncaster which were single lane for stretches of one or two miles is there really any co-ordination between the different authorities which are repairing the various sections <e> <s> my doubt is whether there is any such co-ordination which is why there was such a massive hold-up on the a <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not put my name down to speak but i feel that this is an extremely important debate <e> <s> i am sorry that it was set down on a friday as an unstarred question because it raises so many matters of real importance to the nation <e> <s> i do not propose to speak for more than a few minutes certainly not more than five <e> <s> i should like to make one or two points <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down there is one point which worries me though i did not interrupt him <e> <s> he seemed to say and i may have got it entirely wrong that he equated the manufacturing and the service industries as equally important <e> <s> i am not sure how he defines a service industry but surely it is only the manufacturing industry which contributes to the health of the nation and the balance of payments <e> <s> surely on that ground it is wrong to equate them or consider them as equal <e>", "<cs> my lords i owe your lordships house two apologies first for not having put down my name to speak and secondly for not having heard all the speeches though i have listened to a number of them <e> <s> i should not take more than three minutes over what i wish to say <e> <s> yes our present licensing laws by any standards are anachronistic <e> <s> but is there a real advantage in altering them <e> <s> i do not believe that they constitute any real inroad into the freedom of anyone <e> <s> what one has to consider when altering anything are the side effects <e> <s> there has already been reference to the possibility of greater alcoholism the possibility that the commercial chap will spend longer in the pub will leave at oclock and will be even more drunk on the road <e> <s> that is certainly something we can think about <e> <s> i do not wish however to argue that point tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that there is a problem now and possibly there will be one more so in the future in so far as some countries one of them being in south america will not allow imports of tractors <e> <s> this is presumably because they have their own firms which make them <e> <s> will the noble lord agree that this is becoming an increasing problem for firms which are exporting from the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply which has been much more encouraging than i imagined it would be <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that there is a wave generator which is being constructed in norway on i gather the lines of our own research and that the japanese are following on <e> <s> does he not think that perhaps it is a pity that our thinking about wave generation has always been in too ambitious terms and that there is a great advantage in keeping in being a small research team which can quickly take advantage of any breakthrough that may come <e> <s> finally does the noble lord agree that we can never quite tell what will be useful because we do not know what will be the price of competitive energy in the years to come <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness confirm that the new legislation will make some attempt to follow through the profits however they may have been disposed of and however difficult it may be to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in favour of too much consultation <e> <s> nevertheless in many areas one does want a watchdog who can put forward the point of view of the minority and whose existence is just to do that <e> <s> many of us are really frightened about the bill and fear that those who will suffer or who may suffer simply will not have a big enough voice <e> <s> it is highly desirable that some body should be in existence which even if it does not wholly represent that minority is nevertheless able to look after interests of this type <e> <s> indeed the type of interests about which i have been talking can so easily be ignored when money is at stake and the council is thinking about something else <e> <s> let us not forget that it is not always so easy to take your case to a member of the council <e> <s> people do not do that it is difficult to do <e> <s> people do not even know the names of their councillors i do not <e> <s> therefore i do not think that the arguments put forward on the other side are very convincing <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> i take it that what he is saying is that at the moment the matter is virtually <e>", "<cs> my lords in my speech today i shall deal with several matters which i believe are important to the future of the country <e> <s> however there is a central theme running through my remarks men of integrity must put their shoulder to the wheel in the national interest and not simply reflect or give priority to party prejudices and shibboleths <e> <s> as a nation we are still divided in a way which other european countries have to a great extent overcome <e> <s> unfortunately the them and us syndrome is still with us and for different reasons the government and the labour parties have if anything fostered those differences <e> <s> i shall expand on that later <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall speak only briefly on this subject because i have insufficient detailed knowledge to form opinions except on the wider issues <e> <s> i think we have now all realised that due to ever-increasing high technology the costs of some projects have soared to a point where no european nation can afford to go it alone <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the russians are burning coal with a per cent <e> <s> sulphur content whereas our own is something nearer per cent <e> <s> it seems that the trouble in germany is certainly caused by the sulphur coming from russia and not from anywhere else <e> <s> what steps are being taken to bring pressure on the russians to do something about it <e>", "<cs> my lords before i briefly make my own points i shall pick up just one issue public inquiries <e> <s> i realise that this point has been made in several other speeches before but it is of some importance <e> <s> for years and years very actively we have been discussing a channel tunnel so the question has been well ventilated <e> <s> public inquiries on both sides of the house know full well have become completely out of hand <e> <s> until something is done to prevent minority and other interested groups holding up decisions for years we should avoid their use in the national interest <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down would he answer just one question <e> <s> bearing in mind the experience we already have with the bristol channel bridge and bearing in mind that his proposal takes into account very high technology what life does he think there will be for the bridge and what maintenance costs does he anticipate as compared of course with the alternative which is likely to last years that is a bored tunnel <e>", "<cs> my lords to save time i should like to say that we support both the nightwear safety regulations and the regulations concerning pushchairs which we shall deal with later <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether he realises that probably one of the biggest problems in the safety of goods concerns goods which are imported <e> <s> at the moment it does not seem that anybody can take sufficiently quick action on goods which suddenly come in for some firm which makes a quick profit and then disappears overnight <e> <s> will the noble lord take this particular point seriously <e> <s> because that is how the worst of the unsafe goods arrive on the market <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say what is being done in other countries which must experience the same problem and what solutions they have come to <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree on a rather broader issue that although it is important to hold these inquiries if they go on as some inquiries have done and as this one has done it will be impossible to carry on with this procedure <e> <s> will the government consider what steps ought to be taken to prevent abuse of these inquiries so that decisions which often are required quickly or fairly quickly can be made and we can continue with what is in essence an important procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness not agree that on the whole britain is overpopulated and if people choose to shorten their lives that is their own affair <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall that the invergordon aluminium smelter which was sited on purpose near cheap hydro-electric power or so it was thought had to be closed because the tariff was the same whether it had local hydro-electric power or not <e> <s> does he not agree that there is a strong case for considering that sort of thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> would she not agree that the statistics as they stand are alarmist misleading and unethical certainly as coming from a body of the stature of the bma <e> <s> would she further agree that their effect is not to do what we would all like to do which is to stop young people taking up smoking but to lead to the harassment of those who despite knowing the facts decide to continue to smoke <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate is very timely at the start of the year because the secretary of state for energy has designated energy efficiency year <e> <s> almost everyone agrees that more efficient use of energy is very cost-effective and important in conserving our north sea oil and gas reserves <e> <s> in fact it is sometimes referred to as the fifth fuel <e> <s> in the government set up an energy efficient office which provides advice to industry <e> <s> i gather that further increased funds are being made available to extend its activities <e>", "<cs> my lords am i right in believing that if by any unfortunate chance smallpox broke out somewhere in the world then we should require the original smallpox stock in order to make a vaccine to deal with the disease and that therefore it must be retained somewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the spread of disease requires with one or two exceptions a substantial number of bacilli before infection occurs <e> <s> therefore if it is wind-borne and it comes from a very large herd is there not a greater chance of infecting others than if it comes from a small number of pigs and where again the bacilli is distributed by the wind <e> <s> it is therefore less effective <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i should like to thank all the noble lords who have spoken and in particular of course the leader of the house who i think has understood what i was trying to do and has given a very sympathetic consideration to my approach <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord annan will remember that some years ago after his reith lecture i initiated a debate on whether university education was fulfilling the long-term needs of the nation as a whole <e> <s> i spoke again on this issue on st march <e> <s> i do not believe that on the first occasion we were in complete agreement but having listened to what he said tonight i think we are probably very nearly so <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a good debate and many speakers have made clear their doubts about the bill <e> <s> the minister has done little to reassure the house because we genuinely doubt whether privatisation and the provisions of the bill can possibly achieve the governments avowed objectives <e> <s> having said that i shall now give my own views which in the main express what has already been said in rather different words <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely convinced by the ministers arguments but nevertheless i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that very helpful reply <e> <s> i feel sure that he knows what is the spirit of the amendment and that something along its lines will be possible <e>", "<cs> may i simply ask the noble lord whether in his office there is a copy of <e>", "<cs> throughout this bill what we are really concerned with is trying to protect the consumer <e> <s> one has the horrid feeling that this is going to be a very difficult job <e> <s> of course one also realises that on the other side of the coin the government do not want to frighten off anybody who is taking over the gas industry by producing anything which may in the end produce difficulties for them commercially <e> <s> that i think puts the situation fairly <e> <s> i am sure that the government really want to protect the consumer but we are not convinced that there are sufficient provisions in this bill to make sure that that will happen <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord simply does not realise how many of us have the gravest doubts about the privatisation of the gas industry <e> <s> as one said on second reading the obviously sensible course were it not for the fact that the government want the money for the next election would have been to find out how things went with british telecom <e> <s> they ought not to rush into another privatisation which is opposed by a very large number of people <e> <s> what these amendments really seek to do is to say for goodness sake at the last moment leave yourselves the opportunity of waiting and having more sense than rushing ahead bald-headed <e>", "<cs> i cannot understand how it is possible to argue that share ownerhip is of the slightest importance though of course in a company such as vickers it means a lot <e> <s> shareholders have no control and they will not attend annual meetings <e> <s> i think this is a complete and utter red herring <e>", "<cs> that is a different matter <e>", "<cs> at the outset i ought to declare an interest in so far as i am to some degree connected with the ema trades union which is concerned with electric power generation <e> <s> i have down an amendment amendment no <e> <s> a which is similar to this one <e> <s> i propose not to move mine but to speak to this one <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the noble lord has really appreciated the spirit in which this amendment has been put forward <e> <s> he has not really answered anything <e> <s> i do not mean to be unkind but in certain ways it is what one might almost call a political speech <e> <s> nobody has suggested that there should be a rigid framework or that the government should rush in <e> <s> the powers are there only in case they have to be used <e> <s> the noble lord has not addressed the point that the cegb has to take coal at an enormous price when it could go out and buy it much cheaper <e> <s> all that he has not appreciated at all and i earnestly ask him to go back and have a look at what we were trying to say to him because he simply has not addressed himself to a problem which is going to arise <e> <s> he has just rather cheaply and i am afraid i must say cheaply argued that british gas is going to do too well <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble baroness agree that there is everything to be said for vaccination because if anything goes wrong you can now get compensation but if you are not vaccinated there is an almost equal chance of getting the same side effects for which there is no compensation available <e>", "<cs> my lords it should be said that at least a part of the condition of the shipbuilding industry is due to the unions demarcation disputes and inefficient methods of working <e> <s> the same happened in our docks on the thames <e> <s> that should never be repeated in another industry <e> <s> i hope that the lesson has been learnt but it never seems to be <e>", "<cs> i certainly was not moving amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> that is a much more important amendment and if it were earlier in the day and we had not just had a division it is one that i would certainly have divided upon <e> <s> this particular amendment is important but it is nothing like as important as no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> i am not certain <e> <s> i may not move that amendment <e>", "<cs> i am certainly willing to withdraw this amendment but i am not wholly satisfied that the minister has taken the points i was trying to make or that i have taken the points that he was trying to make <e> <s> so without any commitment i would ask him whether with his advisers he will read what i said because it seems that things have gone wrong in the past and i do not see what provisions there are in the bill to prevent them going wrong in the future <e> <s> that is really the case and so i would ask him to have another look at what i said and i shall certainly have another look at what he said <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that that is not quite what i said <e> <s> what i said was that the government had for a long time tried to keep a reasonable balance in prices between the four fuels <e> <s> but i then went on to say that this amendment was concerned with a far narrower field and that was to keep fair competition between them <e> <s> this amendment is concerned only with fair competition and not with fixing prices <e>", "<cs> i know the noble lord is doing his best but his best is no better than it was on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> he simply does not address himself to the points at issue namely fair competition and a reserve power for the government but not one that has to be used <e> <s> we heard all that was said about using the power but no one is suggesting that it is used like that <e> <s> why we should disagree on this matter still utterly defeats me <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i can only say that i wish that the noble lord had given the same attention to my amendment amendment no <e> <s> a as he has given to this one which is of little consequence <e> <s> i am impressed by what he said and i shall with pleasure withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this amendment is a little difficult to understand on the face of it but we have had two speakers who have explained it at some length and i should like to do so more briefly <e> <s> the main point is that local airports that could obtain private capital from outside are by the bill prevented from doing so <e> <s> this is because such capital will be <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have introduced this bill under the pretext of trying to simplify the social security system and to ensure that help is given to those in greatest need <e> <s> that is something we would all welcome but hidden beneath the facade is a bill that cuts million from housing benefits makes everyone even the poorest pay at least per cent <e> <s> of their rates makes some young unemployed worse off revises upwards the age <e>", "<cs> my lords nearly everyone today would think that we should discourage the young from taking up smoking both on medical and financial grounds <e> <s> this bill makes useful provisions for helping to do so <e> <s> it is tacitly supported by a major tobacco company <e> <s> having said this it must be realised that some people always seek some means of relaxing tensions and tobacco is less obnoxious than some of the alternatives <e> <s> if the noble lord lord pitt wants to achieve a useful piece of legislation i would urge him to reject all amendments to widen the bill which are based on opinions not shared by many of us <e> <s> if he does <e>", "<cs> my lords i was only referring to one matter and that was the cost of the national health service <e> <s> i think that that is a faulty argument <e>", "<cs> i am sure we would all agree on the importance of seeing that the elderly are protected <e>", "<cs> it is clear from what has been said that we should look at this again before report <e> <s> it may be that the bill is just not clear in which case some amendment is required <e> <s> one would hope that the government will put it forward <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely satisfied with what the noble lord the minister has said because if may is deleted from that part of the amendment one is still left with another may in subsection above it so one is not really tying it down <e> <s> nevertheless i do not think it is a point that i wish to pursue certainly not at this time of night and therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this amendment and my own amendment amendment no <e> <s> have precisely the same object in view but i must start by declaring an interest in so far as i have a connection with the ema trade union which is very closely connected with the electrical power industry <e>", "<cs> i do not believe in wasting time and so i shall simply say a few words to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> he has of course repeated what was said in another place and he has not really addressed himself to the problem that i mentioned of the smaller firms <e> <s> the larger firms can probably take care of themselves unless of course for some technical reason they are committed to using let us say gas <e> <s> it would be a waste of time to repeat what i said earlier <e> <s> but i very much hope that the noble lord the minister will read what i have said and will seriously consider the problem of the smaller firms <e> <s> i may come back to this question on report <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords might it not be a useful step forward if spain were to offer dual nationality to those in gibraltar <e>", "<cs> the amendment in part deals with what i was trying to put forward in a previous amendment <e> <s> one is worried because there will be competition among various fuels and small businesses cannot change overnight from gas to electricity and so on as perhaps most larger companies can <e> <s> one feels that it is vital that small businesses should be protected and encouraged as much as possible <e> <s> the amendment goes a long towards doing that <e>", "<cs> i agree with what was said about the non-portable pension <e> <s> i left the army in <e> <s> i suppose that i worked outside for eight or years <e> <s> my pension for those times is precisely a year <e> <s> i thank the noble baroness and the government for being flexible on this issue which worries many of us <e> <s> i did not expect for one moment that she would agree to scrap the per cent <e> <s> incentive <e> <s> i now call it an incentive and not a bribe <e>", "<cs> we are more concerned about keeping occupational pensions as they ought to be keeping them at the same level of provision as they are at the moment <e> <s> i am extremely happy therefore to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness has herself said this is rather complicated <e> <s> i should like to study what she has said and consider further action if any at report stage <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for a very full explanation <e> <s> what i wanted to do at this stage has been achieved and therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that a debate on defence would not be very useful if everyone simply put forward their partys line <e> <s> i do not propose to do so <e> <s> my remarks are my own thinking but with very few exceptions are not far out of line with the recently published alliance report <e>", "<cs> my lords i came in a little late on this question <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord if it has not already been asked whether he appreciates that the emissions from knocks in other words from cars are as important in acid rain as the sulphur <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the issue behind this amendment is probably the most important that we have had to consider on this bill so <e>", "<cs> could adversely affect what my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am rather surprised at the two noble lords who spoke against the amendment because although i understand that one can take the view that it is unnecessary i should have thought that that was the only logical view that one could take <e> <s> the amendment simply says <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that an alternative to bottle banks is to have a deposit on the bottle <e> <s> this means that the bottles can go back in the empty lorry after it delivers the new ones <e> <s> does he agree that although this is probably unpopular it should nevertheless be considered as an alternative where the distances are great <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down does he fully appreciate the loss in productivity as a result of our unemployment and does he fully take into account the cost in social benefits of those numbers <e> <s> the noble lord has argued that many of the unemployed are only unemployed for a short time which is heartening so far as concerns the social aspect <e> <s> however does the noble lord realise the appalling cost to the nation of unemployment as it is today <e>", "<cs> my lords surely no tenant in his senses would want to go to an area as windy and as bleak as those suitable for wind turbines <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that emissions of nitrous oxides from vehicles are probably as important as sulphur emissions from power stations and if he agrees will he therefore ensure that this problem also is taken into account in any discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord answer the previous question <e> <s> he did not mention the russian satellite countries and my information is that they are using coal with per cent <e> <s> sulphur and that they are the major polluters in europe particularly in germany where the forests are dying <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree that if we go to coal which is probably the only major alternative to nuclear power the problem is not only one of acid rain but of the greenhouse effect <e> <s> is he aware that all scientific evidence today indicates that this could be absolutely disastrous to our civilisation <e> <s> is it not folly to give up nuclear power and merely have to go into another area where the risks are far greater for future generations <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> will the noble lord agree that there is little chance of selling our products overseas unless we buy them ourselves <e> <s> will he further bear in mind that gec has put up million and that already its answer and its development seem as though it will meet the requirements <e> <s> finally will the noble lord say when a decision is due on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords first i too should like to congratulate the noble viscount lord torrington and his committee on producing an excellent report <e> <s> it is relatively short but entirely adequate <e> <s> the committee has made some references to important parts of the evidence which makes reference easy <e> <s> i hope this will become a precedent because the record of evidence is to say the least indigestible and i suspect very often unread <e>", "<cs> my lords before discussing the provisions of product liability in this bill i should like to take a rather wider and philosophical view of the problem <e> <s> this is because we ought to consider the longer term implications and try to decide how and to what extent consumer protection and compensation should be extended in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset i wish to make it quite clear that the views i express are mine and that in some areas they are not so far indicated to be the views of our leader dr owen <e> <s> first i pay tribute to the late lord spens who at a time when it was very unpopular to do so put forward the turkish point of view with the intention of counteracting some of the extreme greek propaganda <e> <s> i have visited northern cyprus three times with him and twice since <e> <s> i was also a member of the cpa delegation which visited greek cyprus but my concern goes far deeper than that <e>", "<cs> i earnestly ask the government to consider this proposal in the drugs field in particular <e> <s> anyone who knows anything about international consumer affairs will know the appalling things that the multinational drug companies do in foisting unsafe drugs on to developing countries without even adequate instructions <e> <s> that is a major scandal <e> <s> it must be stopped <e> <s> i ask the government to look at this amendment in that respect <e> <s> it is no good saying that the countries themselves can easily stop it they do not and they cannot because they are developing countries <e> <s> it is morally completely wrong to foist dangerous drugs on a market for purchase without adequate instructions <e> <s> i hope that the government will look at this <e> <s> there is plenty of evidence as to what is happening which they can obtain for example from the consumers association <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord help me by saying whether or not this section or the amendment applies to drugs <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree i think that he does that the existing old law which i believe dates from the th century is ridiculous and hedged around by a great many completely arbitrary assumptions <e> <s> is he aware that in surrey recently coin hoards on private property thought to be valued at some were taken out of the ground largely at night and appeared in europe and that some of the prosecutions brought against the few offenders who were found did not succeed because the law is so unsatisfactory in that respect <e> <s> finally <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that a good bill amending this legislation went through all its stages in this house and was lost in another place purely fortuitously <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that this motion is being debated <e> <s> with the inevitable decline in north sea oil and gas resources energy conservation is of vital importance to this nation and i am sure that in the long term energy costs will rise <e>", "<cs> my lords after nearly speakers i do not think one can really say anything that is new <e> <s> all one can do is to make the points one was going to make and so possibly add emphasis to what other people have said <e> <s> i have always been in favour of a rail tunnel between england and france but not in favour of either a road tunnel or a road bridge <e> <s> however i do not think i need give my reasons against the road link tonight <e> <s> i believe that a rail link will give us several important advantages <e> <s> not everyone enjoys the sea crossing and the quicker rail route will provide a useful alternative <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to speak at any length on the sizewell report itself <e> <s> all it says in effect is that the proposed pwr at sizewell could be safe that it will probably and that was the word used produce cheaper electricity than the agr and even cheaper than a coal-fired power station <e> <s> the report also draws attention to some areas where safety might be further improved <e> <s> as regards the last point i am really shocked to learn that the nuclear inspectorate is undermanned and that the pay of its inspectors does not even equate with the opposite numbers in the cegb <e> <s> in spite of all this some penny pinching decision made i suppose in the treasury moved the headquarters up north resulting in the loss of many very able people <e> <s> the more able they are the more easily they find jobs and therefore the greater the loss <e> <s> the inspectors ought to be paid much more than their counterparts in industry <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a most useful debate <e> <s> every speaker has had something valuable to contribute and most of them spoke from a detailed knowledge which i myself do not possess <e> <s> i should like to thank all noble lords who have taken part and particularly i thank the noble baroness lady platt because i know that she was on a very well earned holday and came to the house specially to speak in this debate <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the motion for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt if anybody would disagree with the terms of this motion <e> <s> the object must be to consider the reasons for decline in our manufacturing industry and to decide what should be done to improve the situation <e> <s> i am no longer directly concerned with industry so i intend to concentrate on the historical reasons for decline with reference to my own experiences since just before the last war <e> <s> for me this is an unusual approach but in my view knowledge of where we have failed in the past still has a direct relevance to the changes and improvements that we must make today <e> <s> i hope as my wife feared that this approach will not simply be regarded as a old mans recollections of a bygone age <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the money for rescue is decided well in advance and that insufficient funds are allowed for rescue excavations arising later in the year that would have received high priority had the facts been known earlier <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that there is a grave difficulty for someone who finds himself in that position <e> <s> what is likely to happen is that he will be charged by two local authorities <e> <s> i suppose that the person will then say i prefer this one and the local <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord been up to see fylingdales as i have many times <e> <s> if he has does he agree with me that it possibly provides an interesting feature in a very large area of plain moorland and that the environmental aspect except to enthusiasts does not arise <e>", "<cs> my lords the essence of this motion has been expressed many times in different ways by thinking people of all parties because our nation is still divided for example by class to a greater degree than many others in the west <e> <s> many of us hoped that as the division between the working man and the white-collared person became blurred and the ownership of cars and other desired consumer products became more common so would class differences largely disappear <e> <s> admittedly the extreme manifestation of a privileged aristocracy is no more <e> <s> however the them and us syndrome remains <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> i take it that there is no major programme for the insulation of existing housing stock <e> <s> does the noble baroness agree that if there were such a programme it might well save us another power station in the future <e> <s> as the government have already said insulation is highly cost-effective <e> <s> therefore why do they not promote it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that some water authorities are finding such difficulty in keeping nitrates within the ec limits that they have increasingly used borehole water rather than surface water <e> <s> in certain circumstances that practice will lower the water table with appalling results for buildings and other structures <e> <s> as has been said the sitution is getting worse <e> <s> the problem must be tackled if we are to keep within ec limits <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord nugent has made almost precisely the point that i was going to make <e> <s> does not the minister agree that if we do not do something about this we are in grave danger of slipping down that road here and that also applies to other practices that america has followed <e> <s> there you receive vast compensation if you win but if you have the same suffering and you cannot prove negligence you get nothing <e> <s> will the government come to terms with this major problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to repeat all i said in my speech on this subject on nd march but i must emphasise some points which i then made <e> <s> first although i support all work on renewable sources of energy it must be accepted that for a very long time they cannot possibly do more than provide a small addition to our primary energy requirements <e> <s> we have to rely in the main for the foreseeable future on coal and nuclear generation <e>", "<cs> my lords this order has been some time in draft and is or at any rate at the start was surely a stalking horse for much wider privatisation of electricity generation <e> <s> in fact as the proposed new lignite burning station at crumlin could provide up to per cent <e> <s> of northern irelands electricity needs it therefore would represent a major step in privatising the whole industry <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall that last year after the recess there was a bill dealt with in the spill-over session i cannot remember what it was and the majority of amendments came from the government <e> <s> does this not show quite clearly that they had not had time to consider that bill properly <e> <s> the same applies to most bills going through our chamber today <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that reply <e> <s> does he agree with me that the building regulations provide a good and useful place for minimum insulation but that if the government are as keen as they say they are to increase energy efficiency and insulation then it must be up to the private sector to provide even better standards <e> <s> is he aware that it will not do so unless the public are interested and become increasingly <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply but does he not agree that there is considerable delay in government departments in producing any paper and that if it is possible to cut that down it should be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble and learned lord for that reply may i ask what steps if any have been taken to find out whether all county courts are being as helpful as they should be <e> <s> is the noble and learned lord aware that in my experience some county courts are helpful while others are not <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak as a layman although on paper i am a barrister <e> <s> we talk about the rule of law and i think it is very important that that should remain in england and also that our judicial system should remain at least the equal of any other <e> <s> i question whether it is <e> <s> the delays which we have heard about tonight make the rule of law impossible in my view <e> <s> i do not propose to suggest tonight what the solutions are <e> <s> but something ought to have been done long ago <e> <s> the situation as it is today is intolerable <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he agree that the points i raised this evening go beyond one department <e> <s> will he consider what might be done to bring in other ministries to consider the problem <e> <s> perhaps that will mean that a wide-ranging committee ought to be set up possibly within the civil service because the issues go far wider than merely medical issues <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree that any large project has some unfortunate environmental effect and provided that it is not excessive that is no reason for turning the project down <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble and learned lord agree that as things stand the law on negligence as applied to this sort of case is simply a lottery <e> <s> there are many people who either cannot afford to sue or who suffer equally and who get no recompense at all <e> <s> would he think it fair and some amelioration that some proportion of the huge damages awarded should be put towards helping those who suffer equally and who cannot prove negligence <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us why the coin appeared and has now disappeared <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his answer <e> <s> is he aware that for example in guildford there is a two-and-a-half year waiting list for hip operations and that many people suffer acute pain night and day and are taking increasing amounts of drugs <e> <s> will the minister consider whether it is possible to make it easier for people to transfer to a waiting list in another area where there is less delay <e>", "<cs> i fear that i must to some extent disagree with my noble colleague lord hunt <e> <s> i pay tribute to what environmentalists have achieved over the years <e> <s> i have some sympathy with what the amendment seeks to achieve <e> <s> there is however a grave danger of enthusiasm getting out of hand <e> <s> almost every major project has some unfortunate environmental aspects which must be balanced against the advantages or necessity of the project <e> <s> to hand over as the amendment does and to weight the decision in favour of the environmentalists i fear might lead to disaster <e> <s> it is only too easy for enthusiasts to put forward an issue and push it to the ultimate <e> <s> in that case what happens <e> <s> priority would have to be given to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that assurance <e> <s> however he has not taken the point that this bill is badly drafted and obscure in this clause <e> <s> i asked whether it could be made clearer <e> <s> surely we want bills that can be understood certainly by the legal profession and preferably by somebody who is not legally trained <e> <s> this paragraph which affects the nic is obscure to say the least <e> <s> nevertheless having said that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this is enabling legislation and perhaps the last chance of influencing the governments policy for privatisation of the electricity industry <e> <s> since yesterdays statement it is clear that no major changes in their policy are likely <e> <s> nevertheless i still think it is not inappropriate to state the objections to the policy and perhaps at later stages of the implementation some notice may be taken of what i say since i represent the views of many <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not the point i made <e> <s> i was saying that there is a limit how far current can be shipped economically <e> <s> if it is shipped too far the reactive component will destablise the grid <e> <s> it is a technical point that i made and nothing else <e>", "<cs> it may be convenient if i speak now on the other two amendments <e> <s> as we know clause a defines the circumstances in which a union member attending a principal executive committee must be elected <e> <s> however paragraph b makes an exception <e>", "<cs> i just want to make one further point on incidental <e> <s> it seems to me that even taking into account what has been said in another place it does not in any way restrict the clause <e> <s> the very fact that it is there seems to me that it might be a wonderful arguing point for lawyers <e> <s> if you omit it i do not think subsection ab loses anything at all from the governments point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to deal at any length with the white paper despite the fact that i know that the minister believed that some noble lords would do so <e> <s> i had the opportunity of putting forward some general criticisms when we discussed the enabling legislation <e> <s> i shall therefore follow the convention that has been established today and make only one remark namely that the six <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that we are facing two problems <e> <s> the first problem is that the increase in high-tech is constantly demanding a substantial increase in the resources of the national health service <e> <s> secondly it is arguable that the service may not have been as efficient as it could have been but that does not excuse the government cutting off funds with the idea of increasing efficiency when they are considering a long-term solution to the problems <e> <s> in the meantime <e>", "<cs> my lords in a short speech one cannot hope to cover more than a few provisions of the bill <e> <s> in general most people both parents and teachers think that in spite of some valid criticisms ilea has not done too badly during the past two years <e> <s> abolishing it outright means initially a state of chaos while the boroughs take over during the two years allowed <e> <s> but it will take far longer before the new system settles down and any possible advantages can accrue <e> <s> this fact should be perfectly obvious from previous experiences for example the reorganisation of the social services <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that uranium oxide is used for military and civilian purposes and that it is pointless to decide which portion of the uranium has gone where <e> <s> one might just as well mix it up and say that some has gone to one place and some to the other <e>", "<cs> my lords with this list of speakers it would be difficult to raise many matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> however can he assure me that there will be no difference in the requirement for the government to give permission after the electricity industry is privatised <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to spend long discussing the governments overall policy on privatisation but rather to point out where it is likely to fail <e> <s> however i must again repeat that the six principles in the white paper are nothing more than a political statement and a pious hope without any foundation for their realistion <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl agree when the new programme has arrived and been built that there will still be a strong case for the old village-type hospital because it is near it cuts down the travelling time and provides a facility for those who are getting on in years geriatrics and so forth <e> <s> although they may be more expensive to run surely would it not be a mistake to close down such hospitals purely on the grounds of small economy <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that peoples intake of aluminium comes primarily from food and medicaments and not from water <e> <s> if it is thought desirable to control that intake the government should look first at aluminium canning and such things in the medicine field as buffered aspirin emulsifiers and pickling agents <e> <s> if we are concerned it might be wise even at this time to have some control to lessen the aluminium being taken in from those major sources <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add from these benches our sympathy for all those concerned and our congratulations to those who dealt with the emergency <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord ezra <e> <s> before the inquiry we should see whether there is any lesson that can be learnt straight away <e> <s> of course such accidents occur <e> <s> they sometimes occur because people have become used to the conditions they are working under and have not been as careful as perhaps they should have been <e> <s> or it may be that there is something which people had not realised was a possible danger <e> <s> both those aspects should be looked at <e> <s> i hope however that before the inquiry no steps will be taken as panic measures <e> <s> we want to look at this kind of thing quietly and do our best to ensure that it never recurs <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that the reduction in income tax has done nothing to help because much of the extra money has been spent on importing luxury goods from abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords since nitrous oxides also have a greenhouse effect would it not be <e>", "<cs> many of us believe that the bill cannot have any immediate useful effect <e> <s> in fact it may have quite the reverse because there are undoubtedly illegally held shotguns which will appear on the black market <e> <s> however i believe that those of us and i include myself who support the bill are concerned with the future <e> <s> there is no doubt that a few years ago there were very few armed robberies <e> <s> however at present in the metropolitan area alone i believe that there have been something like armed robberies <e> <s> therefore i am afraid that the argument put forward by the noble lord who has just spoken that these weapons and others have been held for many years perfectly safely does not carry great weight with me <e> <s> we must look at the increasing crime rate and the increasing use of guns <e> <s> i believe that that is what the bill is about and it should not be weakened <e>", "<cs> in my youth many comparatively young people had no teeth at all <e> <s> whatever may be said about people being logical the fact is that they are not <e> <s> when one is young one does not always think about the future <e> <s> in my own case i did not give much thought to my future financial position <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the relatively small amount of nuclear and radiological waste from our power stations does not present any technological problem and that it is merely a question of finding the right sites and convincing the public that there is no problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> am i correct in thinking that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> however is he aware that many of us believe that the majority of the tax cuts which have gone into the consumers pockets have not been spent in the united kingdom <e> <s> if that is so does not the minister agree bearing in mind our problems with overseas payments and our difficulty in providing adequate funds for education and other urgent projects that it is folly to consider any further tax cuts as i understand the government are still doing <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble and learned lord accept that whatever the difficulties the present law of negligence is just a lottery and that many people who might claim under it are quite unable to risk the costs of doing so in the high court <e> <s> if one can only realise that there is a problem one is half way to solving it <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that in both these large conferences the local people gained considerable benefit <e> <s> hotels other establishments and people in the locality gained <e> <s> does he further agree that the costs that are put forward are probably not quite true because although extra police may have to be brought in from elsewhere that represents to a great extent redeployment for a short period of existing forces <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount agree that at universities most undergraduates are taught by unqualified teachers and that very little has been done even to hold seminars in universities to teach how to teach <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it must have been more than years ago that when i was talking to the leader of the then opposition he gave me this advice never speak on a subject on which you are not fully informed <e> <s> however he added we politicians unfortunately often have to <e> <s> i have tried to follow that advice <e> <s> i am not personally informed about what is happening in the gas industry and how far privatisation with limited statutory control may be being abused <e> <s> however on the broad issues which also affect the privatisation of the electrical generating and distribution industries i have no hesitation in speaking in support of the noble lord lord ezra <e>", "<cs> my lords i had better take the precaution of saying that possibly may be unable to stay to the end of the debate because i have a long-standing dinner engagement in fact with british nuclear fuels <e> <s> i was a member of panel b which produced the report and i do not disagree with the findings as far as they go <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that helpful reply <e> <s> does he agree that we have already fallen behind many european countries in fitting catalysts <e> <s> does he further agree that although under light load lean burn engines are quite effective and conform with the luxembourg requirements under heavy acceleration and at high speed they are almost as bad as existing cars <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house how soon he expects lean burn engines <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> does he not feel that it is very important to try to get as many people who have suitable cars to turn to lead-free petrol as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords there will always be a number of old cars owned by enthusiasts which cannot be converted to run on lead-free petrol <e> <s> can the minister give a reasonable undertaking that for those enthusiasts leaded petrol will be available more or less indefinitely <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that part of the reason bed and breakfast is used extensively by some local authorities and also the reason there are unused properties is the problem of finding capital as opposed to the day-to-day expenditure to produce the new buildings that are required <e>", "<cs> i like this amendment a good deal more than the previous one <e> <s> however i think its provisions are far too wide because the words an offence could refer simply to an offence caused through exceeding the mile per hour speed limit <e> <s> one must have some caveat here and leave it to the discretion of the police whether an accident may have been caused by bad eyesight <e>", "<cs> my lords i only received a copy of this statement five minutes before the minister rose to speak <e> <s> of course this is a highly technical paper which deserves much consideration <e> <s> i should have thought that when there was no immediate political urgency something better could be arranged to give us at least a couple of hours to consider the matter <e> <s> none of us disagree with the minister that the extra channels now allotted to cellnet and vodafone are if anything long overdue <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> however he surely acknowledges that our own gas supplies are strictly limited compared perhaps with those of the norwegians <e>", "<cs> this may be of great importance in the not too distant future to our balance of payments and to much else <e> <s> will the minister confirm that the government have powers to restrict the use of natural gas for generating power if it appears that it is becoming excessive <e>", "<cs> my lords what does the noble earl mean by ample reserves <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank everyone who has spoken and i beg leave to withdraw the motion for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that the licence was unenforceable i think it would be more accurate to say that it was unenforced <e> <s> when thinking about the matter let us remember that a great many of our laws are not enforced <e> <s> for example would he not agree that the miles-perhour speed limit is completely ignored <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give me some idea of how much cfc is contained in a domestic refrigerator <e> <s> if one could recover it would this not be a large contribution to avoiding the emission of cfcs <e> <s> will he confirm that the larger refrigerators use ammonia and that its use and the use of polyurethane and other foams could be a major consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl not agree that insulation of floors is very important <e> <s> one reason is that if floors are not insulated it takes much longer to warm up rooms <e> <s> it is not satisfactory to have insulation of floors as an alternative that i believe is the case in present building regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my decision is an easy one <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise to the house that i was not here at the beginning of the debate <e> <s> the reason was that i was on a private bills committee <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment very strongly <e> <s> i do not think there is anybody including the government who does not support energy conservation in theory at least <e> <s> the government have signally failed to do very much <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that were one to withdraw the united nations from the border a serious border incident might occur and that might have have far-reaching effects <e> <s> for the moment at least it is vital to keep that force there <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak briefly and very strongly in support of this amendment <e> <s> we had a wide-ranging discussion on amendment no <e> <s> which concerned the need to stress in the bill the importance of efficiency of supply of electricity and energy conservation <e> <s> all the minister seemed to say in direct reply to the amendment was that the government did not wish to stress those matters at the expense of other possibly equally important considerations for example consumer and environmental interests <e> <s> i wish i had had time to count how many times these other considerations are mentioned in the bill <e> <s> i refer the committee to clause as an example of that <e> <s> quite insufficient emphasis is laid on the efficiency of supply and energy conservation <e> <s> i should have thought that although there is a distinction between the two the minister stressed that for most purposes the latter covered both <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> received a great deal of support from all sides of the chamber <e> <s> if the government are sincere about energy conservation as they seem to be in theory they must realise that even if this amendment is pressed to a division and lost we shall come back with some other solution on the same lines <e> <s> in my opinion we are morally bound to do so <e>", "<cs> i cannot see how the area boards can possibly be completely responsible for the continuity of supply <e> <s> they must rely on the grid <e> <s> the only other alternative would be for them to have their own power stations <e> <s> if they did so there would <e>", "<cs> i raised a question as to how the area boards could be responsible for supply <e> <s> i suggested that they would have a contract with the grid or one of the national power generators <e> <s> but that may break down <e> <s> if they are to cover themselves completely they would have to have their own stations and possibly considerable duplication <e> <s> could the minister say what is the intention of the bill concerning that situation <e>", "<cs> i realise that and perhaps that prevents my speaking on the other one but the point is much the same <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in that case i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not completely satisfied with the answer that has been given <e> <s> nevertheless i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee for not noticing that <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that long and useful reply <e> <s> i was trying to point out that in respect of large power stations one needs to obtain a prototype <e> <s> once that is off the ground others will follow <e> <s> that is where some guarantee or help from the government would be useful because it is difficult to obtain finance on the long-term basis required <e>", "<cs> i have heard the arguments and although i am not wholly convinced i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i strongly support the amendment <e> <s> most of the major points have already been made <e> <s> however i do not believe for one moment that long-term research will look after itself without promotion <e> <s> firms do not except in a small way look far enough ahead for that <e> <s> i also wonder what the relationship as regards research will be between the two major power generation companies <e> <s> they will obviously agree to a certain degree to share results <e> <s> but unless someone looks at this matter rather carefully the best results will not be achieved <e> <s> someone needs to co-ordinate this matter <e>", "<cs> i did not have much hope <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the safety of nuclear installations whether generating or otherwise is a real worry to the public and i do not think the minister has satisfied us <e> <s> clause is not sufficient <e> <s> the government have taken very far-ranging powers in this bill so why cannot they take this long stop amendment <e> <s> it might never be needed because the existing powers might be sufficient but they should have it nevertheless <e>", "<cs> does the noble baroness appreciate that in a certain number of cases it is not only the maximum that you wish to know about but the time at which it is used <e> <s> the electricity company tries to balance three phases <e> <s> if the situation concerns the normal consumer leading a normal life one can assume that one place is much like another but it is not always so <e> <s> therefore the electricity supply company would be a good deal better off anyway knowing what the consumer had in the way of appliances and if necessary in finding out how they are used <e> <s> otherwise balancing the three phases which is very important may be impossible <e>", "<cs> it seems that the principle behind this amendment has been accepted <e> <s> on the other hand one is not entirely satisfied that there is not a case for including this amendment in the bill <e> <s> nevertheless i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i must make the point that i do not believe that the ministers advisers can possibly have read the amendment <e> <s> it says no more than the desirability of <e> <s> nearly everything the minister said was irrelevant to the amendment nevertheless i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely satisfied with the explanation the minister has given because in other walks of life there are many means of giving security or what is thought to be adequate security <e> <s> however i do not appear to have convinced the minister so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that uninformative reply <e> <s> bearing in mind our better relations with russia and also bearing in mind that all countries bug foreign embassies if they can when it is necessary to deport someone from an embassy is it not better to keep the fact quiet and not allow it to become a major diplomatic matter <e> <s> surely the minister will agree that it is hypocritical and even childish to do so <e>", "<cs> i should just like to emphasise the point that we are getting increasingly concerned about the greenhouse effect and the c emissions from power stations <e> <s> potentially chp could provide an enormous saving as regards the coal which we burn <e> <s> in fact if the schemes which are considered possible were implemented the saving would amount to something in the region of per cent <e>", "<cs> here is an opportunity for the government to do a little to promote this form of heat <e> <s> it is necessary to do that to get if off the ground <e> <s> the amendment costs them nothing <e> <s> i am afraid that the arguments put forward by the minister have almost no weight <e> <s> the government must stand condemned for doing almost nothing to help to reduce the co <e>", "<cs> i am reassured by what the noble lord has said <e> <s> accordingly i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not very happy with the reply of the noble baroness <e> <s> in the bill it is stated that the directors report shall include the information set out in four subsections <e> <s> i agree that those items are rather different from my suggestion <e> <s> nevertheless if we attach importance to the environment and we have attached immense importance to the environment every day that we have sat in this committee i should have thought that the noble baroness could at least have included these vital issues as a specific requirement in the directors report <e> <s> i ask her without any commitment to consider the matter again because the reply that she gave was not very satisfactory <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister very much and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister very much and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords surely it must be realised that had it not been for the dock unions we should still have had some shipping coming up the thames <e> <s> surely it must also be realised that had the dock unions taken the containers as something that they must face we should not have lost so much business to other ports <e>", "<cs> it is mine actually <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for moving the amendment <e> <s> of course i would not think of moving amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however i think unkindly one might ask bearing in mind how important future research is and that under privatisation long-term research is not likely <e>", "<cs> my lords we have talked about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> which we are in fact discussing goes a long way to meeting the point that research and development is vital <e> <s> however it does not spell out at all the direction in which this should go <e> <s> as it stands the provision is a pious hope <e> <s> i am afraid i have to say that having considered amendment no <e> <s> i am not satisfied with the reasons given for this research <e> <s> i think that under paragraph a in the proposed new clause we should talk about generating electricity as cheaply as possible <e> <s> paragraphs b and c could also usefully be reworded <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble baroness has moved in some direction to help on this point but i still cannot understand why it cannot be spelt out much more clearly <e> <s> we have had the arguments before and they are centred around energy efficiency and the need to help or promote chp schemes <e> <s> i still cannot understand why the government simply do not go all out in the bill to say so <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down perhaps i may ask her three questions <e> <s> first when she considers financial viability will she consider it over the life of any chp project <e> <s> secondly will she make comparisons with the success that has occurred overseas <e> <s> thirdly will she give some bias towards energy efficiency which is so important in our future and not just to present economic financial viability <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment does not prevent agreement on how the debt is to be agreed on the meter <e> <s> there is nothing to prevent that but the amendment states that it should not be done without the agreement of the person concerned <e> <s> i do not think that what we have just heard is a reasoned argument against it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to take up too much of the time of the house but i think that one really must reply to some extent to the remarks of the noble lord lord hatch <e> <s> we agree on one point and one point only namely that the way forward avoiding the greenhouse effect is undoubtedly energy conservation <e> <s> there is nothing on the scene at present as regards alternative energy however hard we try apart from tidal power which could have an effect and wind power which would have a small effect that would get us out of this difficulty <e> <s> we are therefore left with nuclear and coal <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment uses the word may <e> <s> it does not state that such an authority must be established <e> <s> i should like to make just two points <e> <s> one must consider the viability of those long-term projects over their lifetime which may be years or more in the case of a tidal barrage <e> <s> in my view it will never be promoted entirely by private enterprise <e> <s> that is not to say that if the government gave a certain amount of help or some guarantees it could not be brought about <e> <s> that is an important point to bear in mind <e> <s> if i am right that it cannot be initiated solely by private enterprise it is a good thing to incorporate the amendment in the bill because it is merely permissive <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord realise that at present even with a certain amount of surveillance many companies provide quite inadequate training <e> <s> does he agree that if there is no outside surveillance there is a reluctance on the part of any industry training board to hold responsible those who are not doing a decent job <e> <s> does he also agree that if that board is controlled by large companies its views will not be welcomed by smaller companies <e> <s> finally does he realise that although it is customary to allow some professions to govern their own affairs and where codes of ethics are breached to deal with offenders that is not always a satisfactory arrangement <e> <s> does he agree that training is a very different matter <e> <s> it is not a matter of ethics it is a question which affects all the members of that profession <e> <s> it is a question of ensuring that a decent job is done <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that all this should have been over a long time ago that it is now the eleventh hour and that further studies are beginning to be too time-wasting <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply cannot understand why the government oppose this amendment or others on the same lines <e> <s> it does not interfere with market forces <e> <s> all it does is try to encourage them <e> <s> they must know as well as i do the difficulties of putting a chp scheme into operation if it is more than an industrial one <e> <s> the roads must be dug up and the heat mains must be laid <e> <s> there is a considerable time to wait before a project is viable <e> <s> any encouragement that is the word i would have used that can be given by the government surely ought to be given <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to speak but there have been so many speakers from the other side that i felt i ought to say a few words <e> <s> the house must congratulate itself on its patience and energy in trying to produce a better bill <e> <s> i feel that it has done that <e> <s> however we must remember what many of us said at second reading that we heartily disliked the bill <e> <s> we believe that to upset the industry at the moment is a disaster and that it cannot possibly lead to cheaper electricity or be in the consumers interests <e>", "<cs> my lords i have three remarks to make and i can make them in three minutes <e> <s> first many of us would consider that the bill had been rushed through and had been ill considered <e> <s> the fact that at this eleventh hour the government find that it will cost more to decommission the magnox reactors is hardly surprising <e> <s> we never knew what it was going to cost <e> <s> it is ridiculous to make this a major new idea of splitting up the responsibilities and creating what is in effect a new company just because of this discrepancy <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with everything the noble lord lord shepherd has said <e> <s> the trouble is that although one thanks the government for taking all this on board as the noble lord lord shepherd said there are not the sanctions that there should be <e>", "<cs> my lords the energy efficiency unit has done a great deal but all the government can say at the moment is that they do not need to promote energy efficiency further and that therefore they can save something on promotion <e> <s> however the concept has only just begun to come across <e> <s> how can the government justify reducing the funds as they have done <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord does not need to do that <e> <s> the point still remains that much more should be spent in that direction <e> <s> unless the noble lord has an answer to that point i do not think that writing to me is of any consequence <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not read the amendments in detail but i am sure that they are good for the bill <e> <s> however what ought to be said very clearly is that such amendments would not be necessary if the bill had been properly drafted and considered in advance <e> <s> the government must stand condemned for having produced an ill-considered bill which has no possibility of producing cheaper electricity <e> <s> they have gone on with it regardless <e> <s> that should be said now as an <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply which meets a great many of our worries <e> <s> however is it not a fact that some time ago the government realised the importance and desirability of giving ethnic broadcasts but they also recognised the difficulties of doing so <e> <s> they had to ensure that anyone who was responsible for a programme was financially viable and that such programmes were not taken over by an undesirable group providing the finance for example communists <e> <s> the government also had to ensure that a large number of problems which have occurred in this area such as political problems did not arise <e> <s> does the minister agree that perhaps the iba has not been over-clever in its original proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i am right in saying that for five years the greeks have had a pirate station <e> <s> i believe that station has been conducted fairly well <e> <s> why have the government done precisely nothing to stop that <e>", "<cs> my lords for a long time many of us have thought that the only sensible answer is to retain the nuclear power stations temporarily under government control <e> <s> can the minister say why the government are not prepared to take that sensible action <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my question comes within the scope of that on the order paper <e> <s> does the minister agree that the time now spent waiting to see a specialist has risen to six or more weeks and that it is appalling to have to wait so long for a diagnosis <e>", "<cs> my lords with this number of speakers it is difficult to say anything new but i want to emphasise some points that have already been made and to consider another which i believe is a major factor in regard to the future <e>", "<cs> my lords the time is now past when we can usefully attack the governments folly over the privatisation of this great industry <e> <s> in previous speeches i have mentioned the undeclared reasons why they decided on that policy <e> <s> i shall now say only that cheaper electricity for the consumer is nothing more than a smokescreen and is almost certainly unachievable <e>", "<cs> my lords the law of treasure trove has its origins in anglo-saxon times when it was a kind of fiscal policy to recover bullion for the crown and to discourage hoarding or secreting of wealth <e> <s> by todays standards it is an anachronism and some strange legal assumptions are required on the part of a coroner in order to arrive at a conclusion <e> <s> objects discovered in the ground are classed as treasure trove only if they have no known owner which is fair enough but also if it can be established that the original owner hid them with a view to their eventual recovery <e> <s> your lordships will not be surprised that this is a matter which cannot always be decided sensibly after several hundreds or even thousands of years and the legal presumptions for doing so hardly bear even a scintilla of common sense <e>", "<cs> my lords in considering whether to speak in this debate today i decided to talk about our legal aid system <e> <s> it has interested me and i feel very strongly about it <e> <s> as it turns out a large number of speakers have already dealt with it but i can do two things first i can reinforce what they said secondly i may be able produce the odd new idea myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> however i think that he will understand quite clearly what i have in mind from the words which appear on the order paper <e> <s> therefore i do not wish to ask a supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind the problem that we raised on second reading of finding people who have the time and are willing to serve as governors and of the danger of appointing extremists and power seekers to a governing body <e> <s> does he agree that that is an ever present danger <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to the committee for producing such an excellent report covering almost any subject that the intelligent layman wants to know about in a generally understandable way <e>", "<cs> if it is a sensible thing to do i cannot understand why we should raise these various objections <e> <s> we all know perfectly well that the over-population of this planet is likely to become a major problem <e> <s> i know of course what the catholics think about it <e> <s> however for the remainder of us i <e>", "<cs> that has been my problem in voting on the bill <e> <s> there are several things that could be done illegally at the moment in the bill such as cloning which would be highly unfortunate but i should have thought that it was a quite clear issue and that nothing has been said which should deter us from putting it in the bill <e>", "<cs> from these benches we strongly support this amendment <e> <s> i shall not waste the time of the committee by repeating examples given by the noble baroness lady stedman because quite clearly she has far greater knowledge of the matter than i <e>", "<cs> my lords it must be more than years ago when with great temerity and as a much younger man i attacked university education as being inefficient and not meeting the nations needs <e> <s> this i did after a reith lecture given by the noble lord lord annan which was largely in favour of what the universities were doing <e> <s> believe it or not this was at a time when it was seriously thought that whatever was taught at a university and however badly it was taught it was self-justifying because it was taught at a university or an upgraded polytechnic <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that reply <e> <s> however has he seen the recent report of the cegb which estimated that by the year our generating capacity would be reduced to half simply taking into account the expected life of our power stations <e> <s> i am concerned this is the point on which i seek assurance that we should do something now <e> <s> will the minister address himself to that point <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount confirm that there is now nobody who is legally responsible for ensuring that we obtain an adequate replacement for power stations of any sort <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke almost exclusively on this subject on the second reading of the courts and legal services bill <e> <s> however i feel very strongly that the effective denial of recourse to the high court for a large number of citizens must be stressed again in this debate <e> <s> that has already been done <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been talking about the tonnes of cfcs which could be recovered and which at the moment go to waste <e> <s> a large proportion of that comes from government <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say to what extent government establishments are returning surplus cfcs from their large refrigeration plants for recycling or dispoal <e>", "<cs> i am appalled that we should go into the detail that is suggested <e> <s> perhaps we should take that nanny attitude towards the whole of our population <e> <s> i am a smoker and i resent being constantly criticised for that <e> <s> i am sorry but such detail in the bill is wholly wrong and it should not be included <e>", "<cs> my lords in deciding whether to intervene earlier did the government take into account first the enormous cost of repairing the prison and secondly the fact that we might be as we are effectively without one prison when there is an extreme shortage of prison space <e>", "<cs> my lords for a long time we have been told that the governments priority was to reduce inflation <e> <s> they have clearly not done so <e> <s> one mus <e> <s> wonder how much trust one can put in their other aspirations <e>", "<cs> my lords some people would wish that our nuclear capability had never been invented <e> <s> i disagree because i believe that it has rendered conventional war in europe impossible for the past years <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that since all contracts for dealing with nuclear waste contain a clause allowing for the return of the waste to the country of origin <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for her reply <e> <s> however does she realise that the ever-rising costs of new technologies equipment and so on mean that perhaps we should think about providing an per cent <e> <s> increase in real terms every year <e> <s> does she agree that if the funds are not available directly it would be as well to find out in this democracy whether the public would be prepared to have increased taxes of some form in order to keep the national health service running smoothly <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept the argument that increasing the number of junior staff need necessarily spoil the pyramid of promotion <e> <s> it seems to me that with a little more expense you also increase the number of consultants <e> <s> as it takes three months to see a consultant in certain cases i should have thought that that was a good thing to do anyway <e> <s> having listened to the last debate on this subject i remain unconvinced that consultants should not pull their weight more and take a certain amount of pressure off the junior doctors which if it was done cleverly would surely help to improve the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister realise that if we are to obtain chp in some of the larger cities government guarantees and finance will be required <e> <s> surely that is worth while for the future <e> <s> will the government seriously take into account that long-term large chp schemes cannot be financed only by the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i was referring to domestic chp in large cities <e> <s> the industrial side can take care of itself <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree that these movements of flasks are of vital commercial importance to bnf and that every effort has been made to make them as safe as anything with which we deal today <e> <s> only if one is anti-nuclear is it sensible or even reasonable to raise those matters <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not extraordinary that countries including the united states have ratified the convention <e> <s> there may be objections to this country doing so but i believe that it could fall into line <e> <s> does the minister remember a similar case in which my wife was involved <e> <s> it was at wanborough where over the course of several nights million gold and silver coins were removed from a field belonging to the noble lord lord taylor <e> <s> they appeared later <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply but does he not agree that most people believe that the situation will deteriorate and that it is only a matter of time before very drastic and unpleasant measures have to be taken <e> <s> a prohibition on further office development in the centre would be comparatively harmless and should be put into practice until transport is improved <e> <s> should we not encourage the development of further office accommodation in the docklands <e>", "<cs> my lords does it not appear that a three year training course is ridiculously long <e> <s> if it were not so long it may be that those who at present practise without qualifications would take those qualifications <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> however is it not sad that having started in the nuclear energy field if we wait another four years we shall almost certainly have to buy nuclear plant off the shelf from a foreign nation <e> <s> does the minister agree that it was a major mistake not to continue with hinkley c <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount said that there are and will remain a great many people in the nuclear field but does he accept that as hinkley point c is not going ahead the designers will not be available in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> i can only say that it was not clear to me or some others that that is the case <e> <s> therefore i am pleased to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that we tried this out a few years ago <e> <s> it was not universally popular and some people disliked it heartily <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> is he not aware that time seems to be running out <e> <s> many of us feel that time is so short that it is quite probable that with privatisation we shall not achieve the desired extra capacity or replacement capacity by the time it is required <e> <s> does he not agree that it seems unlikely that the privatised companies will go in for very large stations and that therefore a large number of the smaller combined systems will not easily make up for the deficiency of the larger plants <e>"]
