undermine the efforts of the countries of origin of these endangered species to protect and conserve them in their natural environment <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> the problem raised by the amendment has for a long time seriously worried both the conservation and the zoo world <e> <s> i know that the cost of putting right ports of entry is very high i have written to the minister and

the first is that this amendment springs from the fertile brain of my noble friend lord skelmersdale who for perfectly good reasons was unable to move it <e> <s> he should get the credit for it <e> <s> having been on the front bench myself i realise the difficulties which can be caused when this sort of amendment is pressed <e> <s> on the other hand noble lords on both sides of the committee

conservation bodies are fairly satis- <e>", "<cs> i do not entirely agree with the noble earl because as he himself said at the moment the ncc consults <e> <s> that is quite true but there will be other moments before this bill is changed and i should still be much happier to see something of this nature in the bill <e>", "<cs> from the length of the noble earls reply it is quite clear that

heard his noble friend lord thurso behind him who made a case which the noble lord on the front bench opposite answered <e> <s> but my amendment goes a long way towards meeting that case <e> <s> i believe that the original amendment of the noble lord lord melchett would give the secretary of state dictatorial powers which would be unacceptable to the farming community and which the conservation bodies that i represent do not think is essential <e>", "<cs> am i right in understanding that my noble friend is accepting in principle amendment no <e> <s> which allows the nature conservancy council to advise all landowners and that he is also accepting amendment no <e> <s> which says that the land charge is an acceptable policy <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend leaves that point is he accepting four weeks instead of three months <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am a little bewildered <e> <s> i am in the hands of the committee but as i understand it i am grateful to my noble friend and safe in withdrawing amendment no <e> <s> the first amendment because he has undertaken to comply with the spirit behind it without any reservation that is that every owner will be notified

noble friends assurance that that is so <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend and i have pleasure in begging leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> do we not discuss amendment no <e> <s>

purveyor of red herrings <e> <s> by the same rule i believe i am almost sure that many of the crofts are historic buildings already and they are not allowed to alter them without permission <e> <s>

<e> <s> none of those things can be brought home to the public until the act is in force <e> <s> the matter is one of great urgency and i hope that my noble friend will do something <e>", "<cs> my lords i put my name down to speak in this debate but unfortunately by a clerical error it was not included <e> <s> i have asked to speak in this debate early because i have to go to another very longstanding appointment and i am speaking with your lordships leave by courtesy of my noble friend lord onslow <e> <s> i rise to support the noble lord lord melchett in what he said <e> <s> the noble baroness lady white referred to the integrated development programme and quoted from it <e> <s> it seems to me the merits of lord melchetts case are expressed in the plan in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords i referred to the idp itself the official document not the brochure <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add my congratulations to those of other noble lords to my noble friend lord geoffrey-lloyd for a sparkling and instructive speech <e> <s> this is quite an unusual occasion because when i became a member of parliament in he was already an old hand of years standing <e> <s> he had made his first speech his maiden speech in moving the address on the first day of the parliament <e> <s> your lordships are used to occasions but that really is quite something to record in <e>", "<cs> i was going to say exactly what the noble lord lord donaldson has said <e> <s> we are talking about elderly men <e> <s> i think three years is too long and they lose touch <e>", "<cs> i am against it <e>", "<cs> i am wholly against this amendment <e> <s> in my view boards are refreshed by somebody who has experience of like responsibilities <e> <s> i would be very much against passing this amendment <e>", "<cs> i should be glad if the minister would elucidate to me what the noble viscount lord eccles has said <e> <s> if you get a man who is no good then you do not want him even for seven years <e> <s> you cannot always pick the right man <e> <s> is it possible at any time to get rid of him <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with what the noble lord lord donaldson said <e> <s> it costs a great deal to be a chairman and an unpaid chairman has a very difficult time and spends a great deal of his life doing this job <e> <s> i am of two minds about the rest of the board <e>", "<cs> having listened to the arguments i am satisfied with the bill as it is <e>", "<cs> the botanic gardens are world known <e> <s> there has never been any confusion but i think that confusion would be created by the addition of the word kew as though it referred to something new i cannot agree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the minister has rehearsed all the arguments and difficulties that i had in preparing this amendment <e> <s> in view of what he has said i have much pleasure in asking the committee to allow me to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i do not think the noble lord lord jenkins was speaking to this amendment <e> <s> however i am afraid that i am not entirely satisfied with my noble friends answer <e> <s> i know that what is said on the front bench is going to be done <e> <s> if it is all done and so many of us have heard this so often that is fine and grand <e> <s> but if at the gardens anybody with a narrow restricted view were to read exactly what the bill as drafted now says then i really believe that he could restrict that information which is so vital to the rest of the world <e> <s> we are not talking about britain we are talking about world functions <e> <s> we are talking about the destruction of the forests and all sorts of things which may not be a function of kew gardens but are a function of the connections that they have with kew gardens and it is up to them <e> <s> they are better able than anyone else to report to the world how things are going on what is the tendency what are the trends <e> <s> i am not satisfied with this situation <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend is talking about extra expense i must remind him that what we are talking about is saving the world <e> <s> man is destroying many of the living things of the world and if preventing that involves extra work and extra expense of course we should be prepared to pay for it <e> <s> but in view of what he has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness comes to a decision does she realise that she will be retaining the longer name which we do not like and that all documents cheques and notices will not be legal unless they use the long name <e>", "<cs> i withdrew my amendment but i will withdraw it again <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that his statement will be widely welcomed by all the traders of westminster to whom this has been a great trouble for many years <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord he did not mention this whether he is restricting these cars to the area of their own offices because there is a belief that these cars are being parked throughout the whole area <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister consider when looking at new regulations that there <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the noble lord realises that this amendment refers only to marine nature reserves made under the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in a difficulty in which i never found myself when i stood where my noble friend is standing now in that he has replied and given me a most satisfactory answer to the wrong amendment <e> <s> so what i shall have to do is to make out in about three minutes the case that i was going to put forward and he can then confirm to me that what he has just said is the answer to that case <e> <s> he can then perhaps answer by saying no or yes it will apply regarding my first amendment <e> <s> i have moved the first amendment and the noble lord has replied to the second <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i shall withdraw my amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the answer to this amendment is that what i wanted to add is not necessary <e> <s> then i shall formally move amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> my lords he has said that he will properly consider any application by the nature conservancy council for a marine nature reserve in scotland <e> <s> that is what we really wanted to hear <e> <s> that is what the nature conservancy council wants to hear and that is what the underwater conservation society wants to hear <e> <s> i am very grateful to the minister <e> <s> i am sure that matters will now go ahead for the first time in british history <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that this ridiculous system of paying people not to destroy the precious land of britain cannot long endure <e> <s> there is one complete answer to this <e> <s> if this was an ancient monument it would be illegal to muck about with it <e> <s> it should be illegal <e> <s> these precious pieces of land should be treated like ancient monuments and then we should not have any of this expensive nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not easy with one simple point to raise for me to follow the noble lord lord davies of leek <e> <s> but is it not good to see him back in such health and vigour again <e> <s> i have to thank the noble lord lord ashby for giving me an opportunity to raise the one point that i very urgently want to raise <e> <s> chapter iii paragraph of the tenth report of the royal commission says <e>", "<cs> my lords i give a warm welcome to parts i and ii of the bill <e> <s> i have a few constructive committee points to make but they are committee points and i will not mention them on second reading <e> <s> i have one question on part ii and if the minister could answer it his reply might be helpful <e> <s> the question is is there any good reason why applications for dumping licences should not be treated in the same way as planning applications which give opportunities for objections and amendments <e> <s> i do not see why they should not be treated as planning applications <e>", "<cs> i am quite satisfied with the reply of the minister and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> all i wanted was that the powers should be there to insist on the black box being installed on the ship of the well-known naughty shipowner who was known to be breaking the law <e> <s> after listening to what my noble friend has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i was so glad to hear what the minister said <e> <s> this was a very happy argument at the committee stage of the wildlife and countryside bill <e> <s> i have looked it up and that act includes the words exposure for sale <e> <s> there were very good reasons indeed for putting them in <e> <s> the reasons are exactly the same in this case <e> <s> i am very happy to withdraw the amendment on that statement from the minister <e>", "<cs> beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i had thought that prior informed consent was covered by subsection <e>", "<cs> may i try to clarify this in three sentences <e> <s> subsection gives the minister power to require information necessary <e>", "<cs> ici are carrying out research now on methods of distributing insecticide <e>", "<cs> this point is one that has worried me more than any single thing about this bill <e> <s> i agree entirely with the noble lord lord northbourne the method of delivery is an important part in the whole operation of applying the spray <e> <s> i agree with him that there is not enough research and i also agree with the seventh report of the royal commission on environmental pollution <e> <s> there is not one mention of delivery devices in this bill <e> <s> i was given to understand that this would be all right on the night and that it would be all right when the regulations were produced <e> <s> but i gave up a glass of wine and had just one course for dinner in order to read the statement of intention <e> <s> i hoped that that would further this particular point <e> <s> the conditions of approval make no reference whatever to the approval of delivery devices <e> <s> then on <e>", "<cs> i am still worried <e> <s> i agree entirely with what the noble lord lord melchett said but what seems to me so important is that the government must themselves worry about the type of spray delivered by the different types of machine <e> <s> they must be concerned about how these machines operate and whether they operate correctly with one or other pesticide <e> <s> it is no good leaving that to the farmer he is no technician <e> <s> it is no good leaving that to the manufacturer he is there to sell machines <e> <s> if the government do not do it we shall not get the correct droplet size that is wanted for a particular spray <e>", "<cs> did i understand the minister to say that he would look not only at his obligation to get the right pesticide but also his obligation to see that it is the right delivery device <e> <s> that is not a point i have made <e> <s> it is a point made in the seventh report of the royal commission <e> <s> it made this very point in four pages and the minister to my mind is still ignoring the point that it is the governments job to take this on board and not to leave it to the manufacturer or the farmer <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister one question <e> <s> he referred to controlled spraying <e> <s> will he be able to have the powers to do what my amendment asks <e> <s> if so then i am satisfied with his assurance <e> <s> can they jointly refuse permission for the release of the pesticide over an area and for a period specified by them <e> <s> will they have powers to say that there is going to be no aerial spraying at all in a certain area or for a certain period or both <e>", "<cs> right that is super <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> regrettably i do not find the ministers reply very satisfactory <e> <s> i hope that he will read the debate <e> <s> to me the insecticide and the sprayer used are one and the same in respect of the instructions of the ministry as to what should be done to protect crops <e> <s> if there is a fault in one there can equally be a fault in the other <e> <s> i am not at all satisfied <e> <s> i shall have to look at the matter before report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the government are missing a very great opportunity here to follow the suggestion and advice of the royal commission in its th report which drew the attention of the public to the fact that you can get the same value from spraying with one-fifth of the amount of pesticide if you use the right sprayer <e> <s> the burden of the royal commissions complaint was that not enough enthusiasm was behind the improvement of the sprayer and there was no push from the government or really from anybody else because the incentive is to use more pesticide and not less because that is the incentive of the manufacturer <e> <s> i believe that the government are missing a great opportunity in not putting into this bill not what i want but what the royal commission wants <e>", "<cs> in view of that reply which had nothing at all to do with my amendment i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not at all happy about that reply <e> <s> i was asked by the minister to put all my amendments together <e> <s> my amendments all with the same words or delivery device were an attempt to get delivery devices mentioned in the bill and here it has nothing to do with previous replies <e> <s> this is proposed so that a delivery device could be used as evidence in obtaining a prosecution <e> <s> that has nothing to do with the previous replies i received and i regret to say that i do not at all like the reply which has just been given <e> <s> if the minister has nothing to say i shall leave it until the next time and beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too join in thanking the noble lord lord aylestone for initiating this debate <e> <s> i must declare an interest <e> <s> i am an age-expired director now a consultant of the aylesbury broadcasting company <e> <s> for some years we have been applying for permission to operate a commercial radio station for that area <e> <s> over the past year we have been moving up the queue to the head of the queue and have begun to make plans for raising the considerable capital required to make a start perhaps in or <e> <s> we now find that the threat and existence of pirate radio stations is not making it any easier for us to launch this project which is now not such an attractive investment as it was <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not a director <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the westminster chamber of commerce already meets many of the requirements of my noble friend as indicated in his question with members of whom per cent <e> <s> are small traders interested in exports <e> <s> with an export committee and about seven trade missions overseas they are already doing a great deal of work <e> <s> is he further aware that the westminster chamber of commerce issues certificates of origin but has no power at the moment to issue carnets which are the final requirement of an export industry <e> <s> the london chamber of commerce and many provincial chambers have powers to issue carnets but <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very much to thank my noble friend for accepting this suggestion of mine <e> <s> with due humility i should say that it is not my idea but it is the idea of recommendation no <e> <s> of part iv of the conservation and development programme of the united kingdom which is the united kingdoms action under the world conservation strategy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i said what i said simply in order to fortify him in his arguments with his own advisers <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for allowing us to discuss this important subject <e> <s> some years ago the thames water authority tried a much-criticised experiment of returning the salmon to the river thames <e> <s> it incurred a great deal of expense and much criticism and it was successful <e> <s> when i take my boat up the thames i find that the towpath is perfectly satisfactory i do not slip into the river i find that the stiles which are put up blend with the scenery and are perfect i find good moorings with no charges made and all this adds to the beauty the environment and the use of the river <e> <s> none of those things could be expected of private enterprise because there is no profit in it <e>", "<cs> my lords the principle of privatisation is that if the operation is being paid for now and can be run at a profit or if it is not making a profit now and if run by private enterprise it can be run at a profit then for both the user and the taxpayer it will pay to nationalise <e> <s> if not it should remain as it is and its influence on the private undertakings should be the subject of a licence <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady white spoke with great authority on marine reserves and gave the views of the select committee <e> <s> i shall not repeat anything that she has told the house <e> <s> i should like to make some comments of my own about the clause that was deleted <e>

out <e> <s> the clause was removed only after the minister had done three things he had admitted that there had been some delays in starting marine reserves on the part of the ncc <e> <s> he had held out hopes of an early settlement of at least two reserves and he had undertaken that to repeat his own words if all came to naught he and maff would come back to the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish the noble baroness was right but i have read it most carefully <e> <s> in making these kinds of agreements with ministers we have to be very careful <e> <s> this would be wider than the bill as approved by another place on second reading so i should not care to take that on <e>", "<cs> my lords the widening of maffs responsibilities under clause and the environmentally sensitive areas under clause is a major step forward and i follow the congratulations given to her majestys government by the noble lord lord moran and the noble baroness lady white <e> <s> for the first time income support for farmers in certain areas will be partly divorced from increased food production and will be made conditional on good environmental practice of which my noble friend lord forbes spoke with great authority <e> <s> although initially clause is to have a narrow application i hope the minister will say as the noble lord lord walston asked him to that the intention is to see support of this type available to farmers across the whole countryside <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord williams spent several minutes making fun of or talking about the littlechild report <e> <s> however in reading it with great interest i do not take that as being government policy it is a guide to what our thinking <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this amendment because i think that without expert advice the enjoyment of the countryside can do more harm than good <e> <s> the farmer has to have some expert advice on how people should enjoy it and where they should go <e> <s> left to himself he might do more damage conservationwise than with the advice of adas <e> <s> for that reason i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will agree to the amendment <e> <s> the addition of the word maintenance means something in relation to the whole business of preserving facilities for the enjoyment of the public <e> <s> but i do not support amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it seems to pick out one issue when there are so many others that could be picked out <e> <s> the provision probably loses force by underlining that point <e>", "<cs> before i withdraw the amendment i should like the minister to look at one point again <e> <s> as i read the bill and i have read a lot of bills in my life i took it as a discouragement that we were not intended to look at the bill in relation to historic interest <e> <s> will my noble friend look and see whether it achieves what he has just said that is that people can enjoy the buildings and the conservation without the inclusion of some words to that effect <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i really am very disappointed in my noble friend <e> <s> he has read out a brief most of which has not in any way referred to the amendment which i seek to move <e> <s> i am not talking about the common market or something wide like that or about rebuilding factories <e> <s> what i am saying is that there must be tools devices and methods for putting right a building of architectural importance of historic interest which does not come under the legal description of architectural that is all <e> <s> that is my only point <e> <s> i can go into <e>", "<cs> i moved both of them together <e> <s> i have done my best to help the minister of agriculture <e> <s> i am sorry i have failed <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the committee may be surprised to hear that i agree with my noble friend lord peel <e> <s> i woke up in the middle of last night and thought this name is really not exactly what is wanted but i have to move the amendment and there has to be a discussion <e> <s> i will ask the leave of the committee to withdraw the amendment but i should like the minister to consider whether he would like me to put down an amendment containing the words environ <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if the contract can be varied by mutual consent and the way this bill is drafted that is allowed then i am quite satisfied and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> as i read the bill this does not happen and if we have his assurance that there will be continuing consultation that of course is what we want that is what this amendment is all about <e> <s> it is not what the minister says in the debate it is what the bill says and that the bill should cover the point that my amendment seeks to make <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i may be wrong but did not understand what the minister meant when he said that his amendment no <e> <s> answered the question which we are now discussing <e>", "<cs> my lords i too signed the amendment put down at committee stage and i support very much the urgent need for something along the lines of conservation orders <e> <s> i shall be very interested to hear what the minister is going to say <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me that is exactly the point <e> <s> as my noble friend on the front bench knows i tried to widen the area beyond farming areas by using a little equipment from outside farming areas and he would not let me <e> <s> this amendment refers solely to farming areas <e>", "<cs> my lords surely agricultural is the word that dominates clause <e> <s> agricultural forestry is only forestry taken on incidental i think that is the word in the bill to ordinary farming <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is a considerable worry about a case last year where a man stood on a hedgehog and killed it but no conviction could be given under this act <e> <s> is he aware that i offered a one-clause private members bill to his honourable friend in the department of the environ-ment if the government would back it and he was unable to give me that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the open streets of our towns and cities are cluttered with statues many of which represent ladies and gentlemen forgotten many many years ago <e> <s> could he not consider appointing a commission which might meet in each area say every years to look at all statues retaining some discarding others or deciding upon those that should be replaced when the opportunity occurs <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware in referring to the uk scheme that it is one of the most successful operations that has ever been conducted in conservation <e> <s> it has succeeded in getting voluntary bodies together for the first time <e> <s> they work together with local authorities and private firms <e> <s> not only that but there is available labour through the manpower services

aerosol cans are made of which million are filled with cfcs but million are not filled with cfcs <e> <s> they are used for about different products <e> <s> so we are getting along now with aerosol

lords i start with the advice given by sir peter scott who said that nothing was more important than teaching the next generation about the value to people of the natural world around us a world that

word of thanks to the noble earl lord cranbrook and to the members of his committee for the time the effort and the travelling that they have put in to produce this thoughtful and constructive report <e> <s> there is a need for this habitats directive and i welcome it <e> <s> this is of course just another directive but its guidelines are a necessary step to be acted on or ignored as this nation or the other nations feel <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his support <e> <s> this particular point is causing us much worry as regards the act <e> <s> i have given the minister notice of this and he knows exactly what are the arguments <e> <s> however if he is satisfied with the wording i must withdraw the amendment <e> <s> nevertheless i remain rather unsatisfied and i very much hope that we shall not have a case in the future where someone says i am sorry i made a mistake but i did not mean to do it <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this matter is a great worry to all of us <e> <s> i hope the government will take the initiative to call a world convention or something of that kind to get this matter sorted out <e> <s> the situation at present is very bad <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down is he intending to allow the courts to have a copy of his paper or is he relying on what he said <e> <s> it worries me that the courts have no guidance if it is not written upon the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> i shall use the well-known phrase that i shall read carefully what the minister said and consider whether to return to this matter on report <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble lord lord mcintosh my amendment has nothing to do with the joint committee <e> <s> my amendment no <e> <s> requires two members of the nature conservancy council for england to represent the countryside commission for england <e> <s> that deals with the points made by my noble friend lord peel <e> <s> at a later stage it may be right to combine the english countryside commission with the english nature conservancy council <e> <s> i should like that to happen but it will take time <e> <s> in the meantime it must be right to put england on the same footing as regards joint representation as is already the situation in wales <e> <s> i ask only that two members of the nature conservancy council for england shall represent the interests of the countryside commission for england <e>", "<cs> having read the amendment and having listened to the noble lord lord ross i tend to agree with him <e> <s> he asked who will fund a bats week supposing that one of the councils does not wish to do so <e> <s> it seems an untidy and unnecessary way of handing on money <e> <s> the joint committee will have to have a separate different sum <e> <s> i cannot understand why it is not funded directly <e> <s> i do not see the logic of the governments thinking <e> <s> i hope that the minister will either accept the amendment or consider it before the next stage <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>"]
