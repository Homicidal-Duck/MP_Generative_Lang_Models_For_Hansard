theatre to which he referred in his speech <e> <s> yet at the same time i was also the chairman of a committee which reported on the future of broadcasting in which in chapter we strongly advocated

informed opinions on the merits of its recommendations <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that i would also wish to reassure him that consultations are taking place directly with westminster medical school and that at three oclock this afternoon i shall be at the westminster medical school with members of the relevant committee which will be advising the governing body of the university <e> <s> may i also warn the noble lord lord cullen <e>", "<cs> may i however also warn the noble lord that it is very difficult indeed for the university of london to continue to fund its medical schools at

about your lordships house <e> <s> is he in any way inclined <e>", "<cs> my lords very well <e> <s> does the noble lord have any views about your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware how grateful the university of london is to the government for having made available million to help the university and for putting that money at the disposal of the university grants committee

graduate medical schools and institutes will still lose million and the four most affected non-medical schools such as the london school of economics and the school of oriental and african studies

importance to broadcasting i doubt whether he was ever much troubled that is that broadcasting should be under the direct control of broadcasting authorities <e> <s> that is a principle on which both the government and the opposition agree though there are still rumbles from an intransigent minority who want either a communications commission to supervise all the media or a broadcasting council

broadcasting for a public inquiry board for broadcasting <e>", "<cs> may f draw attention to the fact that the body being proposed in this amendment is a very different thing from the public inquiry

secretary of state had referred to that board <e> <s> that is an extremely important proviso <e> <s> if you have a body which as has been said can range over the whole of broadcasting then you have a broadcasting council and a broadcasting council is one of the things which in the report with varying degrees of vehemence and some were not very vehement we were against <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a good deal of sympathy with this amendment because i well know how much the committee on the future of broadcasting owes to two people who had professional experience of broadcasting <e> <s> by that i do not mean that they have been on the air but that they had actually worked in the case of mr tony jay in the bbc and in the case of mr phillip whitehead in the bbc and in an independent television

noble baroness lady wootton said it is when one comes to such questions of cutting that the unfairness or fairness of the treatment comes very much into question <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that this year the university of london owing to the governments policy on overseas students fees has had its resource allocation reduced by million of which million has fallen on the post-graduate medical schools <e> <s> is she further aware that next year according to the best estimates these losses will rise to million <e> <s> and would she not agree that in these circumstances

david from cambridge days to whom i am very grateful indeed for initiating this debate but i had to attend a statutory meeting of the court of the university of london <e> <s> the court is the supreme financial body of the university and as you can imagine we had rather a lot to discuss <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl confirm that the agreement which has been reached on the matter of the closure of museums and galleries was an agreement imposed upon the trustees of museums and galleries by the department of education and science <e> <s> for that reason the noble earl will perhaps not be surprised to learn that i as chairman of the national gallery trustees am somewhat surprised to hear that it is in the power of the trustees to alter this matter <e> <s> does the noble earl agree that this decision was in fact negotiated over the heads of the trustees of museums and galleries and against their will <e> <s> is he also aware that the trustees of museums and galleries deplore the present circumstance in which it is impossible to open on public holidays and that they look back with some nostalgia to the days when the only day on which museums and galleries were closed was good friday <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the trustees are very willing indeed that the galleries and museums should be open in the evenings so that the working public could visit them on weekdays between say and pm but that we are unable to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion with the trade union concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that discussions of a very friendly kind have been opened between the westminster medical school and the charing cross hospital medical school under the independent chairmanship of sir frank hartley a former vice-chancellor of the university of london <e> <s> is the noble lord also aware that the savings which it is estimated will be made by the merger of these two schools provided that the reductions in staff and the savings in administrative costs are as set out and envisaged in the report which has been accepted by the university will amount to some million <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that the universitys policy is that these savings in staff should not fall solely on one school <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not a case where bureaucracy as always and despite the good intentions of the minister manages to defeat those who care about the heritage <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to argue today whether the government should or should not have cut higher education <e> <s> what they have done is part of a nationwide plan to reduce public expenditure <e> <s> i shall not do this because i am well aware that during the s the past decade i listened to a number of speeches by the noble lord lord robbins in which he argued that the institutions of higher education might have a slightly less favourable staff/student ratio <e> <s> indeed that is what is of course being imposed now upon the universities and at this time in our economic affairs i would not really wish to dissent from this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not clear what universities the noble lord is referring to or whether in this country or another <e>", "<cs> my lords i am at a loss to reply to the noble lord <e> <s> i do not know the precise terms on which contracts are signed in the lse but it is clear that in most universities the terms of contract and of probation are as i have said <e> <s> i must say that when i call this a scandal i am meaning a scandal only in the terms that lord keynes used to say that in every great academic institution there would always be found two or three gross abuses <e> <s> i believe that he was thinking about what happened to the last one-third at the bottom of a bottle of claret at a college feast <e> <s> but it is true that scandals are easy to detect and that there are sometimes good reasons why they continue <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness confirm that the million fund to which the noble lord lord rochester referred is a fund for this year only and not for the full three years <e> <s> secondly would she not agree that it might be of advantage to the secretary of state if the universities were to be asked say by the end of this year to provide an estimate of the actual number of posts for all kinds of staff which were likely to be reduced and the staff contracts terminated and in that list would it not also be helpful if estimates could be made of the costs of the termination of a contract breach of which would incur liability for damages in the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the minister will forgive me if i intervene for one moment to say that i believe there is a great deal to be said for what the noble lord lord jenkins of putney was saying <e> <s> however there is some doubt in my mind as to whether or not he was proposing a ministry for all visual media and i think that is a very important point whether he was actually arguing in favour of a minister of telecommunications <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that social scientists owe a considerable debt to the present chairman of the social science research council for the way in which he has taken note through his restructuring of the council of criticisms of the councils former operations such as the noble lord lord beloff referred to a moment ago <e> <s> would he not agree that we ought to have confidence in his judgment and in the councils judgment about their priorities <e> <s> would he further agree that in such matters as deciding whether to send on council funds four social scientists to amsterdam for a conference or one social anthropologist to borneo this is a matter that is much better left to the judgment of the chairman and the council <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed grateful to the noble lord lord beloff because he has with his initiative done exactly what the secretary of state wanted done namely brought about discussion of the report of the noble lord lord rothschild in parliament <e> <s> i also very much sympathise with what he said about the secretary of state himself <e> <s> some very unpleasant things have been said about sir keith joseph <e> <s> it is perfectly reasonable for a secretary of state to ask that something of which he and his friends are suspicious and

entirely correct gloss <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that there are many who understand and who are interested in broadcasting problems who sympathise with him in his desire to establish priorities and who think that he has those priorities right <e> <s> would he not agree that if we have to make a choice it is more important to keep going the services in english on the world service which are listened to by many people abroad than to try to cover every single country in its own language <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that many members of your lordships house welcomed his first reply to the question put to him <e> <s> would he not also agree that it is a total delusion to imagine that when mr habib has been negotiating for seven weeks in beirut this matter can in a flash be settled in the united nations <e> <s> would he also agree that at this time we should not forget the lebanon which unfortunately for that wretched country did not have the power which the wise king hussein of jordan had to expel the plo from its territory <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that in the last years in our universities and institutes of higher education departments of history politics international law and international relations have been set up which exist to promote the study of why states come into conflict with each other <e> <s> does he not agree that there is no need of further proliferation <e> <s> is he aware that in universities there is some suspicion of some of those who promote peace studies in that it is feared that they are interested in propagating a particular explanation of this subject rather than considering dispassionately the whole of the evidence relating to peace as would be customary in any university which had a regard for scholarship <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl share my surprise that the noble lord lord jenkins of putney must apparently be in favour of the reintroduction of capital punishment since opinion polls have shown opinion to be in favour of it although parliament in its wisdom has decreed against it <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that this cprs was set up precisely to look into long-term plans <e> <s> was it not also set up to think the unthinkable about many subjects and that on certain occasions it has done precisely that <e> <s> would the noble baroness not agree that it is reasonable for a body of that kind to come forward with propositions which the government may consider in the end not to be appropriate or equally that it may come forward with propositions which the government could never have had before if they had left it simply to the normal workings of the civil service departments involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the minister for that answer may i ask whether in view of the extremely favourable settlement which the universities have received announced in <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that the only way in which universities are likely to move on this matter is if the university grants committee is advised that some financial repercussions will occur unless there is movement on these matters <e> <s> unless such a statement is made universities as can be shown ever since when mrs williams put points to them are unlikely to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> however is he aware that many students use their own private initiative through hitch-hiking or through group methods of transport to get themselves to and from their universities six times during the year <e> <s> is that not in line with the governments own policy of privatisation <e> <s> is he further aware that with regard to some of the fares which i understand are paid during term time the ancient practice in oxford and cambridge of bicycling from lodgings to lectures classes or laboratories is well-established and has proved itself efficient <e> <s> finally if students were to make savings of this kind on their account would it not be right for the government to use those savings to enable the potential students who have been denied the chance of higher education not merely in universities but in polytechnics and other colleges of further <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure the first thing that your lordships will wish me to say is that it has been worth waiting years to hear a speech of such expert knowledge and containing so many ingenious suggestions which i am sure are going to be of great value to those who study this debate <e> <s> i do congratulate the noble lord lord glanusk very sincerely and i congratulate also the very notable maiden speeches of the noble lord lord pender and of my old friend the right reverend prelate the bishop of wakefield who managed as usual to blend both charm and wisdom in what he said <e> <s> indeed congratulations go to other people such as the noble lord lord orr-ewing and in particular to the noble lord lord hunt for his report <e> <s> i agree with everything that has been said about its being a model of what a report should be and it is very much shorter than other reports to do with broadcasting that i can think of <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord geoffrey-lloyd <e> <s> i hardly knew which to admire most the expertise the eloquence or the charm <e> <s> i am interested in the debate today because the day before yesterday we had an extremely good example of good government consultation we had the hunt report published we then had a debate on that report in this house and presumably that will be followed either by a white paper or by a bill <e> <s> in the case of the rayner report we have gone straight to a bill and i imagine that it is parliamentary time which did not enable a separate debate to take place actually on that report <e> <s> that is rather a pity because there are one or two <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord a question <e> <s> is it not a fact that at the tate and national galleries the seven-year period terminates a trustees career whereas in the bill there is provision for extension for a further five years <e> <s> that is the reason why this term may be different <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble earl lord avon will accept my excuse when i say that i do not <e>", "<cs> my lords did not the lawyers in fact do precisely the opposite and increase the costs which the railwaymen had to bear <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak briefly about the relationship of chairmen and trustees to the heads and staffs of public organisations within the arts since i think that in this area a very great change has taken place in the past years <e> <s> the relationship has changed because the role of government has changed in relation to the arts and for that matter in relation to universities <e> <s> at one time in a museum once one had ones estimates and they were very modest that was all that there was to do about it <e> <s> one worked within those limitations and one was expected to do what one had done in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord forgive me if i strike a somewhat discordant note <e> <s> it is not that i do not welcome the admirable statement which the noble lord has made but i am sure the noble lord would agree with me that this whole business was brought about by the folly of the universities and the institutions in higher education in the public sector for refusing to take any steps to stem the flood of overseas students <e> <s> that having been said would the noble lord not accept that some people believe that we now have a system of extreme complexity difficult to work in the institutions themselves which has been instituted by the government unnecessarily when they had in their own hands the remedy of forcing the institutions in higher education to accept quotas for overseas students <e> <s> if that had been done and the government had then set whatever they thought was the appropriate fee we would have had an easier system to work <e>", "<cs> is it not a fact <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that on several occasions during question time the noble lord lord hatch of lusby as is his right has drawn the attention of your lordships house to the existence of the peace studies unit at the university of bradford and has advocated that such studies should be extended in our schools <e> <s> is it not also a fact that those engaged in promoting peace studies are paid from public funds <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that possibly because of the remit certain people think that the remit is entirely what it should be and that it would be deplored if this remit was re-examined and extended <e> <s> would the noble lord also accept that possibly the small number of complaints which have been received by this commission may reflect some credit on the bbc and the commerial companies which broadcast <e>", "<cs> my lords while paying tribute to the nerves of steel that the noble lord lord orr-ewing is known to possess and to a skill in manoeuvring his car that rivals that of mr lester piggott and mr willie carson on the racecourse will he not accept that some noble lords believe that the scheme has been extremely beneficial to their nervous system and that there has been an improvement <e> <s> will he also accept that now that there are three sets of traffic lights working at hyde park corner there has been a marked improvement in bumping and boring on that particular racecourse <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that some people will welcome his statement that experiments are to take place because it is very likely that these experiments will make for better legislation when the time actually comes to pass a bill through parliament <e> <s> however i should like to ask the noble lord two questions <e> <s> do i infer from this statement that it is now possible for any system of transmitting cable television to be used for instance tree and branch as well as star and any other system <e> <s> secondly is there anything in the white paper which will specifically hold out hope to british industry which is interested in the laying of either co-axial cable or fibreglass cable that such firms will receive some preferential treatment in being allowed to develop these systems <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl agree that however much easier it is made to get private sources to contribute to the purchase of works of art and however more attractive it could be made to enable individuals to make private treaties with museums and gallaries there is no substitute for an adequate purchase grant being given to the major national galleries and museums <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that the asking price for a major work by an old master is now well in excess of the total annual purchase grant given to the national gallery <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise although my name is not on the list of speakers because i was much moved by the opening speeches in todays debate which reached a standard i have rarely heard in your lordships house <e> <s> i must confess that i found the speech nearest to my heart that delivered by the noble lord lord home of the hirsel <e> <s> it seems to me that we have to be very careful when talking about principles in foreign policy <e> <s> foreign policy ultimately is about power <e> <s> principles are fine guidelines provided that you remember that in foreign policy they bear the same relation as proverbs do to morals <e> <s> if you want to describe morality and what you should do you can cite numbers of admirable proverbs the trouble is that every proverb you cite always has an opposite proverb that is equally true many hands make light work and too many cooks spoil the broth <e>", "<cs> my lords the soviet union did apply that principle <e> <s> it applied that principle over afghanistan <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why american foreign policy has been exacerbated and explains why it is bound to take the strong line that it does <e>", "<cs> my lords i am saying no such thing <e> <s> i am just asking the noble lord if he will remember that principles applied in that way lead to foolish decisions in foreign policy <e> <s> undoubtedly the russian invasion of afghanistan hardened american foreign policy <e> <s> it is a sad but alas true situation that under president carter the president appeared to his fellow-countrymen to be if we put it in the kindest way an unlucky president <e> <s> he was a president who was associated with humiliations and defeats in the sphere of foreign policy <e> <s> this has led to the change and the hardening in the line of american foreign policy <e> <s> we must take this into account <e> <s> it is not possible for a country such as the united states to suffer the kind of blow which they suffered the other day in the lebanon and not to react strongly <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble baroness for one moment would she not agree that it was not the national gallery which had so many turners but the tate gallery <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down i wonder whether i heard her correctly when she said that the count von seilern gave his collection to the state <e> <s> the count von seilern gave his collection worth million to the hume house trustees in whom also are vested the courtauld paintings <e> <s> that is why they are all ultimately under the university of london <e>

impression as i have that secretary of state after secretary of state has been in <e>", "<cs> my lords hope that i may intervene for one moment even though i have not put my name down to speak to say how much i welcome this bill <e> <s> i should like to say that if in an intervention i made some faint criticism of the operations of the civil service in some respects i want to pay tribute to the way in which the treasury handled the whole question of count von seilerns will which was a most difficult affair <e> <s> we could have lost the painting to this country had not enlightened treasury officials cut through masses of red tape and settled the matter on entirely sensible terms which were acceptable both to the seilern family in austria and to the hume trustees the university of london

maintain discipline in the polytechnic is likely to be a misfortune but that to lose two for the same reason really looks like recklessness <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble viscount is aware that many people have greatly admired the prime ministers negotiating ability in europe and the way in which she stood out against the rest of the community and got the rights of this country to

noble lord lord beloff <e> <s> of course his speech was animated by those two principles which those who admire his speeches as much as i do will recognise as being the principle of personalised animus against the under-secretary of state responsible for higher education and generalised animus against the officials of the treasury <e> <s> however before i move on to what i had thought i would say i shall try to explain to the noble lord lord beloff why universities are bound to be tangled with the government of the day <e>", "<cs> my lords let me continue <e> <s> the government want each

esteem are not the product of academic snobbery <e> <s> however i shall continue to try by using analogies such as the colleges of advanced technology and their history <e>", "<cs> my lords was not one of the reasons for the shortage of veterinary students the fact that the university of cambridge was unable to fill the places in its veterinary school because the colleges did not admit a sufficient number of students to fill that school <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the reason the stamps have no value placed on them is that in certain parts of london they are valueless <e> <s> is he also aware that in nw and w postboxes have been locked bolted and barred for the past days and no mail whatever has been delivered <e> <s> when will the chairman of the post office make a statement in this regard and reassure us that there is some point in buying stamps <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish that i could be as sanguine as the noble lord lord goodman that the

is said here will not cut much ice <e> <s> of course we know why there was such unanimous approval <e> <s> every member of another place representing a constituency naturally supports a set-up which he thinks will reward the interests of his constituents <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps before the noble lord sits down i could make clear my point about local councillors <e> <s> of course local councillors should be on these bodies <e> <s> it was simply the enthusiasm of his right honourable friend who said i should like far more though they must not go over per cent <e> <s> that i thought

thought that there was always a distinction there to be drawn <e> <s> the vast majority of teachers are exactly as has been stated on this side of the house devoted and dedicated to their task but a minority of teachers have done great harm to the profession as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point about cemeteries but is it not also necessary to provide some housing in areas of that kind <e> <s> does he agree that that can be done by converting barns which are now disused and not necessary for agriculture in that part of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble earl will meet a point which follows from one raised by the noble lord lord callaghan <e> <s> is it not always right that the commanding officer in this case the governor of the prison is the person who is responsible for the place and that one follows his judgment unless in the event it proves to be the wrong judgment when one has to take action <e> <s> however in this case it seems clear that he was overruled and quite different instructions then began to be given <e>", "<cs> my lords is years the normal time for consultation <e> <s> is it par for the course <e>", "<cs> my lords how far is the reduction of these services due to the fact that there has been an attempt over the years to rationalise teaching and research at st thomass hospital with that at guys hospital <e> <s> does this

speech which was so well informed so persuasive and one in which his modesty matched his knowledge <e> <s> i very much hope that he will speak on other topics and i certainly hope that he will play a large part in the committee stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble baroness be better advised to accept that while there has always been a brain drain and i well remember asking questions about it in the s the brain drain today is very much more serious and for easily explicable reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord remember a passage in the memoirs of the noble lord lord barnett in which he referred to a former secretary of state for trade and industry in <e> <s> the noble lord lord barnett noted that the minister so enjoyed attending meetings that he never

unofficial industrial action <e>", "<cs> my lords may i bring two good cases to the attention of the noble baroness <e> <s> in the past two years both my daughters gave birth to babies in st thomass hospital <e> <s> both births were extremely complicated and required caesarian re-section <e> <s> no praise could be too high for the staff of that hospital and i need hardly say that both operations were successful <e>", "<cs> at this stage in our proceedings we should be trying to achieve balance between two ways of looking at broadcasting <e> <s> i voted with the government on the previous amendment because it seemed to me that the movers of the amendment had not really tried to face up to the problem to which the government have been facing up <e>", "<cs> if the noble earl prefers let me describe it in this way chicanery of the most arrogant and intolerable kind in which crews which went abroad would immediately stop work and demand higher wages in order that they should be able to have a meal at the rate which michelin showed that a one-star restaurant could have <e> <s> on friday evening all work would stop until it had been agreed that not merely time and a half should be paid but two and a half times the rate should be paid for work on saturday and three and a half times the rate for work on sunday <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i must tell the noble lord that he cannot just take that line <e> <s> the government were faced with this situation <e> <s> they knew perfectly well that the only way they could ameliorate it was by introducing competition into the whole

has to put oneself in the hands of ones public relations advisers who then mount a campaign to persuade the institutions and ones shareholders that ones company is doing a good job <e> <s> one has no time whatever for forward planning or for running ones company <e>", "<cs> is one of the arguments that the noble earl is deploying that when the late lord thomson was required by the iba to divest himself of a very large proportion of his shares in scottish television that it was because it was in the public interest to bring other shareholders into that company and to limit the power held by the late lord thomson in that company <e> <s> is he saying that that is one of the reasons why he believes that it is in the public interest to bring new blood into the running of the company <e>", "<cs> much of what has been said in the last two speeches is familiar to me <e> <s> we had this kind of debate in the committee on the future of broadcasting when it sat between and <e> <s> in those days we were adamant against any broadcasting council being set up <e> <s> we said that the authorities and the governors of the bbc and the iba were there to safeguard all standards and to deal with the problems in regard to impartiality <e> <s> they were the people who were given that duty <e> <s> to put any kind of council above them was a great mistake <e>", "<cs> one of the reasons is that the governors of the bbc were for many years hardly ever known to accept any complaint that was made <e> <s> they always justified it through thick and thin and never gave an inch <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord not prejudging a little what the noble lord lord rees-mogg may or may not do <e> <s> it may well be that the broadcasting standards council will hold public hearings in order to achieve a

learned lord lord wilberforce has said i should have thought that was a wise thing to do <e>", "<cs> did i understand the noble earl to say that he would look at the wording again <e>", "<cs> it is

situation is an extremely dangerous infringement of the liberty of the subject <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may speak to my amendment <e> <s> i very much follow the line taken by the noble earl lord stockton

briefly <e> <s> some noble lords with great sincerity believe that broadcasting as it stands is entirely impartial <e> <s> but the noble viscount lord whitelaw was entirely right when he said that
