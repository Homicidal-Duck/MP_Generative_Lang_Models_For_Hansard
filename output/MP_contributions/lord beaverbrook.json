["<cs> my lords as i stand here with a certain trepidation embarking upon my first speech in your lordships house i can assure noble lords that i shall not unduly tax your patience <e> <s> today is friday the th and it would certainly be unwise for me to tempt fate any more than is strictly necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state for corporate and consumer affairs announced on th september that he had decided to take legislative action to remedy the public interest detriment identified by the monopolies and mergers commission by making an order under the fair trading act <e> <s> the order would prohibit the practice by tour operators of preventing travel agents from offering pecuniary or other inducements to customers purchasing foreign package holidays from them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for his kind remarks <e> <s> the governments action will create an environment in which travel agents can fully compete with each other in the market place <e> <s> no doubt many travel agents will take full advantage of that fact <e>", "<cs> my lords the monopolies and mergers commission report extends beyond airline operators in fact to all foreign tours <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be pleased to draw my honourable friends attention to that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords again i shall bring that matter to the attention of my honourable friend the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing on the order paper in the name of my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord opposite and i are at one in wishing proper public notice of suspension or withdrawal of authorisation to be given <e> <s> i would put it to him that the bill as drafted meets his point <e> <s> he will see from clause that provision is made for public notice of the secretary of states decision to he given if no reference to the tribunal is made and from clause that provision is made for publication of tribunal reports <e> <s> clause provides that the register shall be noted when the authorisation of any person ceases for whatever reason <e> <s> this provision will ensure that the public register is noted appropriately <e> <s> the noble lord will also see from schedule that a designated agency has to be able and willing to co-operate with other regulators <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can help the noble lord in that the existing wording might have been considered to exclude the activities on the part of a clearing house for example encouraging new members to use its facilities <e> <s> it is clearly proper for such activities to take place within the scope of an exemption <e> <s> the expression anything is qualified by the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i was puzzled as to why the noble lord had tabled the amendment <e> <s> however the intention of the present wording is to ensure that the monitoring and enforcement arrangements of clearing houses are not rendered useless because inadequate resources are made available for their proper performance <e>", "<cs> my lords in accepting the noble lords point about the groupings perhaps with the leave of the house i may also speak to the noble lords amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i think the very point which the noble lord makes is covered <e> <s> the bill obliges a secretary of state to look at the practices that is the way in which the business of the exchange is conducted not just under the rules but the way it actually operates in practice <e> <s> he must be satisfied that investors i emphasise investors are given protection equivalent at least to that afforded by a clearing house under the main provisions of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to confirm that <e>", "<cs> my lords when this matter was debated in committee it was indicated that the great majority of instruments to be brought before your lordships under the provisions of clause were likely to concern miscellaneous exemptions under clause and adjustments to the provisions on listed money market institutions <e> <s> as the government said during committee most of these adjustments will be technical for example to take account of changing statutory functions or titles which should benefit from an exclusion under clause or changing market circumstances which affect the coverage of the money markets exemption <e> <s> i put it to the house that instruments of this degree of technicality do not warrant the affirmative resolution procedure <e> <s> and if there are brought forward instruments which fall outside these technical categories and raise issues of substance then the procedures of your lordships house permit a debate on that particular subject <e> <s> i believe that it is right to be selective here <e> <s> i hope therefore that your lordships will reject this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving that further consideration on report be now adjourned may i suggest that the house does not return until five minutes past eight <e> <s> i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments to clause make a small improvement to the insurance brokers registration act by extending the power of the disciplinary committee <e> <s> we are happy to accept them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords the rules relating to the bt telephone voucher scheme were set out clearly in the prospectus at the time of the offer for sale <e> <s> the rules were designed to ensure that shareholders had sufficient quarterly bills against which vouchers could be used before the vouchers expired <e> <s> it has emerged that a small proportion of shareholders have not made use of all their vouchers <e> <s> it is clear that in the great majority of these cases shareholders have simply forgotten to use their vouchers <e> <s> the government will naturally take account of the experience gained from operating the bt scheme in putting forward similar schemes in future <e>", "<cs> my lords the first batch of vouchers expired in april <e> <s> a total of were issued of which were cashed and or only per cent <e> <s> remained uncashed <e> <s> these probably belonged to about shareholders <e> <s> figures for the second batch which expire tomorrow are not yet available but we expect the success rate to be broadly similar <e>", "<cs> my lords no the rules of the scheme were clearly set out in the prospectus and all shareholders invested on that basis <e> <s> the government cannot alter the rules after the event <e> <s> i should perhaps point out that the vouchers are a government not a british telecom responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the further proceedings after third reading be now adjourned until eight oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords this was obviously a very serious incident <e> <s> police and internal inquiries were instigated at once <e> <s> they are continuing <e> <s> your lordships may be assured that we will take appropriate action in the light of the inquiries <e>", "<cs> my lords the prisoners solicitor asked for mehmet to attend the court for a case which concerned his access to his child whom he wished to be allowed to be brought to the prison to see him <e> <s> on humanitarian grounds and in the interests of justice on balance it was considered right for him to be produced at court <e> <s> i have received no evidence to suggest that these civil court proceedings were contrived for the purpose of setting up an escape attempt <e> <s> however we cannot be sure until the inquiries have been completed <e>", "<cs> my lords when i used the word contrived i was talking about the instigation of the civil proceedings <e> <s> i am not saying that we can rule out there being any collusion after the court proceedings had been set up <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> as i said the decision was made on humanitarian grounds and on balance we believe it to have been the right decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> the case was concerned with whether the child could visit the prisoner in prison rather than who had custody of the child and who would bring up the child <e>", "<cs> my lords i actually said that an internal inquiry was taking place <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> all discharged prisoners are given a form which introduces them to their local dhss office and contains details which assist the prompt consideration of claims for benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the noble baronesss work in this area <e> <s> we are not aware that former prisoners or indeed other claimants have special difficulties compared with other citizens in establishing their identity <e> <s> we have no national system of identity cards <e> <s> we all have to rely on a range of licences passes and other miscellaneous documents to establish our identities <e>", "<cs> my lords once prisoners are discharged from prison they should really be treated no differently from any other citizen and at one time or another we all have to prove our identity <e>", "<cs> my lords i must repeat that we are not aware of any substantial or widespread difficulties with the arrangements i have described <e> <s> however if the noble lord has details of any specific case i should be delighted to look into that case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord the leader of the opposition <e> <s> prison authorities give every discharged prisoner a form with a prison stamp which assists him in getting in touch with his dhss office <e> <s> once the dhss office has issued him with his appropriate entitlements then an ex-offender has to cash his cheque just as any other person would whether an ex-offender or not <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the home secretary is examining mr kees book carefully <e> <s> in the <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend has seen it as his duty having regard to his powers under section of the criminal appeal act to consider each case on its own merits <e> <s> he has not taken the view to date that there are grounds for setting up an inquiry into any of these cases <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole of this case was looked at carefully following the debate in your lordships house in may <e> <s> no grounds could be found to justify interfering with the convictions but as i have said my right honourable friend is nevertheless prepared to look at the case again <e> <s> the door is never closed on cases of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> yes i am aware of the concern that has been expressed by many eminent people including members of this house <e> <s> my right honourable friend has certainly taken careful note of the concern expressed by a number of eminent people about the convictions in this case <e> <s> as regards the second point that was raised by the noble lord concerning a scientific committee my right honourable friend the minister of state wrote to the noble lord lord fitt in january to say that the home secretary could not find grounds to justify such a step <e> <s> however i should like to re-emphasise that my right honourable friend the home secretary has said that the door is never closed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> there must be some factor for the court to look at other than evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that question goes rather wide <e> <s> if the noble lord would like to put down a question i should be pleased to answer it on another day <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to answer in this matter on behalf of the police but i must say that i think that confession was largely discounted <e>", "<cs> my lords the evidence was placed before the jury and the court of appeal and the court of appeal upheld the verdict <e> <s> all i can say <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that goes rather wide of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the leader of the opposition <e> <s> my right honourable friend will of course hear the views that your lordships have expressed today <e> <s> i undertake to convey them in the full spirit in which they were expressed to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to be answering on behalf of the government this evening the question put down by the noble earl <e> <s> i am sure we are all grateful to the noble earl lord longford for <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord would accept i believe that there has to be a certain category of offence that is considered by the lrcs alone and perhaps other categories that are not <e> <s> the noble lord lord harris also raised the matter of the reconviction prediction score <e> <s> it has recently been revalidated by a full and thorough home office study that will be published in the not too distant future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i accept what he says about not mentioning the details of the case <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth i beg to introduce a bill to make provision with respect to the liability of persons for damage caused by defective products to consolidate with amendments the consumer safety act and the consumer safety amendment act to make provision with respect to the giving of price indications to amend part i of the health and safety at work etc <e> <s> act and sections and of the explosives act to repeal the trade descriptions act and the fabrics misdescription act and for connected purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord caithness i beg to introduce a bill to alter the maximum period for which programmes may be provided under contracts with the independent broadcasting authority <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i have nothing to add to the answer given on th november to the noble lords identical question <e>", "<cs> my lords under the act the sros are required to act fairly and reasonably in recognising businesses applying for authorisation <e> <s> as a self-regulating organisation it is the criterion of recognition that its rules and practices about admitting or expelling members must be fair and reasonable and there must be adequate provision for appeals <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not able today to confirm whether they will be open to judicial review but your lordships house passed the act which provides for many functions to be transferred to a designated agency composed of experienced practitioners and independent lay members <e> <s> it would be for the agency to assess the organisations rule books and to decide whether the rules on admission are fair and reasonable <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a most interesting debate and i should like to thank those who have taken part especially my noble friend lord poltimore who made an excellent maiden speech <e> <s> i am sure that i speak for all your lordships when i say that we look forward to hearing him in the future <e> <s> we welcome particularly his considerable knowledge of fine art <e>", "<cs> my lords these directives apply to secondhand goods in their entirety not just the question of works of art collectors items <e> <s> the government see it necessary for the fine arts market industry in london to make available as soon as possible its own figures so that the government can have at their disposal the best information when going to make our countrys proposals to our partners in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords the consumer council was successful <e> <s> in particular the council agreed a resolution which underlines that consumers interests must be taken more fully into account when the commission drafts proposals for community legislation <e> <s> the resolution lists a number of specific factors which the commission should investigate when assessing proposals from the consumer viewpoint and asks the commission to confirm for relevant proposals that it has in fact done so <e> <s> the resolution also stresses the need for effective consultation with consumers <e> <s> the commission is to report on progress by december <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her questions <e> <s> the government accept the finding of the select committee on the european communities that present consultation arrangements with consumers are not satisfactory <e> <s> however the new resolution underlines the necessity for effective and duly representative consultation of consumers <e> <s> the resolution calls on the commission to investigate the impact of proposals on the price of goods or services on their quality their safety the range of choice available to consumers and the state of competition in the market <e> <s> i undertake to convey the remarks of the noble baroness accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will press the commission to implement the words and the spirit of this resolution conscientously and effectively <e> <s> the commission is to make a progress report as i have already said at the end of next year <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree <e> <s> safety of toys should be of primary concern to all member states <e> <s> the united kingdom has taken every opportunity during its presidency to press for rapid action but only recently has a revised draft directive been submitted by the commission as a basis for negotiation <e> <s> however the directive is now on the table and working level discussions are under way <e> <s> the government are urgently seeking the views of all interested parties on these proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to repeat a statement made by my right honourable friend in another place <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord williams of elvel and lord diamond <e> <s> i shall preface my remarks when answering their points by emphasising that the discussions with daf and paccar are at an early stage <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams asked whether the fall in the exchange rate would create new opportunities for the domestic motor industry <e> <s> we have explored a great many avenues and we have concluded that doing nothing is not an option <e> <s> we need to look at all possible means of securing a reliable long-term future for the industry <e> <s> sale is one option but it is not the only one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the right reverend prelate <e> <s> i am of course aware of the excellence of the freight rover company <e> <s> however i prefaced my remarks by saying that discussions are at an early stage and that i cannot give any information about detailed arrangements for the future manufacture of sherpa vans and other freight rover products <e> <s> i should make it clear that freight rover is not included in discussions with paccar <e> <s> i believe that freight rover has a secure future <e> <s> the benefits of linkages with daf are already evident in the existing market collaboration <e> <s> that is why the possibility of closer links with daf is being explored <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said these are early stages in the discussions <e> <s> i heard what the noble lord said and no doubt if and when matters progress in the normal procedure this house will be fully informed <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are of course anxious that leyland bus will prosper as an individual company <e> <s> we hope that in the plans for leyland bus it will prosper <e> <s> rover group is continuing to negotiate the details of a sale with the management buy-out group <e>", "<cs> my lords in trying to answer the large number of points i should like to say that mr days job is to run the company commercially in the interest of all concerned <e> <s> i am quite sure that uncertainty surrounding the company will be minimised if rover group is able to get on with these discussions confidentially and quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very much aware of that side <e> <s> that is why the statement is being made today in order to give as much information as there is at this stage on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall convey the views of the house to my right honourable friend but i emphasise that it is in the interest of all employees of the company that a viable long-term future be secured <e>", "<cs> my lords the government wish to see a solution in the best interests of the company the employees and all concerned <e> <s> the discussions are at a very early stage <e> <s> the board of austin rover will put to the government the alternatives for the government to consider once the board has completed negotiations with the two interested parties <e> <s> the government at that stage will have to review the options <e> <s> the government want to see as much as anybody else in fact probably more than anybody else a successful truck manufacturing industry in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> individual treatment is available for women who have drug dependency problems and this may include psychotherapy <e>", "<cs> my lords group therapy is not at present provided because in general prisoners do not stay long enough at holloway for group work to be viable <e> <s> population pressures are such that sentenced women are transferred quickly to other prisons to release places and to reduce the need for women to be remanded in police cells <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not able to answer that question but i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should say that individual therapy which is available at holloway <e>", "<cs> my lords plans are in hand to open up more accommodation at holloway which would mean that more women will serve their sentences there <e> <s> at the moment there are four women receiving individual psychotherapy but per cent <e> <s> of those who are admitted to the prison have some degree of dependence on drugs <e> <s> early results suggest that one in three of all young adults using opiates who are dried out and receive no further treatment do not resort to their former habit <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> we are prepared to reintroduce group psychotherapy if a viable number of prisoners are able to take benefit from it <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are tackling the problem of drug addiction particularly in prisons on a number of fronts and consistent with their strategy set out in <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are committed to vigorous enforcement of the law against insider dealing <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry is always ready to appoint inspectors under section of the financial services act whenever there is reason to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the house will understand if i do not comment on individual cases <e> <s> however the government the stock exchange and the city firms are alert to the pernicious abuse of inside information and have not hesitated to <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> we believe that the financial services act will work very well and we believe that the parts of it already in force are working very well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid not <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a short but interesting debate on broadcasting policy <e> <s> it is clear that we have now reached a very important stage in the development of our broadcasting services where technology which has until now placed constraints on the number of broadcasting outlets will allow a multiplicity of differing channels and broaden the options for paying for what we watch and listen to <e> <s> the peacock report has set out the considerations which the government the broadcasters and the public need to examine <e> <s> as i said in my opening remarks the government for their part are giving very careul consideration to the committees conclusions and are anxious to listen carefully to the views of parliament and the public <e> <s> as i have said earlier your lordships will have an opportunity for a full discussion of the issues raised by the peacock committee before too long <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft rehabilitation of offenders act exceptions amendment no <e> <s> order which was laid before the house on th november and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lords lord mishcon and lord harris <e> <s> i am especially grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon because as is often the case i find that he is correct and that i am incorrect <e> <s> by way of explanation i should say that the order was withdrawn on th november and laid again on nd december <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> we are continuing to give the highest priority to measures to tackle drug misuse <e> <s> as i said our strategy involves action on a number of fronts aimed at reducing both the supply of and the demand for all drugs <e> <s> this order extends the number of drugs that are covered by legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not be inclined to disagree with that view <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> however after strong representations from the council the financial services bill was amended to allow a role for the council for the regulation of life insurance brokers but with safeguards aimed at integrating so far as possible the requirements of the two regimes so as to minimise the burden of dual regulation <e>", "<cs> my lords on a number of occasions during the passage of the financial services bill we felt that representations were made to us rather late in the day <e> <s> the case put by the noble lord today has been delayed <e> <s> this question was considered at the time in both houses of parliament and the governments first response was to exclude the possibility of dual regulation by removing the scope of the ibrc for those who acted as intermediaries exclusively for life assurance <e> <s> following representations about that approach the bill was amended in the way that i have described <e> <s> there has been a full airing of the issue and a solution acceptable to both houses was found <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole question of the fees charged by regulatory bodies and the implication of those fees on entry into the business will doubtless be looked at closely by the director general of fair trading when he scrutinises the regulatory system for anti-competitive effects <e> <s> the secretary of state who has the task of balancing the needs of competition and of investor protection will also consider that question carefully <e> <s> in those circumstances it would be wrong of me to comment upon particular fees <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene in this interesting exchange <e> <s> i am most grateful to noble lords who have spoken this afternoon <e> <s> as i said earlier the government received many representations from the oil and offshore supply industries calling for some measure to ease company cash flow difficulties in the light of the fall in oil prices <e> <s> the provisions of this bill are aimed at taking prompt action to alleviate these present difficulties by providing qualifying companies with cash to help finance their existing and future developments <e> <s> the benefits of the repayments under this bill should thus flow through to the united kingdom offshore oil industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is untrue to say that taxation is never otherwise targeted <e> <s> there are many aspects of taxation that are designed to achieve specific ends <e> <s> the aim of this particular measure is to help the companies in the north sea that are most in need of help in developing the fields and the projects that are the future of the north sea oil industry <e> <s> i do not accept that targeting is alien to our tax regime <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble and learned lord give way for one second <e> <s> i think the house might like to remind the noble and learned lord that time is of the essence <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord airedale <e> <s> the noble lords amendments nos <e> <s> and appear similar in that they cause an obvious distinction to be made between the different occurrences of the word product in each subsection <e> <s> one could argue that at line we are referring to the producer of any product in which the product in question is comprised <e> <s> that surely cannot be the same product <e> <s> in clause however i am not so opposed to the intention of the noble lord lord airedale to clarify subsection <e> <s> i ask the noble lord to withdraw these amendments on the understanding that the government will consider how that clarity may best be achieved <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords we were intending to deal with this after we had taken the second reading of the gaming amendment bill <e> <s> i suggest that we should not come back to the committee stage until half-past eight if that would be acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for giving such a clear explanation of the reasoning behind the bill <e> <s> i am glad to be able to confirm to your lordships that the government regard the bill as acceptable in terms both of what it seeks to achieve and the way in which the bill is drafted <e>", "<cs> while i accept that this amendment will do little to alter the sense of the subsection i believe it will improve its clarity <e> <s> we are concerned that it should be clear and the government will consider bringing forward at a later stage an amendment to achieve this <e> <s> with that assurance i hope that the noble lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if it is for the convenience of the committee i will speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> in this subsection we are ensuring that the kind of safety which people may expect of a product will depend upon whether it may cause damage to property as well as upon whether it may cause personal injury <e> <s> this is because safe might be taken to refer to risks of personal injury and is for example used in that sense in the consumer safety act <e> <s> we are not helped by the english language in expressing this idea but with respect to the noble lord we are helped even less by his amendment which i think would have the effect of ensuring that the defective product itself was safe from any risk of being damaged killed or injured <e> <s> for that reason i ask the noble lord to consider withdrawing his amendment <e>", "<cs> i must say to the noble lord that i resist this amendment because of the way in which it narrows the sense in which we should have regard to the level of safety of a product <e> <s> we should be concerned with the character of the safety in relation to the product in its widest sense <e> <s> thus we should consider the product in its environment and not in isolation <e> <s> for that reason we have chosen particularly to use the words in relation to <e>", "<cs> we have used the word marketed in giving effect to article a the presentation of the product <e> <s> the report on the strasbourg convention from which was drawn the expression presentation of the product makes perfectly clear that the marketing of the product is included <e> <s> i hope the committee will agree that the word marketed though including supply must go wider and include the manner of the promotion advertising training in use and even delivery to the user <e> <s> at the beginning of this subsection we have made clear that all these circumstances shall be taken into account <e> <s> the use of the word supplied clearly does not do so and therefore i urge that this amendment be resisted <e>", "<cs> i said that marketing could include those matters they do not have to be included <e> <s> for instance many products may be supplied but not ever advertised <e>", "<cs> the word get-up is apparently well understood particularly in the context of the trade marks act <e> <s> for instance it would cover styling packaging leaflets that may be included instructions and indeed everything that is included with a product <e> <s> i believe that the courts are familiar with this word and that it is in use <e>", "<cs> for the convenience of the committee while speaking to amendment no <e> <s> i should like also to address my remarks to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in both those amendments we are concerned with the doing of anything with a product or in relation to the product <e> <s> one could argue that by using the word doing one includes the sense of not doing anything with or in relation to a product <e> <s> however i believe that the noble lords amendments go some way toward clarifying this point <e> <s> clarity must be important in this clause where the meaning of defect the central concept in part i of the bill is being described <e> <s> it is important that the instructions or warnings for a product are understood to relate to the doing or not doing of something with the product <e>", "<cs> subsection c reflects the wording in article c <e>", "<cs> i am afraid the numbering has gone wrong on my file i must apologise to the committee <e> <s> having now sorted out this matter i think there is no need to insert the words fair wear and tear <e>", "<cs> i am now able to go back to the answer that i erroneously gave to the noble lord earlier <e>", "<cs> this part of subsection replicates article of the directive <e> <s> it rebuts any implication arising from clause that a court must infer a defect in the product from the fact that a similar product supplied at a later date was safer <e> <s> i agree that article is couched in terms which absolutely prevent such an inference from being made <e> <s> however it seems to me highly improbable that a court would ever do so <e> <s> to make sense a provision for that purpose would need to go into a separate subsection <e> <s> i doubt whether that would be justifiable <e> <s> therefore again i am afraid i must resist the noble lords amendment <e>", "<cs> we have used the word individual quite deliberately <e> <s> what we are talking about in this subsection is personal reliance on any statement or promise or advice <e> <s> we are not concerned with corporate reliance and to use the word person would as i am sure noble lords will agree have the effect of including both the individual and the corporate identity <e> <s> perhaps in the light of this explanation the noble lord lord airedale will consider withdrawing his amendment <e>", "<cs> for the convenience of the committee i shall address my remarks to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> while i accept that the words the defendant are commonly used in england to describe the person proceeded against the noble lord must remember that this part of the bill applies to scotland as well as to england and wales <e> <s> in scotland the usual word is defender <e> <s> i hope then that the noble lord will be satisfied that the phrase we have used reflects the interests of those on both sides of the border and that he will feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> this may be a convenient moment to take the statement <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord morton has said it is made clear in article <e>", "<cs> it may be for the convenience of the committee if i suggest that we do not return to this subject until pm <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> i should have liked to take amendments nos <e> <s> and together because they all change the test of a persons knowledge or the knowledge he might reasonably have been expected to have about loss or damage caused by a defective product <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for now grouping these amendments together and i shall speak to them accordingly <e> <s> as i was saying subsections and to which these amendments are all directed reproduce the wording in section of the latent damage act <e> <s> they determine when damage to property is to be taken to have occurred in a case where the damage could not initially be discovered <e> <s> it is when any person with an interest in the property had knowledge of such facts as would lead a reasonable person to consider the damage sufficiently serious to justify the institution of proceedings <e> <s> in subsection it says that knowledge for this purpose includes the knowledge which a person might reasonably have been expected to acquire from facts ascertainable by him with the help of appropriate expert advice which it is reasonable for him to seek <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for grouping these amendments and i shall speak to them all together <e> <s> i turn first to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the purpose of clause a is to highlight one of the factors which should be considered along with all the circumstances which must be considered when deciding whether goods fail to comply with the general safety requirement <e>", "<cs> what i said was and i must apologise to the committee for repeating myself that paragraph b ensures that we must look at whether it would have been possible to have made those goods safer and if that were possible whether the cost in relation to those goods would have been reasonable <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what

this would be a convenient moment to take the statement <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until eight

introduced but as he has readily acknowledged it meets the concern of the restaurant trade to be able to offer drinks with <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest to the views expressed in your lordships house on this important and sensitive subject <e> <s> the right reverend prelate the bishop of birmingham is to be congratulated on his decision to introduce a measure

will agree with me when i say that we all look forward to hearing more from her in future <e>", "<cs> this is a complicated clause <e> <s> the difficulties of defining the word misleading demonstrate very clearly the need for some kind of supporting code of practice <e> <s> on the points that the noble lord makes about quantity discounts what is the price in clause <e>", "<cs> may i deal with these few matters <e> <s> my noble friend lord campbell of alloway raised a point about the code of practice <e> <s> i was merely pointing out the difficulties that we have indentified in this area <e> <s> i wish to make no statement as to how we resolve those difficulties at this stage <e>", "<cs> i think that in this instance it would be better if i considered the matter further and wrote to the noble lord on these points <e> <s> they are complicated and i prefer to get them absolutely right for him <e>", "<cs> the point i was making was really about hidden extras in general in this case <e> <s> for instance vat is one as the noble baroness pointed out delivery charges are another example <e> <s> as for the matter of vat being pointed out separately it is of course open for any consumer to ask for that information but as the noble baroness will know many prices are shown as inclusive of vat <e>", "<cs> this clause sets out the extent to which part iii applies to services and facilities <e> <s> its coverage is wide <e> <s> all services and facilities fall within part iii subject to a number of exceptions <e> <s> services provided to an employer under a contract of employment are not covered as this is a matter for employment law <e> <s> neither are any services or facilities provided by an authorised person or an appointed representative in the course of carrying on investment business within the meaning of the financial services act <e> <s> that act already protects investors against misleading indications of the price of investments <e>", "<cs> i shall look at the matter and write to the noble lord on the subject <e>", "<cs> if the noble lords amendment were adopted it would impose a very heavy and i believe unreasonable burden on traders who give the sort of price indications covered by this defence <e> <s> the scope of the defence is already very narrow <e> <s> it is intended to deal with the situation where manufacturers advertise the price at which their goods are available in the shops <e> <s> motor manufacturers for example often advertise the prices they have recommended to dealers to charge <e> <s> it is available only when the alleged offence relates to an indication of a price which has been recommended to all those from whom the goods services accommodation or facilities are indicated as being available the indication was misleading only because someone failed to follow the recommendation and it was nevertheless reasonable for the person who both gave the indication and made the recommendation to assume that his recommendation was generally being followed <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> the brief i have is intended to set out very clearly the reason why we feel that we cannot accept this amendment <e> <s> but of course we always listen to whatever is said in your lordships house and will read what my noble friend lord campbell has said <e> <s> but i have set out our case for being unable to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps it will be for the convenience of the committee if we do not return to the committee stage until <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> this is a complicated clause <e> <s> as to whether trading standards officers are prevented from notifying problems or warning the public about unsafe goods the answer is basically no <e> <s> however i should like to consider the matter further and perhaps respond to the noble baroness in writing <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e> <s> i should like to thank your lordships for your interest in this bill <e> <s> the measure itself is modest <e> <s> it is promoted by an imminent period of change in british broadcasting motivated by far-reaching technological developments <e> <s> the implications of those developments were considered in the report of the peacock committee which examined the future financing of the bbc <e> <s> as

<s> it is intended that there should be consultation with the local authority associations prior to the issue of such guidance <e> <s> the amendments provide that guidance may make certain requirements for consultation and the representation of police fire and building authorities at inspections of both designated sports grounds and regulated stands <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to limit the flexibility of the provision for inspection of designated sports grounds by prescribing a maximum of one year between inspections <e> <s> as i said in speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and there will be discussions with local authorities in which the question of frequency of inspection will be raised and the guidance to be issued by the secretary of state is likely to set frequencies for inspecting different types of grounds <e> <s> nevertheless i believe it would make for undue rigidity and would place an unnecessary burden on local authorities to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i take very seriously the views of the noble lord <e> <s> the popplewell report made certain recommendations <e> <s> the government are concerned that the burden of such a duty should not fall more heavily than is necessary on local authorities <e> <s> however we would be happy to look at this again if the noble lord would feel able to withdraw his amendment at this time <e>", "<cs> this amendment requires a local authority to consult the chief officer of police and the fire authority or building authority about the terms and conditions of a safety certificate <e> <s> such provision is already made in lines and of clause on page of the bill <e> <s> if the noble lord turns to that he may see that the amendment needlessly duplicates existing provisions <e> <s> under those circumstances i would ask the noble lord to have a look at that point <e>", "<cs> clause gives the local authority the power to include a condition in a safety certificate that certain records be kept which refer to a regulated stand <e> <s> the amendment seeks to set out in detail which records relating to fire safety should be kept <e>", "<cs> a preliminary determination under clause is the first step for the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords the government doubt whether such an arrangement would add significantly to the information already made available by the annual reports of her majestys chief inspector of constabulary the commissioner of police of the metropolis and every chief constable for his own force area <e>", "<cs> my lords it must be for the members of the association to decide whether it should produce an annual report and if so whether that report should be published <e> <s> in any case we do not believe that a report would provide information which is not already available to us <e> <s> the association of chief police officers is a non-statutory body <e>", "<cs> perhaps it will be for the convenience of the committee if i speak to amendments nos

patent which had already entered its sixteenth year at the date of commencement of this bill <e> <s> for patents which had not passed the end of the fifteenth year at commencement licences of right would not be available if a declaration was filed <e> <s> these amendments therefore have the attraction not present in the bill as it stands that if there is any opportunity for a licence of right on any particular patent it is equally available to all <e> <s> the amendments would however prevent declarations being filed in respect of older patents for which no licence had yet been sought <e> <s> this may not be entirely fair to the patentees concerned <e> <s> however the government feel that this is a subject to which the house could possibly return on report <e>", "<cs> very briefly the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme as mentioned by the noble lords lord mcintosh and lord northfield sets a ceiling on a companys profitability <e> <s> the department of health and social security examines critically the individual costs of each company and the department cannot see the abolition of the licence of right provisions producing additional costs to pharmaceutical companies and thus furthering the need for price increases on other products <e>", "<cs> i think that it would be wrong for me to do so at this stage because the report was published in the paper only this morning and we have had only a short time in which to look at this matter <e> <s> but the position is that we feel that it would be broadly cost equivalent <e> <s> there would be no basic change <e>", "<cs> the government would regard million as being significant <e>", "<cs> i have gone as far as i can <e> <s> as i have indicated we have looked at this matter today and i think that the best i can do is to say that we continually review the position <e> <s> we believe that there would be very little if any change in the costs <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that the committee would expect me to stand here and agree to considerable extra expenditure by the dhss <e> <s> when i say that the expenditure involved would be broadly neutral the committee should consider that that is our view and it is what we mean <e>", "<cs> my lords in the months to october the industrys exports were worth billion an increase of per cent <e> <s> on the same period in <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the united states of america takes by far the largest share <e> <s> other leading export markets are west germany and saudi arabia <e>", "<cs> not without notice my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we are delighted with the

governments aid to the industry and to the british aerospace corporation in particular conforms with the general rules laid down under the general agreement on tariffs and trade <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and we pointed out that the support given to the airbus in the past and any support for the future will be no more than that received by major united states companies who benefit from substantial support from the united states government through military and other programmes <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend would like to table a question i shall be very pleased to answer it <e>", "<cs> not without notice my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill introduced by the right reverend prelate the bishop of birmingham and to which your lordships gave a second reading on th january is in itself a straightforward measure <e> <s> it is short and simple in form and the right reverend prelate explained that it was designed solely to take account of scientific advances which have taken place since the act was introduced as recorded in the report of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists <e> <s> these advances apparently have the result that babies are capable of survival at a significantly lower gestational age than when the act was passed <e> <s> on that basis as i indicated during the <e>", "<cs> my lords my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state for corporate and consumer affairs has drawn attention in speeches to the resolution agreed by the consumer council last october <e> <s> this resolution referred to the need

committee will be deciding future meeting dates next week <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally i am aware of the concern of the noble baroness and of her efforts on behalf of consumers in europe <e> <s> there are a number of subjects under discussion <e> <s> as she will know there are proposals on unit pricing toy safety and imitations of consumer products <e> <s> all these matters may come before the council of ministers but the agenda is a matter for the belgian presidency <e>", "<cs> my lords the government accept the findings of the select committee that the present consultation arrangements are not satisfactory <e> <s> the new resolution of the council underlines the necessity for effective and duly representative consultation of consumers <e> <s> the european consumer council and the government are not wedded to any particular reforms but want to see emerging a credible package of improvements <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that will be a matter for the committee itself to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> the government are not privy to the european commissions consideration of these matters <e> <s> however the consumer council has called on the commission to produce a report and we hope that it will take note of the consultation that has taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to impact statements the government will press for the resolution to be implemented conscientiously and effectively <e> <s> at the end of the year the commission is to make a progress report and we shall review that carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords we constantly press for progress on consumer matters <e> <s> as i said my honourable friend has made a number of speeches including one on th november to the european parliament to press for progress in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i refer the noble lord to the reply of my honourable friend the economic secretary to the treasury to the debate on clause of the banking bill on th january during committee proceedings in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords will be aware that the banking bill is presently in another place <e> <s> it would be inappropriate and premature for me to comment on it now <e> <s> there will be ample opportunity for noble lords to discuss and fully debate the bill when it comes to your lordships house <e> <s> however i understand the concern of the noble lord <e> <s> it may be of some comfort that in the one case where an attempt was made to acquire a uk clearing bank the matter was referred to the monopolies and mergers commission and the acquisition was stopped <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall of course bring the comments of the noble lord to the attention of my honourable friend in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not aware of any reciprocal attempt by american banks simply <e>", "<cs> this may be a convenient moment to take the statement <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has recalled that at committee stage i undertook to look at this matter again <e> <s> as he has stated my noble friend lord caithness wrote on this matter to say that we do not rule out annual inspection for all designated grounds <e> <s> my noble friend gave an assurance and i reiterate it that we expect the guidance to require the annual inspection of the international grounds all football league grounds and the rugby league and test cricket grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that specific question is no <e> <s> these negotiations and discussions would not be concluded prior to this bill leaving your lordships house <e> <s> indeed the guidance that is to be issued will of course be as a result of this bill becoming an act <e> <s> but i should like to emphasise that we wish to look at this matter very seriously and i put that to the noble lord <e> <s> however if he feels that he must take the opinion of the house then that is- a course open to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i said to the noble lord lord mishcon that we should like to look at this matter again and for that very reason i cannot give the undertaking he is seeking <e> <s> i have to say that that could only come as a result of looking at it again <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that noble lords will appreciate that the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale has given a clear exposition of the case for his bill <e> <s> let me confirm that the government accept the case for abolition of this form of licensing and indeed support the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords short term interest rates will continue to be held at whatever levels are necessary to maintain downward pressure on inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that decisions on interest rates can be made only in the light of careful assessment of monetary conditions and changes made only when required to maintain steady but not excessive downward pressure on inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords we are taking all factors into account in assessing the level of interest rates that are appropriate <e> <s> as regards industry company liquidity and profitability remains strong and relaxation of monetary policy fuelling inflation would be a far greater threat to industry than current levels of interest rates <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> well my lords because i was not asked that question <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i have just covered that point <e>", "<cs> my lords yes but i should point out that the inflation rate in this country is still considerably higher than in all our main competitor countries except italy <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but unfortunately it is not quite as simple as that <e> <s> there are many other factors that we have to take into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that your lordships house would expect me to comment on that matter <e> <s> however i think that the success of the interest rates strategy is demonstrated by the fact that inflation is at its lowest level for years and that we are in our sixth successive year of economic growth <e>", "<cs> your lordships might like me to remind members that we are at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords for the convenience of the house i shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and in the name of the noble lord lord airedale and to amendment no <e> <s> in the name of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept of course that all the circumstances taken literally appears rather a tall order <e> <s> plainly it must be interpreted in the sense of the circumstances which might affect what people are likely to expect at the time which is relevant for considering whether the product is defective <e> <s> evidently if the circumstances are not reasonably ascertainable in the sense that a given individual <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i am unable to give a favourable response to the amendment <e> <s> i do not think that we gave it a favourable response in committee <e> <s> we agreed to look at the position <e> <s> as the noble lord lord airedale reminded us the amendments are identical to those he moved in committee <e> <s> we agreed to look at the amendments because we thought that they might add some clarity to clause <e> <s> the noble lords amendments were withdrawn on the understanding that we would consider them and on the basis that if we thought it necessary we would bring forward suitable amendments at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving that further consideration on report be now adjourned perhaps i may suggest that we do not return to this report stage until five minutes past eight oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be clear to the house from our discussion of the preceding amendments that for the purposes of subsection of clause all the circumstances should be taken into account <e> <s> we have discussed the new amendment which refers to the manner in which goods have been marketed and any instructions or warnings given with them <e> <s> we have also discussed the published standards of safety which could be relevant to those goods <e> <s> the amendment proposes removing from what will now be the third paragraph of subsection a particular factor which should be taken into account when deciding whether consumer goods fail to comply with the general safety requirement <e> <s> that factor is the cost of making those goods safer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord opposite for explaining the reasons for the amendment <e> <s> i say straight away that i am prepared to accept not only his argument but also his amendment <e> <s> it would seem entirely appropriate for us in our description of offences against the safety regulations to include a provision which relates to both the prohibition and the requiring of provision of information <e> <s> i commend the amendment to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord morton for his explanation of the purpose of this amendment <e> <s> before answering the detailed points made by noble lords on this amendment i should like to say to the noble baroness lady burton of coventry that later government amendments to be moved to clause by my noble friend will ensure that regulations on the resale of gas and electricity apply to landlords whether or not they are in business <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble baroness that assurance at the moment because i am not sufficiently familiar with what my noble friend will say later <e> <s> if he does not cover the ground no doubt the noble baroness will have something to say at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i entirely take the argument put by the noble lord lord morton and supported by the noble lord lord campbell <e> <s> on that basis i think that we would like to look at this again carefully to see whether something has been missed and whether it can be looked at further <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would remove what in my view is an essential power for the secretary of state to prescribe by regulation that particular tests should be carried out only by specified test houses <e> <s> this is not by any means a new power <e> <s> it was available under both the consumer protection act and the consumer safety act <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i have already said that we will approve as many testing houses and laboratories as are technically competent to carry out particular tests and i think that would be without any other restriction <e> <s> indeed it is part of the assurance that i have given to the noble lord already <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of the house i do not want to be drawn into saying who may or may not be competent to do this sort of testing but i think that in what i have said i have excluded no one at all <e>", "<cs> my lords if their application to become a designated agency under the act is successful it will be for the securities and investments board to recognise self-regulating organisations <e> <s> an organisation can only be recognised if it satisfies the criteria for recognition set out in the act <e>", "<cs> my lords the bodies which intend to apply for recognition are expected to apply to regulate specified kinds of investment activity <e> <s> the membership of most applicant sros will therefore include different types of firms engaged in a similar <e>", "<cs> my lords without commenting on the fullness of any reply or question i expect businesses to prefer to obtain authorisation through membership of an sro but the alternative of direct authorisation by the sib will of course be available <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the sib have indicated that the five sros preparing to apply for recognition will form a satisfactory structure capable of providing for the whole range of investment business <e> <s> they will be looking carefully at fimbras rules and regulations once they come forward for approval <e>", "<cs> my lords i am inclined to agree <e> <s> however having been accused of giving a rather short answer to my noble friend perhaps i may say that i might have run the risk of giving a rather long answer if i had spelt out the full title of a number of these organisations <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am sure they have <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington for setting out clearly the reasons for this amendment <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lord lord obrien for giving your lordships his opinion <e>", "<cs> i should like to pick up a topic to which the noble lord lord bruce referred <e> <s> he mentioned the treasurys broad power to give direction to the bank of england which is contained in the bank of england act <e> <s> although it has never been used it is there <e> <s> but i should say that my right honourable friend the chancellor has no wish to be specifically responsible for the manner of publication of the report and i should emphasis again that there <e>", "<cs> we have carefully considered the amendment <e> <s> we have come to the conclusion that it is not necessary to cover such groups of people particularly reporting accountants or other investigators because we feel that it would be anomalous to grant them immunity when inspectors appointed by the secretary of state and by the building societies commission do not enjoy similar protection <e>", "<cs> for the convenience of your lordships committee i too will speak to this amendment and to amendment no <e>", "<cs> the noble lord asked about the building societies act and the building societies commission <e> <s> it would probably be best for me to consider what the noble lord has said and then write to him on the subject <e> <s> it is a complicated matter and i should like to look at it further and study carefully what he has said <e>", "<cs> i too do not believe that there is any practical problem that these amendments are needed to solve <e> <s> clearly the chancellor of the exchequer may well on occasion request from the bank of england papers on particular issues under the bill <e> <s> if appropriate these could be published <e> <s> and the bank of england can and frequently does publish reports on specific aspects of supervision as the need arises <e> <s> i am not aware of any dissatisfaction as to the quality or quantity of such reports made under the banking act <e> <s> that act contains no provisions such as those proposed <e> <s> i believe that the provisions would be entirely redundant my right honourable friend the chancellor requires no additional authority in this respect and would serve to imply that the bank of englands record in such matters is inadequate <e> <s> i do not believe that to be the case and on that basis i should have to resist this amendment if it were pressed <e>", "<cs> i am advised that the noble lords amendment is unnecessary in that the powers available to the treasury to prescribe transactions by reference to any factors appearing to it to be appropriate is sufficient to allow the regulations to prescribe classes of transactions <e> <s> the current regulations under the banking act the banking act exempt transactions regulations which are made under the similar wording of section of the act already prescribe certain classes of transactions for example those involving sterling commercial paper <e> <s> i believe that this amendment is not necessary and if the noble lord has in mind any other class of transaction perhaps he will make it clear <e>", "<cs> yes i am advised that that is the case <e>", "<cs> i was indeed curious as to the purpose of the noble lords amendment and i am grateful to him for his explanation <e> <s> i think that his amendment fails to take into account the fact that the building societies act permits unauthorised societies which are in the process of starting business to accept deposits in the form of subscriptions for deferred shares and certain other payments <e> <s> if this amendment were to become part of the bill new societies would be prevented from having qualifying capital in the form of deferred shares from the founders and therefore could not become authorised <e> <s> if there is another aspect of the noble lords <e>", "<cs> yes i am <e> <s> that is exactly what i am saying <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for explaining his reasons for putting down the amendment <e> <s> it is a complicated matter <e> <s> to answer the points that he made the bank of england issues bank notes and is exempted under this provision <e>", "<cs> i do not have the answer to that but i imagine that i am probably safe in saying that they will be treated in the same way <e> <s> sterling commercial paper is a deposit and hence it is also exempted <e> <s> solicitors also have an exemption in respect of deposits taken in the course of business except under the regulations <e> <s> i too have had difficulty in identifying in practice where deposits would be repaid at a discount because i think that the definition of a deposit <e> <s> would probably contain an element of capital security <e>", "<cs> it is a deposit <e> <s> it therefore needs an exemption <e> <s> it already has one under the act which is equivalent to clause <e> <s> i hope that that is helpful <e>", "<cs> yes it will <e> <s> these are complex matters <e> <s> if i have missed any point that the noble lord would like answered i shall be pleased to look at <e>", "<cs> this is another complicated matter <e> <s> i followed with interest the remarks made by the noble lord in moving his amendment <e> <s> the governments view of this amendment is that it would capture a very much wider range of business than is presently caught that is those businesses which accept deposits but which do not do so as a profit-making activity <e> <s> for example the deposits may be ancillary to other activities <e> <s> if such deposit proceeds are segregated and placed on deposit with the businesses bankers then it cannot be readily said that the deposits have been lent to others <e>", "<cs> the businesses which finance themselves wholly from the money markets do not require to be authorised <e> <s> the lenders do not require the protection of this bill <e> <s> if they regularly take some retail deposits then they would need authorisation <e>", "<cs> correct <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may say that these are very complex matters <e> <s> they will need to be looked at carefully and some time taken to study them <e> <s> if the noble lord would like to consider what i have said perhaps he would like to withdraw the amendment in the meantime <e>", "<cs> i shall write to the noble lord on this point <e> <s> i give that assurance <e>", "<cs> certainly <e> <s> i am willing to give that undertaking <e>", "<cs> with regard to the amendment no of the noble lord and speaking with the leave of the committee to amendments nos <e> <s> and the effect of these amendments would not be to require the treasury to consult the securities and investments board as well as the bank but would require the treasury to consult one or other or both of them <e> <s> as such they are not necessary <e> <s> it is open to the treasury as well as consulting the bank as they must do under the subsection to consult other interested bodies including the sib <e> <s> if the amendment were to be made it would with respect to the noble lord result in a somewhat confusing situation in that some orders could be made after consultation with the bank some after consultation with the sib and some after consultation with both a confused state of affairs that i am sure members of the committee would not wish to bring about <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has asked me a few questions which i shall come to from a slightly different direction after having set out our position <e> <s> the effect of the noble lords first amendment would he to restrict the choice of account-ant able to provide reports on information submitted in connection with applications for authorisation under this clause <e> <s> the only eligible accountants would be those qualified under section of the companies act that is to say accountants who are members of a united kingdom body of accountants which is recognised by the secretary of state or accountants recognised by the secretary of state as having similar qualifications obtained overseas <e>", "<cs> i have listened to what the noble lord had to say on this subject <e> <s> i think it is inconceivable that the bank would engage anyone other than a qualified accountant but there is no legal definition which would apply worldwide and it would be better to leave the matter to the banks discretion <e>", "<cs> for the convenience of the committee i shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i should prefer to speak to the noble earls amendment separately if there is no objection <e>", "<cs> i think that i may be able to make part of my noble friends day although i am not sure about the whole day <e>", "<cs> we had thought paragraph to be wholly satisfactory in requiring accounting records to be adequate whose meaning is spelt out in paragraph <e> <s> the addition of the word proper would imply something different from the word adequate but i am not sure that it would be clear what <e> <s> it might imply that the accounting records should be such as to comply with other legal requirements for example under the companies act <e> <s> it would however be unnecessary and inappropriate for the bill to duplicate requirements under other legislation <e> <s> this is not the purpose of the bill <e> <s> further <e>", "<cs> the million threshold in paragraph of schedule to the bill is included primarily to ensure that institutions that are moving into deposit-taking have an adequate cushion of their own resources against start-up costs and a reasonable financial commitment from their backers <e> <s> it is a minimum requirement and only applies on initial authorisation <e> <s> by virtue of paragraph c of article of the ec first credit institutions directive it is not permissible for the supervisors subsequently to withdraw authorisation solely on the ground that the initial minimum net asset criterion is no longer met <e>", "<cs> i am not able immediately to give the noble lord a full explanation of that matter and i shall write to him on the subject <e> <s> i understand that the definition of net assets for banking regulation purposes varies from that used for defining shareholders assets within a corporation <e> <s> i believe that it has to do with withdrawability of those net assets- <e> <s> a different definition may be appropriate for the purposes of regulating minimum capital requirements <e> <s> the definition of net assets used in this bill is that used in the act and has given no difficulty <e> <s> however i shall write to the noble lord to confirm what i have said to him <e>", "<cs> the act enables the bank to revoke an authorisation if it appears to it that any of the authorisation criteria are not or have not been fulfilled <e> <s> those words were included to deal with the situation where the bank may have been unable to obtain all the information that it needs to establish beyond doubt that the institution does not fulfil the criteria <e> <s> one could envisage for example a shadowy overseas controlling shareholder resident in the netherlands antilles being reluctant to answer all of the banks questions <e> <s> in another case it may be that a third party refuses to supply information relevant to confirming that a principal controller was not fit and proper <e> <s> in such instances the bank would be on safe ground in proceeding to take action if it considered that depositors interests were or might be threatened <e>", "<cs> may i come back on one point <e> <s> the key point here is that the present wording would cope with a case where there was uncertainty and where the bank is concerned for the protection of depositors but cannot ascertain with any certainty whether the criteria are met <e> <s> that point was unclear under the act <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for putting this point <e> <s> i should like to look at that matter <e> <s> i do not have an immediate response except to say that the principle of the protection of depositors is very high in our priorities here and we feel that the bank should have powers to do this <e> <s> the point is the same under clause but clause covers only notice of revocation once the decision has been taken <e> <s> it is therefore a slightly different point <e> <s> however i shall look at it again and if there is further explanation that i can give the noble lord i shall write to him on the point <e>", "<cs> i can understand the reason behind these amendments <e> <s> depositors should so far as is practicable be in full knowledge of the facts <e> <s> there are however good reasons why these facts should not be mandatorily disclosed <e>", "<cs> i was tempted to say not without notice <e> <s> i am not able to answer the question <e>", "<cs> the content of such publications is properly a matter for the bank as the authority given responsibility for supervision under the bill <e> <s> the situation was the same under the act and the amendment would not change that <e> <s> i believe that the bank of england has a first class record in respect of its obligations under the existing act to publish these statements of principles <e> <s> it will continue to have a statutory obligation to do so under the bill and there is no reason to suppose that it will not discharge that obligation in a proper manner <e>", "<cs> i think it would be helpful if i clarified the definition of controller in clause <e> <s> for instance it also covers managing directors and chief executives who could be

bruce of donington for bringing this to the attention of the committee <e> <s> we have looked carefully at the amendment and i can reassure the noble lord that the bill as drafted is adequate <e>", "<cs> again i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> however i am advised that in this context the word or is correct <e> <s> the effect of clause is to specify some examples of the type of regulation

should be no risk to the depositor in allowing them to be held until maturity <e> <s> conversely the nature of banking is such that risks would arise for those last in the queue if some depositors were able to demand immediate repayment <e> <s> that could create a liquidity crisis in which some depositors would lose <e>", "<cs> i fully understand the noble lords question and i will write to him

amendments of my noble friend lord strathclyde i can confirm that these amendments slightly widen the power under clause for obtaining information by including a related company among the connected companies from which information and documents can be obtained <e> <s> a related company is defined in the companies act <e> <s> it is in brief summary a company in which the authorised institution holds per cent <e> <s> or more of the nominal value of the shares in the company <e> <s> the amendments also significantly widen the reach of the powers of investigators appointed under clause to include companies in which the authorised institution or its shareholder controllers have a per cent <e> <s> or more stake rather than just per cent <e> <s> as is the case with the bill as it stands <e>", "<cs> the government would agree that there is a limit to how far information and investigation powers should go <e> <s> as i have already said the government consider that my noble friends amendments have that balance about right <e>", "<cs> i cannot believe that in the real world the authorised institution would not have disclosed to anyone who was underwriting an issue of stock of its shares the material fact that it was under investigation <e>", "<cs> as i have said any institution doing such underwriting should be aware of the possibility of it ending up with a stake of more than per cent <e> <s> if indeed it had underwritten an issue of shares to that extent <e> <s> however i point out that the bank can only use the powers under clause in the interests of depositors <e> <s> if an underwriting unfortunately got left with the underwriters it is very unlikely in those circumstances that the bank would need to use its powers <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for putting down this amendment <e> <s> i have looked at it very carefully <e> <s> the governments view is that clause d already covers the two cases where the shareholder controller himself or itself directly controls the voting rights or does so indirectly through a subsidiary of the company of which he has direct control <e> <s> that is the meaning of control the exercise or in subsection d <e>", "<cs> i believe that the amendment is necessary to bring the subsection in line with other provisions <e> <s> i believe that the draftsman wanted to include it after taking legal advice <e> <s> i think that it should have been included in the bill at an earlier stage but by a simple oversight it was omitted <e>", "<cs> i am informed that the definition documents in clause refers to this matter and that may help the noble lord to understand why the amendment is required <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what the noble lord lord williams of elvel has said <e> <s> at the committee stage last monday we debated the level of immunity which was appropriate under the bill <e> <s> i shall study carefully what the noble lord has said in respect of clause <e> <s> i should like to think about the matter in the light of the previous debate and i shall write to the noble lord on this subject <e>", "<cs> on clause i shall take the question of the noble lord lord bruce first <e> <s> the short answer to his point is no <e> <s> this clause gives power of entry only to premises occupied by those on whom a notice has been or may be served <e> <s> those are listed in clause and <e> <s> in respect of the point raised by the noble lord lord williams the safest route would be for me to look at this question further and write to him <e>", "<cs> in granting these powers of entry we have been careful to ensure that they are of a nature likely to be required <e> <s> i think that previously it was found with experience that this level of power of entry was about what was necessary and therefore what should be given and no further than that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his question <e> <s> if he turns to clause he will see that there is a much tougher power of investigation which requires the involvement of a magistrate to issue a warrant <e>", "<cs> i was about to say that i do not believe it to be a similar power <e> <s> the powers of entry are in fact rather modest <e> <s> there is no power to force entry <e> <s> it has not been thought necessary to provide a power to force entry in the case of supervisory inquiries <e> <s> we believe that the penalty as stated of possible imprisonment ought to be sufficient to enable the bank to gain entry <e> <s> but as i said where entry is refused these penalties apply <e> <s> of course that would have to go through the legal process <e>", "<cs> the power under this clause is not entirely new <e> <s> sections and of the act can be interpreted as giving equivalent power in respect of licensed deposit takers where they require information or documents at such time and at such place as is specified in a written notice <e> <s> i am sure that members of the committee who have spoken on this matter will also note that clause does not give officials of the bank the right to force entry as i said <e> <s> therefore i do not think that it can be described as a very draconian power <e> <s> it is a modest reserve power for hard cases and i hope that on reflection members of the committee will be able to accept that point <e>", "<cs> i have gone as far as i can this evening in trying to justify the powers under clause <e> <s> it would probably be better if i looked at all that has been said and perhaps wrote to the noble lords who have spoken on this subject <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord bruce for putting the amendment forward <e> <s> i have to say that i do not see a great deal of merit in the change <e> <s> however i do not think that there would be any sense in objecting to it and as the noble lord says it puts the matter beyond doubt <e> <s> i shall be happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord bruce for raising this point <e> <s> i should like to say that there is more to it than just vigorous enforcement <e> <s> indeed it is most important that there are adequate resources available for the investigation in seeking out contraventions <e> <s> without that there are unlikely to be any prosecutions taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness and to the noble lord for their support on the order <e> <s> i shall speak briefly to answer the points that they have put to me <e>", "<cs> my

upon the kind of changes that we decide may be appropriate <e> <s> i may not have gone as far as the noble baroness would like on this matter but i can assure her that we are actively considering the position <e> <s> i hope that in due course the method of consultation will be announced <e>", "<cs> my lords since british productivity growth in the whole economy has been second only to that of japan of all major industrialised countries and in manufacturing it has been the fastest <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the uks average growth rate was only three-quarters of a per cent <e> <s> per annum between and and we were at the bottom of the productivity growth league <e> <s> this contrasts with the period since when our average growth rate has been per cent <e> <s> per annum and we have been at the top of the productivity growth league <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be helpful if noble lords opposite were occasionally to recognise a very considerable national achievement when they see one <e>", "<cs> my lords the world recession brought on by the second oil crisis caused major shocks to a manufacturing industry already suffering from poor competitiveness following years of high inflation and low productivity <e> <s> the result was a steep fall in output but manufacturing industry is now leaner fitter more competitive and better adapted to meet the demands of a modern economy

competitive world and to expand in both home and overseas markets <e> <s> it is only in a soundly based high productivity economy that secure jobs can be created <e> <s> as regards the figures that the noble lord gives me i can only say that over the past four years the performance of this country has been quite remarkable <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the past four years have been

productivity growth our industry would be much less competitive and unemployment would have been much greater <e>", "<cs> no my lords but if the noble lord would like to put down a question i should be happy to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords manufacturing sector productivity has grown at an average annual rate of over per cent <e> <s> since <e> <s> that is as i have said faster than any other major industrialised nation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very interested to hear the noble lords figures but i am not in a position to comment upon them <e> <s> i do not think that he would expect me to

during pleasure until eight oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords i had indeed assumed that this was a probing amendment to follow up the questions raised in committee by the noble lord lord williams about companies financed by wholesale moneys <e> <s> as he said i wrote to him about the subject and a copy of my letter has been placed in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams for tabling this amendment and i think i may be able to be of some help to him <e> <s> the noble lord says that this may not be the definitive amendment that he would like to see so perhaps i may make one or two points and see whether we can make progress <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may come back on that point <e> <s> regarding the noble lords point about foreign currency transactions i understand that it has not been necessary for example to make an exemption for dollar securities under the act because deposits are not accepted in the united kingdom <e> <s> this is not seen as a risk to depositors only professionals lend in the currency markets <e> <s> if attempts were made to solicit deposits from small depositors in currency by united kingdom borrowers the power to control or even ban advertising for such deposits would apply <e>", "<cs> my lords i wrote to the noble lord lord williams on this subject and i confirm to him that it would not be an unsolicited call if a bank manager approached by a customer to discuss a subject broadened the scope of the conversation to embrace other financial topics <e> <s> since the definition of a cold call is the same in the financial services act the situation would be the same under that act <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord if his exact point was not answered <e> <s> i should like to look into this more carefully and write to him on the subject <e> <s> the noble lord can then perhaps decide what to do at the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for explaining his amendment <e> <s> in my letter i reassured the noble lord lord williams that there is no risk of immaterial actions being subject to prosecution <e> <s> this is partly of course because the prosecuting authorities would not bring such prosecutions <e> <s> but it is also the case that the element of materiality will come into the second part of the test namely whether the person making the statement has done so for the purpose of inducing another person to make a deposit or whether the person making the statement is reckless as to whether this might be the effect <e> <s> a wholly immaterial statement is unlikely to satisfy a court that this part of the test has been met <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord elton in moving this amendment seeks certain assurances from me <e> <s> he was good enough to write to <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can help my noble friend lord elton <e> <s> the agency i was referring to is the securities and

move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to answer detailed points put to me by noble lords in this debate when i come to wind up our discussions today <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a full and careful debate on this bill this evening <e> <s> i have listened closely to all that your lordships have said <e> <s> many interesting and valuable points have been made and i shall hope to respond to as many as possible <e> <s> but fundamentally i believe that none has undermined the clear argument i put to your lordships earlier the bill is needed to maintain immigration control arrangements already approved by this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the safeguards to which the noble lord refers have been satisfactory <e> <s> there appears to be operating at the moment when we consider the case of the tamils who arrived at london airport <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it might be better if i return to that point in one moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is always dangerous to take a specific example to make a broader point <e> <s> the problem of the tamils at heathrow airport is still going on while their cases are being reviewed <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it we are debating tonight on the second reading a bill that relates to the charges on carriers <e> <s> we are not having a general debate on the system for dealing with refugees <e>", "<cs> my lords i really think that the noble lord lord avebury would not expect me to comment in detail on these individual cases tonight <e> <s> these arrangements have nothing to do with this bill but in wishing to be as helpful as possible i have answered perhaps in part the noble lords point by giving him the arrangements that are currently in force <e> <s> i can assure your lordships that the visa application system already caters for asylum-seekers and that asylum applications at our posts abroad are referred to the refugee section of the home office <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the home secretary is still studying the judgment which relates only to prisoners serving discretionary life sentences and not to all life sentence prisoners and will announce the governments response in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i am aware that the joint committee used to undertake this work but i think the courts criticisms were confined to the applications of certain aspects of the policy for dealing with the cases of life sentence prisoners announced in <e> <s> the court upheld the lawfulness of that policy <e>", "<cs> my

resources are the responsibility of the commissioner not the government <e> <s> my right honourable friend has endorsed the commissioners strategy for with its continued emphasis on crime prevention and crimes which cause particular public concern such as robbery and burglary <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will know this government have devoted considerable extra resources to the metropolitan police in order to combat the crime rate <e> <s> but extensive research has not shown any direct link between levels of crime and those of unemployment <e> <s> in the past years recorded

smaller crimes being reported that previously were not <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give my noble friend the exact number but i can say that the home secretary particularly welcomes the continued emphasis that the commissioner has given to crime prevention which includes neighbourhood watch schemes <e> <s> i believe that there are over schemes in operation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure your lordships concur that all right-thinking people will agree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree <e> <s> having said that the government are very concerned about the rise in crime we are devoting considerable resources to deal with it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hunt asks about unemployment and crime and i have answered that question <e> <s> i believe that there is a high risk of crime in inner city areas and the government are tackling this problem <e> <s> they are tackling it through urban renewal and a number of programmes including the urban programme the priority estates project the community programme and the inner cities initiative <e>", "<cs> of course my lords where police resources are needlessly tied up in dealing with these sorts of things then they are not on crime prevention duties <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the assurances from the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> i am sure that all your lordships support the police in doing the very best they can <e> <s> but it is not just a matter of throwing money at the problem it is not just a matter of throwing manpower at the problem <e> <s> it is a matter of careful planning <e> <s> i believe that the commissioner is undertaking a number of initiatives to try to solve the difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already mentioned the neighbourhood watch schemes <e> <s> many of your lordships will know that we have undertaken a programme of civilianisation of roles within the metropolitan police in order to release more officers <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said that there is no direct link <e> <s> we believe that problems in the inner cities have contributed to crime but i am quite sure that the commissioner and his force will continue to do the very best they can both in detecting and in preventing crime <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be quite unreasonable to say that there is any direct link whether people are in work or out of work as to whether they commit crimes <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not disagree with the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my lords of course there are difficulties for magistrates but i cannot believe that there is any excuse for crime

range and diversity of services while at the same time sustaining the public service broadcasting role of the bbc <e> <s> both the bbc and the iba have welcomed the balance which we have proposed to strike <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his question <e> <s> in fact there are no community radio stations existing at the moment in this country <e> <s> in regard to independent local radio we believe that some of the proposals contained in our consultative green paper will help independent local radio companies by raising the profile of radio as an advertising medium and thus perhaps giving the industry a larger slice of the advertising cake <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will know that the consultation period expires on th june this year <e> <s> it will be as soon as possible after that taking into account all the representations that the government will wish to bring forward further proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords the primary source of finance for any new radio stations or more radio stations will be advertising revenues and perhaps other types of revenues such as subscriptions or where local people wish to have a specific service they might well put together some sort of community contribution to a station <e> <s> but we see the opportunities for independent radio becoming greater because the stations will be operating under a lighter and less costly regime <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said we believe that if we can reduce the cost structure for independent local radio the stations will be more viable than possibly they are at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already said the government believe that a new national independent station could well improve the whole industry <e> <s> but it is the governments intention to increase the number of viable radio stations and not to decrease them <e> <s> i give that assurance to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords this is entirely a commercial matter for the boards of the post office and british telecom <e> <s> but i understand that the post office would be prepared to offer british telecoms telemessage service over post office counters <e> <s> it is for

telecom is run by its board not by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams for his explanation of the purpose of the amendment <e> <s> i appreciate the point which the noble lord makes <e> <s> however the existing wording of the bill in this subsection of clause has been carefully chosen to properly reflect the position of the board and its members <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i can confirm that that is the case <e> <s> depending on precisely what the issue is the decision-making procedures within the bank will of course vary <e> <s> an organisation such as the bank of england will develop decision-making procedures such as standard committee arrangements that it follows in these issues <e> <s> clearly senior officers will have key roles as members of the board of banking supervision <e> <s> however it is not the case that those ex-officio members will take every decision alone <e> <s> the amendment would imply that that was the case and we could not accept it for that reason <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the concern expressed by my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne and i believe that i can give him some reassurance on what i think is the essential point of principle <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should affirm to your lordships that this bill is all about the protection of depositors not about the protection of fees for auditors or reporting accountants <e> <s> clause imposes a duty on the directors controllers managers and employees of an authorised institution and on any agent banker auditor or solicitor reporting accountant or significant shareholder of an institution to attend before the inspectors and to produce documents and otherwise assist the investigation <e> <s> the clause as drafted does not however impose the same duty on persons who were formerly directors managers and so on but are no longer such at the time of the investigation <e> <s> it could easily be the case that those involved with a troubled institution no longer hold office but nevertheless have much to contribute to an investigation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that my noble friend lord haddington has made his maiden speech or three maiden speeches tonight on this subject <e> <s> i should like to add my congratulations and say that we look forward

like to disregard the current polls <e> <s> i suspect that he might wish to <e>", "<cs> my lords if there are deficiencies in the sample and telephone polls would only reflect opinion among people who have telephones i do not believe that the reputable press in this country would wish to have anything but an accurate reflection of opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords a biased opinion poll has been brought to my attention which was circulating somewhere in west london two or three weeks back <e> <s> i believe that the responsible elements of the press would not wish to publish such blatantly wrong information <e> <s> i do not believe that they would ultimately sell many newspapers if they continued to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords that is becoming increasingly difficult these days <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had this evening another most interesting debate on the many sided question of how the new transfrontier television services in europe should be regulated <e> <s> i should like first of all to thank my noble friend lord torrington for initiating this debate and for providing us once again along with the other members of his committee with another excellent and comprehensive report on the ec draft directive on broadcasting which is in every respect a useful supplement to the committees earlier report on the green paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the ppi is a rolling three-year programme setting a series of monitoring targets for all the requirements of the regulations <e> <s> the first target date in respect of plans is st october this year <e> <s> all the initial ppi meetings with individual county authorities have been completed satisfactorily <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that any of those so-called nuclear-free authorities are refusing to meet their statutory obligations <e> <s> as i said monitoring the planned programme for implementation will help to ensure that all local authorities fulfil their responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords if some of the policies of noble lords opposite were followed civil defence might be our only defence <e>", "<cs> my lords a report on local authorities preparedness was made available last july <e> <s> a copy is in the library of your lordships house <e> <s> it makes it clear that despite encouraging progress in many areas a great deal remains to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i think that is another main question <e> <s> i shall look into the matter and reply to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords officials have now held meetings with all county-level authorities in england and wales <e> <s> they have discussed their work for the coming year <e> <s> we have been encouraged by their constructive approach <e> <s> we believe that we have laid a more solid foundation for rapid and consistent progress in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i thoroughly agree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the plans are those now being implemented with the local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords much more undoubtedly needs to be done by most local authorities in accepting and training civil defence <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a wide variation <e> <s> one county had over community-based volunteers and counties had none <e> <s> however there was a total nationally of over volunteers and only three counties had no volunteer activity <e> <s> under the pp naturally we are progressing the volunteer question but as i said we are addressing other priorities first <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that pattern has been established <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot of course this morning give exact figures on such matters but i am pleased to hear about the preparations in west sussex in which the noble viscount has been involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord tordoff for explaining the history of this measure <e> <s> the bill as first presented by its sponsors in the other place embraced a much wider range of records including those held by central government local authorities and the private sector <e> <s> it also contained some very complex and detailed provisions on the procedures to be followed in granting access to records <e> <s> at that stage the government made it very clear that they were not opposed to the basic principle behind the bill as to the benefits for an individual in obtaining access to records of personal information held about himself <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft order laid before the house on th may be <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft order laid before the house on th april be approved <e> <s> for brevity i shall call it the no <e> <s> order <e> <s> the joint committee on statutory instruments has considered the order and has approved it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount for explaining his bill to us this evening <e> <s> i shall be brief <e> <s> the bill provides for a considerable strengthening of the legislation protecting the welfare of animals <e> <s> the government wish to ensure that effective penalties are available for all instances of cruelty to captive and domestic animals and we are therefore pleased to support this important bill <e> <s> i know that the bill has support on all sides of your lordships house and i warmly commend it to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for the absence of my noble friend <e> <s> i shall of course pass on to him the comments that have been made by your lordships on that <e> <s> however i can assure the house that i have some passing knowledge myself of the newspaper industry and of its peculiar difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords i really cannot accept what the noble lord says <e> <s> the point is that the case has to be made to your lordships today and that is what i am doing <e> <s> it is not a different case it is exactly the same case <e> <s> that case can only be put correctly in a certain way and that is what i am doing today <e> <s> second-hand or not that is the way i am putting the case <e>", "<cs> my lords the owners of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am putting the case to your lordships house today and it is extremely important for all noble lords that i put the case absolutely clearly <e> <s> i make no apology for not paraphrasing what has been said perhaps before in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already said that my noble friend felt that it would be <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should remind your lordships that this is a time-limited debate and that any noble lord speaking for more than nine minutes is speaking at the expense of noble lords who follow <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to noble lords who have spoken in our short debate on this bill <e> <s> as the noble lord lord williams said the corporation has considerable difficulties but there can be no expectation of a blank cheque <e> <s> british shipbuilders has a new chairman of only two months standing <e> <s> he is reviewing the industry and looking at how all its problems can be tackled <e> <s> he has promised a corporate plan in the autumn which ministers will be considering very carefully indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls asked me the position as regards borrowing by the japanese industry <e> <s> i do not have any figures on that <e> <s> if i can find out any i shall again write to him <e> <s> meanwhile i commend the bill to the house <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i shall look into the matter and write to the noble lord <e> <s> perhaps he would like to have a copy of the letter <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand on this particular order as a result of the investigations that no one can now provide state aid to secure it without the commissions approval <e> <s> so yes we shall do everything we can to pursue the order for this country but it has now attracted the interest of the commission which is looking into it <e>", "<cs> my lords this is entirely a commercial matter for the boards of british telecom and the post office <e> <s> i understand that british telecom has considered the matter carefully and has reached the view that such an arrangement would not be commercially viable <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that in the past i have told my noble friend that this service is available from coin boxes to people who do not possess a telephone <e> <s> admittedly it may not be very convenient but it is certainly a good deal more convenient now that call boxes have been introduced which take higher denomination coins <e>", "<cs> my lords i would say that the bt service is a good service <e> <s> indeed if the noble lord feels otherwise he has every opportunity to complain to bt and if he is not satisfied to go to the director-general of oftel which was specifically set up to safeguard the customer <e>", "<cs> my lords of course they are commercial ones taken by privatised companies run by a board of directors not by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the director-general of oftel has stated publicly that on the whole he is satisfied with the service that is being given by british telecom <e>", "<cs> my lords the chairmen of both organisations the post office and bt do from time to time hold discussions and no doubt this has been discussed between them <e>", "<cs> my lords british telecoms duty was set out in the act when it was privatised and i believe that it is operating its business on those lines <e>", "<cs> my lords the government were satisfied with the legislation at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not saying that there is no government interest in this matter <e>", "<cs> i am not saying that the government have no interest in seeing that messages can or cannot be sent <e> <s> but i have to say that the government are satisfied that life and death messages can be sent <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> of course i am prepared to undertake to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the post office the role of the government is confined to broad issues of general policy and to matters of overall financial control <e> <s> the day-to-day commercial operations of the post office are the responsibility of the post office board <e>", "<cs> yes of course my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the overall cost of having a telephone provided by bt has fallen on the rpi basis <e> <s> as regards the cost of sending a telemessage i do not have any figures <e> <s> it may well be that small post offices sub-post offices would welcome some of the income alluded to by my noble friend <e> <s> however the equipment required to send those messages could well make them entirely uneconomic <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the overall cost of telephone calls in this country has declined by about per cent <e> <s> over the last three years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams for asking that question <e> <s> the answer is that some of the beds currently in use could be a danger to children <e> <s> the department issued a press release on th october urging parents who had already purchased bunk beds to check the gaps <e> <s> they were advised to contact their supplier if they had any doubts about the safety of their beds <e> <s> manufacturers have produced modification kits for existing bunk beds to reduce the size of gaps in guard rails which is a major area of concern <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the point raised by the noble lord lord taylor in respect of a publicity campaign all parents should be careful about the use of beds of this nature whether it be in the home or wherever <e> <s> the department issued a press notice and i hope that all people using bunk beds will take careful note of the potential dangers which can be experienced <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> the telecommunications act established the office of the director-general of telecommunications <e> <s> among his duties he has to exercise his functions in the way best calculated to promote the interests of the consumers <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly there are problems to be tackled and british telecom sees that as a high priority <e> <s> however we should not overlook the scale of bts operations <e> <s> there are million customers and complex switching operations <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord knows british telecom operates under a licence which contains detailed conditions on service <e> <s> the director-general of telecommunications is responsible for monitoring and enforcing that licence <e> <s> the choice of chairman is a matter for the company not the government <e> <s> the government welcome mr vallances commitment to tackle the problems with vigour and to improve the companys services for its customers <e>", "<cs> i seem to remember my lords that before the privatisation of british telecom it was rare to receive any reply to complaints <e>", "<cs> my lords the competitiveness comes from an organisation called mercury which is increasingly making an impact by offering customers the possibility of choice <e> <s> its services are at present predominantly for business customers but trials have started on residential services <e>", "<cs> my lords i join my noble friend in that tribute <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that the director-general has sufficient powers to enforce the rigorous provisions of british telecoms licence and to amend these conditions either by agreement or by reference to the mmc <e> <s> british telecom and other operators are well aware of oftels powers <e> <s> i should add that the director-general has not suggested that he needs further powers <e>", "<cs> my lords the activities of the national economic council nedc continue essentially unchanged though meetings are now held on a quarterly rather than a monthly basis <e> <s> the shift of emphasis to discussing the improved supply performance of the economy is expected to continue <e> <s> detailed work will be carried out in the sector groups and working parties which the government will continue to fund from st april <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is demonstrated by the governments continuing view that tripartite discussions can have a beneficial effect <e> <s> the nedc meetings can serve a useful purpose <e> <s> four meetings per annum are surely enough to serve that purpose <e> <s> i am pleased that the cbi and the tuc have pledged to make the new arrangements effective <e> <s> a sensible streamlining has taken place which has been welcomed by a number of nedc members <e>", "<cs> my lords the good will that exists within the nedc will continue as it did in the october quarterly meeting under my noble friend the secretary of state for trade and industrys chairmanship <e> <s> the cbi the tuc and others have pledged to make these new arrangements effective <e>", "<cs> my lords that goes a little wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> however i believe that the nedcs most important contribution has always been at the sectoral level <e> <s> the record was uneven among the sectors <e> <s> the present pattern had become rather too rigid <e> <s> the government therefore selected committees that justified continued public funding from st april <e> <s> in doing so the government took account of past track records recent performance and whether <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in looking at which committees should continue we took account of whether solid work remained to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords we are trying to get the nedc to contribute more by moving away from discussing macro-economic matters to supply side issues <e>", "<cs> my lords the report of the select committee to which the noble lord refers has largely been discredited by events since then <e>", "<cs> my lords most of the valuable work done by the nedc has been done in those sectoral committees <e> <s> the most valid ones are to continue and no doubt the quarterly meetings will look at these very valuable reports <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be so but i think that events since then have shown otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend the secretary of state for trade and industry took the view that this acquisition did not raise competition issues or other issues of public interest such as to warrant a reference <e> <s> his decision was in accordance with the advice of the director general of fair trading <e>", "<cs> my lords the governor of the bank of england in referring to the core was i believe referring to the very large clearing banks that we have in this country <e> <s> i think that on scale alone the takeover of the clydesdale and northern banks could not be described as a very large transfer of assets <e>", "<cs> my lords that is rather wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> i do not wish to comment on other individual situations <e> <s> as regards the regional aspect my noble friend the secretary of state takes into account all relevant considerations and not just regional ones <e> <s> the guiding principle should be that the government intervene in merger cases only where there is likely to be a divergence of interest between the decision-makers in the market and the public interest <e>", "<cs> my lords in deciding not to refer this proposal my noble friend the secretary of state made it clear that the decision related only to the circumstances of the particular case and should not be interpreted as necessarily indicating his likely attitude to any further proposed acquisition of a clearing bank by a foreign company <e> <s> any such case will be considered on its own merits <e>", "<cs> my lords that is of course a matter for the noble lord <e> <s> i shall be pleased to answer any question he might put down <e>", "<cs> my lords i was talking about regional policy <e> <s> i was not referring to scotland specifically as a region <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should clarify that i actually referred to a particular part of the united kingdom rather than just a region <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house be now adjourned during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords officials both in the uk and overseas provide information and advice on the market to business visitors to south africa whether they travel to the market as individuals or as members of a trade mission <e> <s> south africa remains an important market for our exporters <e> <s> such assistance is available to members of the united kingdom-south africa trade association and is not contrary to any of our undertakings on south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that a pre-departure briefing has already been given by officials <e> <s> our commercial offices in south africa will provide the usual range of briefing and assistance available in all posts overseas <e> <s> we observe our international undertakings on trade with south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said we continue to stick by the undertakings given but we continue to believe that civil trade with all countries including south africa should be determined by commercial considerations and not by the character of the government of those countries <e> <s> in line with the undertakings agreed in nassau we do not provide the funding for this visit to south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we and no one more than my right honourable and learned friend keep this matter under constant review <e> <s> but we believe that sanctions have been counterproductive and that united kingdom companies are a positive force for good in south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords that can only be a matter of opinion <e> <s> i have stated the governments view <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords that is of course a very important body of opinion <e> <s> but we believe that the best interests of south africa are served by our continuing to trade and as i said we believe that many uk companies are a positive force for good in south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully acknowledge what the noble lord says <e>", "<cs> my lords how the noble lord interprets the spirit of the nassau agreement is a matter for him but we abide by that agreement <e>", "<cs> i think this would be a convenient moment to take the statement <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord young of graffham i beg to introduce a bill to restate the law of copyright with amendments to make fresh provision as to the rights of performers and others in performances to confer a design right on original designs to amend the registered designs act to make provision with respect to patent agents and trade mark agents to confer patents and designs jurisdiction on certain <e>", "<cs> my lords these directives were made under article g of the ec treaty and as such were subject to the majority voting procedures of that treaty <e> <s> since in this country we had had relatively few mergers of the kind covered by these regulations and no divisions involving plcs it was not possible to argue during the negotiations on either directive with any credibility that any vital national interests were at stake in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords again i think that i had better look at that because i suspect that that form of instrument starts off as one thing and becomes another on conversion <e> <s> again i think i should look at that and come back to the noble lord in writing <e>", "<cs> perhaps this would be a convenient moment to make the statement <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that the consumer affairs council scheduled for th november has been postponed and that a new date has not yet been fixed <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the two items mentioned by the noble baroness were to have been on the agenda <e> <s> the government believe it is important that a full-day consumer affairs council meeting should take place at least once during a presidency <e> <s> we hope that the present presidency will be able to arrange a meeting of the council before the end of the year <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness will know there are procedures for consultation but the government accept that the present consultation arrangements are not satisfactory <e> <s> the council resolution adopted last year underlined the necessity for effective and duly representative consultations with consumers <e> <s> although the government have no standing to intervene directly in an area which is the commissions own responsibility they want to see a credible package of improvements emerging in line with the resolution when the commission reports on the matter at the end of this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i can inform the noble baroness that my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state for corporate and consumer affairs hopes to raise the matter with commissioner varfis next week on th november <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems a long time but i cannot remember precisely how long <e> <s> i shall look into the matter and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords under the terms of the treaty of rome the system of own resources cannot be changed without the approval of the british parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not entirely clear about what is meant by the noble lords phrase creative accounting in that context <e> <s> there is a very carefully set out and complicated formula for calculating the contributions to the community budget <e> <s> in answer to the noble lords first question i think i should further confirm that under the treaty of rome the own resources system which is defined in a council decision can only be changed following both unanimous agreement by the council and subsequent adoption by member states according to their own constitutional requirements <e> <s> in this country that means approval by parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords that would be a matter for the usual channels at that time <e> <s> however i have good news for the noble lord in that a debate in your lordships house on the report on financing the community produced by your lordships select committee on the european communities will take place on monday th november <e> <s> he is no doubt aware of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord bethell for raising this matter and for giving me the opportunity to hear the range of opinions which have been expressed this evening about aspects of this governments policy both towards mergers and towards the airline industry <e> <s> the noble lord lord bethell has made clear his concerns about the dominance which a merged british airways and british caledonian could have in the market for european scheduled airline services <e> <s> i have noted with interest all the points which have been made by noble lords this evening and will draw them to the attention of my noble friend lord young of graffham and where appropriate my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport <e>", "<cs> my lords when the report of the select committee chaired by my noble friend lord aldington was first debated in this house my noble friend lord young of graffham acknowledged both the importance of the subject and the contribution which the select committee had made to the discussion <e> <s> both have been amply confirmed by what we have heard tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords to have read all these reports for this debate would have been perhaps a little time-consuming but now that the noble lord brings it up i shall of course look at mr byatts report with some interest <e>", "<cs> my lords we are at present revising the code of practice in consultation with the main interested parties including the concordat <e> <s> as soon as these informal consultations have been completed the public consultation required by the act will be held <e>", "<cs> my lords we want to introduce this code as soon as possible <e> <s> we have not yet reached any final decisions on the concordat proposals for the regulations <e> <s> these are still under discussion with the concordat and other interested parties <e> <s> we hope before very much longer to be ready to go out to consultation as required by the consumer protection act <e>", "<cs> my lords when the code of practice is in its final form and goes out to consultation everyone who wishes will be able to comment on it <e> <s> as regards whether it is debatable in this house i am not fully aware whether that is a possibility <e> <s> i shall look into it and come back to the noble baroness on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend would care to put down a question on that subject i should be pleased to answer it <e> <s> however i think that his question is rather wide of the one on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree <e> <s> in fact i find it very difficult to understand many of the abbreviations that are used by my colleagues in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords we are trying to finalise the code of practice and as i said we hope to be ready to go out to consultation before very much longer <e>", "<cs> my lords it is inevitable that a bill of this size and complexity will contain measures or will have omissions which do not completely find favour with every one of your lordships <e> <s> however i am greatly encouraged by the welcoming and constructive tone of the debate this evening <e> <s> i expected no less from your lordships house and this augurs well for our forthcoming deliberations on the details of the bill <e> <s> i know that my noble friend the secretary of state wishes to join me in thanking in particular the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for being so generous with his great experience in this field <e>", "<cs> my lords i have acknowledged that we are not yet fully decided on this matter <e> <s> i am sure that we would want to be as co-operative as we possibly can in this matter in order to try to get it right <e> <s> but we shall be giving careful consideration to all the points raised by your lordships today before bringing forward our amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords chlorofluorocarbons cfcs are relatively non-toxic inert and non-flammable products <e> <s> the electronics industry and the dry-cleaning industry are through their trade associations already taking steps to encourage better housekeeping of the cfc-solvents which are used <e> <s> the measures in the montreal protocol on the production and consumption of cfcs should give added stimulus through the operation of market forces to recycling and the recovery through controlled destruction of these chemicals <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt that conservation of cfcs is to be encouraged <e> <s> the government believe that this will be stimulated by market forces <e> <s> after all nobody deliberately destroys valuable goods that they have bought in the process of their business <e> <s> but cfcs are relatively non-toxic inert and non-flammable <e> <s> they represent no direct safety hazard <e> <s> so normal waste disposal arrangements should suffice <e> <s> the government are fully committed to the montreal protocol which seeks to assist in conserving the ozone layer by prudent limitation of production and use of cfcs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of what every producer of cfcs advises its customers <e> <s> i could not possibly be <e> <s> we believe that market forces should govern sensible use of cfcs <e>", "<cs> my lords it is correct that the montreal protocol allows an increase in the production of cfcs <e> <s> this is to give flexibility for production rationalisation and to provide supplies for developing countries <e> <s> it does not give any increase in consumption to what is commonly known as the group of those are the developed nations <e> <s> as regards aerosols the government believe that the limitation on cfcs in aerosols will lead to an increase in the use of cfcs in other products <e>", "<cs> of course i shall look at the matter again my lords <e> <s> if i can come up with any more information i shall write to the noble baroness to let her know <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be the case but i think it is possibly another question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> he brought up two points <e> <s> i shall take up his point on polarisation first of all <e> <s> at present building societies are empowered under the building societies act to give advice on insurance products but cannot themselves underwrite insurance or offer insurance-linked products <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord finds it acceptable perhaps i may look more carefully into that matter and write to him as soon as possible as i do not have an answer with me on that point <e> <s> perhaps he will find it possible to take that course this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall do that <e> <s> i commend this order to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in general yes <e> <s> the technical and vocational education initiative started in <e> <s> the initiative has been monitored by the manpower services commission and by her majestys inspectorate <e> <s> the positive response from the large number of authorities concerned reflects the wide support the initiative has received <e> <s> the government have announced the progressive extension of the initiative nationally starting from autumn this year <e>", "<cs> my lords tvi will continue to exist in harmony with the national curriculum enhancing the relevance of what is taught within a framework set by the curriculum <e> <s> the lessons of tvi have a valuable contribution to make to the development of the national curriculum particularly in science and technology and the msc is closely in touch with the department of education and science on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to point out to my noble friend that the question relates essentially to the department of employment <e> <s> however as regards the education bill and tvi your lordships will have an opportunity to debate the bill in due course <e> <s> tvi will continue to enhance the relevance of what is taught within the framework of the governments education policies <e>", "<cs> my lords tvi is supposed to be completely non-sexist and non-racist <e> <s> i do not know the answer to the specific point raised by the noble baroness but i shall look into the matter and write to her <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have an answer today as regards a response to the report <e> <s> however i shall look into the matter and write to the noble lord and to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that that is not necessarily the case <e> <s> again i should like to look at the matter more closely and i shall respond to the noble baroness when i have spoken to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> i think this would be a convenient moment to take the statement <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to the director general of telecommunications to consider such issues <e> <s> it is he rather than ministers who has powers under the telecommunications act to propose modifications to british telecoms operating licence where he deems this to be necessary in the light of his duties <e>", "<cs> my lords reviews by successive governments suggest that perhaps a ban on teleselling would be impractical and unnecessary <e> <s> however there are certain safeguards for those who may be telephoned by salesmen and the office of fair trading has issued guidelines which are now being printed in british telecom phone books <e> <s> the guidelines cover such areas as the time of the call and caller identification <e> <s> i understand that those guidelines are adhered to in general <e> <s> any complaints in that area can be referred to the company concerned and to the office of fair trading <e>", "<cs> my lords we are satisfied that the office of fair trading has issued sufficiently strict guidelines <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the government want to see the proper use of british telecom services <e> <s> i shall draw the remarks of my noble friend to the attention of the director general <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble and learned friend <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i think that british telecom is aware of that situation <e> <s> as i said the office of fair trading has issued guidelines <e> <s> if customers are rung up at inconvenient hours they should immediately complain and if that does not remedy the matter they should complain to the office of fair trading <e> <s> people can always put the telephone down and that is probably easier than ending visits by salesmen at the door <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not believe that that is necessary at the moment <e> <s> there is one further safeguard that we hope to see implemented namely the option of a telephone preference scheme whereby customers can opt out which the oft and the british direct marketing association are considering <e> <s> i understand that british telecom is supporting those moves <e>", "<cs> my lords of course that is the case <e> <s> as i have said we hope that the guidelines of the office of fair trading are sufficient but if they are not we shall have to look at the matter again <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not suggested that they should become ex-directory <e> <s> people who are ex-directory would already be excluded from such lists if they were to be sold <e>", "<cs> my lords to a certain extent they have already asked to be included because they are already in the telephone book unless they have asked to be excluded from it <e> <s> therefore they are already on the list that is issued by british telecom to its consumers <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly draw that interesting idea to the attention of british telecom <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to all noble lords who have spoken and to those who have broadly welcomed the bill <e> <s> in response to the noble lord lord williams of elvel i welcome him telling the committee how he intends to treat the bill during the committee stage <e> <s> the government for their part will listen very carefully to what all noble lords have to say <e> <s> i hope that we shall be able to deliver the bill in due course in the very best possible form as a result of that <e>", "<cs> of course it would have been desirable for it to have been available earlier <e> <s> the new schedule that the government have tabled as mentioned by the noble lord lord lloyd and all government amendments to this part of the bill to be discussed this week were also in print by friday <e> <s> however again i would say with all these things the earlier the better <e>", "<cs> everyone concerned in dealing with this bill particularly in my department has worked very long hours and very hard indeed in order to get things out as quickly as possible <e> <s> if inconvenience has been caused because the amendments were not ready in time then i can only apologise today <e>", "<cs> i shall have to look carefully at the <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can help the noble lord on this point <e> <s> as lie will be aware the united kingdom is a signatory to the rome convention for the protection of performers producers of phonograms and broadcasting organisations so we <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord howie is correct <e> <s> the third category of work recognised in the bill is the typographical arrangement of published editions <e> <s> the right of the publisher to protect his investment in the lay-out of the printed page is one that is seldom recognised in foreign laws but is one that we believe to be vital <e> <s> the current provisions are therefore re-enacted in this bill <e> <s> as the noble lord said we shall have an opportunity to debate this matter in some detail at the appropriate time <e>", "<cs> there will no doubt be considerable discussion on that point at the appropriate time <e> <s> a number of views will be expressed by the committee <e> <s> perhaps we could come to the point then <e> <s> i note what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> in reply to the noble lord lord jenkins the subject he mentions will probably be debated at some length at the appropriate time when specific matters such as music scores of films come up <e> <s> on the point raised by the noble lord lord williams i shall look at what he said <e> <s> i shall respond in writing to him on this point <e>", "<cs> i shall include the noble lord on my mailing list and i shall place copies in the library so that all noble lords will have access to the correspondence <e>", "<cs> i have to say that we believe these amendments to be unnecessary <e> <s> the copyright owner has the exclusive right to do certain acts by clauses and <e> <s> clause then provides that copyright is infringed by any person who does any of those acts without the licence of the copyright owner or authorises another person to do them <e> <s> thus the result desired by the noble earl lord stockton is already provided in the bill <e>", "<cs> that is not necessarily true but on the other hand i am sensitive to the views of the committee <e> <s> if my noble friend would like to withdraw the amendment at this stage i shall without commitment look at what all members of the committee have said on the amendment <e>", "<cs> if i said a few words about clause at this time it might be helpful to the committee <e> <s> clause acts as a signpost to later provisions in part i which set out the rights attaching to copyright works <e> <s> the copyright owner has the exclusive right to do certain acts which are specified in chapter ii <e> <s> it is by exercise of those rights that a copyright owner can get an economic benefit from the exploitation of his works and we shall be discussing those when we reach clause <e> <s> the author of certain descriptions of copyright work has the moral rights as set out in chapter iv <e> <s> these include the right to be identified as author and not to have his work subjected to unjustified modification <e> <s> provisions for these moral rights under the copyright act and the common law of contract passing off and defamation are not sufficient to meet the requirements of the latest paris text of the berne copyright convention which we intend to ratify <e> <s> chapter iv introduces statutory moral rights in a manner which complies with the berne requirements and discussion of the details is best left until then <e>", "<cs> the purpose of my noble friends amendment was not entirely clear to us <e> <s> no work literary or otherwise can exist until it is created <e> <s> that is surely self-evident <e> <s> if my noble friend lord stockton wishes to ensure that works can be regarded as such before they are written down and recorded such as an impromptu speech i can assure him that this is the case <e> <s> however i should point out that copyright will subsist only in such a work when it is recorded in some way as provided for in clause <e>", "<cs> i am sure that we can find all sorts of literary connotations <e> <s> my noble friend asked me whether when something is written down that is an act of recording it <e> <s> i have said that copyright will subsist in such a work only when it is recorded in some way which of course includes writing it down <e>", "<cs> the concern of the noble lord lord williams appears to be one of ensuring that the lyrics of a song are protected in the same way as other literary works <e> <s> i believe that the clause as drafted achieves that result without the amendment <e> <s> if as is probably the case the words of a song are written down before it is sung there is no difficulty <e> <s> under those circumstances it is a written literary work <e> <s> difficulties may arise however when a work is not written down before delivery for example a speech or an impromptu song <e> <s> we have covered these by the addition of the words spoken or sung although members of the committee will note that under subsection copyright does not subsist in such works until they are recorded in some way either by being written down or perhaps more commonly today by use of a tape recorder <e>", "<cs> i can probably be helpful to the committee <e> <s> the noble lords amendment is purely a matter of drafting as he said <e> <s> i can sympathise with the view that the use of which twice in rapid succession is a little clumsy <e> <s> however i am not convinced that but is the right word <e> <s> if the noble lord will withdraw his amendment we shall look at the drafting <e> <s> should a change be desirable we shall see what we can come up with <e>", "<cs> no we shall look at it <e>", "<cs> i am not sure <e> <s> we shall look at that as well <e>", "<cs> the effect would simply be to remove the specific reference to tables and compilations being literary works in which copyright can subsist <e> <s> it would not necessarily result in tables and compilations ceasing to qualify for copyright protection because such works could very well still qualify as literary works in any event <e> <s> i should point out that the bill as drafted is exactly the same as the act which expressly includes written tables and compilations in the meaning of literary work <e> <s> this must be right <e>", "<cs> we are happy to accept this amendment since it removes a superfluous word with an unintended limiting effect <e>", "<cs> subsection sets out the requirement that for copyright to subsist in a literary dramatic or musical work it must be recorded in some way <e> <s> usually this will be in writing such as the script of a play or the manuscript of a novel <e> <s> but increasingly other ways are used <e> <s> for example an author may dictate a work on to tape a composer may record one of his works without ever writing it down <e>", "<cs> this is a purely linguistic point <e> <s> while i cannot say that the noble lords amendment is wrong it does seem to me that the conjunction used here should be making a contrast rather than an addition <e> <s> the first half of the subsection concerns cases where copyright does not arise and the second half cases where it does <e> <s> in these circumstances i think but is the right word and i therefore oppose the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to answer some of the specific points made by the committee <e> <s> the noble lord lord kilbracken said that there was no definition of dramatic work and asked whether an original screenplay was a dramatic work <e> <s> yes it is <e> <s> i should not have thought that there was any doubt about that <e> <s> in preparing this bill it did not seem necessary to have the complication of the definition as in the act <e>", "<cs> for the convenience of the committee i shall speak also to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i do not know whether such a course fits in with the plans of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran but i should like to speak to both amendments if that is agreeable to him <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would remove words which were introduced by the copyright act for the purpose of making plain that a work is to be regarded as artistic if it is the product of one of a number of specified processes such as painting drawing or photography irrespective of whether it has artistic merit <e>", "<cs> i should perhaps say to the noble lord that of course i accept that his <e>", "<cs> the noble lord raises a number of important points <e> <s> this amendment would add engineering constructions to the list of works that constitute artistic works <e> <s> i note that the noble lord lord howie does not seek to cover engineering constructions generally but only those that are buildings or structures <e> <s> the act contained a very long definition of what constituted an architectural work and included both buildings and structures <e> <s> the act merely referred to buildings <e>", "<cs> the amendment would expressly include in the definition of artistic works architectural models which do not represent complete buildings <e> <s> we were not aware of any doubts as to whether such models benefit from copyright protection under the existing law to which this subsection restates <e> <s> however we are prepared to accept the amendment in principle as we have no wish to see protection denied in these circumstances <e> <s> we should just like to consider the drafting and any further thoughts we might have on the subject and perhaps come back with our own amendment at the next stage if the noble lord would find that agreeable <e>", "<cs> i apologise for my momentary absence <e> <s> i am most grateful to my noble friend lord long for taking over for a moment <e> <s> the amendments standing in the names of my noble friends lord mottistone and lord stockton would expressly provide that a typeface is an artistic work <e> <s> we are not persuaded that amendments of this nature are necessary or desirable <e> <s> the government did indeed draw attention to the position of typefaces in copyright law in the white paper on intellectual property and innovation and said that we would amend copyright law to provide the necessary protection <e>", "<cs> yes that is the case <e>", "<cs> because the government took the view that it was better to proceed with the wording in the bill as it is now drafted <e>", "<cs> i shall deal first with the point raised by the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e> <s> in preparing the bill it was realised that it was unnecessary to create a separate class of work to achieve the desired result <e> <s> we realised that a mistake had been made here and that therefore we should go back to the wording as printed in the bill <e>", "<cs> as regards the point made by the noble lord lord howie of troon a typeface is not the same as a woodcut <e> <s> woodcuts are concrete if that is possible but a typeface is in the shape of letters figures and the light on the page itself <e> <s> i shall write to the noble lord lord morton of shuna on the point that he made <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord morton of shuna asked me to define what is meant by works of artistic craftsmanship <e> <s> these works comprise a small and imprecisely delimited class of copyright work <e> <s> to qualify for protection a work must involve both artistry and craftsmanship <e> <s> those questions can be answered only by assessment of the particular work <e> <s> this contrasts with the treatment of other artistic works such as drawings or photographs which are defined simply as products of the particular process <e> <s> case law has mainly served to deny particular works protection under that category <e> <s> examples include an infants cape rods used to teach mathematics and for instance a particular piece of furniture <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale for clarifying that point <e> <s> i agree that case law has mainly served to deny particular works protection under the category in many cases that included a particular piece of furniture <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord lord donaldson <e> <s> i understand that the crafts council was not consulted <e> <s> i shall look into that matter further <e>", "<cs> we were somewhat puzzled as to the content of the noble lords amendment <e> <s> i am grateful to him for raising the matter at this time <e> <s> i should like to look at what he has said and perhaps write to him as soon as possible concerning our opinion <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord brain for putting down this amendment to the noble lords lord lloyd of kilgerran and lord mottistone and also to the noble lord lord morton of shuna for his amendment <e> <s> in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> with the leave of the committee i shall speak also to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> these amendments seek to broaden the scope of the definition of a photograph although they approach the matter in different ways <e>", "<cs> we shall look at that and see whether the design council should be consulted on that matter <e> <s> to respond to my noble friend lord broxbourne there is no definition of print <e> <s> the word was used in the act and has caused no problems <e> <s> it should not be forgotten that a print is protected by copyright only if it is original as provided in clause a and we have already looked at that <e> <s> of course we will consider what my noble friend has said and see whether we can improve the drafting <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can take the noble lords point now <e> <s> there is obviously a very great overlap between the two paragraphs <e> <s> but there are things in paragraph b that are not in paragraph a <e> <s> paragraph a refers to a recording of sounds paragraph b covers all recordings of works from which sounds may be reproduced whether made by recording sounds or not <e> <s> old fashioned piano rolls and modern electronic recordings may both be works made without recording sounds <e> <s> so they must be covered by the definition <e>", "<cs> under the bill as drafted the sound-track for a film qualifies as a sound recording in its own right <e> <s> this approach is different of course from that in the act under which it was treated as part of the film <e> <s> we have carefully picked up the few points in the bill at which the sound-track needs special treatment for example in clause <e>", "<cs> i shall have to agree with my noble and learned friend and with the noble lords lord lloyd of kilgerran and lord hutchinson <e> <s> i recall that on second reading the noble lord lord kilbracken expressed some surprise at finding the expression moving picture in a bill intended to meet the demands of the present day and into the next century <e> <s> the government would be only too pleased to accommodate the noble lord or any others who feel that way if an alternative definition could be found but i am afraid that the alternative proposed in the amendment cannot be accepted <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord williams is talking about a long-playing record that is made up of previously recorded material into one compilation album <e> <s> am i right in assuming that <e>", "<cs> a compilation may have a copyright of its own if it is a fresh recording <e> <s> that would of course not extend the copyright in the individual items themselves <e>", "<cs> i believe that i am right when i say that a compilation may have copyright of its own if it is a fresh recording <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> if what i have said is incorrect i shall of course return to the noble lords concerned and let them know <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and in that order <e> <s> on amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble lords lord williams and lord morton the purpose of subsection a is to provide a broad definition to embrace all transmissions which are intended to be generally available <e> <s> broadcast for general reception seems about as wide as you can get and i do not believe that there is anything to be gained by limiting the category to transmissions to a particular class of person even when that class is so large as to constitute all members of the public <e> <s> adding these words seems to imply that there could in theory be an opposite type of transmission namely a transmission broadcast for general reception by persons other than the public <e> <s> that seems to me to be a contradiction in terms <e>", "<cs> as regards amendments nos <e> <s> and i gave as full an answer as i felt i could <e> <s> perhaps i may finish speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and specifically <e> <s> i accept that these amendments are intended only to improve the drafting of clause but i do not believe that they necessarily do so <e> <s> the phrase accessible to is a more passive one than accessible by and carries an implication that only those satellite services should be included that a member of the public could easily obtain without going to any special effort <e> <s> the phrase accessible by is broader in that it more obviously encompasses services which the viewer may receive but only with a certain amount of enterprise and resolution <e> <s> it is fair to say that that is still true of the direct reception of most satellite services <e> <s> as regards the use of the word accessible i shall carefully consider what has been said in the committee this evening to see whether we could not improve on that expression <e>", "<cs> our view is as i set out on the inclusion of the word lawfully <e> <s> i believe that as i said before it would be unwise to admit it <e> <s> of course we shall look at what all noble lords have said this evening <e> <s> if we feel that there is any change to our view we shall come forward at that time <e> <s> in our belief the need for the word lawfully does not relate to change in the law but to the licensing arrangements under the existing law <e> <s> however we shall consider this very carefully <e>", "<cs> subsection defines who is the broadcaster for copyright purposes <e> <s> this is important in relation to authorship and ownership of copyright which will be dealt with in clauses and <e> <s> our intention is that it should be the person by whom a transmission is made if he controls to any extent the contents of the broadcast <e> <s> this is provided by paragraph a <e> <s> it would not be appropriate in all circumstances however for the person making the transmission to be regarded as the person making the broadcast and thus its author <e> <s> british telecom for example provides common carrier services for several broadcasters that is by transmitting services to satellites without being in any way responsible for or necessarily even aware of the contents of the programmes <e> <s> in these circumstances the proper person to be regarded as making the broadcast should clearly be the person controlling the contents and with the common carrier making the arrangements necessary for the transmission <e> <s> this is provided for by paragraph b and it is the situation that both broadcasters and common carriers such as british telecom and mercury have told us they wish to see <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i can <e> <s> the view that we take is that the common carrier such as british telecom may not even be aware of the content of the transmission <e> <s> therefore the responsibility should not rest with the common carrier <e>", "<cs> the noble lords amendment would have the effect of blurring the question of who is the maker of a broadcast and therefore of who is <e>", "<cs> we feel it is arguable that the contents of the transmission are the broadcast as a whole and not its component parts <e> <s> that would lead to the wrong answer to the question of who should be responsible for copyright clearance <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has raised an important matter <e> <s> drafting in this area is a tricky problem <e> <s> we have to be careful that in bringing within the definition of a cable programme service activities which clearly should fall within it we do not incidentally bring in activities which should not <e> <s> examples are ordinary telephone conversations teleshopping telebanking or video conferencing services all of which are communications of an essentially private kind <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord finds it acceptable i should like to look into that a little more carefully as i do not have an answer now <e> <s> i shall write to him on that point <e>", "<cs> i should like to take the point raised by the noble lord lord williams first <e> <s> paragraph a excepts services where it is an essential feature that in addition to material being sent by the provider of the service the person receiving the service can send material back to him other than signals sent for the operation or control of the service in question <e> <s> this is the point that we debated on the amendment moved by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> i think it is better that we consider this further as it is a complicated field <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for bringing this up <e> <s> i accept that he has a considerable practical knowledge of this matter and that there are bound to be technical developments in this field over the years that this act will be in force <e>", "<cs> clause provides definitions relevant to the copyright in a typographical arrangement <e> <s> it is not our intention that this copyright should be more extensive than under the act and we cannot therefore accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> as i said the typographical arrangement is about the layout of words or symbols on the printed page <e> <s> it is therefore restricted to published editions containing literary dramatic or musical works and does not include artistic works <e> <s> but of course a book may include diagrams maps charts and plans as well as photographs although these do not form part of the typographical arrangement <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down there are two points that i should like to make <e> <s> having said that i am not in a position to answer for the australian government but i shall look into the noble lords remarks <e> <s> i do not think that he expects me to comment on the position of copyright in australia which is a matter which could lead us into very deep water indeed <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment would be to provide that the photographer is the author of a photograph <e> <s> as the bill is drafted the question of authorship of photographs is dealt with by the general proposition in subsection of clause <e> <s> in other words the person who creates a photograph is the author just as the person who creates a literary work is the author of that work <e>", "<cs> the point that i am making is that there may be more than one contributor to the creative element of the photograph <e> <s> that would be a matter of discovery of those facts <e> <s> for instance a professional photographer may arrange the layout of the things or people being photographed <e> <s> he may set up the position of the camera and he may arrange the set and the props <e> <s> at the end of all that his assistant may actually press the button <e> <s> are we to say that the professional photographer who employs that assistant does not have any ownership in the copyright <e>", "<cs> as i understand it that would not he the case <e>", "<cs> there is not much more that i can say except to answer the point made by the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead <e> <s> there are cases where a creative contribution may be made by someone who does not operate the camera as i have already said <e> <s> it may be somebody who does not take responsibility for the composition of the photograph <e> <s> creative dark room techniques may be used after an initial exposure and the person applying those techniques may or may not be the same person as the camera operator <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord williams of elvel has explained the amendment deals with the authorship of sound recordings and films <e> <s> its effect so far as sound recordings are concerned would be to provide that someone who commissions and pays for the making of a sound recording should have the copyright <e> <s> it would also leave undefined who is the copyright owner when there is no commission but i am sure that this is an unintended effect <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> as i said in connection with our discussions on clause it is not the governments intention to make any significant changes to the provisions governing copyright in the typographical arrangement <e> <s> we believe that as now the publisher should he the first owner of the copyright <e>", "<cs> the wording of subsection is derived from that in the act <e> <s> it has not caused any difficulties as far as we are aware <e> <s> a person with knowledge of the facts can always identify the author <e>", "<cs> as i have said a person with knowledge of the facts can of course identify the author because he has that knowledge <e> <s> as i also said the test is whether it is possible by reasonable inquiry for someone without previous knowledge of the facts to ascertain and find out who the author is <e> <s> that is why we want the words included <e>", "<cs> i listened carefully to what noble lords said in regard to the amendment <e> <s> the fundamental reason why the work of an employed author belongs to the employer when it is created in the course of employment is that the author has been paid for his work and the employer is therefore entitled to the fruits <e> <s> this is not unusual <e> <s> it is probably the usual way in which employees are paid <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the amendment would entitle an employed author to a share in the fruits <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord but i believe that we have not totally misunderstood the thrust of his amendment <e> <s> if the amendment is intended to have the meaning attributed to it by the noble lord i am afraid that the words do not appear to come out in that way <e> <s> if the employee goes to the copyright tribunal on the words of the amendment it is difficult to believe that he will not obtain an award <e> <s> that is why i have to resist this amendment <e>", "<cs> i have to say that the government are not very sympathetic to the thrust of the noble lords amendment <e> <s> i am prepared to look at everything that has been said this evening <e> <s> i am not able to make a commitment to bring anything back at a later stage but for the convenience of the committee perhaps it might be best if the matter were left on that basis <e>", "<cs> this amendment raises an interesting point which has had us scratching our heads <e> <s> it has a certain superficial attraction but in the short time available to consider it we have been unable to decide whether it is right <e> <s> i should like to come back to it at a later stage <e> <s> that will enable us to consider the existing law on this point what the effect of the amendment would be and whether this would be a good thing or not <e> <s> the bill here is the same as the act <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will be able to agree to that course of action <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i ask him which amendments he is speaking to at the moment because the grouping would indicate that we are discussing amendments nos <e> <s> and together <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i shall speak first to amendments nos <e> <s> and and then to amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble lord lord brain <e> <s> regarding amendments nos <e> <s> and clause restates the existing law in section of the act which was in turn based on provisions of the act <e> <s> we believe this longstanding principle to be the correct one <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is well aware that i am making a comparison with other types of business <e>", "<cs> i should perhaps return to the point of comparing this provision with industry <e> <s> we are not only talking about literature and art written instructions for operating washing machines are copyright works <e> <s> in this context we are therefore talking not only about publishers but about employees and employers throughout industry <e>", "<cs> the provision in clause is based on section of the act and has its roots in the act <e> <s> the committee will understand that the government are reluctant to change such a long-standing provision without fully exploring the implications <e>", "<cs> i was not entirely clear as to the purpose of this amendment <e> <s> its effect would be to extend the rights of newspaper and magazine proprietors over their employees works to include copying for the purpose of storing them in a computer database <e>", "<cs> this is a difficult area <e> <s> section of the act provided that the author was the owner of the copyright in a commissioned literary dramatic musical or artistic work except for photographs painted or drawn portraits and engravings where the copyright was vested in the commissioner <e> <s> these provisions were subject to agreement to the contrary <e>", "<cs> we put considerable reliance on the acquisition of the copyright contractually by assignment <e> <s> the noble lord said that there is not very much between us <e> <s> on balance we feel that we have it right in this instance <e> <s> i believe the balance that we have struck is the right one <e>", "<cs> my lords government policies are creating a business climate that encourages and rewards enterprise <e> <s> we are stimulating increased collaborative research between industry and higher education institutes <e> <s> through collaborative programmes such as alvey joers and link the government are encouraging closer ties between the academic community and industry so as to optimise the commercial exploitation of the uk science base <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have created conditions in which enterprise can flourish <e> <s> we are looking to industry itself to increase its rd effort <e> <s> the government are considering what more could be done to encourage industrial rd particularly in the context of our response to the house of lords select committee report on civil research development <e> <s> but that report rightly recognised that the main responsibility for spending more on rd rests with industry itself <e>", "<cs> yes my lords of course i commend the universities for that initiative but i should say that the government are committing considerable sums of money and resources to this matter <e> <s> up to st march million has been spent by the government on specific programmes and a further million has already been committed <e> <s> that does not include the recently launched link programme which envisages public sector expenditure at approximately million over the next five years <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall bring the remarks of the leader of the opposition to the attention of my noble friend the secretary of state <e> <s> the sums of money that i have mentioned are aimed at stimulating applied collaborative research <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i should like to congratulate the three noble lords who have today made their maiden speeches <e> <s> the noble lord lord richardson of duntisbourne has well-known expertise in the world of banking and finance and i am sure he will contribute greatly to your lordships deliberations in the future <e> <s> i should also like to <e>", "<cs> my lords the danish presidency has announced that it intends to hold a european consumer affairs council on th december <e> <s> the agenda is likely to include the draft toy safety and unit pricing directive consideration of the commissions report on the integration of consumer policy into other areas of community policy and consumer participation in the setting of ec standards <e> <s> the government hope that there will be substantial discussion at that council of the draft toy safety directive <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will know that codes of practice consist of recommendations on good accepted practice <e> <s> in general the use of standards is preferred because they lay down requirements and thereby remove uncertainty <e> <s> the government are committed to a policy of encouraging the harmonisation of standards throughout the community with the aim of removing technical barriers to trade <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend the secretary of state is taking this matter very seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that there is no place for voluntary codes in health and safety legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness raises a very important point and we shall pay it considerable attention <e>", "<cs> my lords we all very much respect the noble baroness for the care and trouble that she takes in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords on the toy safety directive an amended draft proposal was circulated <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perhaps too early to say how far this country might be able

of the child safety campaign may well be raised at the meeting on th december <e>", "<cs> my lords i attempted to answer the noble lord earlier <e> <s> i shall look carefully at what he said and come back to him in writing <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord somers has spoken of the need for an increase in the term of copyright protection from life plus years to life plus years <e> <s> germany has a term of life plus years the same as in the amendment <e> <s> nevertheless countries such as germany are very much in the minority <e> <s> the term specified in the berne convention admittedly as a lower limit has in fact become the accepted international standard <e> <s> moreover the present life plus years term has existed in this country for a very long time now and there has been no evidence that over that period an increase was either necessary or justified <e> <s> the whitford

grateful to the noble lord lord kilbracken for his suggestion <e> <s> however i am not able to accept the amendment at this stage because we shall need carefully to consider the implications before we can agree to make a change <e> <s> nevertheless if the noble lord will withdraw the amendment at this time we shall do exactly that and return to the question at a later stage when we have had a chance to consider his very helpful suggestion <e> <s> i should say for clarity that i am speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> for the convenience of the committee i shall speak also to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> the copyright in a photograph under the bill as under the present act lasts for years although the starting point has changed from publication to the taking of the photograph in order to ensure that unpublished photographs do not enjoy indefinite protection <e> <s> a period of years is consistent with that granted to films and is in excess of that required by the berne convention <e>", "<cs> there can be no doubt that sale or distribution to the public of copies of a work constitutes making the work available <e> <s>

matter of composite works and collages <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to avoid any doubt as to when the -year copyright in unreleased films and sound recordings expires by <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he asked me about films being completed <e> <s> i imagine that there are many films where either the money runs out or the leading star has died and it has not been appropriate to complete the film <e> <s> perhaps in later years it is either completed if it is regarded as being of artistic or historical merit at that time or when a <e>", "<cs> i believe that to be the case <e> <s> there would be a split year at the end of the -year period that is the copyright on the first part of the series would run out one year earlier than the copyright on the second half if it had straddled the year in its original broadcast years earlier <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> each broadcast of a serial is a separate broadcast <e> <s> there may thus be more than one period of copyright in a serial <e> <s> however we shall look carefully at what the noble lord has said and see if that makes sense <e>", "<cs> the subsections mentioned by the noble lord lord kilbracken restate the effect of section and section <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for raising the matter <e> <s> the amendment seeks to double the duration of copyright

doubtless be grateful to the noble lord for his concern for their interests we believe that the -year term presently provided by section of the act is quite adequate <e> <s> a doubling of the term would we believe be inappropriate <e>", "<cs> i attempted to give a rather simple answer and that is what the answer is very simple <e> <s> the provision of copyright for years is in the act and we intend to leave the provisions relating to copyright in typographic arrangements as they are in that act <e> <s> the example given by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale of a poem in the shape of a butterfly would probably be regarded as an artistic work and protected for life plus years <e>", "<cs> i do not have an answer for the noble lord but i shall write to him on that particular point and place a copy in the library <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord williams of elvel for explaining so clearly to the committee the probing nature of his amendment

the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i hope so <e> <s> i cannot give an undertaking but i hope so <e>", "<cs> if i understand the point the amendment seeks to ensure that the copyright in an artistic work is infringed by copying not directly from the work itself but from a first generation copy which is not itself an artistic work and therefore by virtue of clause a is not an infringing copy for example a

points <e> <s> i have to say that the noble lord lord williams is more technically advanced than i am and i shall have to look into the point which he raised which i think is an important one because

lordships by speaking at this stage in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> for the convenience of the committee i shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> i am not prepared this evening to give a firmer commitment than i have <e> <s> i too would obviously in principle like to see matters that are brought up in this place dealt with here <e> <s> we shall have to undertake a considerable

seriously <e> <s> if we were not going to do so i might as well resist the amendments and i would not have to waste the time of the committee by going along the path that i have taken <e>", "<cs> i shall not follow my noble friend lord ferrers down that route <e> <s> i have already said that there are considerable implications to be explored <e> <s> the government were not persuaded by the responses to the white paper that certain adverse consequences could not result <e> <s> the rental right might in some circumstances act against the public interest <e> <s> we must be satisfied that that will not be the case <e> <s> i shall undertake to write by report stage to those pressing for a decision on this matter setting out the progress of our deliberations <e>", "<cs> i have already given the committee my personal view on that <e> <s> i hope that we shall be able to do that <e> <s> i cannot give an undertaking but the noble lord will know that that is my own preferred route <e>", "<cs> i have gone as far as i can go this evening <e>", "<cs> my noble friend will remember that i used the words <e>", "<cs> clauses and are subject to the general principles set out in clause <e> <s> clause provides that the restricted acts relate to both the work as a whole or any substantial part of it <e> <s> we therefore need to read references to work in clauses and as if they also referred to a substantial part of the work <e> <s> clearly any substantial part must be a recognisable part <e> <s> we do not think recognisable should replace substantial since there may be cases where the part is recognisable but not substantial <e> <s> for example to be or not to be is clearly recognisable as part of hamlet but is scarcely a substantial part of the work <e> <s> i would say to the noble lord lord morton of shuna that a song in a musical is a work in its own right <e>", "<cs> clause reiterates the definition of adaptation to be found in the act <e> <s> for a literary or dramatic work it means three things first a translation secondly a dramatisation of a literary work or the conversion of a dramatic work into a non-dramatic work and thirdly a version of the work in which the story or action is conveyed by means of pictures in a form suitable for reproduction in a book newspaper magazine or periodical <e> <s> it is this last form of adaptation that is of concern here <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> may i just repeat to the noble lord lord kilbracken my confirmation that his example is copying and that there is no need for it to come under adaptation <e>", "<cs> we do not think this amendment would result in a workable provision or that it is necessary to deal with the problem envisaged <e> <s> i would point out that the unauthorised copying of a copyright work is a primary infringement under clause and unauthorised possession of an infringing copy in the course of a trade or business knowing it to be such is a secondary infringement <e> <s> those provisions together with the corresponding criminal remedies in chapter vi provide as much protection as we reasonably can against the unauthorised production and possession of infringing copies and such copies have to be produced and possessed by someone before they can be exported <e> <s> so long as the infringing copies remain in the exporters hands the infringement or offence of possession provides all that is needed <e> <s> if they had moved on down the chain of distribution to say a freight handler export could still be prevented if the copies could be located <e>", "<cs> the noble lord mentioned amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i do not have that amendment in my grouping <e>", "<cs> it is undoubtedly true that in this day and age copyright works can be brought into the united kingdom in non-physical forms either in a broadcast or through a cable system <e> <s> it is argued that the secondary infringement of importation needs to embrace importation in such non-physical forms <e> <s> similar arguments are applied with respect to distribution within the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> in amendment no <e> <s> we are considering what the test of guilty knowledge should be <e> <s> under the present act it is necessary for the plaintiff to establish that the defendant knew that he was dealing with infringing copies in civil proceedings in respect of the secondary infringements of sale letting for hire and importation <e>", "<cs> there seems to be an absolutely direct difference of opinion as to whether the amendment would strengthen or weaken the clause <e> <s> in the circumstances i should like to see what has been said and then consider whether in our opinion we have got it wrong or have got it right <e>", "<cs> i accepted that the noble lord had a view that was absolutely contrary to my own view and i think that it would be reasonable for us to look at it very carefully <e>", "<cs> i always look with great sympathy at everything the noble lord has said and i shall look at this with great sympathy <e>", "<cs> the committee will recall that recent legislation which has proved very effective in reducing the levels of record video and software piracy created the new offence of possession in the course of a trade or business <e> <s> as promised in the white paper this is to be extended in clause to all areas of copyright <e> <s> a civil remedy is provided here again as promised <e>", "<cs> in regard to the expression for use in his business in the case of a computer program he may well use it in his business for the purposes of doing his accounts but that would not cover him in circumstances where he was trading in illicit copies of the computer program <e>", "<cs> it is certainly not the intention of the government that the professions should be treated more favourably when it comes to matters of copyright infringement <e> <s> we believe the present wording will catch the professional and the businessman alike any professional practice carried on for reward is a business <e> <s> we are prepared to look at this again and to make sure this is the case <e> <s> if it is not we shall introduce appropriate amendments <e>", "<cs> of course we shall look at it again <e> <s> we intend to look at the three amendments under discussion and see whether we can ensure that what the noble lord lord morton of shuna has described is covered <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord has a point here and i am grateful to him for bringing it up <e> <s> however i think the amendment goes too far <e> <s> custody or control is a very wide expression-so wide indeed that a person who was merely looking after an ordinary prerecorded audio cassette for a friend whom he knew was going to copy the cassette would be liable for copyright infringement <e> <s> the correct expression is i think possession <e>", "<cs> in speaking to the amendment which has just been moved i shall also speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> those amendments concern provisions in the bill dealing with articles for making copies of a work <e> <s> the clause principally concerns infringement by making recordings on a commercial scale <e> <s> it is intended to deal with pirates <e> <s> as drafted the clause bites only on articles which are specific to a particular work <e> <s> an example would be a mould <e> <s> in our view that must be right <e> <s> indeed the point was made at second reading by the noble earl lord winchilsea who expressed astonishment that the generality of machines typewriters photocopiers and so forth which are merely capable of copying should be considered an infringing article <e> <s> i was able to reassure the noble earl that that was not what was intended <e> <s> how could that be so <e> <s> it would mean that every moulding machine and every photocopier was potentially an infringing article <e> <s> even when a person has an article specific to a work and is engaged in infringement why should all his machinery be caught when much of it could be used for entirely innocent purposes <e> <s> that would be the effect of the amendments and it is something which i should not wish to accept <e>", "<cs> the hardware which is specifically used for infringing copyright is covered <e> <s> i will look at the remarks made by the noble lord about the drafting of this clause <e> <s> if we feel that it can be improved we will of course come forward with it at the appropriate time <e>", "<cs> we have already considered the phrase reason to believe <e> <s> the reason to believe formulation is used throughout the bill and we would be reluctant to change it in this one clause clause without good reason <e>", "<cs> this clause restates the existing law in section of the act and the principle goes right back to the act <e> <s> the test in subsection a is that common to the other cases of secondary infringement but the provision in b is very different <e> <s> provided he charges no more than a nominal amout a person may knowingly allow a place of public entertainment to be used for an infringing performance without fear of infringement <e> <s> this seems wrong <e>", "<cs> i asked should or be replaced by and <e> <s> if that is what the noble lord said he heard me correctly <e>", "<cs> i think that i had better repeat what i said for the benefit of the committee <e> <s> the question is should the remedy be the deletion of sub-paragraph b as has been suggested or should those who are in the business of operating places of public entertainment be strictly liable in other words should or be replaced by and <e> <s> i said that we are inclined to the view that there is a point in this amendment but that we should reflect upon it further before coming to a final view <e>", "<cs> this new clause appears motivated by the worthy concern to ensure that the suppliers of equipment or of various services are not liable for secondary infringement because the equipment or service in question is used in some way in an infringement of copyright <e> <s> we agree that this should in general be so <e>", "<cs> i agree that the noble lord lord morton has a point here <e> <s> this amendment is concerned with the question of the test to be applied in deciding whether an imported article is an infringing copy <e> <s> it provides that the test should be whether the making of an article in the united kingdom by the importer of the article would have infringed copyright or breached an exclusive licence <e>", "<cs> first i should say to my noble friends lord mottistone and lord stockton that we are not aware that the european commission intends to propose harmonisation of copyright law in the early part of next year <e> <s> the commission has been considering the matter for many years and it is not at all clear that it will make proposals relevant to the point under discussion here <e> <s> the amendments would remove all reference to community law in the context of the importation of works into the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord williams said earlier that we are anticipating future community law <e> <s> this is not the case <e> <s> article of the treaty has direct effect now and there is no point in pretending that it does not <e> <s> this has nothing to do with future harmonisation <e> <s> omitting subsection will not make any difference whatsoever to the effect of community law in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> i am not prepared to go that far but i am prepared to say that i will of course read very carefully all that noble lords have said this evening on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords there are no plans at present to implement section of the weights and measures act which was formerly section of the act <e> <s> however the department of trade and industry will shortly be issuing revised regulations for beer glasses and at the same time the brewers society is to publish guidelines on good dispensing practice <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been a number of trading standards surveys <e> <s> these surveys assume that the froth is not part of the drink whereas in many parts of the country the custom is that it is part of the drink <e> <s> this is fully recognised by the enforcement authorities in applying the law in their areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i would rather stick to beer today <e>", "<cs> i do not think so my lords <e>", "<cs> i would not know my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer the noble lords precise question but i shall look into it and let him know <e>", "<cs> my lords the expression good dispensing practice is set out in the guidelines issued by the brewers society <e> <s> they are an initiative by the trade to promote the use of glasses that will more readily accommodate local preferences for the way in which beer is served <e> <s> in particular the guidelines advise bar staff on the best use of the various kinds of glasses suitable for dispensing beer <e>", "<cs> i agree my lords <e>", "<cs> i would not agree my lords <e> <s> because of the way that beer duty is charged there is <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> clause provides an introduction to the various exceptions to copyright set out in chapter iii <e> <s> the deletion of subsections to would remove helpful general provisions on construction and interpretation <e> <s> subsection provides that where an act is permitted by any of clauses to and the clause does not specifically limit the provision to particular descriptions of works then the provision applies to all descriptions <e>", "<cs> we have had very little time to look at this amendment but its purpose seems clear enough <e> <s> it is intended to provide express recognition by statute that in the ultimate the public interest overrides copyright <e>", "<cs> i should agree with the noble lord <e> <s> in this speech i am dealing with this amendment but i am not engaged in any transaction <e> <s> the expression fair dealing has a long history in coyright law <e> <s> on more than one occasion it has been suggested that fair dealing should be defined in statute so as to make its meaning more widely understood <e> <s> for example there have been suggestions that legislation should lay down the proportion of a work which may be copied free of copyright restraints <e> <s> however the government are satisfied that no general formula along these lines could be devised which would be appropriate in all cases <e> <s> unfairness either to copyright owners or to users would inevitably result <e> <s> the alternative would be to frame a statutory definition in generalities but as we said in the white paper we do not see any advantage in this <e>", "<cs> the gist of my argument was that we should continue with the terminology as we have it in the bill <e> <s> i do not see that making any change whatsoever would be helpful <e> <s> the american wording would itself require interpretation in the courts and since only very general guidance as to its meaning is provided in the american statute it is surely better that united kingdom courts should operate on the basis of the consideration which they have already given to the words fair dealing <e>", "<cs> fair dealing under the act is permitted for private study and research criticism and review and for reporting current events <e> <s> all these <e>", "<cs> with the leave of your lordships committee in responding to the amendment i shall speak also to amendments nos <e> <s> and the two amendments put down by my noble friend lord mottistone amendments nos <e> <s> za and a <e>", "<cs> i believe that i am right in saying i shall let the noble lord know if i am not that we are talking about the primary purpose of his research <e> <s> in that instance the primary purpose would obviously be for his academic endeavours <e> <s> if that purpose were later to change i do not believe that that would have any bearing on his primary purpose at the time <e>", "<cs> it is if his primary purpose is of an academic nature <e> <s> for it to be so he must presumably believe that it is so <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i had thought that perhaps three interruptions on the trot were enough <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has made an important point <e> <s> i shall reply to her and to the noble and learned lord lord simon at the same time <e> <s> the question of primary purpose relates to the intention of the person making the copy at the time that he made the copy <e> <s> his subsequent purposes do not affect the matter <e> <s> therefore if ultimately the use of the research was for commercial purposes it would not affect the matter at that time so long as the research had been made originally for private research purposes <e>", "<cs> for the benefit of my noble friend i shall repeat what i said <e> <s> i said that we shall certainly explore this further with a view to introducing our own amendment at a later stage <e> <s> given that assurance i hope the noble lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i said that the government will give careful consideration to the proposal that copying by libraries for the purposes of commercial research should be free to the extent that no licensing scheme covering the works in question has been established <e>", "<cs> i will say it again <e> <s> the government will now give careful consideration to the proposal that copying by libraries for the purposes of commercial research should be free to the extent that no licensing scheme covering the works in question has been established <e> <s> is that of help to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord stockton <e> <s> i would not want to consider the detailed wording of his amendment today but i am happy to look carefully at the point he is making <e>", "<cs> yes of course we shall look at that point <e> <s> i think it is a very important one <e>", "<cs> first i say to my noble and learned friend lord hailsham that he may just have slightly misread the amendment <e> <s> it is concerned with copying of the abstracts themselves not the articles from which they are abstracted <e>", "<cs> before the noble viscount sits down i should like to say that tacit acceptance given now will not necessarily continue in the future as commercial practices change <e> <s> abstracting services have changed their nature and past consents may well relate to former practices where the abstracting service provided much or all of the wording of the abstract <e>", "<cs> of course i shall look carefully at everything that has been said by all members of the committee <e> <s> i cannot make any commitment as to whether we shall be able to change our view but i hope that what i have said will enable my noble friends to withdraw their amendment <e>", "<cs> this amendment would remove the possibility of dealing fairly with a photograph for the purposes of reporting current events <e> <s> all other <e>", "<cs> first of all i think i should say to the noble lord lord kilbracken something about the example that he gave of a case in which a photograph taken by him some time previously was published six months or perhaps a year or five years later <e> <s> the noble lords rights as the photographer would of course already exist and he would already be protected under this exemption <e> <s> the newspaper magazine or other publication would not be able simply to over-ride his rights as the photographer of that picture <e>", "<cs> i shall let the noble lord know if i am wrong but as i understand it if the photograph were used to illustrate a story about a person who had become famous since the photograph was taken i do not believe that that would constitute fair dealing <e>", "<cs> the corresponding provisions to this clause are to be found in sections and and section of the act but they have now been made applicable to all descriptions of work <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has raised an important point <e> <s> i can understand the concerns of broadcasters that they should not be unduly obstructed by copyright considerations from broadcasting recordings of interviews which they themselves have set up and organised <e> <s> but it is pushing precautions against this to somewhat drastic extremes to deprive an interviewee or the maker of an impromptu speech of any possibility whatever of controlling whether or not the interview or speech is broadcast <e> <s> the maxim which has several times been quoted during our proceedings is relevant here what is worth copying is worth protecting <e> <s> one might as justly say what is worth broadcasting is worth protecting <e>", "<cs> i said we believe that if an interview or speech is recorded without the speakers consent it is only right that if it is such as to constitute a literary work the author should have control over the uses to which it is put <e> <s> this hinges very much upon whether or not the work is a literary work but if it is a literary work we believe that the author should have some control <e> <s> if it is not a literary work then it is not protected <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord kilbracken <e> <s> the exception in clause ought indeed to apply to parts of works as well as to whole works <e> <s> however it already does so by virtue of subsection a of clause which provides that <e>", "<cs> under the bill as drafted the exception which allows incidental inclusion of a musical work in another work for example a film or television broadcast without infringement of copyright does not apply if the musical work is deliberately included <e> <s> thus if an outside broadcast of a sporting event happens to pick up the sound of records being played over the public address system that will not infringe copyright in either the sound recording or the musical works contained in the recording <e> <s> but if a radio is heard playing in the background in an episode of eastenders or coronation street the inclusion of the musical works and sound recordings or broadcasts containing them is to be regarded as not being incidental <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord goes further perhaps i may be able to help him <e> <s> the distinction drawn between the treatment of musical and other kinds of works reflects the reactions of copyright bodies in the consultation process preceding the bill <e> <s> owners of copyright in musical works have expressed concern over an exception for inclusion that is both incidental and unintentional but other groups have not done so <e> <s> the distinction may have a practical basis rather than a theoretical one but i believe it is workable <e>", "<cs> before the house is resumed perhaps i may suggest that we do not return to the committee stage before pm <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> this amendment would allow someone other than a librarian to make the copy <e> <s> that would not be right <e> <s> the strict requirements of the exception in this clause and clause rely to a considerable extent on trusting the librarian to stick to the rules <e> <s> copyright owners may be prepared to place such trust in librarians <e> <s> i doubt whether it would be right to compel them to trust library users as well <e>", "<cs> i hear what the noble lord lord williams says <e> <s> i shall study his suggestion without commitment and see whether perhaps this wording could be tidied up <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just step into this skirmish on the other side of the chamber <e> <s> first i should like to say to the noble lord lord ardwick that there is no distinction between journals and <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will give way <e> <s> i think we have been through this country before <e> <s> perhaps we can move to the next amendment <e> <s> we are not getting very far on the bill <e> <s> perhaps noble lords can have a discussion concerning the matter outside the chamber <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would be for the convenience of the committee if i speak to amendments nos <e> <s> a a a and <e>", "<cs> for the convenience of the committee i speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> the purpose of the library exceptions is to facilitate study and research by allowing small portions of works to be copied <e> <s> this clause restates the existing provisions of section with only one change <e>

that i can do is to repeat what i said earlier <e> <s> the government view is that the present rule is clear <e> <s> both librarians and publishers know what is permissible <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for the brevity with which he moved the amendment <e> <s> it contains an interesting suggestion which in principle is applicable to any copying done under clause and perhaps the other library exceptions and could i suppose be even more generally applicable <e> <s> the intention underlying the amendment is the worthy one of seeking to deter further copying of material which has been copied by the librarian <e>", "<cs> i shall speak to amendment no <e> <s> and also to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in our view these amendments would have undesirable effects <e> <s> clause is primarily intended to cover library copying of books <e> <s> it has limitations on the extent of the copying which is allowed as one would expect <e> <s> however artistic works including drawings as well as photographs appear as illustrations in books and in copying a part of a book under the exception one could copy one or more artistic works in their <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord lord ardwick will understand that i would never undertake to deliver something that i could not fulfil <e> <s> i cannot guarantee to deliver the definition of a reasonable proportion <e> <s>

further definition and it is right that it should <e> <s> any further definition would be unlikely to make matters clearer and it would risk cutting out some things which were reasonable and including other things which were not <e> <s> for that reason i must resist the amendment <e>", "<cs> i believe the noble lord lord kilbracken has misheard me <e> <s> i said that i believed that any further definition was fruitless <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for describing his amendment as a probing amendment <e> <s> it has indeed enabled us to have another look at this point <e>", "<cs> i was not but i can assure the noble lord that i am going to be sympathetic <e>", "<cs> that is certainly to the point <e> <s> these amendments would remove copyright from two separate categories of

proceedings or for reporting such proceedings infringes copyright <e> <s> this ensures that there is no copyright obstacle to the conduct of proceedings or to widest possible dissemination of judgments <e>", "<cs> that is a very interesting idea but i cannot comment upon it fully <e> <s> i do not know how hmso calculates its costings and therefore i cannot help the noble lord <e>", "<cs> clause is a very important clause <e> <s> and i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way because i think that what i have to say may well assist the committee <e> <s> the function of this clause is to take industrial designs out of copyright law and i was very pleased to hear that this is also the intention of the amendment put down by my noble friend lord lucas <e> <s> in this respect i must congratulate the noble lord not only on his very clear explanation but also on his very clear amendment <e> <s> indeed were it not for the fact that in one particular case his amendment seems to give the wrong result i should be very sympathetic <e> <s> however i think it is the case that the clause already achieves the result that the noble lord seeks <e>", "<cs> this amendment would deprive clause of any effect <e> <s> apart from leaving a rather strange non-clause in the bill the result would be that full term life plus years copyright would continue to apply even where the copyright owner has authorised the exploitation of his work in the mass market <e>", "<cs> the amendment is not necessary <e> <s> i remind the committee of the provisions of clause <e> <s> the rights conferred by chapter ii including those in clause are all subject to chapter iii <e> <s> thus the exception defined in clause allows public reading or recitation notwithstanding any copyright that may subsist in the literary or dramatic work <e> <s> if the noble lord had his way here we should need similar wording at the beginning of each of clauses to <e> <s> that if i may say so is the kind of gothic drafting for which the act is criticised and from which we are attempting to get away <e>", "<cs> i take note of what the noble lord says about the berne convention <e> <s> i cannot comment usefully this evening on his views <e> <s> it is obviously important for us to take another look at this to make sure that we have it right <e> <s> if we are in contravention of the berne convention i undertake to return to the matter <e>", "<cs> i believe that the answer is in the affirmative <e>", "<cs> i have listened with interest to the points raised by the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> i should say a certain amount about this clause because although it may not be immediately <e>", "<cs> i will of course consider what has been said about this clause <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams asked about an artist repeating a work that he has previously painted <e> <s> clause creates an exception from what would otherwise be an infringement <e> <s> his example of monet and rouen cathedral would probably not involve infringement in the first place <e>", "<cs> if the second painting were identical to the first and the artist had sold the <e>", "<cs> this clause is intended to reenact the existing law in sections and a of the act <e> <s> the copyright in a broadcast or cable programme is not infringed by copying it for private purposes <e> <s> such copying will however infringe the copyright in any copyright work play music sound recording film included in the broadcast or cable programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> clause provides that where an audience has not paid for admission a broadcast or cable programme may be shown or played in public without infringing copyright in the broadcast or cable programme itself or in any sound recording or film included in it <e> <s> the exception does not apply with respect to any copyright in any play or music which may be contained in such a broadcast or cable programme and a copyright licence will in the normal way be required by the performing rights society <e> <s> our obligations under the berne convention do not permit the exception to be extended to dramatic or musical works <e> <s> without the exception it would be necessary for anyone playing a radio or providing a television set in for example a shop or a pub to obtain a copyright licence not only from the performing rights society but also from the broadcaster or cable company and from any owner of copyright in records or films that might be included in the broadcast <e> <s> we believe this would be unreasonably burdensome to the public <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord williams mentioned an example of a theatre charging for drinks in a bar <e> <s> if those drinks are charged at a normal rate there is no effect but where for instance there was an attempt to get around copyright by not charging for admission but instead charging a very high price for let us say a compulsory drink or a compulsory ice-cream this would provide a way around having to obtain copyright <e>", "<cs> as to how a low price is partly attributable to a particular broadcast that is not what the clause says <e> <s> it refers to prices being partly attributable to facilities <e> <s> in other words if a price is charged to pay both for food and the facilities that is caught by the provision <e> <s> as to a place with several separate halls each is a separate place and can be considered separately <e>", "<cs> i shall look carefully at what the noble lord has said but this is really a fairly narrow exception and subsection b is designed to stop a possible avoidance of having to obtain copyright to show a broadcast or cable programme <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment perhaps i may say that i shall write to noble lords concerned to explain our thinking on this <e> <s> i also undertake to look at the wording in paragraph b but i believe that the paragraph is necessary in order to stop a possible avoidance in this exception <e>", "<cs> we recognise that copyright owners have never been happy with the provision of the act which is re-enacted in

reception area of the original broadcast or in pursuance of what is known as a must carry requirement imposed on a cable programme service by the cable authority the provider of the cable programme service does not have to obtain consent from the copyright owners of works included in the broadcast or pay them royalties for the retransmission <e>", "<cs> the noble lord argues that our obligations

wish to <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness lady birk has told us clause brings us onto the very important question of moral rights <e> <s> these are distinct from the economic rights which we considered in chapter ii which are provided to enable the author to obtain remuneration for the use of his works <e> <s> the moral rights will enable the author to protect his reputation <e>", "<cs> i think that the signing of an original picture would not necessarily in itself be an assertion <e> <s> i think it would be similar to the authors name being on a book <e> <s> and as i said as regards the example of agatha christie the author may well assert that her name must be on the spine of every copy published <e> <s> that would not necessarily apply to an original picture but it could certainly be applicable where prints are being made of an original picture and the person who painted the original picture may well want to make some stipulation of that nature <e> <s> but i think that it may well be that a signature on the original picture is an assertion and maybe it should be <e>", "<cs> these amendments are concerned to add a further category to the list in subsection of the cases in which the author of an artistic work is to have the right conferred by clause <e>", "<cs> i should say to the noble lord that once the author has effectively asserted his right that is it especially if the assertion is an assignment because clause makes that binding on everyone <e> <s> i believe that in cases where it is necessary where there is not a prior arrangement between the photographer and the person to whom he is sending the photograph by electronic transfer that electronic transfer could also be used to carry an assertion of his right in that photograph <e>", "<cs> yes of course i shall consider what noble lords have said and i shall indeed look very carefully at what they have said but i am not convinced that there is a problem here <e> <s> a publisher of photographs let us say a newspaper will have a considerable photographic library <e> <s> within that library there will be the photograph the record of who took that photograph the record of when that photograph was taken and of whom it is <e> <s> there is no reason why along with the history of the photograph there should not be a record of whether a right has been asserted just as the owner of the copyright should be recorded <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> this amendment is consequential on his earlier amendment amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i am grateful to him for allowing me to say that i now have sympathy for his earlier amendment <e> <s> i said that i should consider what he had said and i now believe that in our reconsideration of the copyright status of engineering structures we should also look at the moral rights implications <e> <s> i hope that with that assurance the noble lord will withdraw his amendment and allow us to take a further look at it <e>", "<cs> notwithstanding where the noble and learned lord would like to draw his line between laburnum grove and blenheim palace perhaps somewhere near woodstock we are concerned with the architects right to be identified with his work <e> <s> we recognise that different considerations apply when considering architects than when considering other authors <e> <s> for example we recognise that many buildings particularly private dwellings may be constructed to the same design and so we have proposed that the right only arises in respect of the first to be constructed <e>", "<cs> these amendments deal with the question of how an author chooses to be identified when he has asserted his paternity right <e> <s> it may be for example that he wants to be known by his pseudonym <e> <s> at the moment this is provided for in general terms in clause <e> <s> the suggestion made by my noble friend lord cullen is a useful one <e> <s> it would mean that the author when asserting his paternity right could specify the exact form that his identification should take <e> <s> in this way the author or director could ensure that those whose notice was brought to the assertion would also be aware of the means of identification <e> <s> this is something that we can accept in principle but we should like to look a little more closely at the wording <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to ensure that the paternity right applies to parts of works as well as complete works <e> <s> this has in fact already been provided for in the first subsection of clause which states that the right applies to the whole or any substantial part of a work <e> <s> the amendment is therefore unnecessary and i ask the noble lord to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i agree <e> <s> this amendment seeks to ensure that the paternity right will only have effect if it has been asserted in writing <e> <s> this has already been provided for in the first subsection of clause which states that the right is not infringed unless it has been asserted in accordance with clause <e> <s> the amendment is therefore unnecessary and i ask my noble friend to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> the assertion of the right to be identified as author can be made on the document which provides an assignment of copyright <e> <s> this then binds the assignee and anyone claiming through him <e> <s> this amendment seeks to make the same provision through an exclusive licence <e> <s> i am afraid that i consider this amendment to be mistaken <e> <s> an assignment passes copyright out of the hands of the author and he is thereafter dependent upon his moral right to protect his remaining non-economic interests in the work <e> <s> to be able to rely on his right to be identified he must assert that right and the most effective way of doing that will be in the assignment itself <e> <s> this then binds the assignee and every other person who thereafter becomes owner of the copyright <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord aware that we are on a clause stand part debate at the moment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord morton asked what an assertion is <e> <s> i have already discussed that with him <e> <s> i repeat that an assertion is a statement by the author that he wishes to be named on copies of the work and he can say so in as many words in his assignment or as the noble lord said in his assignation which i think i am right in saying is the scottish equivalent <e> <s> alternatively he can say so in as many words in his notice under subsection <e> <s> the noble lords suggestion about a notice on each page of a book is clearly not required with this clause <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the assertion binds the assignee or his successors absolutely <e> <s> if the successors lose it that is their problem <e>

moral right in this instance <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend says that he was not there <e> <s> i shall indeed include in the letter a form of words that i believe would be an assertion of my paternity right in the letter <e>", "<cs> it is in clause <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to ensure that the authors of computer programs and typefaces are entitled to the right to be identified as author <e> <s> the list of exceptions to the paternity right given in clause has been compiled for a number of reasons one of them being practicality <e> <s> we feel that giving the authors of computer programs and typefaces the paternity right would cause numerous practical problems and would lead to more problems than benefits <e> <s> although literary works programs are different in many ways from books and other material regarded as literary works <e> <s> it would not for example be appropriate for the authors of the computer programs running teletext services to be identified each

where legal recognition of moral rights is perhaps most fully developed there are no such rights in computer programs <e>", "<cs> i said that i believed that the clause enables us to fulfil our obligations under the convention <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord mcgregor of durris has spoken to a number of amendments that were not previously grouped and the noble lord lord howie of troon has

amendments nos <e> <s> a and <e>", "<cs> for the convenience of the committee i shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and and i shall briefly allude to amendment no <e> <s> which was not moved and which is in the name of my noble friend lord stockton <e> <s> we envisage consent in respect of moral rights to operate very like a licence in respect of copyright that is that it may be implied expressed or signified by conduct <e> <s> the amendment in the name of my noble friend lord stockton would have limited consent to express oral or written consent which we do not believe is right <e> <s> waiver of rights in advance should be in writing but consent to the doing of particular acts ought to be able to be given in any way whatever <e>", "<cs> the amendments tabled by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton seek to make general waiver of moral rights applicable only in the context of the employer/employee relationship provided for in clause <e> <s> thus a freelance author or director would in effect have inalienable moral rights subject only to consent for particular acts <e>", "<cs> i had understood that this amendment was grouped with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i spoke to that group including this amendment <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord would like to read what i said <e> <s> if it does not cover his point i shall be very glad to try to do so again <e>", "<cs> for the convenience of the committee i speak also to amendments nos <e> <s> which is in my own name and in the name of my noble friend lord stockton <e>", "<cs> i am advised that one cannot get damages for injured feelings <e>", "<cs> the amendment moved by the noble lord seeks to restrict the remedies available to the court when considering cases of infringement of the right conferred by clause <e> <s> we do not believe that we should deprive the courts of flexibility <e> <s> there will be cases where the best course is to allow the modified work to be used provided that the author or director is clearly dissociated from it <e> <s> i think the flexibility benefits both authors and directors as well as the users of copyright material <e> <s> the court might find the modification insufficient to justify a full injunction so the author could find himself associated with a modified work which he wishes to disown <e> <s> clause will allow the court in cases where a full injunction is not justified to allow exploitation to continue while allowing the author to be dissociated from the change <e>", "<cs> the purpose of this clause is to provide general presumptions as to the subsistence and ownership of copyright in civil proceedings <e> <s> subsection provides that it is to be presumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary that copyright subsists in the work in question and that the plaintiff is the owner of copyright <e> <s> these presumptions already apply under section of the act but only until the defendant puts subsistence or ownership in issue <e> <s> the defendant has only to raise the point in his pleadings without any evidence for the plaintiff to have to prove subsistence and ownership <e> <s> under the bill however he will have to produce some evidence to back his challenge before the plaintiff can be put to proof <e> <s> the amendment would restore the provisions of the act <e>", "<cs> the committee will be aware that a person who in the course of a trade or business is in possession of a copy of a sound recording film or computer program which he knows to be an infringing copy is guilty of an offence <e> <s> these provisions introduced in the last few years have been highly effective in the fight against piracy <e> <s> in the white paper we promised to extend this criminal offence provision to all categories of copyright material and for consistency make unauthorised possession by way of trade a secondary infringement under the civil provisions <e> <s> this we have done in this clause and clause respectively <e>", "<cs> do i gather from that that the noble lord wishes to withdraw the amendment now or would he like me to speak to the committee at this hour of the evening which i am very happy to do <e>", "<cs> my noble friend the secretary of state made an unequivocal condemnation of copyright piracy when he opened the second reading debate on this bill <e> <s> in doing so i am sure that he was reflecting the sentiments of this committee <e>", "<cs> unlike other intellectual property rights such as patents copyright is not registered in any way <e> <s> establishing subsistence and ownership of copyright can sometimes give rise to problems <e> <s> particular difficulty appears to have arisen in film cases <e> <s> we have therefore thought it right to provide for certain presumptions to be made in civil proceedings to ease the burden on the courts and to prevent the pirate from infringing with impunity secure in the knowledge that he can deter an infringement action by putting the copyright owner to proof <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for tabling this amendment which i am prepared to accept <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord and am of course prepared to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> i will certainly look into that matter and let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> when we announced our intention in the white paper to extend the import prohibition provisions in the act to films and records we indicated that such provisions may create difficulties for customs and excise <e> <s> the existing provisions have not been used to any great degree and any sudden increase would impose undue burdens on the limited resources of customs and excise <e> <s> it was for this reason that we said in the white paper that in the case of films and records the copyright owner would have to give notice of the expected time and place of the infringing importation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> this amendment would widen the definition of a licensing body significantly so that it was no longer a necessary condition that such a body had as its main object or one of its

the phrase primary purpose <e> <s> i shall be considering what he has said to me in regard to that matter and responding to it <e>", "<cs> clause introduces a group of clauses concerned with the control of licensing schemes <e> <s> the licensing schemes in respect of the first group of works come under the tribunal only if they are operated by a licensing body cover the work of more than one author and concern the uses specified in subparagraphs i to iii of paragraph a <e> <s> that restriction is basically because the works concerned all come within the berne convention <e> <s> we would be acting outside our berne obligations if for example the tribunal could adjudicate a licensing scheme operated by an individual author or film maker in regard to his own productions <e>", "<cs> the purpose of clauses and is to allow parties who are discussing prospective schemes or licences but who cannot agree on terms to go jointly to the tribunal before a scheme comes into effect and obtain a decision <e> <s> that saves time and effort to all concerned <e> <s> the corresponding provisions in the act have proved useful in the past to such bodies as the bbc and the performing right society when negotiating terms <e> <s> to allow one side on its own to refer a prospective scheme or licence would achieve little <e> <s> if the other side did not agree to the reference it could merely withdraw from negotiations altogether <e> <s> a provision along the lines of the amendment has not proved necessary up to now and i doubt if it would be workable <e>", "<cs> i shall look carefully at what all members of the committee have said on this matter <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the idea of the tribunal is not to make it compulsory for copyright owners to become members of a licensing scheme in any way at all <e> <s> if they wish to enter into a scheme as the willing seller this comes into effect <e> <s> it is not the idea to make it compulsory <e>", "<cs> i understand that the order is an order made under the terms of this bill <e> <s> if it were made wrongly in the eyes of those involved it would be for them to make application to the courts to have the matter considered <e> <s> i do not think that there is any provision for parliament to look at these individual orders <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> the answer on the status of the order i believe can be found by referring to clause <e> <s> it is not a parliamentary matter but is similar to a court judgment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may refer the noble lord lord morton to clause a <e> <s> that provision requires rules to be made prohibiting the copyright tribunal from entertaining a reference under clauses to which is made by an organisation claiming to be representative of interested persons unless the tribunal is satisfied that it is indeed reasonably representative <e> <s> thus the result desired by the noble lord is already achieved <e> <s> this wording already exists in the act where it causes no problems <e> <s> in this instance i see no reason to change it <e> <s> representativeness is a relative and not an absolute concept <e> <s> it would seem to be right to leave the tribunal as the judge of it <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could clarify whether the noble lord in moving amendment no <e> <s> b is also speaking to amendment no <e> <s> d as they are grouped on my list <e>", "<cs> in that case i will take amendment no <e> <s> b separately <e> <s> this amendment is intended to ensure that where a scheme is already subject to a tribunal order the rules preventing a further reference until a set period has elapsed shall not operate in respect of new issues which the parties may want to argue <e> <s> we have not had time to consider fully the implications of this but it would seem readily open to abuse <e> <s> there is already power for the tribunal to give special leave for an earlier reference and that should be sufficient <e> <s> for that reason i oppose this amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps it will help the committee if i run through the subsections and what they are intended to do <e> <s> subsection provides that a person who claims in a case covered by a licensing scheme that the operator of the scheme has refused to grant him a licence in accordance with the scheme or has failed to do so within a reasonable time after being asked may then apply to the copyright tribunal <e> <s> subsection makes similar provision with respect to cases excepted from a licensing scheme and subsection sets out what cases are to be regarded as excepted from a licensing scheme <e>", "<cs> i think we should look at this more carefully as the noble lord may well have a point <e> <s> we will check to see that what the clause actually says coincides with what i have described <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> d to clause provides that where the tribunal has made an order that a person who has been refused a licence in a case excepted from a licensing scheme or offered one on unreasonable terms shall be entitled to a licence on terms it shall lay down the tribunal may extend the benefit of its order to others with similar needs <e> <s> i am rather doubtful that this will prove acceptable but we are prepared to have a look at the point if the noble lord is willing to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> when the copyright tribunal has made an order regarding a scheme or licence clauses and provide that a further reference or application may not normally be made with respect to it within months <e> <s> if the order is for months or less a further reference may not be made until the last three months before its expiry <e>", "<cs> i would say to the noble lord that i think we are both heading in the same direction <e> <s> it is simply a matter of trying to establish a means of getting there <e> <s> in that respect i am always ready to look at what he has put forward <e>", "<cs> may i confirm that my noble friend is in fact speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> f g

defined <e> <s> this is we think misconceived and would probably amount to a general compulsory licensing provision in contravention of the berne convention <e> <s> for that reason we do not feel able to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is true that in general terms the system of tribunal control over collective licensing is primarily designed to prevent abuse of monopoly power but it does not follow from this that the tribunal should be able to vary terms only when clear abuse of a monoploy position enjoyed by licensee is established <e> <s> this would greatly complicate the tribunals deliberations <e> <s> i should say to the noble and learned lord lord denning and the noble lord lord willis that monopoly is a matter for competition legislation which is already administered by the office of fair trading and the monopolies and mergers commission <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that reference to the office of fair trading in the bill and references to monopoly legislation would necessarily be helpful <e> <s> however i shall look at what the noble lord said and see whether we can improve matters in any way <e>", "<cs> i do not quite understand what the noble lord is getting at <e> <s> perhaps he can clarify the point <e>", "<cs> i do not think so <e> <s> i was just trying to be helpful to the committee <e> <s> i was not contradicting myself when i said that we would look at it <e>", "<cs> the amendment would go further than that <e> <s> the proposed new clause would provide that the tribunal can vary the terms of a licence or licensing scheme only where the difference between the terms offered and the terms that the tribunal would consider reasonable can be attributed to abuse of a monopoly position <e>", "<cs> the amendment would extend the criteria that the tribunal must apply in relation to licensing schemes to references or applications in regard to licences <e> <s> i am rather doubful that this would be appropriate but we shall have a look at the point <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect many of these amendments were put down fairly recently in the name of my noble friend lord cullen <e> <s> we have not had enough time to consider precisely all the amendments that he has tabled <e> <s> we should like to consider this further because we feel that there may be a point here but i have to say that we shall be looking at it without commitment

comparisons to be made <e>", "<cs> the amendments of the noble lord lord mulley are designed to ameliorate what independent radio in the united kingdom sees as unfair treatment by the record industry

the work will be relevant to paragraph b of the clause on the proportion of the work to be copied <e> <s> that is set out in clause b <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i can comment this evening on the technical procedures concerning a fax machine <e> <s> obviously as the bill is going to have to serve us in law for the next years or so a similar length of time to the last one -we must look at that matter <e> <s> as we all know technical advances are coming very fast <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lords lord morton and lord willis <e> <s> the purpose of this clause is to ensure that the owners of rights in works including broadcasts and cable programmes which are recorded for educational use under a licensing scheme certified under clause can obtain a reasonable but not excessive return for this further use of their work <e>", "<cs> first i turn to the point raised by the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> i said in speaking to the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran that certainly one of the cases we wish to cover is the reference of a licence to include works in a broadcast or cable programme which is retransmitted abroad <e> <s> i assure the noble lord that the clause does this <e> <s> i also point out that the tribunal will have no jurisdiction over any retransmission outside the united kingdom though the clause may require it to take such retransmission into account <e> <s> let me also say to the noble baroness that under the provision as amended by amendments nos <e> <s> to the tribunal will be required to take account of retransmissions anywhere in the world if within the area of the original transmission <e> <s> i believe that that renders amendment no <e> <s> a unnecessary <e>", "<cs> i think that the expression abroad includes anywhere else in the world other than the united kingdom which if this bill becomes law it will cover <e> <s> however i will look to see whether there is any objection <e> <s> we are not in the business of trying to add words to the bill but we will of course see whether clarity could be improved by the inclusion of those words <e>", "<cs> the clause ensures that whatever specific matters may need special attention in a particular case the tribunal must always take all considerations into account which are relevant to the case <e> <s> although this has always been tribunal practice the obligation to take all relevant matters into account is not specifically stated in the act <e>", "<cs> clause provides for an indemnity to be implied in every general licensing scheme for reprographic copying and every general licence granted by a licensing body for such copying <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee <e> <s> i am indeed speaking to the grouping as set out on the list that was issued <e>", "<cs> the concept of a general licence is where the terms of the licence are to be negotiated between the buyer and the seller so to speak <e> <s> for instance if the government generally wish to negotiate terms for a general licence with a particular licensing agency then there would be a discusssion which would lead to establishing the terms for that licence <e> <s> where a licensing scheme is in operation the terms of the scheme are usually already in existence <e> <s> for instance the price the length of time and other considerations that would still have to be negotiated for a general licence <e>", "<cs> what falls within a general scheme is to he negotiated between the parties <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord repeat what he said because i could not catch it <e> <s> i apologise <e>", "<cs> the licensor and the licensee would be the two parties who would have to agree the terms and other conditions <e> <s> an example of a general licence would be a reference to all books published by a certain group of publishers <e> <s> the copyright in some of those works may remain with the authors <e> <s> in that case the operators of the scheme must be indemnified against any possible infringement resulting from ignorance of that fact <e>", "<cs> as i understand it where a licensing scheme or a general scheme is being established it would be between the operators of the scheme and the people who wish to use the words covered by the scheme <e>", "<cs> as i have already said the amendments moved by my noble friend deal with the issue of commercial research which we debated earlier in our proceedings <e> <s> as i said then we are already considering the proposal that photocopying by libraries for purposes of commercial research should be free to the extent that no licensing scheme covering the works in question has been established and certified under clause <e> <s> if we were to go down that route my noble friends proposal with regard to clauses to would become largely unnecessary <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord may have overlooked the purpose of the certification procedure under clause <e> <s> the clause relates to a number of provisions in part i under which various classes of user of copyright works are permitted freely to copy the works concerned in various ways without infringing copyright unless there is a certified licensing scheme in existence <e> <s> clause provides the necessary mechanism for getting such licensing schemes appropriately certified <e> <s> although the secretary of state may certify a scheme initially without a tribunal decision on whether the terms are reasonable the committee will note that he must amend the certification order if there is a reference to the tribunal and the tribunal rules that the scheme must be varied <e>", "<cs> i understand that the new clause was debated earlier in connection with the tape levy point <e> <s> we are looking carefully at that tape levy point and at the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is quite correct <e> <s> the clause provides for the membership of the tribunal and provision is made for appointment by the lord chancellor after consultation with the lord advocate of a chairman and two deputy chairmen who must be legally qualified and for the secretary of state to appoint between two and eight ordinary members <e>", "<cs> i think that he would have to disqualify himself from that case because it would be very strange for the chairman of the tribunal to act in a case where the tribunal itself was on the other side <e> <s> that would be very difficult <e> <s> on the other hand if the chairman of the tribunal wished to continue on the tribunal in considering a case where he had been involved with his private practice i cannot imagine that it would he right for him to continue in that case either <e>", "<cs> i hear what the noble lord has to say <e> <s> from the governments point of view disqualification must be from activity on the tribunal but equally i think it would be very strange if the chairman of the tribunal were acting on the other side <e>", "<cs> under clause the secretary of state will appoint between two and eight ordinary members <e> <s> as i understand it it would be for the secretary of state to decide who is qualified and suitable to take up the role of member of the copyright tribunal <e> <s> that would be at his discretion as there are no formal qualifications for ordinary membership <e> <s> the point should be looked at because there may well be an error or something the draftsman has not covered <e> <s> i should like to look at it <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i agree with that <e>", "<cs> i also shall speak to amendments b c d and e <e> <s> these amendments have two related aims <e> <s> the first is to enable appeals to be made from decisions of the copyright tribunal <e> <s> not only on questions of law as under the bill and the act but also on questions of fact as well <e> <s> the second aim is to put the tribunal under a strict obligation to give effect to decisions of the high court or court of session <e> <s> following an appeal rather than as under the bill simply having to reconsider an earlier ruling in the light or the courts decision <e>", "<cs> under the act the crown is entitled to copyright in two groups of works <e> <s> the first is those made by or under the direction or control of her majesty or a government department and secondly works first published by the crown <e> <s> under the bill works in the second category will no longer attract crown copyright <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord would not expect me to follow him down that road <e> <s> the example given by the noble lord lord willis of the employee in the royal mint is not a very good one <e> <s> copyright in designs of legal tender is vested in the crown <e> <s> i do not believe that the noble lord would go along with any other possible scenario <e> <s> there are security and all sorts of other implications <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams for moving the amendment of the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead <e>", "<cs> i was making a separate point that regardless of the principle here i believe that any such agreement should be in writing <e> <s> but no i do not think it would change my view on the principle <e>", "<cs> i assume that the noble lord is again talking about why the crown should be treated differently <e> <s> can i assume that i am correct in that <e> <s> we have already been through that argument on the previous amendment and what i said then stands <e>", "<cs> it is a matter of degree <e> <s> we believe that the balance we have struck here is the right one and that the amendment of the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead would change the degree to one we could not go for <e>", "<cs> these amendments address the question of the duration of crown copyright <e> <s> i have to say at the outset that i cannot accept amendments nos <e> <s> b and c since their effect would be to limit the copyright in crown publications to the year of publication <e> <s> that would be disastrous for the viability of her majestys stationery office <e> <s> i do not suppose however that the noble lord intends that <e>", "<cs> we have given careful consideration to the matter and again i believe that the conclusion we have reached is about right <e> <s> we could argue the matter either way for a long period of time <e> <s> however at the end of the day it is a subjective judgment and this is the judgment that we have reached <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord takes that view <e> <s> we believe that it is about right and therefore i cannot follow the noble lord down the road that he takes <e>", "<cs> i have already set out at considerable length why we believe the conclusion to be right <e> <s> throughout the bill there are a number of matters which at the end of the day are a subjective view <e> <s> i fully accept that the noble lord lord howie <e>", "<cs> i think i should make it clear that royal papers which were not released for years would be in copyright for years after release <e>", "<cs> i really must protest <e> <s> i have at considerable length set out the reasons <e> <s> i would urge the noble lord perhaps to have a look tomorrow at what i have said and the reasons that i have set out for coming to our views <e>", "<cs> i should say to your lordships that protocol of the universal copyright convention requires us to protect works made or published by the united nations its specialised agencies or by the organisation of american states <e> <s> most of the works in question will qualify for protection under the provisions of clause or clause but this clause ensures that protection is given even when the works would not otherwise qualify <e>", "<cs> i believe that they are not mentioned in schedule <e> <s> as to whether they should be that is another matter <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly undertake to write to the noble lord and will give him further examples of organisations that would be covered <e> <s> as to whether it will be an exhaustive list i cannot give that undertaking <e> <s> but we will do our best to cover most of the types of organisation <e>", "<cs> i have to say to my noble friend that a copyright bill is simply not the place to deal with matters such as the rules of equity on breaches of trust or confidence <e> <s> this bill does not have any effect on the law of confidentiality <e> <s> in some cases it will protect employers and in others it will protect employees <e> <s> it depends on the circumstances in which the obligation of confidentiality arises <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has moved his amendment perhaps i should reply to it <e> <s> one of the functions of the bill is to restate large parts of the existing law unchanged but in a much plainer and more easily understood form <e> <s> the danger of such a restatement of the law in different language is that the courts will assume that the use of different language necessarily means that the law has changed <e> <s> of course in many areas we are intending a change in the law and each set of circumstances must be treated on its merits <e> <s> i agree with the view expressed by my noble friend lord brentford at an earlier committee sitting that the existing jurisprudence has a vital part to play in this <e>", "<cs> many members of the committee have had many representations often of a conflicting nature <e> <s> for as many representations received taking one view i have received an equal number taking another view <e> <s> therefore the fact that these requests have been received should be no surprise <e> <s> the requests received were in response to the consultation on draft clauses <e> <s> i would have to consider whether i was able to disclose to the noble lord exactly where they had come from <e> <s> i will look at that matter but i cannot give him a definitive answer this evening <e> <s> we feel that we do not want to lose the helpful jurisprudence that has been established <e>", "<cs> the language of the bill is generally simpler than that of the act <e> <s> the changes in wording are not to be construed as leading to a change of meaning <e> <s> examples are the change from cinematograph film simply to film and the wording of the exceptions relating to libraries <e>", "<cs> commercial publication is a new concept in the bill and so some explanation is perhaps desirable <e> <s> it is mentioned in notes on clauses <e> <s> under the act the concept of publication has relevance in three areas <e>", "<cs> as i was saying under the act the concept of publication has relevance in a number of areas namely subsistence duration of copyright and restricted act of publication <e> <s> the term commercial publication is used in clauses and <e>", "<cs> we were not clear as to the thrust of the amendment <e> <s> i shall consider carefully both what the noble lord has said and amendment no <e> <s> and write to him with our conclusions <e>", "<cs> at the beginning of committee stage i undertook for copies of all letters that i write to be available in the library <e>", "<cs> i beg to move amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> of course i shall go more slowly for the noble lord <e>", "<cs> for the noble lord for the committee and for all concerned i shall go more slowly <e> <s> long and complex transitional provisions are more necessary in copyright than in almost any other field of law except perhaps land law <e> <s> copyright lasts for a very long time <e> <s> the transitional provisions must be capable of dealing with works created and transactions in respect of those works carried out more than years ago <e> <s> many works written before the date when the act came into force at st july are still in copyright for example much of the output of george bernard shaw pablo picasso and richard strauss <e> <s> thus the schedule must be capable of dealing with differences between the provisions of part i and three earlier regimes namely before st july between st july and st june which is when the act came into force and between st june and the coming into force of this bill <e>", "<cs> the schedule as now printed on the marshalled list was put down as an amendment very early on <e> <s> i regret that perhaps our intention was not pointed out at second reading <e>", "<cs> i would not agree with the noble lord <e> <s> the new schedule as printed on the marshalled list was not a complete change but a development of what was effectively the previous draft <e> <s> there was very little time to get this provision absolutely right <e> <s> if it had been absolutely right there would have been no need to put down this amendment today <e>", "<cs> the provisions to which the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran and the noble lord lord williams of elvel refer are necessary to simplify the drafting of the schedule <e> <s> their meaning is explained in the revised schedule and cannot really <e>", "<cs> i have already endeavoured to explain why this schedule was tabled as an amendment in itself <e> <s> we had a lot of adjustments to make <e> <s> we did not want to put down long streams of amendments to schedule as printed in the bill and we took a decision to table a new schedule <e> <s> i shall write to the noble lords and place a copy in the library of the letter setting out what they request <e> <s> it will not be a short letter <e> <s> i do not think there are any matters of great note in it <e> <s> really this schedule as it appears in the bill and as it appears in the amendment should be regarded as successive drafts of the same thing <e>", "<cs> i think i can reassure the committee that the differences between schedule as printed in the original bill and schedule as printed in the marshalled list are changes that we have had to make to correct technically defective drafting <e> <s> i do not think that there are any matters or many matters of any great import <e>", "<cs> i was going to carry on to say that we decided perhaps wrongly that the best way of dealing with this was to put down as an amendment a new schedule in its entirety rather than coming through with a great number of amendments of very little consequence <e> <s> this may or may not have been the right way of dealing with it <e> <s> if your lordships committee feels that that has only added to the difficulties i can only apologise <e>", "<cs> the very point we are concerned about in getting this schedule right is that which he mentioned the costs of litigation and the cost to industry <e> <s> we have endeavoured to do this in the schedule as printed in the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> i should say to the noble lord that the timing of report stage is for the usual channels <e> <s> yes it is a very great undertaking <e> <s> the noble lord is asking for something <e> <s> i am seeking to oblige him and oblige him i will <e> <s> changes between the act and the bill are not i believe anything to do with this matter <e> <s> both versions of the schedule achieve a transition from the act to the bill and it makes no difference to the question of the change of expression which version of the schedule is used <e> <s> i would point that out to the noble lord and i think that having said that it will perhaps define the task that we are undertaking in writing to him with the changes between the schedule as printed in the original bill and as presented in the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> i should just make it clear again to the noble lord lord lloyd that i will be writing to him and the noble lord lord williams pointing out the differences between the schedule as drafted in the original bill and as printed in the marshalled list <e> <s> i do not know whether he is asking me for the changes compared to the act <e> <s> that would be an almost insurmountable task and is perhaps not what he had in mind <e>", "<cs> i think that when the noble lord has received our submission to him as to the changes in schedule between the original bill and that printed in the marshalled list he will find that any changes of substance are very small indeed <e> <s> i am well aware that one part of the usual channels is listening to this debate this evening and no doubt he is well able to take account of the noble lords remarks <e>", "<cs> we try to get everything right first time round <e> <s> i have to admit that we did not get schedule right first time round <e> <s> i hope there will be no further amendments but i cannot give that undertaking because something may come to light or be brought to our attention by your lordships that would require an amendment to be brought forward <e>", "<cs> the noble lord can certainly ask for it but the noble lord lord brain may have noticed that i was unable to give it <e>", "<cs> i wish to couple myself and my colleagues with those good wishes <e> <s> i shall undertake to pass on all the comments and good wishes from noble lords this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords the commissions proposal for a general directive was identified by community heads of government in june as a priority for decision by the end of <e> <s> work has been pursued energetically during the present danish presidency with a view to ensuring that the council of ministers meets that target <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the government have studied with great care the very helpful and well researched report of the select committee <e> <s> in particular the proposal has been amended to reflect the reports observations on the distinction between professions and activities <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i should point out that we are talking here about professional qualifications and not about education from a young age <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness raises a very interesting point <e> <s> the directive would apply only to fully qualified professionals practising in their home state who have a university level qualification <e> <s> in addition most member states and the commission now accept that where qualifications differ there should be provision for an adaptation exam <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble baroness <e> <s> i would say to her that the precise form of the adaptation mechanism is still under discussion and it is clearly very important to get it right <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has been on his feet for nearly minutes and he is now speaking at the expense of subsequent speakers in the debate <e> <s> we are already running minutes late <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a most worthwhile debate on a subject of considerable importance and i am most grateful to the noble lord lord sefton of garston for introducing it today <e>", "<cs> my lords i was dealing with the recent interest rate cuts which are very important in the management of our economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i have outlined a number of the governments initiatives which in themselves add up to many projects for dealing with these problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> as explained by the noble lord lord morton of shuna these amendments seek to restore the position under the performers protection acts whereby consent to the use of a performance must be given in writing if an offence is not to be committed <e> <s> this requirement for consent to be in writing has been dropped from the bill <e> <s> the reason for this decision is that we have concluded that on general legal principles such a requirement is unsound <e> <s> let us suppose as may happen that a performer is asked to consent to a recording being made of a performance and he chooses to consent orally <e> <s> the agreement might be made quite casually but it would unquestionably amount to the giving of consent <e> <s> the absence of writing would be total irrelevance because the court would refuse to give judgment in favour of a plaintiff who had consented to what he subsequently complained of whether or not that consent was in writing <e> <s> it is scarcely credible that a criminal court should convict in such a case <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i think i should say to him that the consent in the pink panther case was in fact in writing <e> <s> there was no question of oral consent arising in other words in this case the writing did not avoid litigation <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can clarify whether the noble lord lord tordoff is speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> ab ga b and aa <e> <s> he also mentioned amendment no <e> <s> da and i was wondering whether he was also speaking to that amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> perhaps at this stage for the convenience of members of the committee i can also speak to amendment no <e> <s> da as well as amendment no <e> <s> aa as i was under the impression that amendment no <e> <s> aa was listed on the groupings list with the first three amendments <e> <s> it is of course at the discretion of the noble lord as to how we deal with this <e>", "<cs> it was in my belief unclear what the noble lord lord donaldson was doing with his tape recorder and what exactly he was recording <e> <s> for me to have said that he was acting illegally was entirely hypothetical <e>", "<cs> i shall also speak to the same amendments <e> <s> these amendments are essentially the same as amendments nos <e> <s> and which we debated at some length at an earlier sitting of the committee <e> <s> at the risk of repeating myself i shall gladly accept that the restricted acts should not be confined only to acts done with a complete performance <e> <s> nevertheless as with copyright the removal of the word substantial would go much too far <e> <s> it would mean that acts done in relation to the smallest fragment of a performance would constitute infringement of a performers rights for example a single word from a performance of hamlet to build on the example i used last time <e> <s> in our view this is clearly wrong <e> <s> of course as i said before a substantial part does not necessarily mean a large part <e> <s> even a small part can be substantial depending on the circumstances <e> <s> we have in the words substantial part a well worked and well understood concept which is just as appropriate here as in copyright <e>", "<cs> will it be agreeable to the noble lord if i also speak to the other amendments in the grouping <e> <s> this is a substantial group of amendments and i can go through them carefully <e> <s> it may be to his convenience if i speak to all the amendments <e>", "<cs> i am speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> e f ha c za d za b da h j c a and za <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord and i hope that other members of the committee will be happy to consider the amendments in this way <e>", "<cs> of course i shall look and see what has been said in <e>", "<cs> i should say a few words about why the wording in the patents act is we believe not appropriate here <e> <s> in the patents act the words <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is a much greater authority than i am on what might happen in a scottish court <e> <s> i suspect that he is also much more <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly speak to the amendment as the noble lord has moved it <e> <s> i believe that the amendments would go rather further than perhaps has been outlined so far <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> a and ac attempt to create a new right to control usage of a recording once it has been made <e> <s> under the performers protection acts and under the bill as drafted neither the performer nor a person having recording rights has the right to prevent a recording from being shown or played in public broadcast or included in a cable programme service once they have consented to the making of the recording in the first place <e>", "<cs> the intention of the amendments tabled by the noble lord is that the importer or dealer in illicit recordings should be liable for a forfeiture order against him even in cases where he acquired the recordings in good faith <e>", "<cs> i shall speak also to amendments nos <e> <s> zb and zd and i agree with the noble lord that amendment no <e> <s> aa addresses the same or very similar point <e> <s> these amendments seek to control the manner in which contracts are arranged between performers and those to whom they give exclusive recording contracts <e> <s> apart from the general controls against the making of recordings without the performers consent this is not a matter with which this bill is concerned <e> <s> it is entirely up to the performers and recording companies involved to decide what sort of contractual arrangements they enter into <e> <s> all the bill is doing in clauses to is provide that where someone does have an exclusive recording contract with a performer that person as well as the performer has certain rights against third parties who may record the contracted artists performances without consent <e>", "<cs> i was about to say that i shall study carefully in <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord for his comments <e> <s> the protection for performers provided by the existing performers protection acts is primarily a protection against unauthorised recording filming broadcasting and cable distribution of live performances and the term is not particularly significant in that context <e>", "<cs> i do not have that information with me <e> <s> i shall find out and write to the noble lord <e> <s> i shall send a copy to the noble lord lord jenkins of putney and place one in the library <e>", "<cs> the purpose of subsection is merely to make it clear that consent may cover any grouping of performances past or future which the owner of the relevant rights considers convenient <e> <s> the provision is permissive not mandatory and in no way obliges performers or persons having recording rights to give consent to use of their performances generally <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lords lord williams and lord tordoff <e> <s> clause deals with forfeiture and delivery up as already explained <e> <s> in circumstances where a person has illicit recordings in his possession custody or control and an order is made against him that they can be forfeited and delivered up he would at that point become aware that they were illicit even if he did not know before <e> <s> for the convenience of the committee i should say that i am also speaking to the amendments spoken to by the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> i shall also speak to amendment no <e> <s> ac <e>", "<cs> that will be a matter for the courts <e> <s> what happens in any circumstance is impossible to say <e> <s> all we can provide for is the possibility of seizure <e> <s> i suppose ultimately in those circumstances he must desist and take the matter to the courts <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> for the convenience of the committee i shall speak also to amendments nos <e> <s> a and b <e>", "<cs> i spoke to this amendment when dealing with a previous grouping <e> <s> however it may be helpful to the noble lord if i repeat what i said in relation to the purpose of this amendment <e>", "<cs> this amendment would remove the defence of innocence in a case where someone represented falsely that he was authorised to give consent in relation to a performance for purposes of part ii <e> <s> it would not be reasonable or just to subject someone to the penalties under this clause possibly including imprisonment who had genuine reason to believe that he had authority to consent to say the broadcasting or recording of a performance and gave such a consent mistakenly <e> <s> we could not accept that proposition which runs counter to natural justice <e>", "<cs> i do not think it is wise or necessary to write into the bill a reference to a particular international convention unless some provision of the bill positively depends on or is linked to membership of that convention <e> <s> the content and membership of international conventions changes over the years and the rome convention may not necessarily remain the main convention providing for protection of performers <e> <s> the bill allows other countries to be designated as qualifying countries for purposes of part ii on a reciprocal basis <e> <s> i can assure your lordships unequivocally that all rome member states will be so designated if and to the extent that they adequately protect british performances as by definition they almost certainly will do <e>", "<cs> we had a long debate on th december last monday on a similar proposal regarding extension of copyright law <e> <s> i do not think that i need repeat everything that was said on that occasion by my noble friend lord dundee since the arguments are exactly the same <e> <s> i am aware that we did not appear to convince all of the members of the committee who were present on that occasion but we continue to believe that it would not be appropriate to extend these provisions to aircraft concerned with exploration of the seabed or to all british registered ships and aircraft <e>", "<cs> i covered this point when dealing with amendment no <e> <s> aa <e> <s> i then spoke to various amendments including amendments nos <e> <s> bca and bda <e> <s> i refer the noble lord to that reply which i think he will find covers the point <e> <s> i shall not go through the case again if that is acceptable to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> we felt it advisable to provide a general definition in the clause of the meaning of for private purposes because there is no general definition in part i the only occasion on which that expression is used in part i is in clause where it is defined in the same terms as in this clause <e> <s> by contrast the expression is used in several cases in part ii namely clauses and <e>", "<cs> we think that in some cases it might be useful

"<cs> amendment no <e> <s> zda in the name of the noble lord lord jenkins of putney would substitute the word unintentional for the word incidential in sub-paragraph <e> <s> that is almost exactly the same point as was made in relation to clause by amendment no <e> <s> which the committee debated on th december and the same arguments apply <e> <s> the point is embroidered to some extent by the noble lords amendment no <e> <s> db <e> <s> with his agreement i shall speak also to that amendment and amendment no <e> <s> bc at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords this governments policies will continue to assist in the social and economic development of the northern region <e> <s> we remain committed to policies which will encourage wealth creation and increase prosperity in the region

friend <e> <s> ministers have frequently made it clear that they have no intention of reviewing the assisted areas map in the foreseeable future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the bow groups assertion but i would say in reply to the noble lord that corporation tax in this country is now one of the lowest in the developed world <e>", "<cs> my lords i should say to the noble lord that the level of spending in particular areas will as now depend on the number of good projects which come forward from those areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams of elvel for his reception of the order <e> <s> i take note of what he said as regards the actt proposal but the british screen finance corporation has substantially more funds than were available to its predecessor the national film finance corporation which invested in feature films and shorts <e> <s> in addition projects have received loans under the project development scheme <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord will agree that that represents an impressive level of activity considering that the british screen finance corporation has been operational for only two years <e>", "<cs> speaking from a governmental point of view we will be looking at the various proposals that come forward <e> <s> i cannot say that it will be used for production but i believe that a number of proposals will be put to us <e>", "<cs> first of all i think i should say to my noble friend lord mottistone that i am not going to offer to withdraw this part of the bill because i believe there are very good reasons for retaining it <e>", "<cs> the point here essentially is what should design right protect <e> <s> as drafted the bill covers shape and configuration and in this respect it is an archetypal design right <e> <s> it protects the way things look and not what they are made of or how they work <e>", "<cs> for the convenience of the committee i shall also speak to amendments nos <e> <s> x bz and all of which essentially concern the exceptions to design right contained in clause <e> <s> the best known of those provisions appears in clause b and c and are perhaps more often referred to as the must-fit and must-match exceptions to design right <e> <s> the reason they appear in the bill is probably well known to the committee <e> <s> it is to prevent design right conferring a monopoly <e> <s> the problem is that where one article has to fit another it must of necessity be a copy of the design of that other article to some extent <e> <s> that is of particular but by no means exclusive application to spare parts used to repair equipment of all kinds <e> <s> because of the need to fit and hence the need to copy design right without these provisions could completely shut competitors out <e> <s> i have to say very firmly that this is not what we want <e> <s> accordingly the exceptions allow copying where that is compelled by design constraints <e>", "<cs> for the convenience of the committee i shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> <e> <s> c ha and hb <e> <s> i shall occasionally perhaps allude to amendment no <e> <s> a in the name of the noble lord lord lloyd <e> <s> these amendments concern ownership of the rights in designs <e> <s> we devoted some time to the provisions of clause of the bill when we discussed employed and commissioned authors <e> <s> i indicated that we place considerable reliance on the ability of the parties to override the provisions on first ownership of copyright by assignment <e> <s> the same is true of both design right and registered design rights <e> <s> it is for this reason that the provisions of clauses and on the ownership of the rights in commissioned and employee designs can both be overridden by assignment <e> <s> i should however say a few words about the differences in the treatment of copyright and design rights in the bill <e>", "<cs> for the convenience of the committee i should like to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and az both of which deal with the term of design right protection <e> <s> any period selected for an intellectual property right is necessarily somewhat arbitrary <e> <s> nevertheless there are a number of factors which lead us to the view that years in the market subject to an upper limit of years from the creation of a design strikes the right balance <e>", "<cs> i have already responded to the noble lords amendment no <e> <s> bz <e> <s> i repeat myself by saying that we find here a different recipe for dealing with the monopoly effects of design right in the absence of must fit and must match exceptions <e> <s> i have already indicated that we believe the must fit and must match exceptions are necessary <e> <s> therefore i resist this amendment <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> za and za also <e> <s> the paris convention provides for the protection of various categories of intellectual property including aesthetic but not functional designs <e> <s> it requires each contracting state to give the same protection to nationals and residents of the other contracting states as it gives to its own <e> <s> it will therefore be necessary for the united kingdom to give design right protection to aesthetic designs created by nationals and residents of other contracting states <e> <s> this obligation will arise regardless of whether another contracting state provides equivalent protection for designs <e>", "<cs> i repeat that the paris convention provides for the protection of various categories of intellectual property including aesthetic but not functional designs <e>", "<cs> that is a very reasonable course of action <e> <s> on that basis we shall consider whether we are actually standing on the same playing field let alone deciding where the goalposts are <e>", "<cs> clause merely provides for the assignment of right in a design which has not yet been created or in a design for which rights do not yet exist <e> <s> the latter case covers those designs which will qualify for protection under the terms of clause which have not yet been put on the market <e> <s> the assignment of future rights has an important part to play in the context of the ownership of the rights in an employee or commissioned design as we have discussed <e>", "<cs> i have just said so <e> <s> i am not quite clear what the noble lord is getting at <e>", "<cs> i misheard the noble lord <e> <s> i thought he asked why i did not say so <e>", "<cs> having cleared up that slight misunderstanding i think that the noble lord has a point <e> <s> we will look at it and take note of what he has said <e>", "<cs> the amendment of my noble friend lord campbell would delete subsection b of clause which provides that reproduction is <e>", "<cs> i do not want to enter the argument as to whose amendment this is <e> <s> i do not accept that there should be any difficulty with our argument that the courts are familiar with the term reproduction in the sphere of design right <e> <s> it has been applied in other intellectual property for many years <e> <s> i would say to my noble friend lord campbell that the new right uses concepts which already exist in intellectual property law and reproduction is one of them <e> <s> my point was that the courts will apply this concept with no difficulty <e>", "<cs> the overlap between copyright and design right occurs in cases where a design is first recorded in a copyright work such as a design drawing <e> <s> the committee will recall that in part i of the bill clause cuts back copyright in this area by <e>", "<cs> having heard what the noble lords lord monkswell and lord williams have said i emphasise that it is the intention that copyright should prevail where there is an overlap so there would be no question of a back-door reduction of copyright <e> <s> that is the intention <e> <s> however we are fully aware that there may be some valid criticism of the wording of the clause <e>", "<cs> this clause provides an exception to design right in cases where an application for a patent covering a design is made by or with the consent of the design right owner <e> <s> the essence of a patent is that it is a monopoly granted in return for the disclosure of an invention <e> <s> it is inherent in the bargain struck between the inventor and the state that subject only to the patent monopoly everyone should be free to use and learn from the disclosure of the invention <e> <s> we therefore decided that a provision is necessary to ensure that any design right cannot be used to prevent the patent being fully and freely worked for example where the patent monopoly lapses <e>", "<cs> clause concerns licences of right and is one of the more significant provisions on design right <e> <s> in this respect the approach of my noble friend lord mottistone is very straightforward <e> <s> he has said that licences of right effectively reduce the term of design right and should not be included <e> <s> while it is of course true to say that licences of right reduce the strength of the protection it is if i may say so too extreme to say that they reduce the term <e> <s> even <e>", "<cs> i have explained why we believe that clause is necessary especially in regard to the possible necessity to exclude certain aspects <e> <s> however i cannot agree with the noble lord that licences of right <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e> <s> on the point that he raised about the use of the word facts and whether facts can operate i would point out that in clause aii the wording is that used in the fair trading act <e> <s> that is precisely why we have used it here <e>", "<cs> the use of the term public interest is very much based on section of the patents act <e> <s> however i take the point that there is other legislation that impinges on this matter <e> <s> we shall carefully consider that issue <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord lucas for raising this matter <e> <s> there are some problems with the drafting in his amendment but i probably understood the thrust of it correctly <e> <s> i am sure he will tell me if i have not <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord monkswell was quite right when he surmised that i should not necessarily go along with some of the terminology that was used nevertheless i assure him that i certainly do not take offence at the words military dictatorship even though he may have noted some surprise in my expression when he did use them <e>", "<cs> i must say that i believe the noble lord has reached an amazing conclusion <e> <s> no doubt the ministry of defence anticipates the demand for particular components and spare parts and no doubt they are covered in contracts <e> <s> i am speaking of the exceptional case over and above the normal requirements for spare parts or extra components and not cases where a particular supply requirement has been omitted <e> <s> that conclusion should not be drawn at all <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lords lord williams of elvel and lord tordoff for accepting the argument that i put forward regarding the armed forces <e> <s> without commitment i am prepared to see whether the clause as drafted is too wide on this point <e> <s> i take notice of the example given by the noble lord lord williams of a department that has nothing to do with or is unlikely to have anything to do with the argument that i have put forward concerning the armed forces <e> <s> it is on that basis that we shall look at the matter again without commitment <e> <s> if something can be put forward by the government we shall return to the matter at a later date <e>", "<cs> i should like to make clear to my noble friend the fact that i do not intend to look at the matter in respect of defence or the armed forces <e> <s> i believe that that argument has been accepted by the committee and i can make no suggestion to my noble friend that i shall look at the matter in respect of the armed forces <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has raised a good point <e> <s> it is true that clause is based on the provisions of the patents act <e> <s> it is also true that his amendment would include a provision which is to be found in the act but not in clause of the bill <e> <s> i must say that at first sight i have some sympathy with his view <e>", "<cs> for the convenience of the committee i was going to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> a and which is what i believe my noble friend lord mottistone has already done <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has made his point <e> <s> the whole committee would agree that we are here to consider intellectual property <e> <s> i understand what the noble lord has to say about consumer safety <e> <s> nothing is more important than consumer safety <e> <s> we already have a considerable body of legislation on consumer safety and the terms of the new bill when it becomes an act will in no way detract from the rigorous standards that are already embodied in our law <e>", "<cs> i regret that i cannot agree either with my noble friend or with the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e>", "<cs> i shall speak to amendment no <e> <s> ab in the names of the noble lord lord williams of elvel and the noble lord lord morton of shuna and to amendment no <e> <s> b which stands in my name <e> <s> both amendments concern transitional provisions for the registered designs act <e> <s> clause would exclude from registration two categories of designs which have hitherto been registerable <e>", "<cs> we have received submissions from the british agrochemicals association and a group of research-based agrochemical companies arguing that patents for pesticides like pharmaceutical patents should be removed from the scope of schedule of the act licence of right provisions <e> <s> there are however aspects of the case put to us that require further clarification <e> <s> we are in touch with the british agrochemicals association on this but are not at present able to make a decision <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> following a decision in <e>", "<cs> i cannot agree with the noble lord that that was retroactive <e> <s> he is entitled to his opinion and we are entitled to ours but i feel that that aspect of the act was not in fact retroactive <e>", "<cs> the governments intention behind removing pharmaceutical patents from the scope of the schedule licence of right provisions of the patents act was to compensate the owners of these patents for significant delays in obtaining marketing approval for pharmaceuticals <e> <s> these days on average approximately years of a pharmaceuticals patent term will have expired before the pharmaceutical can be marketed <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord lord monkswell will not be surprised if i do not take up again his invitation to debate the matters of consumer safety drug testing or licences of right <e> <s> however i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams of elvel and i think that we are more likely to find common ground on the clause in the context of the amendment put forward by the noble lord lord rea than on the suggestion to recycle extra revenue into further rd <e> <s> perhaps the matter will become clearer when we have responded fully to that amendment <e>", "<cs> for the convenience of the committee i shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> a to n excluding amendment no <e> <s> f which was spoken to earlier by my noble friend <e> <s> we believe that amendments nos <e> <s> b and d proposed by the noble lord will not have the effect that he desires <e> <s> instead we believe that they

that purpose <e> <s> this could lead a prosecution to fail merely because the defendant made or intended to make an unusual use of material <e>", "<cs> i fully understand the purpose of this amendment <e> <s> it is to sanction the practice known as character merchandising that is the granting of a licence by a person who has created for example a childrens cartoon character allowing the use of that character as a trade mark on goods such as clothing or toys <e> <s> this is of course a practice undreamt of at the time of the act <e>", "<cs> i was not quite sure what the noble lord intended by this amendment <e> <s> read literally it would cause the title to refer to a design right in trade marks <e> <s> this of course does not make sense <e> <s> i assume that his concern is to ensure proper mention of trade marks but this is already achieved in lines trade mark agents and fraudulent application or use of a trade mark and no other provisions in the bill relate to trade marks <e>",

differences of perception <e> <s> completing the single market will mean that there are a large number of individual measures which member states will have to negotiate and decide <e> <s> we cannot

impose any extra taxes <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said that we will make no commitment in order to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has a good point <e> <s> there is an existing derogation and we expect to be discussing the position with the commission in the coming months <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will recall that i answered a question on that point towards the end

matter of trying to get some european standards <e>", "<cs> my lords uk industry has generally welcomed the toy safety proposal because it will provide a common set of requirements throughout the

seem to be fixed are the goalposts in this particular debate <e> <s> i should just like to address the points that noble lords have made <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has said the purpose of these amendments is to ensure that in the case of broadcasting by independent television the relevant programme contractor as well as the iba qualifies under clause as the person making the broadcast and therefore the first owner of copyright in it <e> <s> as the bill stands only the iba will qualify as the maker since that organisation alone not the contractor fulfils

as i read the amendments tabled by the noble lords lord williams of elvel and lord morton of shuna the director is to be regarded as a joint author although it is far from clear to me who is to be

does not revive copyright <e> <s> i hope that that is clear from the bill and perhaps the noble lord will accept that response <e> <s> i have listened to what the noble lord has said and i shall double check that point <e> <s> however i believe that the drafting is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to noble lords who have spoken in this short debate on amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble lord lord williams and also spoken to amendment no <e> <s> in my own name <e> <s> at the outset i should say that i believe there is some small measure of agreement between myself

where the noble lord and myself part company because he moves in one direction and the government move in the other <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee we discussed the question of who should own the copyright in commissioned works in connection with the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord howie of troon <e> <s> this amendment places a different emphasis on the matter <e> <s> i explained at committee stage that the current law is anomalous <e> <s> it is our view that the author should be the first owner of the copyright in a commissioned work <e> <s> it is always possible for the commissioner to acquire copyright contractually <e> <s> this amendment would reintroduce most of the substance of section of the act under which the commissioner owns copyright in respect of certain commissioned works with the addition of films <e> <s> a further proviso is that in the case of photographs and films this is to apply only where the subject is a person or an event of private character <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with interest to the argument put forward by the noble lord lord kilbracken <e> <s> he possibly went wrong when he described his suggestion as being perfectly simple <e> <s> i am sure that all of your lordhips will agree with me that nothing in copyright is perfectly simple it is a complicated matter <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments all address the very important question of the relationship of copyright to the electronic storage transmission and display of copyright works <e> <s> this relationship was extensively debated by your lordships in committee but it was clear that in certain respects there would be a need to return to the question <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way and with the leave of your lordships i should like to point out to the noble lord that we are on amendment no <e> <s> and i have spoken to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords clause as we have just amended it provides that the making of a photograph of the image on a television screen or of a single image of a film amounts to copying the television broadcast cable programme or film in question <e> <s> the reason for this is that clause a provides that for there to be infringement a substantial part of a work must be copied <e> <s> it is strongly arguable that a single frame from a two <e>", "<cs> my lords we are returning now to a matter that we discussed at length during committee and i am pleased to tell your lordships that the government have reached some firm conclusions on the question of rental <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do not believe that a longer period would be appropriate <e> <s> at the moment no rental right whatever exists and therefore copyright owners are without <e>", "<cs> my lords they may now have appeared in printed form but my noble friend had two very late amendments that we had to consider in manuscript form earlier on <e> <s> it is clear that they seek to put computer programs in a more favourable position than films or sound recordings and i can see no reason for that <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall speak to the same group of amendments as was spoken to by the noble lord lord morton <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i undertook in committee to look at everything he had said and we have indeed done that <e> <s> we looked at this carefully with the fullest possible consultation <e> <s> of course the noble lord has far greater experience than i have in dealing with these matters in the courts <e> <s> i can only say to him that we took that into account and we came to the conclusion that we have in the full knowledge of the noble lords considerable experience stuck at the point that we reached originally <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of your lordships i shall speak to amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran and to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i shall refrain at this point from speaking to the other two amendments that he mentioned <e> <s> i shall deal with those later <e>", "<cs> my lords i always take note of what the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran says or in this case to a certain extent what he has not said <e> <s> we shall look at what he said <e> <s> i cannot give any commitment whatsoever and i am sure that he would not expect me to do so <e> <s> i would say to my noble friend lord rodney that his amendment no <e> <s> seems entirely unnecessary on its own <e> <s> the expression supplies or deals with covers no more than is already covered by the expression sells or lets for hire <e> <s> i do not understand what extra is involved in the kind of package to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> i had expected to be speaking to a grouping of amendments which seem to make rather more sense taken as a group but i have to say that on its own in amendment no <e> <s> i see no merit whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall also speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> the amendments in the grouping are concerned with what i like other noble lords shall refer to as anti-spoiler devices <e> <s> these devices in some way circumvent security systems that are included in recording videograms or in recording and play back equipment intended to prevent or limit copying <e> <s> in last years consultation exercise we received representations that the bill should contain provision to render illegal the manufacture importation or sale of equipment intended to remove or otherwise avoid the effect of spoiler signals included in commercially produced copies of copyright material <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to what your lordships have had to say <e> <s> i say briefly to the noble lord lord howie that at committee stage there were a number of occasions on which i took away for consideration suggestions made by the noble lord <e> <s> lord kilbracken <e> <s> there were other occasions when i was unable to concede the point and take away points for consideration <e> <s> i believe that this is the kind of bill in which your lordships have a very important role to play in making sure that we send it away in the best possible form <e>", "<cs> my lords i must tell my noble friends that the government have not changed their views on this matter since i responded to the corresponding amendment debated at committee stage in your lordships house <e> <s> the effect of clause is that copyright cannot prevent importation of an article into the uk if the importer has the right to import the article under community law <e> <s> that is an inevitable consequence of community law and the subsection is there simply to ensure that the public are aware of the true legal situation <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords with these amendments we return to the question debated in committee as to whether there should be a general fair dealing exception <e> <s> i resisted the amendment tabled on that occasion by noble lords opposite because it opened the concept of fair dealing from within the confines of well defined purposes and set it at large <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with interest to what noble lords have said tonight about licensing schemes for commercial research <e> <s> i have to say that our concerns about the burdens that would be placed on industry have not been allayed by what has been said or by anything said to us by the publishers before this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of this amendment would be that those who make photocopies could not avail themselves of the fair dealing exception <e> <s> it is true that whitford made such a proposal <e> <s> but that was in the context of a statutory blanket licensing scheme <e> <s> thus all photocopying would be permitted under licence <e> <s> the amendment takes part of the whitford proposal without the other more essential ingredient with the result that all photocopying of copyright material for study or research would require the consent of the copyright owner unless done under one of the library exceptions in clauses and <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave i too shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall also speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> these amendments return to a question raised by the noble lord lord morton in committee <e> <s> on that occasion he proposed a new clause which would have provided a public interest defence in cases of copyright infringement <e> <s> whatever the merits of the case i have to say i think that was a more appropriate way of dealing with the point than in a subsection of a clause principally concerned with incidental inclusion <e> <s> a new clause is of course what the noble lord lord lloyd proposes in amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may continue and come back to that point in a moment <e> <s> as i said when we discussed this in committee there are formidable difficulties in defining the public interest and this amendment like its predecessor offers no help in that direction <e> <s> therefore the matter would be left to the courts as now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> that assists me in speaking to my own amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord williams of elvel has acknowledged this is a difficult area <e> <s> he asked me whether the presence of someone who was cleaning the floor in the location in which the performance was being given would constitute an infringement <e> <s> i do not believe that that would turn the performance into a public one <e> <s> however were there to be someone present who was there for a completely different purpose not related to the school that could be a marginal case <e> <s> as i have said it is difficult to define that borderline precisely <e> <s> however the way in which we have now phrased the bill if the amendment is accepted should solve the problems that were foreseen in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i should also like to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and and to amendment no <e> <s> in my name <e> <s> as my noble friend lord dundee explained in committee the purpose of clause is purely to ensure that very small-scale copying can always be carried out in educational establishments <e> <s> it is intended to cover situations where teachers need to copy small extracts of material from books and musical works for example in making compilations for teaching purposes and would but for this clause be prevented from doing so because copyright owners have failed for whatever reason to offer appropriate licences <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend lord mottistone will agree when i say that the provisions of the bill including clause represent a distinct improvement on the present law <e> <s> i take it that he welcomes the repeal of the first publication rule and accepts that copyright considerations cannot unduly obstruct crown business <e> <s> his concern as i understand it is that we have not gone far enough in cutting back the crowns position <e> <s> it is acceptable for the crown to be able to publish works which have been communicated to it for that purpose but that is where the line should be drawn <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> b and c <e> <s> i can say straightaway that i have a good deal of sympathy with amendments nos <e> <s> a b and c tabled in the name of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> these amendments seek to clarify clause in three respects <e> <s> first amendment no <e> <s> a is intended to make it quite clear that the question of whether or not we are dealing with an artistic work applies to the article as distinct from the design or the artistic work embodying the design <e> <s> secondly amendment no <e> <s> b is intended to make it quite clear that the copying of an article referred to in clause b includes the making of design documents and models <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> a would have the result that importation of an infringing typeface for use in the ordinary course of typing composing text typesetting or printing could constitute infringement of the copyright in the artistic work if the importation fell within the terms of clause <e> <s> possession of the typeface or its use would however remain non-infringing <e> <s> i have to say we have not had much time to consider this point since this amendment was tabled only yesterday <e> <s> it may be that my noble friend lord rodney has overlooked the provisions of subsection which ensure that importation of articles for producing material in a particular typeface such as a font of characters infringes the copyright if the purpose of importation is not use but dealing <e> <s> thus the printer who imports a font for use in his printing works does not infringe any more than he does when he uses the typeface <e> <s> however those who import infringing copies to sell to printers in the united kingdom knowing or having reason to believe they are infringing do not escape the provisions of clause <e>", "<cs> my lords clause provides that articles for producing material in a particular typeface may be copied years after such articles are first marketed <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> b would increase that period to the normal copyright term of life of author plus years <e> <s> the effect would be as if clause were left out <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i too shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and in the name of the noble lord <e> <s> lord kilbracken <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to answer the noble lord lord williams and say to him that once a copy has been lawfully made and issued under this new clause that copy may be subsequently dealt with without infringement because subsequent dealings could only be secondary infringement and that would depend on a primary infringement which of course is not committed under this clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we shall probably end up with the same result but i should prefer today to get the clause into the bill <e> <s> then we can look at it at third reading <e> <s> there is not very much difference between the two <e> <s> however on the basis that the thrust of the amendment is accepted and on the undertaking that i have given to consider whether it needs narrowing down or refining somewhat i think the course i have suggested might be acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords the exception to clause is of long-standing and so far as i am aware has operated to the benefit of clubs and societies without seriously damaging the interests of the record industry <e> <s> it is a fairly limited exception <e> <s> it can only be taken advantage of in respect of social or similar functions which are non-profit-making and organised for charitable or other closely defined purposes related to the public good and does not even extend to the broadcasting of a charity event <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with interest to the arguments of the noble lord lord hacking <e> <s> in the interests of brevity i should say to him that i think that the argument he puts forward is quite right <e> <s> but what we should also be looking at is the position of what are known as pop promos in pop videos where the visual effects are perhaps secondary to the musical score <e> <s> indeed the visual effects are a way of promoting the musical score <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of the amendment tabled by my noble friend would be to disapply the exception in clause in relation to commercial sound recordings and films leaving it to apply principally only in respect of recorded broadcasts not involving commercial films or recordings <e> <s> if the amendment were to be agreed to anyone playing a radio or tv set in a shop or pub would require licences from phonographic performance ltd ppl and from any film copyright owners involved as well as from as now the performing rights society <e> <s> the berne convention requires us to give composers a right in respect of public performance of broadcasts of recordings containing their work but convention requirements do not oblige us to extend this to makers of sound recordings provided they receive equitable remuneration in respect of the broadcast itself <e> <s> nor in our view does the convention require a right to be given to film-makers in respect of public showings of broadcasts containing their works <e> <s> that can be justified as a minor reservation recognised by the parties to the berne convention as a legitimate departure from its literal wording <e>", "<cs> my lords let me say to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs at the outset that the government have given high priority in ensuring that adequate arrangements exist to protect the consumer interest in privatised industries which have monopoly of power <e> <s> however there is no single pattern which can be applied in all cases and the needs vary from industry to industry <e> <s> for example the problems faced by gas consumers are of a different nature from those faced by telephone users <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> i was pointing out that there seems to be some inconsistency whether it is right or wrong is probably a matter of opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i cannot tell the noble lord tonight <e> <s> he may have sat through the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> it was before i came to your lordships house so i do not have knowledge of that <e> <s> but i shall find out and let him know <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now further considered on report <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would allow television broadcasts and cable programmes to be recorded for private purposes without infringement of copyright <e> <s> i find its placing in clause somewhat odd <e> <s> clause is concerned with the reception and retransmission of broadcasts in cable programmes <e> <s> with respect i venture to suggest to the noble lord that the amendment would sit more happily with clause <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is very difficult to please at times but it is not our intention to exclude designers or authors if you like of bridges and the other examples that he mentions <e> <s> we have looked at this and i understand that we are <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first respond to the points made by the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> he referred to the berne convention <e> <s> as he told the house the author has the right to claim authorship and i must emphasise the word claim <e> <s> the presence of a name on a book is no indication of a claim as i have explained <e> <s> the amendment in the name of the noble lords lord morton and lord williams of elvel is not required by the berne convention and i believe that it would confuse matters not help them <e>", "<cs> my lords with apologies to the noble lord and with the leave of the house let me say that in many cases the artist may not be claiming his moral rights <e> <s> certainly he may be identifying himself as the painter of the picture but there is absolutely no reason to believe that he is asserting the new moral rights that have been granted to him under this bill <e> <s> an artists signature will be an assertion of paternity right for the purpose of exhibition only and not for any other purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of your lordships i shall speak also to the amendments spelled out by my noble friend lord stockton <e> <s> we discussed in committee whether the moral rights provisions should apply to employees and in particular whether there should be special provisions for newspapers magazines periodicals and composite works <e> <s> many representations have been made to us and we have now had the opportunity to consider them and indeed all the arguments put forward in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment seeks to disapply the right of an author or director to be identified when a literary dramatic musical or artistic work is broadcast and that work has been <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened very carefully to the noble lord explaining this amendment which reflects two concerns of broadcasters <e> <s> the first concern is that the right not to suffer unjustified modification is subject to a double test which goes beyond the requirements of the berne convention <e> <s> the second concern is that it is unreasonable to allow authors or directors to invoke the right to prevent modifications to broadcasts when these have been required by a regulatory authority in pursuance of its statutory duties <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke to this amendment as did other noble lords earlier <e> <s> we are therefore having a re-run and a slight re-hash of the amendment this afternoon after what the noble lord lord morton of shuna described as a natural break <e> <s> we believe that giving employees and employed film directors the integrity right would cause practical problems <e> <s> the views of the government remain as expressed in committee on this point <e> <s> there are many instances where in the course of normal working practices work will be modified in some way <e> <s> we believe that it is only right the employer should be able to do this <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> a i shall speak also to amendments nos and <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham of edmonton seeks to prevent consent from being given except in writing <e> <s> i cannot accept such a proposition <e> <s> let us suppose an author writes a play <e> <s> shortly before its performance the producer telephones the author and asks if he can make certain cuts <e> <s> the author agrees <e> <s> there is no time to obtain consent in writing <e> <s> i believe that is the point made by the noble lord lord howie <e> <s> is the author then to be able to sue the producer for damages for breach of his integrity right <e> <s> it is an elementary proposition of law that a person cannot sue for damages in respect of anything to which he has consented whether the consent is signified in writing orally or by conduct <e> <s> this applies in contract law personal injury litigation the law of trespass and indeed copyright and i believe that moral rights should be no different <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be helpful if i clarify that we are speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> b a and b <e> <s> with the leave of your lordships i shall do the same <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments are identical to those tabled by the noble lord lord graham in committee and would make general waiver of moral rights applicable only in the context of the employer-employee relationship provided for in clause <e> <s> thus a freelance author or director would in effect have inalienable moral rights subject only to consent for particular acts <e> <s> given that the integrity right does not apply to employed authors and directors and the acceptance in principle of the amendment in the name of my noble friend lord stockton that will mean that the paternity right will not apply and these amendments will have nothing to kite on since there are no moral rights for the employee to waive <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord stockton has pointed out that although clause a purports to be a re-statement of section a of the act it omits the words set out in amendment no <e> <s> in the name of my noble friend <e> <s> the meaning of acts in clause a is no more than things which can be done <e> <s> there is nothing in the word to limit it to whole classes of acts corresponding to the five paragrapahs a to e in clause <e> <s> thus the explanatory wording required in the act which speaks of classes of acts not merely of acts would be superfluous <e>", "<cs> my lords we return now to a matter that we discussed in committee concerning the transmission of moral rights on death <e> <s> this amendment tabled by the noble lords lord morton of shuna and lord williams of elvel seeks to ensure that the moral rights of paternity and integrity do not lapse in cases where copyright does not form part of an estate and the moral rights themselves are not the subject of a specific bequest <e> <s> they will at least pass to the personal representatives of the deceased as the false attribution right already does under subsection of the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords with these amendments tabled in the name of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran i shall also speak with leave to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> they concern licensing arrangements for copyright works <e> <s> i believe that they spring from the particular concerns of the users of printed material who wish to make photocopies from hooks and periodicals and wish to do so on reasonable and clear terms <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendments in this grouping seek to extend the various provisions relating to delivery up and forfeiture of infringing copies to cover the delivery up of legitimate copies used for infringing purposes <e> <s> amendment nos and would create a new criminal offence in respect of broadcasting or cable diffusion without the copyright owners consent as well as a criminal sanction in respect of the new rental right <e> <s> again orders for delivery up of legitimate copies may be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord williams of elvel and lord lloyd of kilgerran for the welcome that they have given to the principle of these amendments <e> <s> i am not averse to looking at the detail <e> <s> indeed as your lordships know i welcome all constructive suggestions <e>", "<cs> yes i agree with that my lords <e> <s> street traders may not be legal experts probably they are not and of course the notice should be written in clear language which they can understand it should not be in language which would require them to employ a lawyer to interpret for them <e> <s> clear language is highly desirable <e> <s> i take the points made in that respect <e> <s> i hope that i have now answered the points that have been raised on this large group of amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords this subsection dealing with damages for the infringement of the moral right to claim authorship was amended in committee to show that damages could be given for loss of reputation but not for injured feelings <e> <s> it appears that the noble lord lord williams of elvel and the noble lord lord morton of shuna are not content with that change and would prefer there to be no restriction at all on the damages available for the infringement of moral rights <e>", "<cs> my lords our understanding is that there is no practical difference between section of the act and having nothing at all <e> <s> in other words i believe that the only choice is between clause as it stands and leaving it out <e> <s> it was the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran among others who was instrumental in persuading us that the latter course was right <e> <s> for that reason i seek to have the amendment accepted by your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords the term manager is a relic from earlier years when the organisational structure of companies tended to be different from what it is today <e> <s> it was once common for the board of directors of a company to delegate the running of the business of the company to a manager who would not himself have a seat on the board <e> <s> however in most modern companies the person or persons responsible for running the business of the company are likely to have been appointed to the board of directors <e> <s> as a result in most cases a person who falls within the term manager will anyway fall within a provision of the type under discussion by virtue of being a director i think that the point that the noble lord raised about manager being <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the point of the noble lord but i wish to put on record the origins of the word manager <e> <s> i believe that the word manager is well understood <e> <s> i am not sure whether or not the term is defined in the companies act <e> <s> if we feel that it is necessary to have a definition in this bill of the word manager we will immediately set about drafting a suitable amendment <e> <s> however the expression manager has been defined by the courts as referring only to senior management and i believe that we will have to rely on case law here because there will be so many different circumstances and perhaps it will have to he left to the courts to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat that the courts have no difficulty in deciding who constitutes a manager within a business or company <e> <s> as i said to the noble lord there will be so many different instances and it may well be that it is difficult or impossible to define exactly who constitutes a manager within a certain company <e> <s> i think that the pandoras box to which the noble lord referred has probably already been opened by many other acts which are phrased in the same terms <e>", "<cs> my lords an identical amendment was tabled but not moved in committee <e> <s> the effect would be to allow customs and excise to seize infringing copies which are not in printed form computer programs being the most obvious example <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that i answer at this dispatch box for the government of the united kingdom not the united states <e> <s> the resources available to our customs and excise are what i have to take into account <e> <s> we shall endeavour to do the best we can within the resources available <e> <s> any further burden upon customs and excise would not be acceptable to the government at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said we have very carefully revised and reviewed the earlier drafting <e> <s> i believe that in this case the order of events mentioned by the noble lord is entirely unimportant <e> <s> they must be the way round now expressed in the amendment so as to give the expression other terms some sensible meaning <e> <s> i do not believe that a tribunal or a court would be influenced by the order <e> <s> the two paragraphs are of practically equal status <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving the amendment the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has drawn attention to the special needs of broadcasters in the situation where a licence to use for example the music controlled by the performing right society has expired without agreement being reached on the terms of a new licence <e> <s> i understand that such situations have indeed arisen on several occasions in the past and have been dealt with satisfactorily by the performing right tribunal <e>", "<cs> my lords the argument that copyright owners should not be forced to suffer expropriation of their rights is a powerful one and indeed the whole purpose of this bill is to prevent that <e> <s> but it is really going too far to say that an order made by the secretary of state under clause would impose expropriation on rights owners <e> <s> the circumstances in which such an order may he made are circumscribed <e> <s> it may be made only where an inquiry has taken place under clause and has resulted in a recommendation for a new licensing scheme or general licence <e> <s> even if the order is made it does not apply once a certified licensing scheme has been established in accordance with the recommendation or once there is a general licence which has been granted referred to the tribunal or offered to educational establishments and refused by them without a reference <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment standing in the name of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran deals with the question of qualification for moral rights <e> <s> it would allow orders in council to be made disapplying the moral rights provisions from authors or film directors of countries which do not give moral rights to uk authors and directors <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships leave i shall speak also to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> as regards amendments nos <e> <s> and we debated this issue extensively at committee stage both on clause and on clause <e> <s> we promised then that despite our reservations we would look further at the possibility of extending at least parts i and ii of the bill to ships and aircraft registered in the united kingdom <e> <s> this we have been doing <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave i shall also speak to the group of amendments as specified by the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e> <s> all of these are concerned with the classes of work that should be covered by clause <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend says that it certainly should and i say to him that it certainly would <e> <s> i think that is <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it difficult to answer that question without further notice of the circumstances that the noble lord lord williams has in mind <e> <s> however as regards the basic principle yes such a performance would be protected by crown copyright <e> <s> there may be some exceptions in circumstances which we could imagine <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> both these amendments were moved in committee and were withdrawn when i indicated that i could not accept them <e> <s> i am afraid that the passage of time has not made me any more favourably inclined to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first say to the noble lord lord willis that this amendment is grouped with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> with the leave of the house and if it is acceptable to the noble lord i will speak to both amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that that is not the case <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i believe the noble lord asked me about a board minute <e> <s> a board minute would not be invalidated if it had not been sealed <e> <s> on the other hand the noble lord referred to the matter of assignment of copyright and the answer is that the seal may be affixed but it does not have to be <e>", "<cs> my lords since we debated in committee rather similar amendments moved by the noble lord lord tordoff we have discussed the issue with the broadcasting organisations <e> <s> they have explained to us that one of their main concerns is the possibility that performers who have consented to having their performance recorded or filmed might nonetheless invoke rights under the bill to prevent further reproductions of the original fixation from being made without their consent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure why this amendment was not grouped with the previous one <e>", "<cs> my lords there could be all sorts of explanations but i am sure that my noble friend is not responsible for groupings at this late hour <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment standing in the names of the noble lords <e> <s> lord williams of elvel and lord morton of shuna provides that rights and performances may be dealt with in the same way as copyright <e> <s> it seems to me that the amendment stands of falls with amendment no <e> <s> to clause

morton that the word commonplace does not have a precise meaning <e> <s> nevertheless we believe that in the context of this bill it will provide a perfectly comprehensible and workable threshold for design right <e> <s> in our view the meaning which would be given to the term original if this were not qualified that is something which is the creators own work and not a copy is too generous a test for the acquisition of design right <e> <s> to put it in an extreme form it could allow someone to acquire a right for re-inventing i should really say re-designing the wheel <e> <s> our intention is to avoid giving design right to mundane routine designs of the kind which are common currency in the particular field in question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> i shall look into his suggestion because particularly with a bill of this nature it could perhaps simplify proceedings in your lordships house <e> <s> perhaps i may add that from time to time it would be helpful to know whether or not an opposition amendment is a probing amendment <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like just to clarify whether we are also speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> with the leave of the house i also shall speak to amendment no <e> <s> as well as to this amendment <e> <s> perhaps i may just say by way of a preamble that there is an unfortunate relationship between the drafting of the noble lords amendments and that of amendment no <e> <s> to which your lordships have just agreed <e> <s> if the present amendments were to be accepted the result would be that no one would be the first owner of design right in commissioned designs <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a complicated area <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams knows that design right protects all original designs of all articles without registration and that the registered design provisions protect new aesthetic designs of articles <e> <s> however the bill restricts this to articles whose aesthetic appearance is significant but a shape in the grey area may be covered by two rights at once <e> <s> however i believe that clauses and resolve any problem of this overlap area <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall also speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> listening to the debate on this point in your lordships house i certainly agree that the government find themselves in the middle of an argument that has very strong advocates on both sides <e> <s> but in speaking to my noble friends amendments it seems to us that there are first some drafting problems particularly in cases where first marketing occurs more than years after a design is first recorded in a material form <e> <s> in such cases the two amended paragraphs of clause would give conflicting results <e> <s> nevertheless my noble friends aim is clear and he will not i think be surprised when i tell him that i am not able to accept an increase in the duration of design right <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting point <e> <s> i should have to look at it rather more carefully <e> <s> there would no doubt be a number of different circumstances for each different occasion <e> <s> we shall be discussing more fully later in the bill the terms of the crowns rights in these matters <e> <s> i shall look into what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> as i understand it the problem arises where most of the design features of a particular product do not attract design right for example because they are must-fit or indeed must-match features <e> <s> in such a case there may be a few remaining features which form only a small proportion of the product but which could not be copied <e> <s> the solution put forward by the noble lord lord alport is to deny design right protection to the design of features which do not constitute a substantial part of the product as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall speak also to amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord stockton for raising the issue of the meaning of the term reproduction because it is clearly very important that we know exactly what will and what will not constitute a reproduction of a protected design <e> <s> if i understood my noble friend correctly he fears that because there is no explicit indication that <e>", "<cs> my lords we were somewhat mystified as to the intention behind this amendment <e> <s> if read literally its breadth is staggering <e> <s> it would include within the definition of infringing article articles imported from another member state the manufacture or sale of which was contrary to the laws of that member state regardless of whether any design right would have been infringed if the articles had been made in the united kingdom <e> <s> in addition the noble lords amendment places no restriction at all on which community laws should be considered <e> <s> we therefore have the spectre of for example an article being held to be an infringing article because its making contravened say the health and safety laws the planning laws or as the noble lord lord morton said some obscure religious laws or preference in another community country <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord agrees that that perhaps goes too far <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understand my noble friend correctly he is concerned that clause is not only a presumption that allegedly infringing articles were made when design right subsisted but also a presumption that design right does or did exist <e> <s> this proposition is demonstrably incorrect <e> <s> perhaps i may refer my noble friend to the first line-and-a-half of clause which require it to be shown that an article is made to a design in which design right subsists or has subsisted <e> <s> what this clearly means is that the design-right owner must riot only show that there is or has been a design right but also that the allegedly infringing articles were made to that design <e> <s> once the design-right owner has proved his case on these two points but only then will clause come into play <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not wish to be admonished by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for pre-empting his later identical amendment but on this occasion perhaps he will be agreeable if i also speak to his amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord and i am sure that it will be for the benefit of the house if we expedite these discussions by grouping these similar amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall also speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> perhaps i may deal first with my noble friends amendments nos <e> <s> and which would ensure that licences of right would be available only where a design right had been abused <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave i shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> to and and which all concern the crown use provisions <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for so fully explaining the thrust of his own amendments <e> <s> when we discussed these provisions in committee it was generally agreed that a crown use power was necessary for defence purposes but i agreed then to consider whether the general power presently provided in the bill was justified <e> <s> we have a great deal of sympathy with the <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord stockton is concerned that the restriction of clause to actual disputes is too narrow <e> <s> at first sight he does seem to have a point <e> <s> it may well be possible to say that for example someone who wishes to manufacture articles which are apparently protected by design right but who has been unable to trace the design right owner cannot possibly be a party to a dispute because there is no one for him to be in dispute with <e> <s> i am afraid however that his suggestion will not work <e> <s> if there is a dispute between two parties its resolution can be binding on both <e> <s> if however there is no dispute but only an assertion by one person against no one in particular the confirmation of his assertion will bind no one else which makes that confirmation worthless <e> <s> to be more specific if the manufacturer of articles to a design obtains a ruling from the comptroller binding on no one else and the owner of the design right then turns up that owner will not be bound by that ruling and will still be able to sue the manufacturer for infringement so the manufacturer will be no better off <e>", "<cs> my lords by way of reply to the noble lords lord lloyd of kilgerran and lord morton of shuna i would say that the bill as drafted without this amendment would mean that design right owners could say little more than that a design is protected by design right <e> <s> we believe that it is necessary that they are able to make the position clear to the sources of infringing articles in both strong and unambiguous terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord williams will not be too surprised if i say that we do not intend to go entirely down the road that he has suggested <e> <s> he will know that we have worked on the provisions of this part of the bill for some time and we believe that they are entirely appropriate <e> <s> design right is part of the policy of this bill <e> <s> as regards the interjection from the noble lord lord howie of troon the government amendments standing in my name would modify the must match exception in the same way as in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords as usual with the bill before us at the moment not very much of it is perfectly simple <e> <s> however when we discussed at committee stage subsection of the proposed new section of the registered designs act the noble lord lord morton of shuna questioned the meaning of the words to a material extent which my noble friend is now seeking to delete <e> <s> i accept that the words are open to interpretation but i do not accept that they are unnecessary <e> <s> nor can i accept that they are in any sense confusing nor that they will unduly prevent designs of things like telephones or even farm tractors and scientific instruments from being registered <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether any representations were made <e> <s> however as the noble lord well knows we are always open to suggestions <e> <s> we are always looking at the bill as it goes through its procedures in your lordships house in order to effect any possible improvements <e> <s> the noble lord will know that we listen with care to comments that he and all other noble lords make <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say to the noble lord lord williams that this schedule is known as a keeling schedule a point made by my noble friend <e> <s> that is a device that is frequently used <e> <s> however the act will continue to be known by its existing name <e>", "<cs> my lords an identical amendment was indeed moved in committee by the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> the issue of foreign competition and reciprocal access to overseas markets was first raised with the government by the chartered institute of patent agents early last year before any final announcement of the governments plans for legislation had been made <e> <s> it was given most careful consideration at that time and the subject has been raised again on several occasions since <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendments seek to reverse the effect of government amendments fully debated and agreed to in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords clause provides that unauthorised use of the reserved title is to be an offence and lays down a penalty that we think appropriate <e> <s> it is also consistent with the penalty in existing law for unauthorised practice as a patent agent <e> <s> to involve the trade descriptions act as the amendment seeks to do would have wider implications and should not be provided for in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure why the amendment has been tabled <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall also speak to amendments nos <e> <s> k and <e> <s> perhaps i may deal first with amendments nos <e> <s> k and <e> <s> in committee my noble friend lord dundee explained the intended scope of subsection of clause <e> <s> his explanation can be found in <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall speak also to amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> the substance of clause is not new <e> <s> the patents act and the registered designs act both have provisions along similar lines and these are being replaced by clause <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would change clause in that it would result in an agent who concerned himself only with service marks and not with trade marks being able to obtain registration as a trade mark agent <e> <s> however it is almost inconceivable that an agent would limit his practice in this way and as a result it seems unnecessary to clutter up the subsection with these extra words <e> <s> i therefore resist the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any reason why the present structure of capital taxation should encourage insider trading <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i follow the noble lords logic <e> <s> no doubt many investors wish to make gains and perhaps wish to make them in the short term <e> <s> but that is absolutely no reason to say that they wish to make profits from insider dealing <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall look into this and find out whether figures are available <e> <s> the fact is that the financial services act provided for new powers of investigation of insider dealing and for certain substantive amendments to the insider dealing legislation <e> <s> your lordships will be aware that the stock exchange introduced computer assisted surveillance in and i believe that that together with the possibility of investigation by inspectors means that the chances of detection and successful prosecution in such cases are much enhanced <e>", "<cs> my lords it is in no ones interest for any such investigation to be rather slow or tardy in coming to a conclusion <e> <s> however i can say to the noble lord that my noble friend the secretary of state naturally wishes that inspectors making such investigations should report to him as quickly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether i completely follow the noble lord in that opinion but i would say to your lordships that the criminal justice bill which is now in another place seeks to increase the maximum term of imprisonment that can be imposed on someone convicted of insider dealing from two years to seven years <e> <s> that makes it an arrestable offence and an extradition crime <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> as i said earlier to the noble lord i believe that the ability of the stock exchange to detect instances of insider dealing has been enhanced by computer assisted surveillance <e> <s> i also believe that the collection of evidence has been made very much easier <e> <s> the appointment of inspectors to look into such allegations is a great step forward <e> <s> i think that it is still too early to say exactly what impact the financial services act has had on our ability to bring those guilty parties to court and have it is hoped a successful conclusion if they are found guilty <e> <s> at the moment we have no plans to amend the provisions in the financial services act and i believe that we are making progress in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords from the cities put forward the european commission provisionally short listed four early last year <e> <s> these were london the hague madrid and munich <e> <s> since then it has not taken the matter further but its next step will be to make a proposal about location to the council of ministers and it may do this in the near future <e> <s> however it will be for the council to make the decision and it is not bound to accept the commissions proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will be aware that the decision will take into account all factors <e> <s> the government recognise the benefits of having the ec trade marks office in london and hence we are ready to support it with a financial package <e> <s> he may have noticed the necessary enabling clause which is clause of the copyright designs and patents bill in your lordships house a bill with which he is somewhat familiar <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the decision will take all factors into account <e> <s> it is not just a matter of money <e> <s> i think that all in your lordships house will agree that such a decision should not become just an auction <e> <s> i assure noble lords that the government will pursue with vigour the uk hid to house the ec trade marks office in london <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble and learned friend that the government will indeed make this omission very clear to the commission in our continuing negotiations to try to have the office located in london <e>", "<cs> my lords it is less than a year since the department of trade and industry completed a years campaign to encourage uk manufacturers and commercial concerns to look more seriously at the nordic market including finland <e> <s> uk exports to finland in were per cent <e> <s> higher than a year earlier <e> <s> no further campaign is at present planned but a full range of help is given by the government export services and finland is one of only five west european countries that are eligible for financial support for group business visits under the departments outward mission scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of my noble friends keen interest in anglo-finnish trade <e> <s> there are plans for ministerial visits involving finland <e> <s> for example the finnish minister for foreign trade will be visiting this country on rd to th may this year and my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland will be visiting finland on th may to st june <e> <s> i cannot tell my noble friend when the most recent visit by a british <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell your lordships that in there was a balance favourable to finland in trade between this country and finland of million <e> <s> but i should say that approximately per cent <e> <s> of finnish exports to this country consist of paper and pulp products <e> <s> if one excludes paper and pulp products the trade between the two countries is almost even <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i would necessarily make that connection <e> <s> in fact finlands trade with the soviet union has fallen very considerably in the past few years which of course has made it much more important for finland to develop other markets <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly pass on the noble lords comment to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> i should point out to your lordships that the project that the noble lord has in mind the caledonian paper mill will indeed create new jobs and another indirect jobs in the construction and forestry industries <e>", "<cs> my lords the geneva conventions act already makes it a criminal offence to use the emblem of the red cross without the authority of the defence council <e> <s> the act also makes it a criminal offence to use without the authority of the secretary of state for trade and industry or the board of trade any design or wording so nearly resembling the red cross emblem that it could be mistaken for or understood as referring to it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the red cross emblem has a very important role to play in time of war <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships will all agree with me that we have a high regard for the work of the red cross and attach great importance to the protection provided for it by the geneva convention <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have details as to how other international emblems or symbols are protected <e> <s> however the existence of the laws which were adopted in this country under the regulations adopting the geneva conventions act emphasises the importance which we all attach to the red cross itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that there is a limit to the comment which i can make on that question <e> <s> the matter is being considered by the director of public prosecutions and until he has made up his mind that is as far as i can go <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord is jumping the gun a bit <e> <s> naturally it is important that the emblem of the red cross should be protected <e> <s> that is why the geneva convention is so precise on that subject <e> <s> i am aware that the labour party has written to the red cross undertaking that in future it will not use any more material containing a symbol which is similar to the one which has been used in that particular campaign <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that we ought to hijack the national emblem of australia either <e> <s> as i said earlier i can make no comment while the matter is being considered by the dpp <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can say to that is that i run up the white flag <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already said i am sure that all your lordships would concur with that <e>", "<cs> my lords that may or may not be so <e> <s> however i assume that the royal crown is not protected by the geneva convention <e> <s> that is rather more central to the question which i am answering today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that they are protected <e> <s> perhaps i should also say to the noble baroness that it is open to the red cross to take any civil proceedings which it may wish to take <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now further considered on report <e>", "<cs> my lords when this amendment was tabled in committee i explained that we were unable to take a position on it at that time <e> <s> this was because clarification was needed on certain aspects of the case put to us by the research-based agrochemicals industry <e> <s> the industry was aware that the case for exempting pharmaceutical patents from licences of right had been accepted on the basis of data showing a substantial increase in the time taken to obtain marketing approval thus decreasing the effective patent term <e> <s> it therefore had produced data for pesticides relating to the time taken to get full marketing approval <e> <s> we have now had the opportunity to consider further aspects of the case concerning pesticides including data now provided by the industry relating to the time taken to secure provisional marketing approval since an important distinction between pharmaceuticals and pesticides is that the latter can be marked before tests are fully completed on the basis of such an approval <e>", "<cs> my lords in responding to amendment no <e> <s> aa standing in the name of my noble friend lord stockton perhaps i should explain that we do not envisage orders being made under subsection of clause following formal applications to the secretary of state <e> <s> any industry that believes it has a case for its products being exempt from the transitional licence of right provisions of the patents act will be free to present its case to the government <e> <s> we should then consider the case seeking clarification if necessary before deciding whether to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave in using the term evaporate i meant to convey that the number of patents that are caught by the linking provisions of the two previous patents acts is relatively small <e> <s> indeed all subsequent patents are for years duration <e> <s> before three or four years have passed all new patents and all existing patents will be of years duration <e>", "<cs> my lords it is section <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> b and c <e> <s> these amendments relate to applications made to the comptroller for the settlement of terms of licences <e> <s> one effect of the amendments would be to extinguish such applications which are still outstanding at the date of commencement of clauses and if the applicants have not made an investment in anticipation of and in reliance on their entitlement to licences before declarations are filed by patent owners <e> <s> in committee i explained our view that where a person has an application before the comptroller to settle the terms of a licence of right the invalidation of the application would amount to a deprivation of property within the meaning of the european convention on human rights <e> <s> it would be immaterial whether the applicant had made an investment in anticipation of obtaining a licence <e>", "<cs> my lords it was indeed late at night when the noble lord lord rea moved this same amendment in committee <e> <s> i am grateful to him for explaining again the purpose of the amendment <e> <s> i am also grateful to my noble friend lord jenkin of roding for so fully explaining his case against it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should point out that we are now at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords a dispute over a decision by the comptroller under section a will in practice essentially boil down to a dispute about whether or not a fee for a supplementary search is payable <e> <s> when drafting the bill we felt such a dispute did not warrant an appeal procedure <e> <s> that is in line with the provisions in rule of the patents rules concerning other decisions on the payment of search fees <e> <s> however in view of the concerns that my noble friend has expressed we are willing to accept his amendment so as to allow a right of appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords we are constrained from taking unilateral action to extend patent term by the need to harmonise our patent law with the european patent convention <e> <s> patents granted under the european patent convention can run for a maximum of years from their date of application <e> <s> if the united kingdom introduced a longer term this would undermine the european system and would also be contrary to a resolution signed by community states in in which the signatories agreed to harmonise national laws <e> <s> any amendment of our law to alter the term of patents will therefore have to be accompanied by a corresponding amendment of the convention <e>", "<cs> my lords the length of the restoration period must strike a balance between the interests of patentees who have made a genuine mistake and the interests of third parties who wish to know for certain whether they can freely work an invention <e> <s> with the leave of the house i shall speak to amendment no <e> <s> d also <e> <s> we accept that the present -month period is too short <e> <s> we had proposed to extend it to months <e> <s> subsequently we have received representations that it should be even longer perhaps months as in the first of my noble friends amendments <e> <s> we now feel it would be better not to specify the period in the primary legislation at all but to leave it to be provided for in a statutory instrument <e> <s> i recognise that the noble lord lord williams of elvel is of the view that this is not always the best course but there are occasions when it is better to have some flexibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord williams of elvel that we do indeed miss the noble lords presence from what we used to call the alliance benches <e> <s> i am not sure whose they are at the moment <e> <s> they appear to belong to the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead at the

joseph and lord williams of elvel <e> <s> the noble lord lord callaghan and other noble lords who have spoken have all eloquently expressed the admiration and respect which the nation has for the

where a counterfeiter is <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mottistone moved an identical amendment at the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> at that time i said that we were unable to accept the amendment <e> <s> the reason for this was that we did not think it was necessary in view of the fact that we had already accepted in principle the proposal to give to trading standards officers

<e> <s> i agree with him in that respect <e> <s> he also asked whether the government should respond to the commissions proposals <e> <s> no member state appears to have regarded it as necessary to respond by writing to the commission <e> <s> it would be the normal route for proposals to be considered by the committee of economic and finance ministers <e> <s> the government will respond in that committee ecofin at the appropriate time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will no doubt be aware that my right honourable friend the prime minister has made it absolutely clear that the united kingdom could not accept proposals which restricted our right to apply vat zero rates <e> <s> the noble lord asked about the completion of the internal market <e> <s> we are not convinced that tax harmonisation on the lines proposed by the commission is necessary to achieve the internal market <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his view on that point <e> <s> it is a well known convention that statements on tax matters are made at budget time <e> <s> i cannot go further than to say that that is a matter for my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e>", "<cs> my lords an undertaking on food and childrens clothing was indeed given by my right honourable friend the prime minister but no further commitment on books has been given for future years <e> <s> the noble lord would not expect me to go further at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords zero-rating in the united kingdom cannot be abolished by the european commission in the face of united kingdom opposition <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may remember that about a year ago i said in your <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i am prepared to bring the comments of the noble lord and those of all noble lords to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords investigation of complaints about abuse of a dominant position under article of the treaty of rome is a matter for the commission <e> <s> however i am very glad that the commission and british airways have been able to reach an amicable settlement which is compatible with the arrangement on which the monopolies and mergers commission reported <e> <s> this left it to the uk licensing process to decide which of british caledonians routes and associated slots ba should be allowed to take over <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the noble baroness in paying tribute to the work of commissioner sutherland and british airways in negotiating this sensible agreement <e> <s> of course the undertakings agreed by british airways will be looked at carefully by the commission <e> <s> the detail of the monitoring arrangements is a matter for british airways and the commission <e> <s> i believe that the agreement is for four years <e>", "<cs> my lords i was in danger of exceeding the allotted number of answers that i should be giving but of course i shall look at what the noble baroness said to see whether that is possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that the noble lord is referring to my original answer which was about words <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord raises an interesting point <e> <s> as i said earlier the recommendations will be looked at over a period by the commission and it will no doubt ensure that british airways is complying with them <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a hypothetical situation which has not happened in this case <e> <s> in this case the deal achieved with the european commission fits in well with the mmc recommendations <e> <s> i cannot tell the noble lord what will happen in circumstances that we have not yet come across <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be the case <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friends <e> <s> in the case with which this question is concerned the ec recommendations and the mmc recommendations fit together <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for his observations <e> <s> i should also like to draw to your lordships attention the very considerable amount of work that has been done by my officials since the last stage of the bill and indeed throughout all its stages <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is probably as well that we do not have a fourth reading in your lordships house because no doubt we could extend matters so that it was as long as some earlier stages of the bill <e> <s> the short answer to the noble lord lord kilbracken is that transmission of a drawing by the fax process may well be a photograph but does that matter <e> <s> as i have already said it would not be original and would not enjoy copyright on the other hand if a photograph is transmitted by radio the item received may not be a photograph but that does not alter the character of what was sent which will remain a photograph and will continue to be protected by copyright <e>", "<cs> order this is third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords we cannot go on backwards and forward on these matters at this stage <e> <s> we have thrashed out the definition of a photograph pretty thoroughly over the last three months <e> <s> i think we have arrived at the best solution <e> <s> i commend the amendment to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my noble friend lord mottistone does not really intend the complete omission of clause a from the bill without any replacement <e> <s> that would cause an ordinary telephone conference service to be a cable programme service which is obviously not right <e> <s> what my noble friend seeks is an indication of why the government have done nothing about the matters which he mentions and what perhaps they intend to do about them in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment standing in the name of the noble lord lord lloyd is i believe based on a misunderstanding of the provisions of clause <e> <s> the intent of the amendment as i see it is to ensure that the copyright owner may not use copyright to control the normal activities of a library in holding or lending books periodicals and other copyright material which have been put into public circulation <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in agreement with the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran and therefore i am sorry to have to disappoint my noble friend <e> <s> as my noble friend explained these amendments are concerned with the rental right which your lordships will recall was introduced into the bill on report <e> <s> this new right is only conferred by the bill on the owners of copyright in sound recordings films and computer programs and not other copyright owners <e> <s> the intent of the amendments in the name of my noble friend is to extend some of the benefits of the new right to other copyright owners specifically the owners of copyright in musical works and associated lyrics incorporated in sound recordings and films <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is correct that he has not found a government amendment similar to his own among those tabled in my name <e> <s> as he said he tabled an identical amendment on report and at that time i indicated that we would give serious consideration to the question of a provision to deal with anti-spoiler devices <e> <s> we are not yet in a position to bring forward our own proposals but i hope that we shall be able to produce something in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord stockton and the noble lord lord williams have reminded us of the debate we had at report stage on the question of copying for commercial research <e> <s> i explained the reasons for the governments change of view on the question but did offer to consider without commitment any further evidence that my noble friend could bring to bear on the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i remind my noble friend that he has spoken twice already <e> <s> perhaps he can cover any other point when he winds up the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave i shall also speak to amendment no <e> <s> which is tabled in my name <e> <s> there has been much pressure on us both in this chamber and outside to include in the bill an express exception from copyright on public interest grounds <e> <s> i have already explained both in committee and on report why we think that it would not be right to attempt to codify the existing case law on the point and i do not propose to repeat that now save to say that the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran shows exactly why codification would be unwise <e> <s> who is to say whether the circumstances listed in his amendment will remain the only matters in respect of which the courts were they to retain a free hand would be willing to accept that a defence of public interest should be available <e> <s> i think that the new clause proposed by the noble lord would be a great mistake <e>", "<cs> my lords normally it is customary on third reading and also at report stage for the minister to have the last word <e> <s> however with the leave of the house i think i can deal quickly with the point raised by the noble lord lord harris of greenwich <e> <s> i believe that the key words in what he said are very nearly <e> <s> throughout the bills proceedings it has been a matter of coming to a compromise position which is very often a fine line between two sets of different interests <e> <s> i cannot recall whether the noble lord lord harris of greenwich was present during our deliberations in committee when the noble and learned lord lord denning told us that he felt that any mention of public interest was unnecessary because the courts were quite able to resolve the matter <e> <s> on the other hand the noble lord lord williams of elvel among others felt that it was indeed necessary to insert such a clause <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so this amendment was tabled very late and relates at least in part to matters which have not previously been debated during the long and arduous passage of this bill through your lordships house <e> <s> in these circumstances it may not greatly surprise the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran to learn that i do not approach these amendments with great sympathy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> i shall briefly reply to the point made by my noble friend lord stockton <e> <s> i accept that publishers receive requests from librarians for consent to copy under the equivalent provisions of the act <e> <s> i understand that normally this consent is given without payment <e> <s> this if i may say so appears to support my view that doing away with subsection will not harm the publishing industry <e> <s> publishers will not be deprived of any revenue which they now receive and they as well as the libraries will be relieved of the administrative burden of dealing with such requests <e> <s> for that reason and for the reasons that i stated earlier i commend amendment no <e> <s> to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord williams when he says that a halfway house can sometimes be a difficult position <e> <s> as i said earlier to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich the government find themselves in the position of having to try to establish a fair compromise on a great number of issues in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment standing in the name of my noble friend is certainly not without merit <e> <s> as he has indicated an industrially applied aesthetic design may be registered under the registered designs act <e> <s> under the present law it also enjoys the weaker protection of copyright even if it is not registered <e> <s> why my noble friend asks should we remove that weaker protection if the designer chooses not to register <e> <s> he says that the problem with copyright protection for the design of articles concerns functional and not aesthetic designs and that clause should be limited in its effect to functional non-aesthetic designs <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has raised again the issue of copyright in the spoken word and the fears of broadcasters that this copyright could be invoked by those interviewed on television or radio to prevent or restrict use of the recorded material <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment seeks to give the owners of copyright in sound recordings a full exclusive right in respect of rental but during the period when the hiring out of film and computer programs is subject to statutory licence those who are refused licences to hire out sound recordings may apply to the copyright tribunal <e> <s> it is not clear what is to happen then since we are given no guidance as to what the tribunal is to consider whether it can order that a licence be granted or what factors it should consider before making such an order <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with interest to the argument advanced for restricting use of the so-called ephemeral exception to cases where the broadcaster makes the recordings himself in-house <e> <s> the government agree and indeed the berne convention demands that the exception should not be used to permit a recording to be made without copyright authorisation except where a particular broadcaster makes it himself for use in one of his own broadcasts or sub-contracts it out again with a particular broadcast in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak to the group of amendments as listed by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> however i believe that he missed out amendment no <e> <s> the first amendment on this subject tabled in my name <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i shall be able to enlighten the noble lord a little <e> <s> this grouping of amendments deals with a number of proposals for further exceptions to moral rights <e> <s> with the leave of your lordships i should first like to speak to my own amendments to add a fourth subsection to both clauses and <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that i have to move these amendments formally <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave i move those amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment seeks to reinstate a clause which your lordships agreed should be left out at report stage <e> <s> clause as it then was found few friends in committee and was strongly criticised both inside and outside your lordships house <e> <s> i am rather surprised to see it resurface so quickly after what i had hoped was a decent burial <e>", "<cs> my lords an identical amendment was tabled in committee and on report and i must again resist it <e> <s> as i pointed out in committee clause introduces a significant change in the law in relation to the importation of infringing films and sound recordings <e> <s> however due to practical considerations and resource constraints we cannot do much more <e> <s> i explained the reasons very fully in committee and on report and i do not intend to go over the ground yet again <e> <s> if any noble lord wishes to know the reasons i refer him to the relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not had as long to consider the amendment as we might have wished <e> <s> however from briefing material circulated by the library association we surmised that the purpose was to prevent contract from prohibiting acts which are permitted under copyright law <e> <s> i have to say that clause is rather a curious place to provide such an amendment but i would have to resist the amendment wherever it was placed <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems that an error has somehow crept in either in the marshalled list or perhaps in my own notes <e> <s> however these amendments sit together and i should just say that it is an error on the right side in that we have slightly overgrouped on these small amendments rather than the other way round which would have been rather less helpful to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has returned to a question about performers consent which he raised on report <e> <s> the issue is whether broadcasters and cable operators should have to have the consent of performers when they want to make copies of authorised recordings for purposes of repeat broadcasting cable distribution or perhaps for marketing to other broadcasters <e> <s> it is another issue that we have been discussing further with broadcasters since the report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords amendment deals with a point which has recently been drawn to our attention by the bbc <e> <s> if a broadcaster has made a recording of a concert and has inadvertently failed to obtain the consent of all the performers then exploiting that recording may infringe not only the rights of those performers but also the rights of those with whom they have exclusive recording contracts <e> <s> if the broadcaster wants to rectify the situation he will as matters stand under the bill be obliged to obtain the consent of the recording company <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall also speak to the grouping of amendments detailed by my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> that includes amendment no <e> <s> which appears on the groupings list but which my noble friend omitted to mention <e> <s> all of these amendments concern the must-match exception <e> <s> i should like to turn first to my noble friend lord mottistones amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> he said these would limit the must-match exceptions to those sectors of industry where abuse has occurred <e> <s> but the must-match exception is not intended to deal with abuses <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> they cover the same point <e> <s> dealing first with my noble friends amendments nos <e> <s> and these would mean that the -year cut-off period would start only when the first article is made to the design <e> <s> in the typical case of a design which starts life as a drawing and then progresses through a model and a prototype to the final article the effect would be that the -year period would start when the model was made that is some time later than would be the case under the bill as drafted <e>", "<cs> my lords be that as it may i am afraid that i am unable to be very helpful to the noble lord tonight but i assure him that we have given long and careful consideration to what he said previously <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has disputed that perhaps my assurances may not be effective in future years <e> <s> i would not dispute that the assurances i have given about how the powers will be used are not legally binding in the same way that a statutory provision would be <e> <s> we are reluctant to write equivalent restrictions into the bill not least because they are extremely difficult if not impossible to frame in the precise way in which statutes are written <e> <s> furthermore writing restrictions into the bill could be unduly restrictive in that they would be set in concrete and could prevent changes being agreed in the way in which powers should be used in changing circumstances <e> <s> for those reasons i prefer not to write any further restrictions into the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of your lordships i shall speak also to the amendments quoted by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the powers of inspectors are covered under other legislation <e> <s> in the example mentioned by the noble lord i do not want to get involved in particular cases it would depend perhaps on whether criminal proceedings had been commenced <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords for their kind words and to echo all your lordships views in saying how much we appreciate the contribution of my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor <e> <s> we appreciate seeing him here at this late hour of the night when he has so many other matters to attend to <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government support the efforts of uk manufacturers to gain work on these important programmes <e> <s> we have agreed to provide million of launch aid to british aerospace <e> <s> the government are not persuaded that further financial support should be provided to equipment companies <e> <s> i understand that the french and german governments may make some financial support available to equipment companies <e>", "<cs> my lords the government recognise the importance to the economy of the equipment sector <e> <s> that goes without saying <e> <s> i cannot comment on my noble friends remark concerning the level of aid given to the equipment sector in germany <e> <s> apparently the german government do not publish those figures <e> <s> perhaps i should point out that equipment companies in the united kingdom may be eligible to apply for other forms of dti support under the enterprise initiative and are free to negotiate with british aerospace for contributions towards their investment costs <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend raises two very interesting points but i am afraid they are somewhat outside the scope of the question on the order paper <e> <s> if he would like to put down a question on those points i should be pleased to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that government support for the airbus programme is not in question <e> <s> your lordships may be aware that a report prepared recently on airbus is being reviewed by ministers at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords there are operational university and polytechnic science parks in the uk on the latest reckoning <e> <s> in addition a further three are expected to open in <e> <s> ten more are known to be at the planning or feasibility stage <e> <s> the effectiveness of science parks is normally judged by their success in attracting new businesses and generating new jobs <e> <s> the government do not control science parks and we have not established specific performance criteria along the lines suggested by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> one my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords our aim is to ensure that by the end of this year over per cent <e> <s> of firms in this country are aware of the commitment to complete the single european market by the end of <e> <s> my right honourable friend the prime minister has today launched our europe open for business campaign with a national conference at lancaster house <e> <s> this will be followed by regional conferences for firms in every part of the country supported by a comprehensive information service <e>", "<cs> my lords it is absolutely vital that british business plays its full part in the european community in particular after <e> <s> the dti survey of companies showed an awareness level of only per cent <e> <s> when we announced our campaign last autumn <e> <s> this has now risen to per cent <e> <s> our target is over per cent <e> <s> that is the aim of the campaign that was launched today <e>", "<cs> my lords the single european market has been discussed in your lordships house on many occasions <e> <s> questions have been answered both by my noble friend and myself on a number of <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the main aims of the single market is to eliminate not only tariff barriers but also non-tariff barriers so called invisible barriers <e> <s> many matters are under review as my noble friend will know <e> <s> eighty measures plus another not included in the white paper have been agreed by the council of ministers <e> <s> they include a record during the time of the uk presidency <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that lancaster house is large enough to house all british businessmen <e> <s> however it is a very important campaign <e> <s> we are taking the single market very seriously <e> <s> it is the governments prime duty to make sure that awareness among british industry is as high if not higher than among any of our competitors in the ec <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly the awareness campaign has a very long way to go both inside and outside parliament <e> <s> but it is very important as i said that we make sure that the message is driven home <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the leader of the opposition is better aware than i am that anyone on these benches answers on behalf of the government <e> <s> the secretary of state unfortunately has other calls on his time <e> <s> i would be the last to wish to diminish in any way the importance of parliament and in particular of your lordships house <e> <s> but it has all been said before in your lordships house <e> <s> the conference at lancaster house today is specifically targeted on the businessman who after all will have to compete in europe to ensure that british business is at the forefront after <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord would like to address that question to the noble lord lord cockfield <e>", "<cs> my lords the success of british industry will be vital for ensuring that the british worker can earn as much or more than his competitors <e> <s> the only way to ensure an increasing standard of living for all the british workforce is to do better than the competition not only in the european community but in all our foreign markets <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not possibly predict what may happen <e> <s> unless british business is made aware and is able to compete after it is possible that our deficit will rise <e> <s> the whole point of the campaign launched this morning is to ensure that british business can do as well as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an interesting debate this evening and i am grateful to my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne for providing this opportunity to discuss whether the uks involvement in the airbus programmes has been worth while and whether the provision of launch aid to british aerospace for its share of the development programmes is a safe investment of taxpayers money <e>", "<cs> my lords it is expected that the commissions report will be discussed at the next meeting of the consumer council on th or nd june and that the council will adopt conclusions on the subject then <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is correct <e> <s> the government are disappointed that the report reflects little progress <e> <s> at the next consumer council in june the government will seek to bring pressure on the commission to show some real progress <e> <s> i am also aware that the consumer movement in particular the consumers in the european community group has made it clear that it too is extremely disappointed by the report <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall pass on the noble baronesss comments to my noble friend <e> <s> i cannot promise the action that she requests <e> <s> we should all like to see more progress made on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first congratulate my noble friend lord lucas on the lucid way in which he has introduced the bill <e> <s> let me say at the outset that the government do not oppose the bill and indeed have provided drafting assistance <e> <s> your lordships may have noticed from the precise language of the bill that the hands of the parliamentary draftsman and his scottish colleague have been at work <e> <s> there is of course a coherent policy underlying the bill as it is now drafted and i should like to explain to your lordships how it has come about <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until eight oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the government i fully support the compliments that have been paid this evening to sir brandon and to his persistence and tenacity over the years on matters including the one before us tonight in which he passionately believed <e> <s> he was a powerful advocate who earned widespread respect for the skilful and professional way in which he approached whatever task to which he set his mind <e> <s> he will be a sad loss to parliament and our sympathies go out to his wife and family <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams of elvel for having given notice of what he intended to ask me <e> <s> first he asked what would happen in the event of the bbc at some time in the future taking advertisements <e> <s> there are now a few bbc advertisements carried on bbc i and bbc for example for <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer the noble lords direct question but i understand that the wording is taken from the ec directive <e> <s> i shall look into it further and let him have the results of my research <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> that probably is the case <e> <s> the courts would come to a decision and i understand that they are well versed in that <e> <s> it is a complicated area but at the end of the day it is up to the courts to come to their own conclusion on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of access to gilt-edge market maker status is one of a number of issues which are being considered <e>", "<cs> my lords taking my noble friends second point first i believe that major japanese security houses such as nomura and daiwa are here in london for the long term <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend may be reading too much into what he has read in newspapers about potential disagreements <e> <s> the bank of england my department and the treasury are fully in agreement on the importance of maintaining londons lead in the global markets and on working together to achieve access for british houses to financial markets in japan and elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting view <e> <s> we have to look to the japanese to remove restrictions and perhaps sources of friction in a trading relationship which we are otherwise finding of increasing value <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question of the government having implemented any reciprocity powers which they have been given by parliament in the financial services act <e> <s> that is not the case at all <e>", "<cs> my lords there were just over three quarters of a million new cars registered in the uk in the first four months of this year <e> <s> this is an increase of per cent <e> <s> on the corresponding period of last year <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that rovers programme of new models is clearly encouraging for the british motor car industry as a whole <e> <s> as regards import penetration analysis of new registrations of passenger cars in the period january to april of this year shows that per cent <e> <s> were imported <e> <s> in the corresponding period for last year per cent <e> <s> were imported <e> <s> however i should say that the ford strike undoubtedly had an impact on those figures whereas during there was a drop in the percentage level of registrations of foreign-made vehicles <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting point <e> <s> i have all sorts of figures in front of me concerning new car production <e> <s> however i do not have figures relating to cars which are taken off the road or scrapped <e> <s> if i can find those figures i shall of course let the noble lord have them <e> <s> no doubt they <e>", "<cs> my lords i must tell the noble lord that that is another question <e> <s> the present question concerns registration of cars in this country <e> <s> although that may have some bearing on traffic the noble lords is another point <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a most interesting debate this morning and i am most grateful to the noble lords who have participated in it <e> <s> the british steel corporation has often been the subject of debate in this house and all too frequently at times of difficulty for the industry <e> <s> however i am happy to say that the bill now before us will be the first step in taking british steel out of the hands of politicians and returning it to the commercial domain where it truly belongs <e>", "<cs> my lords the production of steel in itself i do not believe to be a monopoly under the law <e> <s> there are other overseas producers which are already well represented in this market <e> <s> it is a completely different case from that of the earlier privatisations such as british telecom <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a matter for british steel to come to a decision on what is required by way of investment in the plant but even the arthur young report confirms that there is no need for any substantial capital expenditure in ravenscraig in dalzell or in shotton over the next five years <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that that will not be the case but i shall look into it and let the noble lord know the full reasons for whatever the decision will be <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to repeat a statement made in another place about girobank plc a subsidiary of the post office corporation <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord williams and lord ezra for their questions <e> <s> perhaps i may first apologise to the house and in particular to the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> while reading the statement i changed the first person singular to the first person plural <e> <s> i accept that that changed the statement slightly from the statement which was in front of the noble lord <e> <s> i apologise and i am sure that the noble lord accepts that there was no intention to change the meaning of the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords the chancellor of the duchy is the minister most responsible for the post office <e> <s> that is why it is appropriate that he has made the statement in another place <e> <s> i emphasise that to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord queried why it was being done whether his query related to the method or the principle <e> <s> however i hope that to some extent i have answered his question <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have an answer at the moment <e> <s> i shall look into the matter <e> <s> i prefer to answer the noble lord after ascertaining the exact position i should not like to mislead either the noble lord or the house <e>", "<cs> my lords in looking at the bids for girobank we would very carefully consider plans that each potential purchaser had in respect of developing the business <e> <s> the business can flourish <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may take my noble friends second point first i understand that legislation will probably not be required <e> <s> as to the decision as to who will be the successful purchaser i understand that both the post office and my noble friend the secretary of state will be employing separate investment banking advice in this respect but it is the post office that is actually selling <e> <s> of course it will consult the government as to the choice of purchaser <e>", "<cs> my lords the post office is the owner of the business <e> <s> therefore i understand that having consulted the government the board of the post office would be responsible for choosing the ultimate purchaser <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord enters into areas of basic philosophy and i am quite sure that i am not going to convince him today that the way in which we look at this matter is the one that he should follow <e> <s> but i can certainly assure the noble lord that the way in which he looks at this matter is not one that we are likely to follow <e> <s> we believe that businesses should operate in the private sector where possible <e> <s> we believe that they do better there that they can develop better and can compete better because they are able to operate away from the restrictions of government and to undertake all the functions of other businesses in the private sector <e> <s> girobank is prevented from carrying out certain functions that its rivals perform at the moment because of its existence in the public sector <e> <s> so i believe that there is a very clear rationale for girobank moving from the public to the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords before other noble lords come forward with their questions perhaps i may respond to my noble friend <e> <s> an excess of what he describes as clutter in any deal that is made with the new owner of girobank would be self-defeating <e> <s> it would defeat the whole point of moving the girobank from the public to the private sector <e> <s> however i should emphasise that the post office will take into consideration not only the price indicated by a prospective purchaser but also the support that the company may give to the development of girobank plans to use the counters network the desirability of increasing competition in retail banking in the united kingdom and of course the ability of the potential purchaser to meet the requirements of the banking act <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already said that the girobank developed very well in the public sector <e> <s> however we believe that it will develop faster <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i cannot give a guarantee and the noble lord would not expect me to do so <e> <s> i was asked a question about competition and i answered in respect of how the competition policy of this government is carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes a good point however the best contracts are those which are operated with much goodwill on both sides <e> <s> the post office counters will provide the retail outlets for girobank <e> <s> girobank will provide considerable income for post office counters <e> <s> there is a considerable shared interest here <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend is being somewhat pessimistic when he says <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the main thrust of the noble lords question was the matter of jobs on merseyside <e> <s> i cannot give any assurance as to the continuity of employment in bootle or merseyside nor can the post office <e> <s> however girobank is successful and ambitious <e> <s> it has the majority of its facilities on merseyside i am fully aware of that <e> <s> the benefits to merseyside have been considerable <e> <s> i believe that the girobank management is very satisfied with the decision that was made to locate on merseyside <e> <s> however i should say to the noble lord that i fully expect it to be in the interests of any purchaser of girobank to maintain those facilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already indicated that the post office is selling girobank <e> <s> the post office will receive the proceeds <e> <s> however i should say that the post office lends surplus resources to the treasury <e> <s> it has agreed with the government that resources that are surplus to its own requirements can be lent back to the public sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that any such representations have been received <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood that the so-called council of the north had been convened to discuss the bid by nestle and suchard for rowntree <e> <s> i am not aware that there was any wider implication behind the formation of the council <e> <s> however i shall certainly draw the noble lords comments to the notice and attention of my appropriate right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i sense that the trend is probably in the other direction <e> <s> as the ec market opens up in there will be a much bigger market <e> <s> we must look to broadening the ability of our economy to compete in the world market and indeed in the european market <e> <s> to have a competition policy on the basis of a regional policy within the united kingdom would be self-defeating <e> <s> it seems to me that competition policy will have to be opened up to consider far wider implications especially that of the single european market <e>", "<cs> my lords i have noted especially from reports which have appeared in the press that the so-called council of the north has been convened by a group of yorkshire mayors or mayors in that region to consider the implications of the bids for rowntree

is about but i shall look at it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right <e> <s> considerable problems are created in the south by traffic and other environmental hazards <e> <s> they are caused by the sheer number of people concentrated in a small area <e> <s> i have seen that the north and other regions are coming up <e> <s> property prices are beginning to rise <e> <s> in some instances it is becoming difficult to find suitable people to fill jobs <e> <s> the trend in many cases is possibly away from the south and hack towards the north <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that firms in this country are not allowed to merge <e> <s> i am not sure what the noble lord means by that <e> <s> we operate an open economy <e> <s> we doubt whether the swiss system serves their economy well

chocolate market <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i was making the point that there seems to be an increasing demand for property in the regions that prices are rising and that that is often an indicator of economic activity in the regions <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the council of the north as convened recently uses that title in quotation marks to distinguish it from the council of the north that was some form of northern privy council <e> <s> that is what the council has been quoted as saying in the press <e> <s> the government do not have a representative on the current council of the north so i cannot fully answer the noble lords question on that point <e> <s> yes in some regions there is a shortage of factory space <e> <s> we are addressing that problem <e> <s> english estates is doing an excellent job in parts of england <e> <s> the welsh office has just announced a package of measures to improve matters in wales <e> <s> i am sure that the scottish office is doing everything in its power to ensure that a shortage of factory space is not a hindrance to economic development in the regions <e>", "<cs> my lords my knowledge of history is not as good as that of the noble lord lord strabolgi <e> <s> i understand that to draw a direct comparison between the privy council as we know it and the council of the north of those days would be erroneous <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know when the noble lord will receive a reply <e> <s> however the governments policy on moving civil servants out of the south-east is well known and as the noble lord has said has been stated many times in your lordships house <e> <s> as regards opportunities that will be available to british industry after i see no reason why the regions that is those parts of the country outside

is already a shift back to the regions and to the north <e>", "<cs> my lords the consumer council agreed conclusions which call on the commission to step up its efforts on the integration of consumer policy in other policy areas <e> <s> it also agreed a resolution on consumer involvement in standards making but a decision to extend the system for the rapid exchange of information on dangerous products was deferred <e> <s> commissioner varfis drew attention to progress in launching the child safety campaign <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the noble baronesss first point on the resources

what will happen in this country i can tell the noble baroness that it will be essential to involve the enforcement authorities and voluntary organisations with an interest in this area and that all these matters will come together when we discuss the detailed planning <e>", "<cs> my lords the issue of child safety has been under discussion in the commission for a long time <e> <s> we should like to see something come forward as soon as possible <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware that the original proposals were not feasible or practical but we want to see as soon as possible a campaign that

past two years i have been answering the noble baronesss questions on the subject <e> <s> we have both been hopeful of being able to work towards a date <e> <s> this has slipped back on a number of occasions but i hope that by this autumn we should be in a position to make some progress <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lords lord williams and lord grimond <e> <s> it may be helpful to the committee if i begin by explaining briefly the position with regard to the articles of association of the successor company and the ground that they will cover <e> <s> i shall then turn to the subject of the governments special share which is the provision in the articles that is of some interest not only to the committee but also to many outside this chamber <e>", "<cs> in an ideal world i am sure that everything would be before us <e> <s> as i have explained i am not able to bring the articles before the committee today <e> <s> before giving way to the noble lord i was <e>", "<cs> before giving way to the noble lords lord marsh and lord morton of shuna i was coming to a point which has bearing on the matter <e> <s> there will not be one set of simple articles but rather two sets of articles <e> <s> i shall refer to the first set of articles as the interim articles <e> <s> they will be based on the companies tables a to f regulations but with certain modifications for example concerning borrowing powers to reflect the governments ownership <e>", "<cs> first the articles of association must set out the restrictions that we shall seek to apply to shareholdings over and above per cent <e> <s> secondly there are many procedures available to companies in the private sector to discover who is behind shareholdings <e> <s> the city has developed many rules of that type in the last few years <e> <s> there are procedures for discovering who is behind nominee shareholdings <e> <s> at the end of the day it may well be for the courts to decide whether a concert party exists <e> <s> however it is the governments intention that the full procedures available to any other company in the private sector that wishes to find out who is behind shareholdings in its shareholders list will be available to british steel <e> <s> we expect the management of british steel to be as diligent as any other management in any other private sector company in finding out who is behind shareholdings that are built up in the shareholders list and whether a number of shareholders are acting together <e>", "<cs> i assume that the noble lord lord jay is referring to the period of time following the expiry of the five-year period <e>", "<cs> he asks a number of questions concerning hypothetical situations <e> <s> i said that the governments intention is to put the privatised company on all fours with any other large private sector company <e> <s> the noble lord will be well aware of the governments mergers and monopolies policy <e> <s> any such acquisition of shares in british steel or any other company above a certain percentage has to be looked at by the oft <e> <s> under the circumstances of whatever hypothetical situation the noble lord likes to imagine of course that would be looked at <e> <s> if there were a referral the monopolies and mergers commission would have to consider the public interest <e> <s> if such a takeover by say a hostile or semi-hostile or even a friendly overseas power were to be judged against the public interest no doubt the mmc would say so <e> <s> there is power to act <e> <s> it is up to the mmc to judge the public interest and not the government themselves <e>", "<cs> the monopolies commission is the place in which the public interest can be considered in such an instance <e> <s> it is the right place <e> <s> if a reference were made the noble lord is well aware that there could be no change in control of the company until the mmc had come to its conclusions <e>", "<cs> of course i hear what has been said in the committee today <e> <s> i shall see what can be done to speed up the provision of any articles of association <e> <s> i can make no promises today but i shall bring the comments that have been made by the committee to the attention of my noble friend the secretary of state so that he is fully aware of the tide of opinion in the chamber <e> <s> i shall certainly take those views on board <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will give way <e> <s> i said that the wheels of government may not grind as fast as some noble lords would wish <e>", "<cs> i have already said to the noble lord that i am not able to give that assurance today <e> <s> i have said to him that i shall draw the comments of the committee to the attention of my noble friend in order to see what can be done about this matter but i cannot give the noble lord an unequivocal assurance on this point <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to noble lords who have spoken on this amendment and to the noble lord lord williams for outlining why he would like an explanation of what we have in mind in this clause <e> <s> i will endeavour to give the background <e> <s> this amendment relates to subsection of clause <e> <s> that subsection provides that references in this bill to property rights and liabilities of the corporation are references to all such property rights and liabilities whether or not capable of being transferred or assigned by the corporation <e>", "<cs> the noble lord anticipates me by a few moments <e> <s> the noble lords knowledge and experience of credit rating is no doubt unsurpassable <e> <s> the owners of the ship in the noble lords example will have the same contractual rights and obligations after vesting as before <e> <s> the wording of paragraph of schedule to the bill makes it clear that that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has a far greater knowledge of law than i do <e> <s> however it is a matter of logic in the noble lords example on the basis that a and c are to all intents and purposes essentially the same person <e> <s> as i said it is the governments intention that there should be a transfer of the whole of the undertaking of the corporation without any discontinuity <e> <s> i cannot see that the interests of any party which at the moment has a contract with british steel should be diminished in any way <e>", "<cs> whatever system exists within british steel in terms of arrangements to reward employees who come up with an idea if a scheme exists it will continue <e> <s> there is no intention to change such arrangements on the vesting of the british steel business in the successor company <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i believe that when he reads <e>", "<cs> the very act of vesting would have no impact that i can see on such a situation <e> <s> of course no one can give a guarantee that the particular employee would for any reason be carrying on in the same division <e> <s> he might be due in any event for posting to another job he might be run over by a bus some other misfortune could occur <e> <s> he might be retiring <e> <s> those are matters outside the control of bsc management and also of the government <e> <s> the act of vesting itself will have no effect whatever on any supplier customer or any creditor of bsc <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord williams and i have already disagreed regarding the credit rating of the corporation <e> <s> i believe that the most important matter is that the company is successful and that is what will secure the rights of all concerned <e>", "<cs> it may be of assistance to the committee if i outline the purpose of clause before turning to the amendments themselves <e> <s> subsection of the clause empowers the secretary of state to reduce the capital of the corporation by an amount that he may direct and subsection subsequently extinguishes the remaining capital immediately before the appointed day <e> <s> the successor company will then issue securities to the secretary of state under clause <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will give way <e> <s> i think that i ought to explain further the point that i was making which is that companies which are going for flotation tend to try to rid themselves of complicated possible future liabilities of that nature that might reflect an aspiration of a previous owner of the company <e> <s> for instance there <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i shall speak also to amendments nos <e> <s> and together <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i shall speak also to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> yes i believe that under a rights issue the government would be subscribing for shares and as the noble lord said they would not just be acquiring them in the market place because in circumstances of shall we say <e> <s> grey skies for the corporation the government buying shares in the market would be of no benefit to the corporation though it might benefit some of the shareholders who wish to sell <e>", "<cs> grey skies <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i do not believe that there is very much between us <e> <s> he is quite right <e> <s> i shall study carefully what he has said and see what our reaction is to that <e>", "<cs> clause is well precedented in previous privatisation acts as the noble lord lord williams is well aware <e> <s> the clause provides investors with a necessary degree of assurance about the future status of the successor company <e> <s> it prevents the government from increasing their stake in the company beyond the level they hold immediately after the flotation without the express consent of parliament <e> <s> that is a necessary if not an absolute comfort to potential shareholders in the company <e>", "<cs> under clause the industrial development act would override the target investment limit <e> <s> it applies only in respect of the provisions of this bill <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that that is the case <e> <s> there is no reason why the industrial development act should not continue to apply in this instance <e> <s> it applies to every other company in the private sector <e> <s> why should it not apply to this company <e>", "<cs> i understand that the important point is that powers under the industrial development act can be exercised only with the consent of the company <e> <s> therefore the government could not <e>", "<cs> clause makes it clear that the target limit applies only to provisions in this act <e>", "<cs> i believe that what i have said should make matters clear to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i shall be delighted to explain the matter to the noble lord lord morton <e> <s> perhaps he will agree that i should do so in writing <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i shall speak also to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> it may be helpful to the committee if i explain the statutory reserve briefly in general terms before dealing with those provisions of clause that these amendments would delete <e> <s> it is normal for a private sector companys balance sheet to contain a mix of capital and reserves <e> <s> clause provides for the creation of a statutory reserve that will be the balancing item between the nominal value of the securities issued to the secretary of state under clause and the amount of the public dividend capital extinguished under subsection of clause <e>", "<cs> the noble lord speaks specifically about pensions and other arrangements <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i am able to give the noble lord quite the guarantee that he seeks but i can say that we do not wish to have the privatised british steel corporation dictated to by powers such as those under the iron and steel act <e> <s> as i have said we wish the corporation to be on the same basis as other private sector companies <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams for introducing this amendment <e> <s> paragraph of schedule in conjunction with the vesting provisions of clause and schedule ensures continuity in respect of the corporations pension scheme <e> <s> that scheme in common with the corporations other property rights and liabilities will vest unchanged in the successor company <e>", "<cs> my lords the code of practice for the motor industry which has been drawn up by the motor trade associations in conjunction with the director general of fair trading contains requirements about car servicing and repairs <e> <s> any changes to that code with a view to improving standards of car servicing and repairs are a matter for the director general and the relevant associations <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right that there has been little progress <e> <s> however i should say that the office of fair trading has been pressing the motor trade associations to take action <e> <s> i believe that it would be very helpful if some strengthening of the guarantees that are given by garages to their customers could be incorporated in an updated code <e> <s> there have been a number of surveys which cause concern on the other hand i suppose it is fair to say that many garages do an excellent job <e> <s> it may well be for the motorist to shop around and find the very best garage that will provide him with good service at a fair price <e>", "<cs> my lords i respectfully suggest that next time the noble lord might try buying a british motor car <e> <s> but i do suspect that the government are correct in believing that competition is the best way to get standards improved <e> <s> i should point out to the noble lord that there is a new generation of service centres being operated by operators such as kwik-fit b q and halfords service centres <e> <s> they are bringing considerable competition to the traditional garage trade <e> <s> there is plenty of scope for motorists to shop around as i have already said and to get the best price and the best quality <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that he had suffered problems in obtaining parts from abroad <e> <s> that was what i understood him to say <e>", "<cs> my lords as in many other industries standards of service are usually judged by the reputation of the person providing them <e> <s> i believe that in this particular industry motor servicing so many people own motor cars and so many people never stop talking about motor cars that no doubt the word spreads round very quickly when an inadequate service is being provided <e> <s> but as regards the point made about how many stars a garage should advertise and so on when it comes to safety i do not think that there is any difference at all <e>

will take more trouble to make sure that they go to satisfactory suppliers <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend no doubt would not have asked his question if he had felt it to be unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments view is that trading standards officers have considerable powers to deal with unsatisfactory services particularly garages which are in the business of putting unroadworthy cars into the hands of the general public <e> <s> anyone who has cause for complaint should approach a trading standards officer individuals can also go to court <e> <s> we do not feel that it is necessary to take further steps at this stage <e> <s> however we shall be watching the effect of local licensing of used car traders in scotland to see if any lessons can be learnt <e>",

production of a document <e> <s> however my noble friend will remember that the government took a substantial initiative two years ago <e> <s> unfortunately that initiative did not pass into law <e>", "<cs> my lords the point of the consultations which are taking place is to establish the strength of feeling on a number of fronts <e> <s> no doubt the right reverend prelate will make his views known

lords i understand that that was the case although i was not myself involved in the discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lords comments show that there are many different tides of

would be much less damaging to the british economy than a per cent <e> <s> increase in inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble viscount will agree with me that there is probably no such thing as a short lesson in economics <e> <s> however i agree with the line that the noble viscount took <e> <s> i have already tried to put that line across but the <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> our oil surplus is still running at about billion per annum <e> <s> that is a very important contribution to our balance of payments <e>", "<cs> my lords the services offered by the export credits guarantee department in support of major overseas industrial projects arc broadly equivalent to those available for major defence contracts <e> <s> in total the amount of cover provided by the ecgd for industrial projects far exceeds that provided for defence contracts <e> <s> for major civil contracts the current range of ecgd facilities provides more comprehensive cover to uk exporters than is available to their foreign competitors from their domestic ecgd equivalents <e>", "<cs> my lords civil exports may be helped to the extent that cover for defence sales is set against the new facility and depending on the outcome of the detailed country assessment may even release cover for non-defence business <e>", "<cs> my lords that would depend on the circumstances <e> <s> on the whole i believe that the new billion facility for defence sales should improve the situation relating to cover available for civil contracts <e>", "<cs> my lords the ecgd is a very important part of the export facilities that we offer to firms in this country which are involved in international business <e> <s> the new arrangements will apply only to a very small number of exceptionally large defence contracts whereas the bulk of ecgd business is in the civil field <e>", "<cs> my lords every export contract has to be looked at on its merits <e> <s> therefore it is very difficult to make a comparison <e> <s> however i believe that we shall assist those exporting civil goods by setting up the new defence facility <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i think that should explain to the noble lord that from time to time defence sales to a particular country have absorbed a rather high percentage of the available insurance cover for that country <e> <s> therefore it was decided to establish the new billion fund for defence sales so that there would still be enough insurance capacity for the normal civil trade with the particular country <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the new fund will improve the ability for those exporting civil goods to obtain insurance cover as i have already explained <e>", "<cs> my lords i have little to add to the answer which my noble friend gave on th june <e> <s> he met the chairman and chief executive of british aerospace to discuss difficulties faced by the company with its participation in the airbus project <e> <s> discussions continue and must remain commercially confidential but we have received no firm proposals for additional support <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i am aware of the problems that british aerospace believes that it faces over the dollar exchange rate <e> <s> my noble friend is correct in pointing out that the dollar is approximately back to its level when the agreements were made <e> <s> i cannot give an unconditional guarantee that british aerospace will receive no further assistance <e> <s> no prudent minister would <e> <s> however i repeat what was said on th june that should in any way launch aid be varied my noble friend will come back to tell your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the government attach the highest importance to creating employment in this country <e> <s> i think that the airbus programme so far deserves full praise for the employment that it has created through british skill and british technology <e> <s> i would say to the noble lord that launch aid for the a is fully repayable and a rate of return of per cent <e> <s> is to be achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give my noble friend that undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments firm financial policies will continue to control inflation and provide the right background for satisfactory and sustainable growth <e> <s> moreover investment growth is expected to be strong this year and this will further improve the supply potential of the economy <e>", "<cs> my lords as my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer has made clear the economy has recently been growing at an unsustainably rapid rate and needs to slow down <e> <s> however that can and should be achieved without drama <e> <s> the government are determined to take no risks with inflation as evidenced by recent interest rate rises <e> <s> the noble lord is no doubt aware that interest rates are now at per cent <e> <s> which is the level that pertained prior to the stock market crash <e> <s> that is some two and a half points up on only six weeks ago <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer has indicated that if inflation appears likely to increase he will not hesitate to take action to raise interest rates in order to try to stop any such increase <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true to say that investment is running at a higher level than was originally forecast in the fsbr forecasts <e> <s> recent rises in interest rates may indeed slow up that rate of investment a little <e> <s> but it seems that the rate of investment is at a healthy level <e> <s> it was originally forecast to run at a level of per cent <e> <s> in in the manufacturing sector but is running at a higher level at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments main weapon against inflation is interest rates and for the foreseeable future it will remain interest rates <e> <s> i would also say to my noble friend that i do not believe that a return to direct credit controls would be very effective <e> <s> i think that they would cause a major distortion of the market <e> <s> such controls can easily be circumvented in the highly developed global credit markets of today <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i said that it is the governments principal weapon <e>", "<cs> my lords the north sea oil revenues are doing very well <e> <s> there was a surplus of billion this year in our balance of payments <e> <s> employment figures are also doing very well with considerable decreases in the last year or so <e> <s> i would also point out that as money supply has increased my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer has seen fit to increase the cost of money <e> <s> i believe that that will be an effective means of controlling inflation in the economy <e>", "<cs> my lords in answering the noble lord lord peston earlier i stated that investment is running at an even higher level than the government had predicted <e> <s> the governments policies have brought steady growth with no resurgence of inflation unlike most previous upswings <e> <s> our aim is to reduce inflation further and we shall continue not to be deflected from that policy <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments policies are encouraging considerable growth within the economy and i should have thought that growth in economic activity is the best way to bring down unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that the cannon group has any plans to sell its cinema chain <e> <s> any sale whether of the chain or of individual cinema sites would be a matter for its commercial judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not like to speculate on what may or may not happen to the assets of the cannon group in this country <e> <s> it is a matter of record that the company has experienced severe financial problems affecting its international interests <e> <s> i understand that equity of at least million dollars has recently been injected into cannon but cannon is a private sector company and it is not for the government to intervene in its commercial decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords the future use of the studio property is a matter for the commercial judgment of the new owners subject to any consents <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for the government to try to intervene in commercial decisions <e> <s> the owners of the studios are best placed to make commercial judgments as to their future <e> <s> the noble lord knows better than i that the government support the british film industry through a number of initiatives including the national film and television school of which he has great knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do not believe that the commercial british film industry needs wholesale subsidy <e> <s> however we recognise that in some areas there are special difficulties and hence our support through british screen finance limited the british film institute and as i said earlier the national film and television school <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will not be surprised if i do not follow him down the route of deprivatisation <e> <s> however the government wish to see as much activity as possible in the film industry in this country but within the policy guidelines that have been laid down and operated by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very interested to hear the noble lords report of the activity at elstree <e> <s> it is a matter for the owners to make a commercial judgment on the future of the studios <e> <s> the government will not and could not intervene in such decisions <e> <s> however the government would like to see as much activity as possible in the industry in this country <e>", "<cs> perhaps this would be a convenient moment to take the statement <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> oh no <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments policy is to encourage all industries to compete in an open and international market and we do not consider that special measures are needed for the film industry over and above the support measures arising from the provisions of the films act <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will know that it is the governments policy to encourage inward investment into this country <e> <s> however there are considerable successes in the british film industry <e> <s> only this morning perhaps the noble lord will have read of the very encouraging export sale of british television productions <e> <s> there are opportunities arising from the requirement for channel to move toward per cent <e> <s> independent productions and from the satellite broadcasting channels that are planned <e> <s> also bsb plans to offer million dollars to help finance predominantly uk film production <e> <s> such expansion in the market obviously represents potential new opportunities for the british film industry if it can produce the right product at the right price <e> <s> i am sure that it will be successful in doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will know that the big budget productions are produced on a highly international basis <e> <s> they are very portable and tend to go where the most favourable conditions exist at any moment in time <e> <s> i believe that the british film industry is far better at gearing itself up to smaller productions million or so and that it can achieve considerable success at that level <e> <s> the industrys exports remain at a high level which clearly demonstrates that british films are made with a keen eye to the market <e> <s> i have every confidence in the ability of the industry to continue to sell its films vigorously both domestically and overseas <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not absolutely sure that european co-operation will be as easy as the noble lord makes out <e> <s> much of the government subsidy given by other ec states relates to keeping a film industry presence in their own language <e> <s> i am not sure that english will necessarily be a common language for film production <e> <s> i am not sure that there will he competition from other ec states to make english language films <e> <s> that has to be said <e> <s> however the facilities on the scale of elstree may well not be the way forward for the future <e> <s> smaller more compact and more efficient studios may well be the facility on which the british film industry will thrive rather than trying to compete in the big international market for big-budget movies <e>", "<cs> my lords in my original answer i said that we wish to encourage all industries <e> <s> we are not in the business of giving the film industry more advantageous treatment than other sectors <e> <s> however there are various support schemes funded by the government <e> <s> we have recognised the unusual nature of film investment by the special methods approved by the inland revenue under which film companies can write off their investment <e>", "<cs> my lords the future of pinewood studios as with the future of elstree studios is a commercial matter for the owners and not a matter for government <e>", "<cs> my lords the best thing for government to do is to create a climate in which all industry can flourish <e> <s> tax rates have come down <e> <s> that must create an incentive for investment in films or in any other industry <e> <s> investment is running at a high level in this country at the moment <e> <s> inflation is being kept under control <e> <s> the film industry is important but we believe that the best way to encourage investment in film making is by maintaining a sound and healthy economy with growth that is sustainable and containable <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene for one moment <e> <s> my noble friend is quite right when he stresses the importance of the british film industry <e> <s> however i believe that the british film industry has the best possible future in responding to demand <e> <s> demand is now coming very often from the requirements for the smaller screen rather than the big screen <e> <s> there are many new exciting developments taking place in television and broadcasting generally <e> <s> i am sure that british producers will participate fully in the requirements that will be there world-wide for such products <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i shall of course draw the attention of the secretary of state to the remarks of the noble lord <e> <s> i cannot give him any <e>", "<cs> my lords when i see the amount of money that the government devote to the arts that is probably a matter with which i could not agree <e>", "<cs> my lords the latest investment intentions survey carried out by her majestys government indicates that the level of investment including leased assets planned by manufacturing industry for amounts to billion an increase of per cent <e> <s> over the level <e> <s> indications for suggest a further though smaller increase <e>", "<cs> my lords it is no doubt obvious to many of your lordships that higher interest rates in themselves will not encourage investment <e> <s> however industry has far more to fear from a resurgence of inflation <e> <s> a per cent <e> <s> rise in interest rates even if sustained for a full year adds to costs only a quarter of the amount that a per cent <e> <s> increase in wage settlements would add <e> <s> i believe that the stable state of the economy will enable business to plan far better for the future than it has for many years <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have just said investment is running at a very satisfactory level and at the moment is at a rate somewhat higher than the estimates in the fsbr <e> <s> however it is important to make sure that the growth in the economy is at a sustainable level <e> <s> it would be quite irresponsible of government to let inflation run away <e> <s> as i told your lordships last week the interest rate weapon is the governments principal weapon in the war against inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords know that the noble lord attaches a great deal of importance to the matter of research but it is a somewhat different question from the one on the order paper <e> <s> if the noble lord would like to table a question on research <e> <s> i should he happy to answer it <e>", "<cs> i think my lords that it is something called hindsight <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be the case but i think that the business sector can plan with far more confidence than was possible in the s or s <e> <s> as i said the government attach the utmost importance to controlling inflation and i believe that businessmen can have confidence that the governments policy is to contain inflation <e> <s> after all an increase in inflation would be the most serious threat to business confidence <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right and the level of investment is also very satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps this would be a convenient time to take the dinner hour business <e> <s> in moving that the house be resumed may i suggest that we return to the firearms bill at pm <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords for the period st july to th july there were visitors to the parliament and the glorious revolution exhibition at the banqueting house whitehall <e> <s> various promotional activities have been undertaken to publicise the exhibition <e> <s> these include direct mail campaigns posters distribution of information packs press photographs press advertising a radio feature and facilities provided for national and regional television companies <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to my noble friends first point i understand that additional banners on the facade of the banqueting house are being arranged <e> <s> as to having a member of staff dressed in costume on the other side of the road that is another matter <e> <s> however i shall draw my noble friends remarks to the attention of those responsible for the running of the exhibition <e>", "<cs> my lords i have seen the article but i suspect that it has not put many people off yet <e> <s> after all sunday is rather recent history <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble and learned friend has an important point <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has made a good point but perhaps we can continue with the history lessons outside the chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend would like to distribute further samples <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware that the results of the by-election in brent last week showed what most people think of the councils policy on rubbish and also that most people think that many of the councils other policies are rubbish <e>", "<cs> my lords by listing the number of acts which the bill seeks to amend the noble lord lord williams of elvel reminds us that it is a broad bill <e> <s> however i am not sure that it visits as many corners of economic life as we have in this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords last week your lordships debated at second reading the governments proposals for water privatisation <e> <s> a number of your lordships took us back through the <e>", "<cs> i agree that this is a wrecking amendment <e> <s> not only will the amendments wreck the bill the result of them will be to wreck the nuclear industry <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lord torrington that that will enable us to carry on wrecking the ozone layer and the atmosphere <e> <s> until a miracle such as cold fusion comes to exist we have to go on using sources of power that are not ideal <e> <s> however we must use those which we believe to be the cleanest available <e>", "<cs> i agree with my noble friend but i do not believe that the presence of the secretary of state as the sole shareholder in any of these industries will make a huge diference to safety <e> <s> we cannot get away from that <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to thank my noble friend lord boardman for bringing this subject to our attention today <e> <s> i greatly enjoyed the contribution of my noble friend lord de la warr <e> <s> i have known him for many years and i hope to see him in your lordships house on many more occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell the house what level of interest rates would be necessary to fund the spending proposals of the party opposite
