["<cs> my lords may i first apologise for having been silent so long since i joined your lordships house but i found it very hard to convince myself that among other things i had enough special or up-to-date knowledge to enable me to make a useful contribution <e> <s> i am therefore all the more grateful to the noble earl lord longford for having initiated this debate because until the beginning of this year i served on the parole board both under the noble lord lord windlesham and for a longer time under the leadership of the noble lord lord harris <e> <s> i thank him very much for his verygenerous undeservedly generous tribute to me tonight <e> <s> before that i served on the board of visitors and the local review committee of a local prison <e> <s> i have also been on the mental health review tribunal at broadmoor and elsewhere and now on the board of a community home for boys at risk and in trouble <e> <s> so i think i know something of the outlines of this problem hut as in all human problems the more i know the outlines the less idea do i have of the proper solution <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by thanking the noble baroness lady lockwood for raising this very important subject <e> <s> i think that everyone who has spoken tonight gives one the feeling that far from cutting the resources given to further education they must be expanded <e> <s> i dare to speak of a small sector because i come from toynbee hall where i have the honour to be deputy chairman <e> <s> around us we have the traditional east end where by any standards the deprivation is as serious as anywhere in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to join the chorus of thanks to my noble friend lady stedman for introducing this important subject and doing it so very well <e> <s> she soared like a lakeland buzzard over the whole scene <e> <s> i shall approach it from another angle a more earthbound position of the toad beneath the harrow <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel very inadequate to follow the noble baroness lady fisher <e> <s> i am sure that we all sympathise with the many problems that she sees ahead <e> <s> however <e> <s> i wish to speak in particular about a matter in which i am involved that is rural housing <e> <s> i should first declare an interest <e> <s> i am chairman of the rural housing association in my county of suffolk <e> <s> it is one of set up by the national agricultural rural trust and the rural development commission <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for having initiated this debate which i have found absolutely fascinating <e> <s> i should also like to thank my noble friend lord hutchinson of lullington for having made my speech for me <e> <s> i have served on the parole board and been connected with prisons but my direct concern in this debate stems from the fact that at the moment i am deeply concerned with alternatives to custody and with preventing people from ever being taken into custody <e> <s> i am president of the rainer foundation which was the precursor of the probation service and was the old london police court mission <e> <s> i am also chairman of the intermediate treatment fund which sprang from the rainer foundation <e>", "<cs> my lords like everyone else i want to thank my noble friend lord ross for giving us a chance to talk about this important subject <e> <s> i also want to apologise that i came into the chamber after he had started speaking but i hope i shall be excused on the grounds that i had to attend a meeting arranged long ago to try to think of ways in which we can deal with the problem of homelessness <e> <s> i do not apologise for straying off the subject of the debate in my remarks because i want to speak almost exclusively about the problems in rural areas in which i am much involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i strongly support everything that has been said <e> <s> i am chairman of a rural housing association <e> <s> i do not have a direct interest in shared ownership but it puts a much heavier weight on those of us who have to provide rented housing if all the schemes in my own county for shared ownership are held up by this uncertainty over staircasing <e> <s> my own feeling is that it is quite impossible that a pre-emption clause will ever meet the case <e>"]
