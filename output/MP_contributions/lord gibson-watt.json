["<cs> my lords to make a speech on forestry in your lordships house is rather like sailing a ship between scylla and charybdis because wherever one looks one sees experts upon this subject even on the front bench and that is not normal in every legislative chamber in the western world <e> <s> i confess an interest in that i am myself a forestry owner in wales and i am a part-time forestry commissioner <e> <s> my noble friend lord dulverton does the forestry industry as a whole a great deal of benefit when he raises this subject in your lordships house <e> <s> i suppose there is nobody who has done more particularly on the private side of the industry both in england and in scotland than my noble friend <e> <s> until recently for three years he was president and for three years before that he was chairman of the forestry committee of great britain which as far as the private side is con <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will forgive me if i do not follow him in his argument about housing associations <e> <s> but i certainly would agree with the noble lord lord evans that the matter we are discussing is a delicate one in the principality <e> <s> however i would not advise your lordships to agree to the amendment and i shall try to explain why <e>", "<cs> following what the noble baroness has rightly referred to as her view of the future of the reorganisation and i speak as one who was closely embroiled in the last reorganisation in the s i agree with what she says of the unforeseeable difficulties in this particular line that we ran up against after that reorganisation <e> <s> i do not think that figures mean a great deal when we are talking about per cent <e> <s> or <e> <s> i would agree with her that that is not the core of the argument <e> <s> i listened carefully to the excellent speech of the noble lord lord wells-pestell voicing rightly the deeply-felt understanding of those who work in the health service <e> <s> i myself believe that what my noble friend has said about the appeals mechanism is really the core of the matter <e> <s> i look forward to hearing more from the government on how this will work out <e> <s> i would hope very much so far as wales is concerned for that is my particular interest that there will be a separate appeals mechanism operating in wales for the seven areas health authorities that exist there <e> <s> but i believe and i stress the point made by my noble friend that when talking about a period of three and a half years we will have automatic wastage whether or not we like it we all grow older <e> <s> the important thing in this as she has said is that every single case which is a problem and which could lead to any redundancy should have very special consideration by the special committee of the whitley council and by the appeals mechanism to which she referred <e> <s> i repeat that i look forward to hearing more about that in the future <e>", "<cs> my noble friend must realise that when we are dealing with celtic affairs we move in rather a mysterious waymay i begin by saying to your lordships that the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos has made a characteristic and generous speech which i certainly very much welcome <e> <s> i too congratulate him for the part which he and his two other colleagues have played in their approach to the secretary of state <e> <s> lord cledwyn was also generous enough to say that there were many others who <e>", "<cs> i find myself in some difficulty in speaking to this bill but i wish to do so because it so happens that the honourable member in another place who has brought forward this bill represents the constituency where i live <e> <s> naturally i should like to support his bill but it is rather a difficult bill to support completely because what it is doing is spreading night shooting to an alarming extent <e> <s> i have done a certain amount of this night shooting and i think that the noble lord lord houghton might well agree with me when i say that it is rather a cruel form of shooting whether it is done by x y or z a landlord or a tenant <e> <s> i can well remember going out not many years ago with a landrover and shooting about rabbits <e> <s> it is a very good way of getting rid of rabbits if they are there but a number of rabbits get away because they go outside the sphere of the light of the vehicle <e> <s> therefore there are a lot of wounded rabbits <e> <s> to this extent i certainly go along with the noble lord lord houghton in what he has said <e> <s> if i may interpose between the two noble lords on the opposite front bench it was quite clear to me in what the noble <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what has been said <e> <s> i think that this ban should extend to everybody <e> <s> of course that is not in the bill but i quite agree with what my noble friend has said <e> <s> the indiscriminate use of rifles is of great concern to the police <e> <s> let us face it nobody has spoken much tonight about the point of view of the police but it is a very difficult one <e> <s> in my experience it is a fact that a good number of people use firearms who really have no experience of them and they are extremely dangerous not only to others but to themselves <e> <s> as to the rifle and its use at night i very much hope that the mover of the bill will seek to talk to his honourable friend and indeed my member of parliament in another place to try to get the bill amended to omit the use of rifles at night <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord is right in thinking that the government front bench is neutral it appears to me that there are probably more in your lordships chamber who are prepared to vote for the amendment on rifles <e> <s> before the noble lord sits down will he make it clear that he will take us into the lobby on this issue <e> <s> i think that it is quite an important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> i agree with what he is saying <e> <s> would he not also say that one of the great drawbacks that the nature conservancy suffer under at the moment is that they are able to make areas sssis without informing either the owner or the tenant of land <e> <s> this is doing them a great deal of harm in the country <e>", "<cs> may i say to the noble lord lord houghton that i do not think that either of these two amendments have much to do with ground game or for that matter with red herrings <e> <s> they deal entirely with the problem of wildfowling on the marshes <e> <s> other noble lords have also said something about this <e> <s> those who carry out this particular pastime are extremely hardy young men <e> <s> no doubt some of us used to do it a good long time ago i certainly did but do not any longer <e> <s> i agree with what has been said by the noble lord opposite that if you were to carry out the provisions of this amendment you would prevent wildfowling by moonlight <e> <s> i doubt very much whether expert wildfowlers shoot a lot of rare birds that they should not do <e> <s> today as a result of the efforts of wagbi the advice and control over wild-fowling is far greater than it was years ago <e> <s> for these and for other reasons with which i shall not detain the committee i hope that we shall not follow this amendment <e>", "<cs> before the government accept this amendment i should like to put a slightly different point of view <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord donaldson is in a way quite rightly using the argument in all these amendments under this clause that if we make certain changes and rationalise it would help the rspb and other conservationists in their arguments with europeans <e> <s> this may well be so but from ones present knowledge of the attitude of the europeans i rather doubt whether it will have a great deal of effect <e> <s> perhaps i am a pessimist in this <e> <s> that is my first point <e>", "<cs> may i speak again and say to those noble lords who happen to shoot in scotland that there is such a thing as a snipe migration <e> <s> if you stop shooting at the end of the season nothing will get down to wales at all <e>", "<cs> may i make a quick point before the minister replies again <e> <s> on the last occasion on <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies may i say that i agree with my noble friend lord stanley of alderley that the word property should <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the support which i have had from both sides of the committee <e> <s> i felt rather ridiculous getting up to move this amendment but as my noble friend said that he would be prepared to look at it the only comment i would make is that nowadays a catapult is an adult weapon and not just confined to children <e> <s> in view of that i shall be glad to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend and in view of that assurance although he has not given us a whole cake he has certainly given us half of one i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> could i make a point on what the noble lord lord houghton has said <e> <s> when he talks about taxidermists being cruel i do not quite follow him <e> <s> i do not know much about taxidermists but i thought they dealt with dead animals or birds that they stuffed them <e> <s> i cannot quite see how you can be cruel to a dead bird or a dead animal <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies i should like to say to the noble lord lord kilbracken that he may have eaten a quail in soho but i very much doubt whether he has eaten a capercaillie <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may put forward a slightly contrary view <e> <s> within the rarefied atmosphere of your lordships house it is of the greatest interest to hear two experts talking about bats and to both of my noble friends i would say that in general i have every sympathy with what they say <e> <s> the point that i wish to make quite briefly is this my noble friend lord cranbrook said that there is a good deal of concern on the part of certain private owners <e> <s> but if any private owner has a colony of bats in his house it is probably known about by the nature conservancy council <e> <s> is it not possible therefore for the ncc to come to some voluntary agreement with the private owners concerned <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is merely underlining what i have already said that most owners of houses where there are colonies of bats are very sympathetic to them <e> <s> all i am saying is can we not avoid the heavy hand of government being implicated <e> <s> can this not be brought about by good will between bat owners and the nature conservancy council <e> <s> i could not agree more with both of my noble friends <e> <s> what they are seeking to do is eminently right that is to preserve bat colonies particularly the important ones <e> <s> my noble friend lord craigton said that there was a dilemma <e> <s> the dilemma is that on the one hand we have those who wish quite rightly to preserve bats while on the other there are in this country millions of people with houses who do not want the heavy hand of government telling them what they are to do with the bats in their lofts <e>", "<cs> i quite understand what my noble friend is saying <e> <s> i was trying to shoot down the amendment of my noble friend lord cranbrook who spoke specifically about dwelling-houses <e>", "<cs> this is really an omnibus amendment and i do not intend to reply to everything that the noble lord has spoken about <e> <s> i agree with him when he says that certain poisons are sometimes over-used and wrongly used <e> <s> i would remind him i think he is aware of it that the use of strychnine is against the law except as he rightly said for the purpose of dealing with moles <e> <s> i should not like your lordships committee to say that all poisons could not be used <e> <s> there is one particular poison that is cymag which if it is used properly can be very sensibly used to get rid of vermin <e> <s> i am not saying that it should be put indiscriminately down badger holes to control foxes <e>", "<cs> may i just say that this is slightly different in so far as under subsection it might be for the purpose of complying with an international obligation and we should not like this to be slipped through without proper debate <e> <s> i think there is a great deal of suspicion about the european decisions on this matter <e> <s> we think that something of this importance should be properly debated in both houses <e>", "<cs> on reflection i shall be happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend one quick question <e> <s> in schedule which is really what we have been discussing with this clause we come to the question of the polecat <e> <s> the polecat is a rare beast in most parts of britain but it certainly is not in mid-wales <e> <s> it is extremely prolific and we get population explosions from time to time <e> <s> if we have to deal with this when it happens would it be covered by the possibility of applying for a licence <e>", "<cs> i have just as much sympathy with the noble lord lord houghton as i have with tommy brock but i very much question whether <e>", "<cs> i should like only to strike a slight note of discord here <e> <s> if this amendment means that everybody has to get a licence to collect gulls eggs i think that the government would be in great danger of seeing this law disobeyed very often <e> <s> that would be a pity because this includes the eggs of the black-headed gull and a vast number of people throughout the country pick them up and eat them and sell them and all the rest of it <e> <s> the black-headed gull as we all know and the rspb know very well is a bird which if you take its nest the first time will go and lay a second nest <e> <s> it is in no danger whatever of being in short supply <e> <s> i hope that this amendment does not go quite so far as i think it does <e>", "<cs> in view of that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies could i say to the noble lord lord donaldson that i do not agree entirely with the arguments which he has put forward <e> <s> the reasons are these <e> <s> first and foremost the ncc is an agency and not any part of government <e> <s> as he himself said it is an advisory body <e> <s> i know that the rspb would like the ncc to take this on <e> <s> indeed the noble lord is producing the rspb argument this afternoon <e> <s> but we must look at past and present experience in this <e> <s> if one looks at what happened in the berwyn mountains it was there that the ncc acting under great pressure from the rspb brought in something which was going to take over a vast area of wales under an sssi <e> <s> this is just an example of how strong is the rspb in the councils of the ncc <e> <s> the noble lord is quite right when he says that the ncc do not wish to take this on <e> <s> i do not think it would be an appropriate job for them to do <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord avon for what he has said and particularly with regard to a re-application to a licensing authority to review its decision <e> <s> in the circumstances i see that it is a little difficult for a minister himself to be the court of appeal for his own department <e> <s> in view of what has been said on behalf of the government and i am grateful for the explanation of the position i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> with that assurance i shall be glad to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the support of the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge <e> <s> i think that it was he who was supporting me and i shall naturally look forward for a <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess an interest both as an owner and as a forestry commissioner <e> <s> it is indeed fortunate for the forestry industry as a whole that so many of your lordships are interested in and have knowledge of this particular subject <e> <s> it was of particular interest today to hear the noble lord lord lovat speak having only days ago heard his brother speak in another place on the forestry bill <e> <s> i think it was significant that the select committee under the chairmanship of the noble lord lord sherfield in general commended the research work of the forestry commission <e> <s> i may say that the commission took this committee extremely seriously as it was right that they should do and there were many occasions when the general director and the head of research attended your lordships committee to give evidence <e> <s> it is a matter of considerable pleasure to the commission to hear such comments as those made by the noble earl lord cranbrook this afternoon when he said that the standard of oral evidence was of a very high order <e> <s> indeed one would have expected such from the general director and the head of research of the commission but it was good to hear it in public <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> pension funds and other organisations can go abroad and they can invest in other countries as we very well know <e> <s> it is a free market in that respect <e> <s> the point i was trying to make and perhaps did not make well enough was that if we have a situation where her majestys government are producing from taxpayers money something of the order of to million a year and if it is quite clear that funds are available from other sources it is not unreasonable for a government faced with severe economic problems to take the steps which her majestys government are now doing <e>", "<cs> if i may make a welsh remark everybody has his own experience of this but perhaps i can say to the noble lord lord melchett that i do not think he is right <e> <s> all my experience points to the fact that in mid-wales all home-bred snipe normally leave the hills about the th august and i certainly have never seen an immature snipe jack snipe yes but not immature snipe <e> <s> in spite of the profusion of scientific evidence that the noble lord lord melchett has given to your lordships house on this matter i must with respect disagree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say <e>", "<cs> my lords if i used the word excessive perhaps that was wrong <e> <s> i meant that it was unnecessary that it was overdoing it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that perhaps my noble friend lord stanley was going to withdraw the amendment after he had heard what the minister had to say <e> <s> but in view of what the minister has said i am absolutely appalled at the situation <e> <s> i rather hope that my noble friend will persist in his amendment because if what the minister has said is correct it is a shocking situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i put a slightly contrary view <e> <s> successive governments urged forestries to grow four acres of forestry and although i was glad to hear the noble baroness lady white refer to some areas in the national parks i believe she would certainly accept that some forestries should take notice <e> <s> i think the noble baroness would agree with me that this should take place in those areas covered in bracken which are very often on the side of the national parks <e> <s> this is very typical of the brecon beacons <e> <s> nobody is suggesting that you should have afforestation on the top of such peaks as snowdon or any mountain of that sort <e>", "<cs> my lords yes but with the greatest respect to the noble baroness there is not a great deal of point in planting hardwoods in view of the return one gets on them now <e> <s> i do not think anybody in the forestry world sees any sense in doing a great deal of planting of that kind <e> <s> that is the trouble from the conservationists point of view <e> <s> all i am trying to say is that governments urge those responsible for forestry to produce more and then time and time again in just such an instance as this we have another little restriction not in itself terribly important but making it more difficult for the wishes of successive governments to be carried out <e> <s> in about years when north sea oil goes the time will come when both food and timber are going to be in such short supply that there will be a great problem in feeding our people and keeping them warm <e> <s> people will not recognise this <e> <s> i do not oppose the amendment <e> <s> but i do wish to draw the forestry problem to the attention of my noble friends <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies to the amendment i should like to say that although i normally support the amendments which my noble friend lord stanley of alderley proposes on this occasion i am not entirely happy about the amendment <e> <s> i say that to him as somebody who has had a long experience of living in a sheep breeding area and who breeds sheep himself <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend lord burton <e> <s> i think that the government front bench have made a mistake over the goosander <e> <s> the goosander is a pest <e> <s> in fact it is a greater pest in scotland than it is in my part of the world <e> <s> one of the things to remember about the goosander is that it is a very prolific breeder <e> <s> last year i saw a brood of over <e> <s> therefore the size of the population will grow very much if this bird is protected <e> <s> i believe that the government have taken this step with the goosander as a result of the eec directive <e> <s> if i am wrong i should like to be corrected but i very much support the amendment of my noble friend lord burton <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord put me right and say whether he is speaking about the law in scotland or the law in england and wales <e> <s> because in fact it is slightly different <e>", "<cs> in speaking to the amendment i wish to declare an interest as a part-time forestry commissioner <e> <s> looking at the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i speak shortly <e> <s> everything that is said in this amendment is on the side of virtue <e> <s> it is saying that virtue is a good thing and sin is a bad thing <e> <s> it does not get us anywhere <e> <s> with respect to my noble friend all the things which are mentioned in this amendment are already being done to the best abilities of the commissioners <e> <s> if you take them point by point local employment for instance look at the amount of local employment that has come from the forestry industry in particular the forestry commission <e> <s> look at the addition to the rural economy <e> <s> look at the vast sums of public money that the commissioners have been administering in the cause of recreation and access <e> <s> i think the figure was million last year <e>", "<cs> my lords to my noble friend i would only say this even people in hampshire need work <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak after a long list of noble lords who made a number of informed speeches not least among them the speech made by my noble friend lord fisher and that made by my noble friend lady gardner of parkes who showed in her speech her experience of local government and of the problems of licensing <e> <s> i too have local government experience though it is some way back in my career <e> <s> i go along with a great deal of what she said <e> <s> may i say to her as have other members that we hope very much to hear from her again <e> <s> we liked her reference to her childhood voyage across the sea to the zoos here <e> <s> it so happens that at lunch today i sat next to an australian lawyer who had come overseas though i do not think by sea for five days to visit a certain place not very far from london zoo <e> <s> he was going to watch white-flannelled gentlemen play the game of cricket <e> <s> i shall not go further and say who i hope will win <e> <s> all i hope is that he enjoys his visit here <e>", "<cs> no my lords that would not be exactly in my nature <e> <s> i happen to think that matters have greatly improved and i have faith that they are going to improve even further in the next couple of years or so <e> <s> zoos as a whole play a very great part in the tourist industry which i happen to be interested in <e> <s> for instance the zoo at twycross was visited during one morning by no less than to school children <e> <s> i think that puts the matter into perspective <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord craigton leaves that point i should like to say that of course he is right when he says that the local authority has a concern about the number of people who go to the zoo <e> <s> however can he meet the point which i made <e> <s> it is that i do not believe that district councils at present have the right sort of inspectors to carry out the provisions of this bill and that it will mean a lot of extra expertise <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend two questions <e> <s> first does he not consider that to schedule acres in central wales mostly for the sake of a few hen harriers and merlins which are not a threatened species is a bit excessive <e> <s> secondly following the supplementary question of the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that this is <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that this is not just a question of governments finding money <e> <s> there is the question of expertise in agricultural circles for which over the years we have shown a great aptitude <e> <s> are her majestys government satisfied that we export this kind of expertise to help under-developed countries with this very important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend come a little cleaner <e> <s> like the noble baroness lady white who has an interest in mid-wales i find his answer a little tantalising <e> <s> would it not be possible to tell the house at least the tenor of what the secretary of state is about to announce in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting my noble friends question may i ask whether in view of <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the statement that he has made today will be received very well in many quarters <e> <s> the question of the welsh problem was touched upon <e> <s> i once for my sins had responsibility for reorganising welsh water and it was then described as an explosive subject <e> <s> the fact remains that the boards were too big when we created them and may i say to the government that i think they are quite right to make them smaller <e> <s> with regard to the question of the council is it not a fact as the minister himself said earlier that the great work done by the council was largely used to set the system up and as to whether it is necessary to carry that system further may i be allowed to disagree with my noble friend lord nugent <e>", "<cs> may i support my noble friend in relation to this <e> <s> on the face of it there is something to be said for the amendment but like my noble friend i abhor black lists <e> <s> my modest experience of being responsible for health affairs in wales for a short period and having been engaged in the knowledge of certain people being sacked for running these residential homes in a bad way leads me to believe that any local authority or any authority taking on somebody to run one of these homes will inquire whether they have done it before <e> <s> short of that person lying to the authority they will then be able to check up <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend that we should not have any black list in regard to this <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend the minister finally replies if he is going to do so may i ask him to address himself to one part of the amendment which i think is of some importance although the noble and learned lord lord gardiner did not press that part <e> <s> it is that if advice is going to be given to those who apply for it is it going to be charged for or not or is that perhaps a matter on which my noble friend might write to me <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment of my noble friend lord mottistone and i very much hope that my noble friend the minister can meet this amendment <e> <s> as i read the bill it is the case that civil servants in the office of the secretary of state can make these decisions without the minister <e> <s> if that is so i cannot go along with it very easily and i support this particular amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak to this amendment quite quickly i shall not take up very much time <e> <s> i certainly have some sympathy with the thinking of the noble lord lord melchett although i cannot in fact support his amendment <e> <s> i should like to draw noble lords attention to two comments that he made in his opening remarks <e> <s> one is that nobody wishes either good agricultural land or anything to do with nature conservation to be unnecessarily lost to water <e> <s> but equally nobody will argue against the necessity of good water supplies not only for domestic but also for industrial use <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that the housing picture is not complete unless one includes the figures of those houses which have been improved as a result of government grants <e> <s> has he any figures which he can give us for these improvements which would perhaps give us the whole picture <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me <e> <s> the noble lord has mentioned the attitude of the national farmers union <e> <s> i expect that he is aware that recently the national farmers union have expressed their view that they are to a very large extent satisfied with the assurances that the government have given <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to follow the noble lord lord prys-davies in his masterly deployment of the case for the welsh plant breeding station <e> <s> i agree entirely with a good deal of what he said <e> <s> i will start by making two points <e> <s> first it is open to any government at any time in their term to say to their agencies and departments that there should be some curtailment or limit to the amount of money that is spent whether it concerns tourism and we have just had a basin of that from scotland sport the arts or as in this case research <e> <s> none of these very desirable avenues of our national life is inviolate none may be left untouched by any government <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect if i may intervene that is the last thing i said <e> <s> all that i said was that every form of agency and activity under every government must come at some time or another under the eye of economy <e> <s> i never said that research in itself should be cut <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the real problem here rests on the old adage that theres many a slip twixt cup and lip <e>", "<cs> the noble lord referred to powis county council <e> <s> that is one of the councils the minister has mentioned which would be under million <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend would go a little further than that <e> <s> i think the amendment which my noble friend lord stanley has tabled is a very worthwhile one and as i understand it it has the full support of the national farmers union who of course have great experience in this matter <e> <s> with respect the ministers answer did not quite cover the point <e> <s> we all know that you can shoot a dog that is worrying your sheep but as my noble friend said we do not normally stalk about with shotguns when we are looking after our sheep <e> <s> in any case we do not very much like shooting dogs <e>", "<cs> my lords as i come from an area where there are probably more of this type of bird than in most other parts of the country may i support what my noble friend has said in his question <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend the minister whether he would agree that those who spend a lot of time both in the day and at night often in quite horrible weather trying to watch out for these people who steal from nests deserve a great deal of commendation from all concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very suitable that the noble lord lord john-mackie should have initiated this debate because he is both a practical farmer and a former agriculture minister <e> <s> also he was the chairman of the forestry commission under whom i had the pleasure to serve <e> <s> indeed i still serve on the forestry commission and was so glad to hear my noble friend lord radnor refer to his late father because there was nobody who was kinder or who encouraged me more as a young man to pursue forestry <e>", "<cs> my lords while commending the action of the minister of agriculture in getting the less favoured areas in britain greatly extended will my noble friend agree that as in the case of the hill cattle subsidy some years ago to get the delineation of the boundaries correct is an extremely difficult exercise <e> <s> therefore will his right honourable friend have consultations with such other bodies and perhaps the regional representative which he has in each region <e>", "<cs> from this side i agree with the noble lord who has just spoken <e> <s> compromise on this bill started from the moment the government held discussions with all the various interests concerned <e> <s> that co-operation has continued throughout the bill and i agree with the noble lord that it has been very valuable <e>", "<cs> may i briefly add to the debate <e> <s> the question of having no appeal is as the noble lord lord grimond has said one of the major obstacles to good relations between certain individuals and the nature conservancy council <e> <s> anyone who knows anything about the nature conservancy council knows that it is very understaffed <e> <s> we also know that the staff are difficult people to get hold of <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i can briefly help my noble friend even it i cannot support his amendment <e> <s> i must confess an interest as a forestry commissioner for some years <e> <s> in regard to sssis which are the concern of this amendment any problem about planting or felling applications in them or in national nature reserves is always a matter of discussion between the forestry commission and the nature conservancy council <e> <s> this follows from statutory directions given to the forestry commission by the forestry ministers <e> <s> therefore i am able to speak on this matter which i know about and i repeat my assurance to my noble friend that what he is asking for already exists <e> <s> he is pushing at an open door <e>", "<cs> with respect this is a matter for the future and certainly not a matter for debate at this moment in this committee <e> <s> the noble lord is not totally right in what he is saying <e>", "<cs> indeed i shall <e> <s> if any public body has ever been to the lengths of having discussions and seminars with all interested bodies i should like to find it <e> <s> i would ask the noble lord not to be too unfair to the forestry commission <e> <s> they have great problems and they bend over backwards to recognise the problems to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> on the question of the earlier cases i would not argue with him <e> <s> all that i am arguing with him about is with regard to the so-called broad-leafed policy <e> <s> that is a matter for the future and i would ask him not to prejudge it <e>", "<cs> my lords while i recognise that from time to time governments have to make adjustments in their research programmes may i ask my noble friend whether he recognises that the cuts in the plant breeding station at aberystwyth have been viewed with considerable concern in wales <e> <s> will the government be very careful in future with regard to the programme and the establishment there <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that any of us would agree with my noble friend lord trenchard when he apologised for taking too long <e> <s> having removed his fishery figleaf which he has been wearing for so long it is quite clear not only that he has done a great deal of fishing but that he also knows a great deal about fishery matters <e> <s> that of course applies to all the speakers whom we have heard today <e> <s> i do not think anybody would dare to stand up in this debate and talk about salmon unless they knew a little bit about the subject <e>", "<cs> if i may comment very briefly without entering into the argument between the east and the west coast of scotland i support very much what has been said by various noble lords and by the noble baroness lady white about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the noble baroness speaks with a great deal of experience because of her position in the university of wales institute of science and technology <e> <s> that is very important <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i beg to move that the bill he now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have a right of reply and my reply will be very short <e> <s> i should like to thank my noble friend lord glenarthur for voicing the governments fair wind to this bill <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord prys-davies for his support <e> <s> i should like to return to a reference i made in my earlier speech to the liberal benches and to say to the noble earl lord grey that i meant no rudery if i may say so <e> <s> i merely wished to make some reference to the liberal party in view of the fact that david lloyd george had some hand in something that happened to the welsh church some years ago <e> <s> i do not want to go into that issue further but i should like to say that i am most grateful to noble lords for not impeding this bill in any way <e> <s> i hope that it will be able to go through its other stages with equal speed <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords when my noble friend looks into this matter will he not find that the diversification of industry in wales and particularly in south wales has been one of the outstanding achievements of the present government <e> <s> although the figures are still far too high the ongoing success there is well worth recognising <e>", "<cs> i came to hear the speech of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make a short comment <e> <s> i am rather disturbed that the two baronesses opposite have taken a rather strong line on planning control of forestry <e> <s> i say to them only this <e> <s> as the noble baroness has intimated i am in the industry and have been all my life <e> <s> i do not think planning control is the right answer <e> <s> the present situation run as it is by regional advisory committees may not be perfect <e> <s> it certainly does not suit everybody <e> <s> however i would point out to the noble baroness lady nicol that we must remember that we have a very small industry <e> <s> it is not just the planting which counts it is employment in the sawmills and other ancillary parts of the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that so far as grants for the renovation of houses are concerned the government might do well to look into the methods by which the local authorities are not empowered to insist that the tender submitted is carried out by the original builder <e> <s> this is a sphere where the government might be able to help <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble baroness lady stedman is happy with the result of the debate which she initiated <e> <s> i have been very interested in all the contributions which have been made <e> <s> it is a pity that the television cameras are not here today when we are discussing a matter of far greater importance than some of the issues upon which we normally spend much of our time <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make a quick point to my noble friend <e> <s> those schemes are limited to the disposal of mature trees which have fallen in such great quantity <e> <s> the fact is that many of the trees are of great value owned largely by people who have no knowledge of forestry prices <e> <s> will the government in their advice to the general public point out that the first cowboy to come along must not necessarily be sold the big trees <e> <s> will they also point out to those people in this unfortunate position that although there are certain trees such as cherry ash sycamore and pine which will have to be picked off the ground before next april oak and other hardwoods will last upwards of two to three years <e>", "<cs> my lords might i quickly from these benches just thank <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for covering the point that i was going to raise <e> <s> i should like it to be known from these benches that we too very much sympathise as others have said with those who are related to the victims <e>", "<cs> my lords i know the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord carter for introducing this debate and for the excellent speech he has made particularly relating to the employment aspects of forestry <e> <s> i am a practical working forester and owner of woodlands <e> <s> i was for years a forestry commissioner <e> <s> i am chairman of timber growers united kingdom which represents all private forestry <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies may i support this amendment <e> <s> i shall not repeat the arguments put so well by the noble lord lord moran whose knowledge of this subject is immense <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter which affects a number of people personally <e> <s> i cannot confess to a personal interest in the matter but i confess to an interest because i am chairman of the royal welsh show which has the largest showing of welsh ponies and cobs in the world <e> <s> the meeting will be held in a fortnights time <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to disagree with my noble friend about this matter because no doubt she has studied this part of the bill in greater depth than i have <e> <s> however as someone who lives by a river within spitting distance of a large reservoir i understood her to suggest that the nra should not have the same powers over the reservoir as it should over the river <e> <s> i do not go along with that argument <e>", "<cs> this is an important amendment <e> <s> i should like to support it <e> <s> the question of minimum acceptable flow is a very important matter to the general public and in particular to the riparian owners <e> <s> it affects in particular an area where there is compensation water let out by a reservoir on an agreed statutory provision <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend could later given me an assurance that the plcs when they take over the water will have the same responsibility for the compensation water that the present water authorities have <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add one point to the very powerful speeches made on this point <e> <s> for some time the water authorities had discretionary powers to set minimum acceptable flows for inland waters <e> <s> as the noble lord lord moran said in some cases they failed to come up to expectations <e> <s> the nra will be given those discretionary powers under clause <e> <s> however in my view the nra will be very short of money and the temptation to <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add a brief word to the discussion on the issue <e> <s> all that amendment no <e> <s> is trying to do is put some teeth into the regional fisheries advisory committees <e> <s> under the present system there has been a great deal of <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate initiated by my noble friend lord radnor has brought forth a great number of views on what is a complicated industry the forestry industry <e> <s> the past few years have seen some dramatic changes in the industry both in the woods and in the mills <e> <s> we have also seen changes in the attitude of the general public towards forestry and of foresters towards the other claims on woodland areas <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that it does not matter which secretary of state in this administration produced the plan <e> <s> the fact is that in south wales there has never before been a venture such as this and most people in wales recognise it for what it is <e>", "<cs> we all have a different view on this subject <e> <s> i should like to say briefly why i have some doubts about the necessity of bringing in legislation <e>"]
