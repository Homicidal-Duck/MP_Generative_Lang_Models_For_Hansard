["<cs> my lords i find myself in this debate in the unhappy position of being in a minority i think probably of one in viewing the plans of the government and their many supporters round the house with an increasing measure of incredulity <e> <s> i propose to take advantage of the point made by the noble lord lord shackleton that we should treat this debate in the broad general sense <e> <s> i know that some of the points that i may have to make may be unpopular but at least i can offer your lordships the consolation that i shall make no further mention of fish <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords when i said the campaign i was referring of course in the first instance to the military campaign of two years ago <e> <s> i thought i had made that abundantly clear <e> <s> if i have misled the noble lord in any way i should be happy to clarify it <e> <s> that is the only campaign to which i intended to make reference <e> <s> i had no other purpose in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that is that if we handed over complete sovereignty of the falklands to the argentines it would clearly no longer be our responsibility <e> <s> it would give this warning period of five years for them to make up their minds but any falkland islander who stayed would become subject to argentine foreign policy and system of law <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only accept the noble lords clarification <e> <s> i did not have his speech particularly in mind when i was talking about a conflagration <e> <s> it was my thought that any relevant conflagration would be in antarctica or around south america <e> <s> but i take his point that we do not want one to originate anywhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to return briefly to the main subject of this debate the subject of unemployment <e> <s> one of the surprising features of unemployment and the sudden rise that has occurred over the last decade or so is how it has taken us by surprise <e> <s> when i think back to my youth and i am sure this goes a great deal further back than that we were being warned by writers economists and forecasters that we were advancing to what was often called a post-industrial society a society where machines would do the drudgery and where men would be free to do what they wished to follow their hobbies and to lead a fuller life <e> <s> it has been held up to us as a most attractive advance for the human race <e> <s> but what is the reality <e> <s> this has not come to pass at all <e> <s> in fact we have heard a number described variously as million million or million of unemployed <e> <s> it is a grave national problem and a source of constant misery to a large minority of our population <e>", "<cs> my lords one industry that has suffered more than its fair share of drama in the past months since last years debate is the oil industry and as i have spent a large part of my adult life in that industry i view the drama with perhaps more interest than most <e> <s> moreover what has happened in the oil industry both to the economy and to employment fits quite neatly within the confines of this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there is a fair measure of consensus in this country that some of the economic decline that we have suffered over the past three or four decades has been due in part to the behaviour of the trade unions and their members <e> <s> that is not the only reason <e> <s> however it is one of the main reasons and it follows from that that the present government have embarked on the various legislative measures which they have undertaken <e> <s> that is why we have in front of us today the green paper which seeks our views on proposals for new legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord hunter of newington for introducing a debate on what i conceive to be a very important subject <e> <s> i believe that its importance is not widely recognised by the british public who probably see it as a rather marginal issue and not nearly as exciting as the discussion on theories and policies on education which fill the media today <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to add my congratulations to the noble marquess lord aberdeen and temair on his maiden speech <e> <s> it is a real pleasure to welcome among us a practising artist there are all too few <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank the noble lord lord hatch of lusby for introducing this debate on a most important subject which has particular relevance to british foreign policy <e> <s> i have not had the opportunity to visit some of the southern african states which he very properly mentioned but i had the pleasure of visiting the republic last year <e> <s> it is of my experience there the opinions that i formed and the discussions that i had that i wish to speak today <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by congratulating the noble baroness lady turner of camden on her perseverance in ensuring that the debate has taken place <e> <s> it may lack the excitement of soccer hooliganism but it is arguably more important to the countrys future <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by thanking the noble lord lord moran for his kind words about the work done by our committee which i know that all the members will appreciate <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord lord peston opened this debate he said that there <e>", "<cs> my lords while the attention of this house and of the public outside has been focused on the military and political aspects of the immediate crisis it might be worth spending a little time looking at the general background and longer-term considerations of the position in the gulf <e>"]
