["<cs> my lords i can certainly do so <e> <s> i was hoping that i might be free to do so when i wind up if the noble lord will forgive me <e> <s> if the noble lord will not be here at such a late hour may i say very briefly that the provision of shelter accommodation which i know is an absolutely vital question forms part of my right honourable friends review <e> <s> meanwhile going on within the home office and it has been going on for some time is a most urgent study of how it may be possible to advise the public that they can have easily-provided family shelters against <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord peart for the speech he has just made <e> <s> as a senior minister in the previous government over a period of many years the noble lord knows what needs to be done in this field <e> <s> it was the noble lord lord shinwell in his remarks during this debate who said that it was essential in his view that your lordships house should have this debate <e> <s> indeed we are indebted to the noble lord lord clifford of chudleigh for the debate which has been important for civil defence planning in this country <e> <s> i should like to give an assurance to the noble lord lord hunt <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord for misinterpreting the speech he made to the house and i repeat that apology <e> <s> but the issue surely is whether one conducts ones foreign policy from a position of strength or from a position of weakness <e> <s> i have to say to this house that this government follow the previous administration in doing our very best to follow our foreign policy from a position of a firm defence and civil defence policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble lord that the handling and treatment of long-term and violent prisoners is not successful in this country <e> <s> in england and wales we have the dispersal systemthe prison at grendon has its therapeutic regimethere is c wing at parkhurst which exists as a structured regime for prisoners who suffer from mental disorders and of course there are a number of prison hospital annexes <e> <s> in addition to that the noble lord referred to the rehabilitation of prisoners in the community <e> <s> this is what the parole system and the pre-release employment scheme are all about <e> <s> the visit of officials from my right honourable friends department is precisely to meet the second point which the noble lord put to us <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i know and this falls slightly but not completely outside the question the noble lord is asking what the noble baroness is saying is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly take into account what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to say to the noble lord that that question falls very far wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with what the noble lord said to begin with and i should like to make that crystal clear <e> <s> so far as the subsequent remarks of the noble lord are concerned may i repeat that although the barlinnie experiment is so far as we know and there is no research on the subject a very interesting one it involves a very heavy commitment so far as resources are concerned for the prison service <e> <s> the prison service in scotland is in better shape so far as numbers of prison officers is concerned than in the rest of the united kingdom <e> <s> it is for that reason that i had to say to the noble lord in my first reply that this is a matter finally for my right honourable friend the secretary of state for northern ireland to decide <e>", "<cs> yes my lords indeed i would <e>", "<cs> the amendment which the noble baroness lady david has moved is in fact if she will forgive me for saying so a wrecking amendment <e> <s> it would effectively remove from authorities any obligation to meet parental preferences and would put their decisions beyond the challenge of appeal committees <e> <s> the noble baroness asked a question of my noble friend to which i shall try to give the answer <e> <s> as i understand it the question relates to clause <e> <s> that reads <e>", "<cs> i do not like to be unhelpful to the noble baroness but i do not think that this amendment is acceptable <e> <s> the situation as we see it is that an authority or governors of a voluntary school will only refuse a child admission if they believe that they are not under a duty to admit him or her <e> <s> if they wish to plead that the childs admission would prejudice the provision of efficient education or the efficient use of resources they must have good grounds for believing so which will stand up to challenge on appeal <e> <s> these are bound to relate to their own locality but the considerations involved may it is true cross local education authority boundaries <e> <s> your lordships will notice that the provisions of clause <e>", "<cs> may i try to do a little better for the noble lord and as i am not quite as familar with this as my noble friends on these benches i may help myself at the same time <e> <s> if i am not out of order may we look one clause ahead to clause and i shall keep this brief because i think this is getting rather near to offending against the rules of order <e> <s> i think that the answer to the noble lord lord ross is this <e> <s> the way in which an appeal and i am thinking of the point which the noble lord made will work so far as this point is concerned is that the arrangements which the local authority will have made for admissions to schools will be published and that is required in another completely different clause clause <e> <s> should a parent be dissatisfied the parent will have the opportunity to go to an appeal committee under clause and put his case <e> <s> the committee will be bound to have regard to the authoritys published admission arrangements but it will be for the local authority to demonstrate that any limitations on parental preferences which are set out by the arrangements are justifiable in terms of the provision of efficient education which is what the noble lord is asking about or the efficient use of resources <e> <s> it will be for the appeal committee to listen to the case which the local authority is makingto listen to the case the parent is putting and to decide on those two criteria if those are the two criteria which are relevant to the appeal whether the parents appeal has been made out or whether it has not <e>", "<cs> at the end of quite a long interchange may i remind the committee that the effect of this amendment would be to do away completely with selective education <e> <s> i thought it might be a good idea to remind ourselves what we are talking about <e> <s> i remember very well when the noble lord lord heycock and i met for the first timeit was a long time ago now <e> <s> it is perfectly true that he and i met because he wished to establish a comprehensive school in the local authority area in wales which he <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should tell the committee the reasons why the government decided on these provisions <e> <s> there were three options open to the government in pursuing their view of the rightness of providing an appeal procedure for parents <e> <s> let me set them out <e> <s> one could have had a totally independent form of appeal committeeone could have had an appeal committee which was independent but advisory only or one could have had some other form of committee <e>", "<cs> i think that the meaning of sub-paragraph is absolutely as the words denote <e> <s> it states that <e>", "<cs> i will certainly take it away <e> <s> i am not entirely sure that large parts of the bill are clear to me <e> <s> that is no reflection on the draftsman the department or anybody else <e> <s> it is simply a reflection upon me and probably the time at which your lordships committee is only just starting to sit this evening <e> <s> of course i will ask my right honourable friend the secretary of state at the department of education whether this can be looked at again <e> <s> the difficulty is that sub-paragraph is put in the negative <e> <s> but of course i will ask the department whether it can be put more clearly and will be ready to reply to my noble friend if he raises the matter again <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the answer is yes in england only <e>", "<cs> i am surprised to hear what the noble baroness lady david says <e> <s> i know that she is not only very experienced in these matters but that she is always very fair <e> <s> i have to say to <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend lady young has been at pains to try to say this evening we are trying to make sure that authorities emulate the best practice of other local authorities <e> <s> it may well be that some of the local authorities which the noble baroness has just mentioned are ones that have co-opted members authorities which have gone to very great pains as many of them i know have done over the years to try to see that politics do not obtrude too much in their educational affairs locally <e>", "<cs> i think that it has rather slipped the mind of the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge that voluntary aided schools are not the same as county schools or indeed controlled schools <e> <s> the governors of aided and special agreement schools are after all responsible for admissions <e> <s> therefore i put it to the noble lord that it seems to be right if we leave the making of appeal arrangements in the hands of the governors of these schools <e> <s> clause provides for the local education authorities to do what the noble lord wants donenamely to publish the details of the arrangements of voluntary aided schools about their admissons procedures but by mutual agreement <e>", "<cs> i do not think there is very much between the two sides of the committee <e> <s> what the noble lord is asking us to agree to can be done by agreement specifically set out in writing in clause <e> <s> all the government are saying is that they do not want to make it a draconian measure <e> <s> because of the long tradition of voluntary aided school governors being responsible so far as possible for their affairs we would like to see not only the preparing of the admission procedures remaining in the hands of the governors of voluntary schools but the publication of them as well unless by agreement the governors of voluntary schools take the same line as lord donaldson and they look at clause and say very well we will get the local education authority to do this for us <e>", "<cs> that is right <e> <s> my lords surely this exchange has been helpful because the question which the noble baroness put and the final remarks of the noble lord lord donaldson persuade me that the regulations are going to have to be put in a clear way <e> <s> we must consider how the general public can most easily read the published details both for the county schools and for the voluntary schools and understand what the admission arrangements are <e> <s> i should not like the noble lord to think that as a result of this exchange i and representatives of the department have not been listening <e> <s> i am sure that to that extent this amendment has been valuable and helpful <e>", "<cs> i very rarely use the word promise and i have not done so this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer to my noble friend is that <e>", "<cs> i would rather not look forward at this stage to forthcoming clauses <e> <s> i would tell the noble lord lord avebury before we leave this amendment that the matter is clearly set out <e> <s> the responsibility for preparing admission arrangements is upon the governors of aided schools and the local education authority of county and controlled schools and the responsibility for publication rests in the same places both on the governors and on the local education authority <e> <s> we therefore not only believe it will be done but there is a statutory duty that it shall be done and we on this side of the committee believe that the statutory duty rests in the right place in both cases <e>", "<cs> i can give the noble lord an assurance that what he seeks to do by his amendment is already covered in the bill <e> <s> local education authorities and the governors of aided and special agreement schools are required to publish particulars of their admission arrangements and that is to be found in clause <e>", "<cs> i can give the assurance that the regulations determining the manner in which publication should take place will ensure what the noble lord is asking while leaving open the possibility of authorities charging for supplying information for other purposesfor instance someone wanting to do research <e> <s> with that proviso i give the noble lord the assurance he requires <e>", "<cs> i am genuinely grateful to the noble lord for the two points that he has made <e> <s> as regards the first point i realise that in another place concern has been expressed about the use of the procedures in clauses to so far as primary schoolchildren are concerned <e> <s> i point out to the noble lord that certainly we shall look at it again before the report stage <e> <s> i give the noble lord that assurance <e> <s> however i should like to make two points <e> <s> first i am sure that the noble lord would agree that the primary stage is no less important than the secondary stage <e> <s> indeed he in no way suggested that that was not the case <e> <s> his case was that the machinery was too cumbersome for the primary stagebut if one accepts the premise that the two stages of education are of equal importance then it is difficult to get away from the fact that they should therefore be treated in the same way from the point of view of appeals <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble lord has drawn attention to the nature and size of the annual intake of pupils because it brings pupils into clause which otherwise seems to deal only with capital expenditure matters <e> <s> however with regard to the nature of the annual intake of pupils i think that this is covered because as the section process under the education act stands at the moment if an authority wishes to make a significant change in the character of a school and that means for instance changing a school from being mixed to single-sexfrom being an to to a to schoolor from of course being selective to <e>", "<cs> that is a matter for the parliamentary draftsman <e>", "<cs> yes that is a matter for the parliamentary draftsman <e> <s> i think i have begun to learn enough about legislation to know that words are not put into legislation if the parliamentary draftsman takes the view that they would be otiose <e> <s> often i would be only too ready to agree with noble lords when they say they would like to put words into a bill and then i am generally told that the parliamentary draftsman will not agree because what parliament has to do is to produce legislation which is as effective as possible <e>", "<cs> without any hesitation i give the noble lord that assurance <e>", "<cs> might i first of all repeat because the noble lord lord mishcon was generous enough to mention it in moving the amendment that the government have written into the bill the requirement that if a nursery school is to be closed then the section procedure as we will call it must be gone through <e> <s> if i may say so without going into detail i think it is a very considerable advance on the situation which we find ourselves in today <e> <s> your lordships who took part in the second reading of this bill will know better than i do that the governments contention is that the duty which it was thought had been laid on local authorities by the education act had not really been a duty at all <e> <s> indeed what had been happening as anyone who had been taking an interest in nursery education over the years knows is that the duty had been regulated by successive governments by circular and so we do not stand today finding all our under-fives in school more is the pitywe find only a proportion of them in school <e>", "<cs> no a great advance <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord does so may i reply to the noble lord lord stewart of fulham about the point he made regarding clause <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that until when the then secretary of state for education withdrew the circular all secretaries of state for education among whom the noble lord opposite was a very distinguished one operated under what was called circular / <e> <s> if <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon has moved amendment no <e> <s> and has spoken to that amendment and to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> perhaps i may reply in the order in which he dealt with them <e> <s> as far as amendment no <e> <s> is concerned the effect of this being to widen the grounds for a clause procedure to include a significant change in an authoritys recruitment policy for an individual school the noble lord will appreciate that the drawing of catchment areas has never been a statutory requirement <e> <s> it has never had statutory authority <e> <s> although i realise that local education authorities will wish to continue to have school catchment areas clause let us not forget gives the parent the statutory right to choose a school regardless of where the family home is <e>", "<cs> the only thing i would add if i may is that so far as the first amendment that the noble lord lord mishcon moved is concerned that is amendment no <e> <s> to make any significant change in the manner of the area of recruitment of any school part of the section procedure i would just like to draw the noble baronesss and the noble lords attention to the fact that clause of the bill provides for the annual publication of details of admission arrangements including the policy followed in deciding admissions <e> <s> that means that parents should be in no doubt as to the prevailing arrangements and the catchment areas if any that are being used <e> <s> if i may say so that is a better way of getting across to the general public what the catchment areas for schools are bearing in mind that catchment areas are a non statutory procedure <e>", "<cs> the effect of the noble lords last three amendments nos <e> <s> c d and e would be that all objections relating to proposals affecting county schools should be sent to the secretary of state and not to the local authority concerned <e> <s> i can only say from my own brief experience many years ago that i know from working at the department of education that the procedure as it is at the moment is expensive time consuming and leads to delays <e> <s> at present all those entitled to do so submit their objections direct to the secretary of state and then are referred back by the department to the local authority concerned for their observations since without these comments the secretary of state cannot give due weight to the objections when he considers whether to approve the proposals <e> <s> it is to try to get round this that the new procedure in clause which the noble lord is criticising has been put in <e>", "<cs> if a proposal attracts no objections and is therefore decided under clause i think we may reasonably assume that it is in accordance with local needs and wishesin other words there have not been any objections <e> <s> therefore i do not see why it is necessary to place on the authority a duty to do more than is expected of the secretary of state in the case of proposals which are opposed <e>", "<cs> i am not speaking with advice now <e> <s> most certainly we will look at it but my assumption is that it is not inconceivable if this bill becomes law that at some stage there may well be an accompanying circular or some form of advice which will flow from my right honourable friends department to local authorities <e> <s> i should have thought that that would be the appropriate way in which modification could be interpreted <e> <s> i know that does not satisfy the point that the noble lord has put to me and we will certainly look at the wording of the clause in the light of what he has said <e> <s> in the meanwhile may i leave him with the assurance which i gave to him when i gave my first reply <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the right reverend prelate for what he has said because i think that amendments nos <e> <s> and are not reasonable <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would place a duty on authorities to consult with the governors of all county schools as well as with governors of voluntary schools that might be affected by a proposal relating to a voluntary school <e> <s> frankly do not think that is reasonable <e> <s> i do not want to rehearse the arguments at this late hour but i think that what the right reverend prelate has said about this pushing consultation further than was reasonable fills the bill <e>", "<cs> the answer to the noble lords question is yes <e>", "<cs> what a sensible wording of an amendment <e> <s> however i am afraid that i cannot possibly accept it <e> <s> the truth of the matter is that local education authorities bear a share of the maintenance costs of the premises of voluntary aided schools and it is plainly right that they should be consulted about building projects designed by architects employed by promoters or governors <e> <s> to that extent i genuinely agree abso lutely with the noble lord lord mishcon and the noble baroness lady birk that there must be consultation for the reason given <e>", "<cs> so far as amendment no <e> <s> is concerned the deletion proposed by this amendment would remove the duty on authorities and governors to publish their proposals in such a manner as required by regulations made by the secretary of state <e> <s> i should assure noble lords that it is intended that the regulations referred to in this clause should be on the same lines as the county and voluntary schools notices regulations <e> <s> they will lay down where the proposals should be publishedthat is in one local newspaper at or near any main entrance to the school concerned and in at least one other conspicuous place within the area <e> <s> that of course is the minimum <e>", "<cs> the amendment which the noble lord has moved is concerned with educational and training opportunities and financial support for those who have the misfortune to be made redundant and who may wish or indeed need to retrain for a new occupation <e> <s> the amendment impinges not only on the student award system but also on the special provisions made by the manpower services commission <e> <s> the noble lord said in moving the amendment that he hoped it would commend itself to the government <e> <s> i do not think that anything that the noble lord said would not commend itself to members of the committee but in this country we live in a real and at the moment a harsh economic world and in view of the provision which is already made by local education authorities and in particular by the manpower services commission i do not feel that it would be possible to create a further scheme to enable the secretary of state for education and science to bestow grants in the way that the noble lord would wish <e> <s> it is for that reason that i cannot accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> the clause to which the noble lord has drawn attention will make it possible for my right honourable friend the secretary of state for wales to pay specific grants towards the costs of teaching the welsh language and the use of welsh as a medium for teaching other subjects <e> <s> your lordships will be delighted to hear that it is identical in terms with a clause in the education bill introduced by the last administration in and lost with the election of last year <e>", "<cs> that is not in my brief <e> <s> what is in my brief are these words wales enjoys a rich and ancient culture distinct from englands <e> <s> its cornerstone is the welsh language <e>", "<cs> the amendment is not necessary <e> <s> section of the education act already prohibits charging in respect of admission to any school maintained by a local education authority and in respect of the education provided in such a school <e> <s> therefore it would not be possible for a drafting reason to write it into the bill <e>", "<cs> i have no idea <e>", "<cs> perhaps i had better first say that i have thought of the answer to my noble friend <e> <s> the answer subject to any correction is that it would not have any effect upon charges in a voluntary aided school <e> <s> perhaps i rather live in the past so far as this is concerned <e> <s> it occurred to me when i was looking at this amendment before your lordships met this evening that when in the s the plowden report was published the noble baroness will remember that there was in that report a minority report on the possibilities of charging for nursery education <e>"]
