["<cs> my lords that is why i specifically mentioned consultation just before i sat down <e> <s> so far as the expression of a point of view is concerned i think the government were very conscious of the feelings of the people in this country to which my noble and learned friend lord hailsham referred in his speech following what has been one of the most disastrous winters that this country can remember certainly in my lifetime <e>", "<cs> no my lords i have not and the noble lord like me will have to wait for a reply from my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> my noble friend lord de clifford asked for more money for roads <e> <s> although that is of course for my honourable friend the minister of transport to concentrate on the thing which i feel so strongly about on this was mentioned with greater clarity than i could possibly achieve by my noble friend lord wolverton who explained to your lordships in his short speech the heavy burdens which have been placed on county authorities by the shift in the needs element of the rate support grant by the government which have just left office <e> <s> if something can be done about this then i believe my noble friends question is answered <e> <s> i shall certainly draw the attention of the minister of transport to what my noble friend has said and incidentally at the same time if i may i will draw the attention of the secretary of state for the environment to the interesting remarks which my noble friend made about dogs <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter which is being considered now by the property services agency whose activities are the responsibility of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords i take to heart what the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts has said about not being too precipitate but in fairness to my noble friend lord swansea i should say that monies have been expended on preparatory work to convert the old coal exchange building for use by the welsh assembly <e> <s> the building is held on a lease and there is a current annual cost of rent and maintenance of <e> <s> obviously such factors must be borne very much in mind <e> <s> with regard to the second part of the noble lords supplementary question i think it is fair for me to say to him that the conservative manifesto for wales stated that the government intend to examine ways of improving government and administration in wales <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord lord wells-pestell for his support of this order <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that the time has certainly come when the position of the pool competitions which are covered by this order and of lotteries in general should be looked at <e> <s> that is precisely what the home office is doing at present in considering the comments of the royal commission on gambling <e>", "<cs> my lords under rule of the rules for control on entry it falls to the port medical inspector to use his clinical judgment as to the disposal of someone in this unfortunate position <e> <s> i am aware of the case of mr choonara to whom the noble lord referred <e> <s> it is true that mr choonara had to go to the hospital wing at pentonville because there <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a question of the statute law and the practicalities of where people can be placed <e> <s> the law is quite clear <e> <s> under rule it falls to the port medical inspector to use his judgment <e> <s> in the case of mr choonara the best arrangements possible have been made which have been successively hospital the hospital wing at pentonville and now once again for i hope a short time hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not seen the evidence to which the noble lord has particularly referred in the wealth of evidence which has been put before the may commission <e> <s> i hope i indicated in my reply to the noble lord lord brockway that i agree with the tenor of the question which he has asked but having said that with reference to the specific examples which the noble lord has given me may i just say that so far as concerns the power of the home office to free those who are awaiting possible deportation close checks are regularly made into the continuing need to detain them but it has to be borne in mind that if a court or the home secretary has ordered that a person be detained until a final decision is reached on deportation then usually in that case there has been a complete disregard of the rules governing immigration control <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the courts are concerned the government are pressing ahead with plans which have in fact been inherited from the previous government for more court building <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for saying that he is content with my reply <e> <s> with respect to what he then said i am not aware of what he has put to me about decisions being taken because deportation is being considered <e> <s> i should like to make it crystal clear that that is directly contrary to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to be unhelpful but it is not possible to make comparisons between the cases which the noble lord had asked me about and all the other parole cases because the numbers of cases where parole is to be followed by deportation is so infinitesimal compared to the enormous number of other parole cases <e>", "<cs> my lords that is for the local review committee or parole board to consider <e>", "<cs> my lords persons and organisations have sent in comments on the green paper <e> <s> i doubt whether your lordships house would consider the printing of a long list of names in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i will consider the noble lords suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords we have already had a green paper from the previous government <e> <s> i am not sure what shade another green paper would take possibly paler but i hope not <e> <s> for those reasons i am sure that the noble lord will understand me when i say that i am not sympathetic and my right honourable friend is not sympathetic to the issue of another green paper <e> <s> but of course we will consider what the noble lord has suggested regarding a white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords this afternoon your lordships have expressed different views about the merits of this bill but i join with the noble lord lord boston of faversham to whom i was most grateful for his characteristically kind remarks in saying that i am sure the whole house can at least agree that the noble baroness lady wootton of abinger can be applauded for her tenacity <e> <s> the noble baroness piloted this bill through to report stage in the last parliament and she has been quick to seize the opportunity of the new parliament in order to present the bill again to your lordships house <e> <s> on the last occasion the divergence of opinion as recorded both in the debate and in the division lobbies crossed party lines <e> <s> so it is against this background that the government have looked afresh at the contents of the bill and have considered what advice i might try to offer to your lordships upon it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the right reverend prelate for what he has said <e> <s> i agree with what he said <e> <s> when all is said and done good friday and easter sunday comprise the most solemn dates in the christian calendar <e> <s> arising from what the right reverend prelate said if the noble lord lord airedale will forgive me i think really that the first part of his question is based on something of a misconception <e> <s> the noble lord may be aware that of the last easter days six have fallen on dates other than the date contemplated by the act and of those six easter days four fell earlier and of the four only one was colder <e>", "<cs> my lords i must have notice of that <e>", "<cs> my lords let me end this discussion by saying that my brief goes back only to <e>", "<cs> my lords that is my understanding <e> <s> the only gloss which i would put on the noble and learned lords remarks is that there was to have been a pan-orthodox holy synod convened for <e> <s> when the moment came it was not held <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that discussions on the disposal of these funds have been going on for a very long time indeed and my noble friend and other noble lords

talks in february the brewers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a position this evening to be able to say that it will be published <e> <s> this is a matter which the noble lord may care to discuss with my right honourable friend when he speaks to him at the home office <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may at this stage reply to the noble lord lord wells-pestell i am grateful for what he said and the answers that i have to the questions which he has put to me are that i am sure that commander cass will make his report as quickly as possible <e> <s> the report will go to the coroner and to the director of public prosecutions <e> <s> but i am sure the noble lord will agree with me that it would not be right for my right honourable friend the home secretary to interfere with that process <e>", "<cs> but i will reply to him on the london borough of brent <e> <s> as i understand it the facts are that during the parliamentary election campaign the borough of brent declined to make a room available for the use of the national front <e> <s> the national front then sought redress in the high court and a direction that a room should be made available <e> <s> as in other cases the judge declined to consider the case in the time available <e> <s> the noble lord did not say that he said that in fact one of the sides to the case won <e> <s> the judge did not rule as implied in press reports in favour of the councils decision <e> <s> the national front have not pursued any of the cases that they have brought to the point where such an authoritative ruling can be obtained <e> <s> it is in those circumstances that i think it is wise and i think the house would agree that it is wise to review the public order act <e>", "<cs> my lords this is enshrined in legislation which was passed by a government of which the noble lord was a popular and very hard <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord reminded me of that <e> <s> i must say that my right honourable friend agrees with the views which were clearly expressed by the noble and learned lord lord scarman that public inquiries should be used most sparingly and that they are no substitute for an effective complaints procedure or indeed for the courts <e> <s> that complaints procedure now exists and all the correct steps have been put into effect and are at this moment in effect <e> <s> therefore there is no need for a public inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may keep short my reply to the noble lord lord janner in view of the advice of my noble friend the noble lord opposite referred to the events of the s <e> <s> the fact is that the public order act provides powers only to ban marches and processions and the chief officer of police can only apply for such a ban when he believes that this is the only way in which serious public disorder can be prevented <e> <s> this matter is being looked at in the review of legislation which has been announced in the statement <e> <s> so far as amendment of the representation of the people act is concerned this as i have said is a matter for discussion between the political parties <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may reply to the noble lord lord hunt and my noble friend lord hylton in the statement my right honourable friend in another place said <e>", "<cs> my lords discussions were held before the day in question but the power which the noble lord hopes can be ascribed to the police does not exist and it would not have been possible for the police to do what the noble lord wishes they had done <e>", "<cs> my lords in this house we make a habit of expressing thanks to noble lords who are responsible for contributing subjects for debate <e> <s> however difficult the questions and the noble lord lord donaldson of kings-bridge has put his share of difficult questions raised in a debate in this house we are accustomed from the government bench to thank the noble lord who is responsible <e> <s> well i can genuinely say that i am grateful to the noble lord lord soper not only for teaching us how to make a wonderful speech but also because the problems presented by the prison system are matters for deep concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if i misrepresented the noble lord who has now made it quite clear <e> <s> i am really trying to put my own response to the king and morgan view into the general context of what i am attempting to say tonight but i wish to say a word about category a prisoners <e> <s> i feel there are three interrelated issues here <e> <s> first there is the question of how to deal with category a prisoners secondly there is the question of what is the appropriate rgime for longterm prisoners in conditions of high security where it has been the aim of successive governments to provide a liberal humane rgime within a secure perimeter and thirdly there is the recurring question of how to deal with long-term prisoners who present control problems <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i consider that the noble earl is pre-empting what he believes everybody else would believe as well <e> <s> the difficulty which i think the noble earl has disregarded is that while the government provide penal facilities they cannot prescribe how they are used <e> <s> that is the task not of your lordships house but of the courts <e> <s> legislation and other declarations of government policy in relation to sentencing practice can of course go some way to guide the courts i do not deny that but a wide discretion must be left to the courts <e> <s> therefore it is quite possible that new non-custodial facilities would not be used by the courts wholly or even mainly in place of custodial sentences <e> <s> the upward <e>", "<cs> that may be so my lords but all i can say to the noble lord is that the upward trend in the use of custodial sentences for instance over the last three years suggests that the courts would not be as ready as noble lords may seem to think to see a marked switch in sentencing practice towards non-custodial measures <e>", "<cs> yes my lords so far as i know the noble lord is right in thinking that and some of the extra places that i have indicated are i understand being provided at the present time <e> <s> if i have made a mistake about that i shall certainly write to the noble lord <e> <s> following that exchange it is right that i should mention that the noble lord asked specifically whether the government accept the butler point of view <e> <s> my right honourable friends the secretaries of state for the home department and for social services remain committed to the establishment of these units as a matter of priority <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> was at great pains to say that i have not myself had the opportunity to visit either leeds or manchester and i ended up by saying that i felt it would be wrong to think that detoxification centres are the only or indeed necessarily the most appropriate answer to this problem <e> <s> this may well mean that they are part of a pattern which is always good conservative logic <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to give the assurance for which my noble friend asks but that is a matter for the police <e> <s> we will of course look at the legislative timetable as regards her point about legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends on ones view about the sale of alcohol <e>", "<cs> my lords not as far as i know <e>", "<cs> my lords the government intend to publish an assessment of the working of the parole scheme after the first years <e> <s> the paper will include discussion of the feasibility of giving reasons for the refusal of parole <e> <s> the government feel it right however to say that on the available evidence the giving of reasons would be incompatible with the present parole scheme and would make unacceptable demands on resources <e>", "<cs> my lords the parole system is not arbitrary or capricious <e> <s> it is run by volunteers and it works very well indeed as the last report of the parole board confirms <e> <s> i am happy to be able to tell the noble lord that it is the intention of the government to put together the findings of the parole board which the noble lord asked me about the findings of the local review committees which were undertaken and ended in december and also the findings of the review which has been going on within the home office about the general working of the parole scheme and in answer to the noble lords question to put all that together in a government paper <e> <s> that is the assurance that the noble lord asked me to give him <e> <s> so far as deportees are concerned i have previously replied to the noble lord on that particular subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to seem evasive on that but at the moment we are still formulating our ideas as to the form the assessment will take <e> <s> i do not think that i can go any further than that this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly take into account the remarks of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the expense of the scheme is very much in our minds <e> <s> this of course is one of the things which i would ask noble lords and other people who will read the paper when it is published to take into account <e> <s> may i just add that i think it is natural that there should be a wish for reasons to be given for decisions which affect a prisoners liberty but the difficulties of actually doing this are formidable <e> <s> what i am asking is that your lordships would wait to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not think that i can go further than i have this afternoon <e> <s> i have in essence answered the question which the noble lord put to me which was will there be a government paper <e> <s> my answer is yes <e> <s> with that i hope your lordships will be content <e>", "<cs> that is quite right my lords i confirm what the noble earl has said <e> <s> my answer to the noble lord lord boston and indeed to other noble lords who quite rightly want to know the governments position in this matter is that although the recommendations are being considered urgently and when i use the word urgently i mean urgently certainly it is the case that we have not yet been able to give our response to the recommendatons of the working party <e> <s> but today i am in a position to say that undoubtedly there will have to be a revised scheme in which the government will be accepting certainly the more detailed administrative improvements recommended by the working party but it would obviously be wise to have a trial period before moving to legislation <e> <s> but i join <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to hear that <e> <s> the fact is that if the noble earl is going to the trouble of setting up boards around the country he is in fact jettisoning the very cheap economical straightforward and informal system existing at the present time <e>", "<cs> i will give way in a moment <e> <s> if the noble earl will agree to do this his bill will have helped in a practical way the victims of violence <e>", "<cs> my lords on the assessment how compensation is to be paid <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl will forgive me it is absolutely fundamental <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right to take this question seriously <e> <s> in and again in there were over injuries connected with the commission of in <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter which we will be considering along with all other matters connected with air weapons <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we most certainly will <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that comes quite within the scope of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree the noble lord is right about this <e> <s> but it is also right to bear in mind that the misuse of an air weapon or indeed a crossbow would almost certainly involve <e>", "<cs> no my lords one does not <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones for his acceptance of this order <e> <s> the noble and learned lord and indeed many of his noble friends some of whom are sitting in the house this afternoon together with my noble friend lord elton and other of his noble friends laboured long and seriously over the bill <e> <s> if in office my noble friend lord elton had not disappeared across the water to northern ireland i am sure that he would have wished to reciprocate the noble and learned lords courteous and humorous remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble and learned lord has bowled me out <e> <s> i should like if i may to write to him on the matter <e> <s> this will of course be a committee of another place <e>", "<cs> and as the noble and learned lord would be the first to tell me it will be within their remit to decide where they will sit <e> <s> none the less i should like to collect what information i can gather on that point and write to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> as i was saying i think that this is not a bad start <e> <s> whereas at the beginning i said that noble lords all agreed in one sense with the noble and learned lord perhaps it is fair to me to say that noble lords speaking in this debate have also in essence said that if there is not to be a devolution bill this is not a bad way of making a fresh start <e> <s> in the hope that <e>", "<cs> my lords it was parliaments decision that for these first direct elections the united kingdom representatives should be elected according to the system used in parliamentary elections namely the first-past-the-post system <e> <s> my noble friend then asked me for an undertaking <e> <s> under the eec treaty it is for the directly-elected assembly to propose a uniform electoral procedure and for the council of ministers to agree it unanimously <e> <s> and if there is to be an alteration in the election procedure that will be the procedure <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that question arises from my noble friends original question <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as that question is concerned i repeat that it is a matter for the directly-elected assembly followed or not followed by ratification by the council of ministers <e> <s> i think that this is a separate matter from questions of procedure for general elections to the parliament at westminster <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i know the noble lord is right <e> <s> we are unique <e> <s> but then parliament in this country mercifully is unique <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot speak for the policy of the party of noble lords opposite <e> <s> i think that it is a simpler matter that it was asking rather a lot of some people in this country to vote in three different elections within a period of only four to five weeks <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords those who would be prevented by a ban from marching would still be free of course to organise a meeting and that too could give rise to severe disorder and inconvenience <e> <s> while therefore i fully sympathise with my noble friends desire to minimise disturbance to the general public to ban all marches might not achieve that objective <e> <s> my right honourable friend will certainly look at this issue very closely indeed in the review which he has instituted <e> <s> may i just remind the house that he has also undertaken that on any matter touching the representation of the people act there will be consultations with the parties in the normal way <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think this is what my noble friend lord duncan-sandys is getting at at all <e> <s> the vast majority of processions i entirely agree with the noble lord lord blyton do not cause major inconvenience or disorder <e> <s> i think the point which my noble friend was getting at is that there is a need to find a balance which so far as is possible reconciles the rights of those who wish to protest with the rights of ordinary people who want to go about their daily lives in peace <e>", "<cs> my lords it is if i may say so because the noble and learned lord has hit the nail on the head with regard to the difficulty of making distinctions in these matters that my right honourable friend felt that the time had come for a review of the act and related legislation <e> <s> with regard to the second supplementary question about the timing which the noble and learned lord put to me your lordships might wish to know that my right honourable friends review initially will take place within his department <e> <s> naturally it will take into account points of view put in both houses of parliament not least the expressions of opinion put by your lordships today and then my right honourable friend will wish to consult organisations principally interested <e> <s> after that my right honourable friend will consider what further procedural steps will be necessary in the light of that initial work <e> <s> i am sure the noble and learned lord will acquit me of any discourtesy if i say that i cannot put a timescale on it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may be right but it is because the answers to the questions which he puts are obscure that my right honourable friend has felt it necessary now to undertake a review <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the concern which the noble lord expresses but it is part of our democratic tradition that people should be free to express their views however unpalatable they may be to others so long as they keep within the law <e> <s> it is the review of the law which my right honourable friend has felt is necessary at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i gave an undertaking a few minutes ago that the subject matter of my noble friends question will certainly be taken seriously into account in the review that my right honourable friend is undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords the impression i have gained from the speeches which have been made by your lordships this evening is that in the words of the noble and learned lord lord gardiner this is not an easy question <e> <s> should committal proceedings be published <e> <s> that is the issue into which the committee under lord justice tucker was asked to inquire years ago the tucker commitee recommended that unless the accused was discharged or the trial was ended any report of committal proceedings should be restricted to a recital of the main particulars <e> <s> nine years later the government of the day took a somewhat different view although the criminal justice act provided that there should not be publicity for committal proceedings it none the less enabled a defendant who preferred publicity to secure as of right that the restrictions on reporting should not apply in his case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i was afraid that the noble and learned lord would ask that question following upon the remarks made by the noble and learned lord lord gardiner on this matter <e> <s> i have not the answer readily available and i think it would be for the convenience of the house if i wrote to the noble and learned lord and perhaps made other speakers in the debate aware of the letter i was writing to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord will know that it is the practice of the independent broadcasting authority to seek substantial information from prospective groups about the local nature of the programmes to be provided and elements of local ownership and knowledge in the composition of the applicant groups and companies <e> <s> after that it is a matter for the independent broadcasting authority to decide to which companies to award the franchises <e> <s> so far as the noble lords second question is concerned it really is not a matter of my right honourable friend approving or disapproving of the practices which the noble lord outlined <e> <s> giving the franchises is a matter for the independent broadcasting authority <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord says is my right honourable friend going to do something <e> <s> he is really asking me whether my right honourable friend will put something into legislation <e> <s> i must put it to the noble lord that there may be circumstances either in which no application from a locally owned company is forthcoming or in which an application from a locally owned company may in the authoritys view be less satisfactory than another <e> <s> in those circumstances and subject to those considerations my right honourable friend the home secretary would see no reason to introduce provisions in his forthcoming bill to require the authority to depart from their policy of awarding the franchise to the applicant group which they consider would provide the best service for the locality <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not agree more with the noble lord and i assure him that this is precisely the policy of the independent broadcasting authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i give the noble lord an undertaking that i shall look with the greatest care at what he has said and that i shall draw the attention of my right honourable friend to what he and other noble lords have said this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the house will wish to take into account what the noble lord with all his experience in this field of the media has just said in the form of a question to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords it is unusual for a government circular to be the subject of a question in your lordships house but this it it is clear from the speeches made by noble lords tonight was an unusual circular and i am grateful to the noble baroness lady phillips for providing this opportunity to discuss it and for explaining so clearly the formidable problem which we are debating <e> <s> the circular was conceived at one of a series of conferences of selected chief constables held at ditchley in march <e> <s> the conference took as its subject juveniles and the police <e> <s> the programme involved two presentations one on the links between the police and the social services and the other on the links between the police and the education service <e> <s> this brought out very sharply i understand the extent to which co-operation between the police and local authority services and the probation service could make a substantial contribution to the treatment of children in trouble <e>", "<cs> my lords in this house your lordships come and go as you feel best and it would not be for me sitting on either the front bench or the back bench in any way to criticise the comings and goings of my noble friends <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for making that clear both to me and to your lordships house <e> <s> so far as the press council declaration in was concerned the noble and learned lord read out the exact words of that declaration which amounted as i have said in plain terms to a condemnation of payments or offer of payments to witnesses including witnesses in committal proceedings until the trial itself is over <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord inglewood for giving us an opportunity to discuss the role of her majestys inspectorate of constabulary <e> <s> it is timely because the report for last year comes out next wednesday and because the central task of the inspectorate that of promoting the efficiency of the policy service has never been more relevant <e> <s> again i am particularly grateful to my noble friend for this short debate this evening <e> <s> there has been a shortage in police establishment numbers for some years and the demands upon the police are such that even with the encouraging improvement in recruitment which we are seeing there are bound to be shortages for the foreseeable future <e> <s> in addition policing becomes an increasingly expensive operation and this must be so the more chief constables plan as they are planning for their police officers to concentrate closely upon community relations <e> <s> today the efficient use of resources therefore always important assumes increasing significance

equal opportunities commission <e> <s> i should like to point out to the noble lord and to my noble friend that the commission is of course independent in the day-to-day conduct of its business <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept what the noble lord has said <e> <s> he mentioned human rights <e> <s> it might be for the information of your lordships if i remind the house that the commission has published discussion documents on such subjects as taxation and the pension age <e> <s> it has published its findings on credit facilities for women and on services available from building societies for women <e> <s> full details of those and other matters are in the commissions annual reports the third of which was published on th june <e> <s> however i am sure that the noble lord lord boston of faversham will agree that none the less the commissions budget must be included in the governments overall review of public expenditure <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> perhaps we were just not too good at figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am right in saying that the commission is responsible for dealing with sex discrimination and equal pay <e> <s> i believe that the noble lords question falls within the scope of race relations <e> <s> if the noble lord would care to table a question about that i should be only too ready to do my best to reply on another occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i should like to think about that and will write to the noble lord <e> <s> if the noble lord feels that my answer was misconceived and would like to table a question i should be at his disposal to answer it on an appropriate future occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords my answer to the noble lords substantive question is no <e> <s> if the noble lord would like to table a question i repeat that i am at the disposal of your lordships to do my best to give whatever satisfaction i can to noble lords who wish to ask me further questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to tell the noble lord that the noble baroness lady lockwood who is the very distinguished chairman of the commission is present and has been listening <e> <s> if she wishes to discuss these matters with my right honourable friend or any of the junior ministers we are at her disposal <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have no evidence of such recruitment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have great regard for the noble lords views and the way he expresses them but i am not able to express displeasure on this occasion because although i am aware of the allegations made in the panorama programme i am not aware of any evidence that recruitment did in fact take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that it is not certain that private prosecutions for criminal libel would necessarily be inconsistent with the european convention this may or may not be the case <e> <s> this is one of the many reasons why the government think it appropriate to await the report of the law commission on the whole subject of criminal libel <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that my right honourable friend and others who read this exchange will be interested that it is the noble and learned lords view that the requiring of consent would get rid of the difficulty so far as the european convention is concerned <e> <s> however i am not entirely persuaded that that would totally clear up all the problems with regard to the law on criminal libel <e> <s> this is the reason why the government feel it is right to await the recommendations of the law commission <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i certainly agree with what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the european assembly pay and pensions bill be read a second time <e> <s> this bill provides for the payment of salaries and pensions to our representatives to the european parliament for the payment of severance grants to those who lose their seats at future general elections of representatives and for an order-making power so that the secretary of state may authorise the payment of allowances and facilities to assist representatives in the execution of their duties within the united kingdom <e> <s> it is therefore a short bill for which it is necessary to seek your lordships approval now so that the first payment of salary to our representatives may be made at the end of this month <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord boston lord shinwell and lord ardwick who have spoken on the second reading of this bill <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord boston for the welcome which he gave to it and particularly for his acceptance of the abated salary proposal and for the order-making power to be found in clause to allow expenses to be paid within the united kingdom if necessary <e> <s> as i said and i think it is right to repeat it since there has been a long interval since the beginning of this second reading the government believe that it is for the european parliament to pay expenses within the united kingdom <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord for his support for that point of view <e>", "<cs> i think that the personal element is an essential factor in determining loss and therefore i should like to express my agreement with this amendment <e>", "<cs> since this is the clause which provides the basic statutory right to compensation in the noble earls <e>", "<cs> it may be temerity to move amendments to the noble earls bill but it does not mean claiming paternity <e>", "<cs> there is just one small point that is worth mentioning <e> <s> the amendment rectifies one of the bills deficiencies by indicating the basis on which compensation would be assessed <e> <s> however as a result of the amendment the side-heading to the clause as printed in the bill is no longer accurate in referring only to reductions <e> <s> i thought that the noble earl would like me to point that out <e> <s> if i have not quite made myself clear what i have said will be accurately reported in the <e>", "<cs> it is not entirely easy to follow what are at any rate to me technical matters but i think i ought to say that the amendment which the noble earl has just moved and the previous one have an unfortunate effect <e> <s> although they are an improvement on the bill as drafted they reduce the payment of compensation to a dependant by the amount of any insurance money or benefits relating to the injury instead of those arising from the victims death <e> <s> the subsection as amended by the noble earl is also more restrictive than the governments revised scheme announced yesterday in that under the revised scheme benefits and pensions which are received as a result of personal payments made by the victim need not be taken into account when assessing compensation <e> <s> i am not particularly asking the noble earl to respond to what i have said but i thought it was right to place this on the record <e> <s> these are some of the problems which the government still see in the noble earls bill <e>", "<cs> this of course follows the word shall which is a requirement <e> <s> i am not entirely clear what will happen if a claimant fails to comply with the requirement <e> <s> i do not mean deliberately to ask a difficult question <e> <s> this is a genuine question which the noble earl needs to look at <e> <s> there is a requirement here and the bill does not say what happens if the requirement is not met <e> <s> for instance will the claimant be subject to ordinary court proceedings or will the compensation tribunal have some special power further to reduce the compensation as a sanction <e> <s> those are the kind of questions which arise in ones mind <e> <s> the noble earl may wish to look at what i have just said before we come to the next stage of his bill <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak to this group of amendments and express my recognition of the fact that the noble earl has taken the view that the bill should be amended so that the members of the compensation tribunal do not need to be medically qualified <e> <s> it is not that the medical qualifications are not most important with regard to the work of the board but as i sought to say on the previous stage of the bill the medical advice can be procured without including in legislation the fact that one or more than one of the members of the board needs to be medically qualified <e> <s> having said that i cannot see why the members of the tribunal need to be appointed respectively by the lord chancellor and the lord president of the court of session when the members of the existing board have been appointed by my right honourable friends the home secretary and the secretary of state for <e>", "<cs> in the revised scheme which the government announced yesterday that is the situation the chairman and the members of the board will be legally qualified <e> <s> the reason for that is a matter which occupied the members of your lordships house considerably during the second reading of the bill <e> <s> it is because the compensation is assessed in accordance with assessment of tort damages <e> <s> it is necessary to have people who understand the assessment of tort damages in other words people who are legally qualified to sit on the board <e> <s> therefore my answer to the noble lord lord wells-pestell is that it is the right way to proceed <e>", "<cs> i have listened very closely to what the noble lord lord wells-pestell has said because he has considerable experience of tribunal matters although not necessarily perhaps criminal injury matters <e> <s> i would remind him that the present system of the criminal injuries compensation scheme is that in the first instance the hearings are held in front of a single member of the board <e> <s> the government claim indeed i have no hesitation in claiming this that this is a great advantage <e> <s> it allows for hearings to be held as quickly as possible although hearings are not held as quickly as everyone would wish it allows for reasonable informality and in the event people do not appear to object in any large numbers to the hearing in front of one member of the board <e>", "<cs> this is in a sense like putting in a paragraph in the middle of a page <e> <s> i think perhaps it is a good moment if the noble earl does not mind my speaking once again on this for me to repeat in case i have seemed over-helpful that the government do not believe that the time is ripe those are the words i used for legislation <e> <s> it is not because we do not like private members legislation <e> <s> we are delighted to see legislation from the noble earl or any other member of your lordships house but there were good reasons why i got up on clause and said we thought the time was not ripe <e>", "<cs> i am not a lawyer but i do not think it is quite so straight-forward as the noble earl suggests <e> <s> legal aid is not generally available for hearings before administrative tribunals <e> <s> the legal aid act provides for regulations to be made specifying the proceedings before tribunals for which legal aid for legal representation may become available <e> <s> it is also the case that the act has not yet been brought into effect and regulations have not been made yet <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could ask one question of the noble earl before we leave this subject <e> <s> he gave as an example an appeal to a three-man sitting and he said the applicant was not legally qualified whereas those who were hearing the appeal were legally qualified <e> <s> he said the applicant did not have a chance <e> <s> why did he say that <e>", "<cs> people who are members of the board are there to do their best to assist within the terms of the criminal injuries compensation scheme those who make application to them for criminal injuries compensation <e> <s> they are there to do their very best for the applicants within the terms of the scheme <e> <s> there is no question of the people who are on the board in some way being faceless officials they are independent members of the board once they have been appointed <e> <s> it is most important that i should make that clear and should underline the value of the work which members of the board do <e>", "<cs> if it is helpful to have the governments view i would say that i am a little perplexed but i do not object <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most relieved that even after the speech of the noble lord lord boston i am still able to say that the government accept the principle of lord birketts bill <e> <s> i also was grateful for the noble lords clear explanation of both the background to and the intentions of the bill <e> <s> in the light of the very interesting remarks which the noble lord lord wigg made i ought to say that it would have been the intention of my right honourable friend the home secretary to implement in due course recommendation of the report of the royal commission on gambling by including in general legislation in the future when opportunity permits a provision to vary by order the maximum prize permitted in respect of games of <e>", "<cs> my lords the particulars in question are required as evidence of identity of the applicant and are recorded on the certificate when issued as a protection against the fraudulent use of a certificate by any other person <e> <s> it normally takes about two weeks to process applications and issue certificates but industrial action has recently caused delay in the printing of certificates and this has held up their issue <e> <s> we hope that this difficulty will soon be resolved and in the meantime successful applicants are being authorised to operate in anticipation of the issue of a formal printed certificate <e>", "<cs> my lords t agree with my noble friend that we want to do away with unnecessary form-filling where possible <e> <s> so far as the noble lords question to me today is concerned if a certificate of this nature came into the possession of someone who was not properly qualified to operate maritime radio and that person thereby managed to get into a position of operating a ships radio then safety at sea could be jeopardised <e> <s> i think that these certificates are in a special situation but i am only too <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the argument about the late dame nellie melba was that she took up too much room on the radio frequencies <e> <s> if i may say so seriously this is not a question about radio frequencies although it is true that my right honourable friend the home secretary is the minister who issues the certificates <e> <s> the point about these certificates is that they are to protect the competence of people operating radio telephones and therefore safety at sea <e> <s> however i may repeat that of course i am ready to examine this matter again in the light of my noble friends question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his interest in an important fund <e> <s> if i may first reply to the first part of his supplementary question we have taken a step forward <e> <s> we now have proposals from the brewers society and we really do have to look at them to see that they are practicable and not too costly to administer <e> <s> regarding the second part of my noble friends question the government attach importance to the principle accepted by other parties to the discussions that the money should be used at least in part for public purposes such as those that the erroll committee had in mind some seven years ago <e> <s> these include the types of purpose which i know my noble friend has in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords maybe that would help with alcoholic troubles maybe it would not <e> <s> from the time that the erroll committee sat most people have felt that at least part of these funds should be devoted to trying to help generally with the problem of alcoholism <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i wish to go back to the time of pre- licences <e> <s> but to be more helpful to the noble lord a genuine answer is that the brewers society scheme has to be looked at carefully and we received it only in july first of all to see whether it is too costly to administer <e> <s> the question of administering a trust has to be worked out and i must be blunt and say that the distribution of these moneys will need legislation <e>", "<cs> over million my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that goes a little wider than the question i was asked <e> <s> if the noble lord cares to put a question down i shall do my best to reply to him <e>", "<cs> my lords animal experimentation is a complex and highly specialised subject <e> <s> it also raises moral and social issues which are by no means the exclusive concern of the scientists <e> <s> i think there are few other scientific activities which give rise to such strong instinctive reactions towards suffering to which many in fact all of your lordships have given expression in the speeches which have been made today <e> <s> with over years experience behind us in the working of the cruelty to animals act of and in view of the developments which have taken place during that time in the fields of scientific research and animal welfare it is clearly right that the most serious consideration should be given to placing on the statute book legislation which takes those developments fully into account <e> <s> so our thanks are more than usually due to the promoter of a private members bill to the noble earl lord halsbury today not only for introducing what i think is only the second attempt completely to replace the act but also because by introducing this important bill the noble earl has attracted to the debate many of your lordships who have a close knowledge of the working of the existing legislation <e> <s> may i join all other noble lords in welcoming particularly the speech which was made by the noble lord lord adrian <e> <s> in fact the noble lord has been frequently a patient listener in your <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt that in this unstarred question the noble earl lord denbigh is raising a very important issue <e> <s> the ravages of drugs misuse leave their mark worldwide and the figures published by the home office of the use of drugs in the united kingdom in the year which are really the subject of the noble earls unstarred question undoubtedly point to a pattern of misuse which is increasing <e> <s> i join with my noble friend lord amory in saying that i must admit that before i went to work at the home office i was under exactly the same impression as he <e> <s> i had understood that the incidence of drug misuse and indeed the amounts of drugs illegally brought into this country and recovered were reducing <e> <s> i was wrong and so i say with respect was my noble friend <e> <s> i join with him in being grateful to the noble earl lord denbigh for raising this debate this evening <e>", "<cs> without men like this our drug problem would undoubtedly be very much worse <e> <s> customs staff at ports and airports are kept as well informed as possible of drug-smuggling trends and new methods of concealment <e> <s> mobile task forces and special baggage crews have been established now to add an element of unpredictability to the pattern of control and to enable efforts to be concentrated to meet particular needs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> as he will realise from his experience in government i am in fact speaking for two departments for the home office and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both the noble lords lord boston of faversham and lord wade for their comments on this report <e> <s> may i just say this in reply although as the committee says there were fundamental reasons for the setting up of the may inquiry of course the immediate reasons were the disputes on pay and conditions <e> <s> the committee recommends that it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i am only aware that my right honourable friend the home secretary made a perfectly splendid speech on th october with every word of which i agree <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boston of faversham has just referred to scepticism about the <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to my noble friend for misunderstanding him <e> <s> if the bill is given a second reading perhaps we could return to this point at the next stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for making the point again and thereby underlining it <e> <s> the undertaking i give is that i will personally draw this point to the attention of my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> with that i hope that your lordships will agree that this bill should be read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords not one of the articles which the noble lord has quoted so far as the international covenant is concerned is relevant because when the previous government ratified the covenant in the government entered a reservation so far as this countrys immigration control is concerned <e> <s> so all the articles that the noble lord quoted to me are not relevant at all <e> <s> so far as the european convention is concerned i repeat that the government do not believe that we shall contravene the convention but perhaps your lordships would prefer to see the actual text of the white paper before we discuss that matter in detail <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that the reply to a question for written answer in another place on st november from which the noble lords question arises in any way reflects proposals which are sexually discriminatory <e> <s> the abuse of the arranged marriage system is in itself sexually discriminatory and i am surprised that the noble baroness does not recognise this <e> <s> it uses girls in this country in such a way as to enable men to enter illegally in effect <e> <s> i think this is something which all fair-minded people in this country would wish to see brought to an end and it is at this that the governments proposals are aimed <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a perfectly fair question and perhaps the noble baroness and indeed the house would prefer it if detailed statistics were given when the white paper is presented but in broad terms the number of husbands coming into this country has changed since the concession was made by the previous home secretary mr roy jenkins in so that we now have husbands coming in at three times the rate at which they were coming in during <e> <s> so far as concerns the number of male fiancs coming in the rate of increase is considerably greater <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say to the right reverend prelate that if he cares to look at the written answer to a question in another place given by my right honourable friend the home secretary on st november he will see i think that it is not apparent that the proposals are racially discriminatory <e> <s> they will mean that asian and other girls from the new commonwealth who are born here will benefit equally with women born in the united kingdom from provisions enabling them to bring in the partners of genuine marriages <e>", "<cs> no my lords so far as i know that is not the case but it is not the case for the reason that i have given <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right about the conservative party manifesto but the manifesto also said that firm immigration control is essential for good community relations and it is this that the government are attempting to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say this to the noble lord lord segal <e> <s> i think it has run across party boundaries that in this country we really have attempted to do our best so far as concerns people who are fleeing from rgimes which are harsh and of course the latest example of this has been the tragedy of the vietnamese boat people <e> <s> i do not know whether it exactly answers the noble lords question and indeed i think we ought to wait until we have the statement on the white paper but may i draw the noble lords attention to the second paragraph of the written answer given by my right honourable friend the <e>", "<cs> my lords to the first part of the noble lords supplementary question i would simply repeat without going into statistics which i have but which i do not think the house wants at the moment <e>", "<cs> very well my lords <e> <s> in before the concession was made by the then home secretary in there were some husbands who were already here and were allowed to settle <e> <s> in that year a further number of husbands were admitted for settlement making a total of about of these men who had then entered the country <e> <s> in only one year later after the concession some husbands were admitted and last year that total had risen to <e> <s> so far as fiancs are concerned in before the concession only a handful of male fiancs was admitted for settlement <e> <s> last year the number was over <e> <s> i think those statistics show that this is a practice <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the pleasure of answering in writing so many questions from the noble lord on this subject that i am afraid that one or two of my replies slip my memory <e> <s> perhaps the details of this matter are something which we should now debate on the statement on the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are not responsible for the previous governments green paper <e> <s> i seem to remember however that the previous government felt that it was right indeed necessary only two years ago in to take a hard look at the question of arranged marriages and to do something about them <e> <s> in fact the rules if i remember rightly were changed <e> <s> as regards the line which my right honourable friend will be taking i shall be making a statement to your lordships house if the house will agree at a convenient moment after half-past three <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any representations of the kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that previous royal families have indulged in arranged marriages <e>", "<cs> my lords i unhesitatingly give the right reverend prelate an assurance to that effect <e> <s> it is no part of the intention of her majestys government to discourage the traditional practice of the arranged marriage <e> <s> but we are fully entitled we believe to take steps to prevent further primary immigration through marriages which are arranged for this purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords if i am quick i can reply just before my former tutor at university who was introduced into your lordships house today takes his seat and say that honestly i cannot answer that question <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a fair point and i thought i gave a fair answer <e> <s> indeed pressed by the noble lord lord avebury i then wearied your lordships with specific statistics <e> <s> i do not think the house would want me to do that again <e> <s> i think i should say to the noble baroness on this occasion that the statistics for husbands coming into the country have shown a very marked increase since the concession which was made by the noble baronesss government after i know very mature thought and considerable hesitation in <e> <s> similarly the numbers of male fiancs coming into this country have also shown a very marked increase <e>", "<cs> my lords what would be needed to reply to the noble lords question is a nationality act and i do not think there is anything between the two sides of your lordships house that this is desirable but i am afraid we have not got to the moment when we are able to introduce such legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the home secretary has today published a white paper on our proposals for revision of the immigration rules and i shall be repeating his statement to your lordships later this afternoon <e> <s> under these proposals a husband or fianc will not be allowed to settle in the united kingdom if the primary purpose of the marriage is to obtain admission to this country or if one of the parties does not intend that the couple should live together permanently as man and wife or if the parties <e>", "<cs> my lords for precisely the reason to which i admit i have only alluded at the end of my reply to the noble lord lord avebury because it may be that girls may have been born outside the united kingdom but in circumstances in which i think any fair-minded person would feel that such girls would fall within the rules as they are being made <e> <s> i have mentioned that parents might have had to be abroad on crown service or on business and it also occurs to me that they might have been abroad as missionaries or in certain other guises <e> <s> it is such cases that my right honourable friend would be looking at sympathetically <e>", "<cs> i would have thought so my lords <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> we are of course talking in the context <e>", "<cs> my lords when your lordships will allow me to make the statement i think the right reverend prelate will find that in that way the new rules are not racially discriminatory <e> <s> girls of any race colour or creed born in this country will under the rules which my right honourable friend is putting to the house in the form of a white paper have the same rights <e>", "<cs> my lords the announcement by my noble friend the foreign secretary on th july of the governments decision to take a further indo-chinese refugees from hong kong indicated that the timetable of admission would be agreed with the governor and fixed no particular period <e> <s> in view of the situation in hong kong the government are anxious to admit these refugees as quickly as possible <e> <s> the total received in october was well over <e> <s> the future rate of intake will however be largely determined by the speed with which the refugees can be resettled in permanent accommodation <e> <s> the machinery for handling the reception and resettlement of these refugees has recently been strengthened by the formation of the joint committee for refugees from vietnam to which my right honourable friend the home secretary has appointed sir arthur peterson as chair- man <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i think that his second question in particular is something which officials in the government especially in my right honourable friends department would want to look at very carefully <e> <s> may i just say in reply to the noble lords first question that as i think he will be aware the selection is carried out by officials of the home office and the british council for aid to refugees and they have indeed recently returned from their third visit to hong kong <e> <s> i think it is fair for me just to say that arrivals here have at no time been limited by a lack of refugees already selected and we do not think there is at present a need to maintain a permanent selection team in hong kong <e> <s> but in the light of the noble lords question we will certainly keep this matter under very close review <e> <s> as i said so far as the second question is concerned i think the noble lord will forgive me if i say that i should like to take it away and draw my right honourable friends attention to it and if need be write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady stedman and the noble lord lord avebury have asked me a series of questions which persuades me indeed that is the intention as indicated in the statement that some further discussion in your lordships house would be desirable <e> <s> of course this would be arranged through the usual channels <e> <s> i say to the noble baroness that this has nothing to do with attacking minority cultures <e> <s> about three-quarters of an hour ago i specifically gave an assurance on this point to the right reverend prelate the bishop of southwark <e> <s> i shall certainly look into the question asked by the noble baroness about the project within the home office on over-stayers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord barnby for his intervention <e> <s> in essence my noble friend was saying something which was in the manifesto of his political party and mine at the last election at least i think it was in the manifesto namely that firm immigration policy leads to good race relations <e> <s> i believe that that is right and i know that that is what my noble friend believes <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to answer questions from the noble lord <e> <s> he asks me the same questions from week to week and i give him the same answers <e> <s> the answer to the noble lord is no <e> <s> i give that answer because we made it clear in our manifesto that we believe that a firm immigration policy is the necessary precursor to good race relations <e> <s> we also made it quite plain in our election manifesto that we would change the rules governing the entry of husbands and male finacs in order to deal with the exploitation of marriage as a means of primary immigration of men for work <e> <s> i must say that i cannot think of a practice which is more likely to lead to worsened race relations <e> <s> that is why i have no hesitation at all in following my right honourable friend the home secretary and making this statement to your lordships today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for the way in which he has put his question <e> <s> i must say that in the time that i have been in your lordships house together with the noble lord i have learned to listen carefully to what he says <e> <s> certainly i shall draw the attention of my right honourable friend to what the noble lord has said <e> <s> that is not just a form of words <e> <s> deliberately these proposals which are of course much wider than the specific point about the entry of husbands and fiancs have been put to parliament in the form of a white paper so that it would be possible for both houses of parliament if the members of both houses wish to do so to debate these matters before the order for the rules is actually laid <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may reply to the first question which the noble and learned lord has put to me consideration has been given by my right honourable friend as to whether the changes proposed in this white paper are consonant with the provisions of the european convention particularly the articles that the noble and learned lord mentioned <e> <s> my right honourable friend believes that the government have a perfectly respectable argument for doing what we are proposing <e> <s> the answer to the noble and learned lords first question therefore is yes we have taken this seriously into account <e>", "<cs> my lords there is not the slightest need to do anything of the sort precisely because the white paper refers to the discretion of the home secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the concern which the noble baroness as chairman of the equal opportunities commission has about this aspect of the white paper but if she will forgive me saying so i think she is disregarding the reason why paragraph appears in the white paper <e> <s> it appears there because the government believe and i think many of your lordships would agree that we are entitled in this country to take steps to prevent primary immigration through marriages which are arranged for that purpose and for that purpose only <e>", "<cs> my lords i share my noble friends concern that when people put their views forward by taking action which goes beyond the limits which have been set by the law that is something which should cause us all concern <e> <s> my noble friend asks me whether this cannot be prevented not by further legislation but by administrative means <e> <s> may i give him two answers <e> <s> i think first one needs to do as my noble friend did in his question namely to look at the penalties and i ought just to point out that the penalties for the kind of offences i think my noble friend may have in mind are not inconsiderable <e> <s> to give one example only conduct conducive to a breach of the peace carries with it now a maximum fine of or six months imprisonment or both <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with a very great deal of what the noble lord has said but not if i may say so with his final remarks <e> <s> i think there are many noble lords here who would jump on me very quickly if i did not make the point that the home secretary is not responsible for the enforcement of the law <e>", "<cs> a mixture <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the numbers are in england of which two are for girls and two for young adults and there are two attendance centres in wales <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the enforcement of the law is concerned as i was venturing to say to the noble lord lord paget this is a matter for the police in consultation as appropriate with the law officers <e> <s> so far as the effect of the race relations act is concerned this also falls to them to enforce <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to hear of the cases which the noble viscount has put to me <e> <s> the home office is sponsoring a research project into the experiences of victims in the criminal justice system to try to ensure precisely that in the prosecution process the legitimate interests of victims are not overlooked <e> <s> meanwhile i think that as a government we are taking as much action as we possibly can to meet the noble viscounts wishes <e> <s> last year under the previous government compensation orders were made which was more than in the previous year <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly i would not rule out the suggestion which the noble lord has made <e> <s> in addition to that as the noble lord well knows with his close connection with the magistrates association last year that association sent out guidelines on compensation for cases of personal injury <e> <s> may i come back to the main point in my reply to the noble viscount <e> <s> by statute the initiative for awarding compensation lies

friend is referring to the interim reviews i am not aware that whenever an interim review has been undertaken any constituency has as a result of that been created nor has any constituency ever been extinguished <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not trying to be flippant but the answer to the noble lords questions are yes i am not sure i do not know and no <e>", "<cs> no my lords i shall have to write to the noble lord if i have got this wrong but as i understand it the commissions are dealing with the countries that they are statutorily charged with dealing with <e> <s> in other words there are separate commissions for scotland wales england and northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has got rather longer not much but rather longer experience than i perhaps he had better answer the question himself <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the first part of my noble friends supplementary question but i should like to think about the second part <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a hypothesis of course because it would need a change in the rules <e> <s> i shall look forward to legislation from the liberal party on that particular subject <e>", "<cs> if your lordships will

and if the noble lord felt able to agree to withdraw it if there is any assistance which my right honourable friends department could give him in the redrafting of the amendment we should be delighted to be of service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to noble lords for the welcome they have given the bill and in particular to the noble lord lord boston of faversham for his welcome to it because

right <e> <s> having to reply to him immediately across the floor of the house certainly i am not going to contradict him and say that my figures are right and his are wrong <e> <s> i wonder whether the house would accept it from <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord spoke i have been in touch with the department of health and social security and the answer that i should like to give to the noble lord is that this was indeed an option which the department felt had to be considered <e> <s> no decision has been taken and the terms of what the noble lord has said are being drawn immediately to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for health and social security <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> for that reason a study at the home defence college in yorkshire took place between th and rd november and was attended by representatives of both central and local government and representatives of other authorities <e> <s> the results of that study will be taken into account as urgently as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the suggestion made by the noble lord at the beginning of his question <e> <s> for instance most houses offer <e>", "<cs> my lords the organisation which the noble lord was mentioning which of course has been doing valuable work in this field has been able to talk to both my right honourable friends departments the home office and the ministry of defence <e> <s> we shall certainly take into account what the noble lord has said about the question of making sure that any arrangements for civil defence are not too top heavy from a bureaucratic point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had said to the house that a study had taken place at the home defence college representing all the people involved in civil defence <e> <s> that is six months after this government came into office <e> <s> i am not aware that any similar <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree absolutely with what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i think a strong case can be made out that we have been unnecessarily secretive about what is being done in the civil defence field in this country <e> <s> i assure the noble lord and indeed your lordships that this particular aspect as well as others was seriously taken into account in the study which has just taken place at the civil defence college <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may reply to my noble friend lord inglewood i hope that he will not have the impression himself or give the house the impression which i would suggest to him is mistaken that representatives or organisations who are involved in the civil defence field particularly the representatives of the local authorities have not had the opportunity to know what is going on at the civil defence college where courses <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for the welcome that they have given to the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the regulations laid before the house on st november be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this debate which i invited when the immigration statement was made in your lordships house on th november because i believe that it will clarify points upon which there is misunderstanding <e> <s> incidentally it gives us into the bargain the opportunity to hear for the first time the right reverend prelate the bishop of bradford who is to follow me <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble baroness may i say that as i understand them the rules dealt with what the government in their rules called the marriage of convenience people who did not intend that their marriage should subsist <e> <s> they did not necessarily deal with marriages which are contracted with one thought in mind that is for the man by hook or by crook to get into the united kingdom <e> <s> as i was saying to your lordships <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i have listened fairly quietly to your lordships <e> <s> i shall certainly give way to the noble lord but may i remind him that both he and if the house will allow me i also will have another chance to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords i know the noble lord well and i know that he is absolutely genuine and very knowledgeable in these matters <e>

visited the indian sub-continent and i am doing no more than repeating the view which he has given on the floor of the house of commons when i say to this house that we know that there are cases in which men overseas openly admit that they are looking for a <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps if the noble baroness would like to read the rules she will see <e> <s> in addition we repeat the labour governments rule that where there is no intention of there being a genuine married life entry should also be refused and we add what i do not think is an unnatural requirement that the couple to a marriage should have met <e> <s> however even these changes can be circumvented by people who are determined to conceal the true reasons for a marriage and that is the reason why the government have been obliged to confine the right of entry to husbands and fiancs of women who are citizens of the united kingdom and colonies by birth or who have a parent born here <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise genuinely and unreservedly to <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps we are getting a little tired and i did not make myself clear <e> <s> i was trying to explain to the house that immigration officers are working under considerable strain <e> <s> i gave the example of the very large number of visitors who come to these shores to show the extent of the number of people who pass through our ports of entry every year <e> <s> i was going on to explain that in my view the rules we are putting forward in the white paper will provide easier and more workable rules <e> <s> the noble lord does not agree with me <e> <s> when the noble lord speaks again he can explain to the house why that is so <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate has ranged widely and at this hour i will try to reply to as many of the points raised as your lordships patience will allow but i hope no more <e> <s> before doing anything else may i express my appreciation of the speech made by the right reverend prelate the bishop of bradford <e> <s> i see from the right reverend prelates career that he has moved as it were by degrees towards the north of england and now i think yorkshire is very lucky to be able to count him one of their number <e> <s> i know that the right reverend prelate did not agree with a lot of what i had to say <e> <s> but that is no matter <e> <s> he made the most wonderful speech and i am glad to have been here to hear it <e> <s> i join with other noble lords in saying that it must not be another four years before he comes back to speak in this house again <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case he falls within the rules as they have been drafted within the white paper <e> <s> the noble lord lord byers mentioned in passing as it were the position as he saw it of what are called working holidaymakers from the commonwealth young people we have all met very often in large numbers usually globetrotting doing a job getting some experience and going home <e> <s> the noble lord if i may say so is labouring under a misapprehension if he thinks the rules prevent working holiday-makers from the commonwealth indulging in that <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords perhaps i am getting a little tired at the end of the day perhaps i got the noble lord wrong <e> <s> perhaps on the other hand the government have to take account of the whole scene and to decide on the number of people at any one time considering the employment situation in the country at any one time <e> <s> if i may say so i think that on those grounds the noble lord is not on to a very good point <e>", "<cs> my lords we will certainly take into account what the noble lord has said <e> <s> this is precisely what a debate like this is important for and i assure the noble lord that i will draw that to my right honourable friends attention <e> <s> the noble lord lord pitt raised the case of a student who wished to undertake yet further education after acquiring skills for which an award had been given in the expectation by the award-givers that the graduate would use those skills for the good of his or her own country <e> <s> none the less my answer is that obviously an extension for such further higher education could of course be applied for at the secretary of states discretion <e>", "<cs> my lords i have got the point <e> <s> i shall certainly draw it personally to the attention of my right honourable friend and i shall see to it that the noble lord is written to either by myself or by the minister responsible again as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords we are always ready to talk to local authorities and indeed the machinery is there for my right honourable friend to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall now reply to the speeches made on the police negotiating board bill <e> <s> may i express my gratitude to noble lords who have spoken on this bill thereby showing their interest in its importance and particularly to the noble lord lord boston of faversham for reminding us of the responsible and often dangerous duties of the police <e> <s> if i may say so my noble friend lord inglewood was absolutely right to say that these duties require the police service to have officers of high quality and it has been to the advantage of this debate that we have had the noble lord lord harris of greenwich with his experience of the police service saying that he feels that the police service is finding these men and women to enter the service <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has been very active in these matters over the years <e> <s> indeed the previous working party of the police advisory board which looked into the position of the special constabulary paid tribute to the very helpful and valuable evidence which my noble friend had given to it <e> <s> however as to the supplementary questions which my noble friend has just put to me it is precisely points of that kind which this working party which is due to meet this month for the first time should now begin to consider <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but as things stand at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that the powers of local authorities concerning film censorship raise certain concerns over anomalies and inconsistencies of which the local authorities are very well aware <e> <s> what i said to your lordships in my speech was that the removal of those powers would be a step which should not be taken lightly <e> <s> at this stage i do not wish to go further than that <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord inglewood raised very much the same point on the second reading of the <e>", "<cs> i am genuinely sorry because the noble lord and i frequently discussed these matters and i certainly recognise the experience and the genuine concern which my noble friend has for this <e> <s> but i certainly cannot respond by undertaking to think about this again before the report stage for two reasons <e> <s> the first is i think implicit in the answer which i have just given to my noble friend in the last part of which i tried to explain that because special constables are under the operational control of their own chief constables in a sense therefore their interests are looked after on the police negotiating board <e>", "<cs> i take seriously what the noble lord lord george-brown says and indeed what any of your lordships would say on this subject which after all affects all people in this country namely the police service <e> <s> but i think that the noble lord would not have said what he has just said to me if he had been aware that in there was previously a working party which was set up by the police advisory board on the future of the special constabulary <e> <s> on that working party there were representatives of the special constabulary and the recommendations of that working party were that the special constabulary should not be paid a bounty and there was no call from that working party that they should have a representative organisation <e>", "<cs> in fairness to the consultations which have gone on in order to set up the police negotiating board may i say that the board is being put into legislative form because of the recommendations of the committee of inquiry on the police under the chairmanship of the noble and learned lord lord edmund-davies a committee which so far as i know has received nothing but praise for the conclusions it has reached except apparently on this particular matter <e> <s> however that is by the way <e> <s> i would think that the fairer way of looking at it is that surely it is better to try to meet the sort of points of concern which are being put which i know are perfectly genuine by waiting until the working party which is an immediate working party it is not something that is going to happen in a years time has reached some conclusions on the special constabulary <e> <s> on those grounds i would ask the committee to recognise that it is not because i am trying to dig my toes in but from an entirely practical point of view that it is not possible for me to give an undertaking and indeed it is an undertaking which i have no intention of giving that any amendment will be moved into this bill at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords mr reyes expulsion from panama had to be investigated before he could be admitted temporarily to this country <e> <s> there was delay in handling one telex sent from london airport on the day that mr reyes arrived and during the period that mr reyes was detained a weekend intervened but as soon as we ascertained that mr reyes expulsion from panama was not caused by any misconduct which should lead us to believe that he should not be in this country he was granted temporary release <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am not aware of what my noble friend said in the first part of his supplementary question <e> <s> all i am aware of is that mr reyes had been living in panama for some four years and it was a matter of concern and a matter which the immigration officer who received mr reyes knew nothing about as to why mr reyes should have been sent first of all to chile which seemed certainly to be refoulement in the terms of the convention and then straight to this country a country with which mr reyes had no connection and was telling the immigration authorities he did not want to come to <e> <s> it was for those reasons that the immigration authorities in this country felt they had to <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that in this case the immigration officer and the port of entry authorities behaved absolutely correctly <e> <s> if the noble lord has in mind particular cases which are causing him concern and he will be so good as to let me know i will see that they are looked into immediately <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the point which the noble lord is putting to me but we are not talking about an inflexible rule <e> <s> mr reyes arrived on th november on th november the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees as the noble lord knows telephoned the refugee unit of the home office at croydon <e> <s> i think it is important that i should recall to the noble lord that as i understand it during that telephone call it was agreed between the unhcr and the home office that <e>", "<cs> my lords i acknowledge the value of voluntary work performed in aid of civil defence plans both in the past and at the present time but the governments present policy is to leave it to local authorities to liaise with voluntary bodies and judge how best together they can make suitable civil defence plans for their areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly would not dissent from the opening words of the noble lord lord boston of faversham that events in the world have caused all of us to concentrate with a good deal more urgency on this matter than perhaps we thought might have been necessary <e> <s> however this was the first review of its kind to be undertaken for some time <e> <s> it has been thorough it involved many agencies central and local government as well as representatives of <e>", "<cs> again my lords i would not dissent from what my noble friend said <e> <s> incidentally i did not say in my remarks that we would be publishing the review i used different words which made it clear that of course we would keep both houses fully informed <e> <s> all i would add to what my noble friend said i must add it because any government would have to do so and i most certainly must do so is that the level of expenditure on civil defence must of course always be part of the considerations which have to be taken into account in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make it clear that the government <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am not aware of either of the two statements which the noble lord has put to me but certainly we shall take them seriously into account in the review which is proceeding at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords logic and the soviet union do not go hand in hand <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord is on to a good point here and i assure him that this too is something we are looking at carefully <e> <s> i should like to link this to what i have already said <e> <s> the noble lord is on to the point of how much information should be issued at a time when one feels attack is not immediately apparent and this is a matter which perhaps we have to look at again <e> <s> incidentally this was a point raised when we last had a question on this matter by the noble lord lord shinwell who is not i think in the house today and on that occasion i sought to reply to the noble lord in very much the same way <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor would have liked to answer this question <e> <s> he is at this moment sitting on your lordships appellate committee in place of the noble and learned lord lord wilberforce who is indisposed <e> <s> he has asked me to express his regrets to the house <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i can best reply to the noble lord by saying that as i understand the judgment of the lord chief justice in relation to the particular case about which the noble lord lord wigoder is questioning me he was of the view that there were dangers in the revealing of jury secrets in that it might deter subsequent juries from speaking their mind in the jury room because of the fear of publicity afterwards <e> <s> it could also imperil the finality of jury verdicts which as i understand the lord chief justices words was a prime reason for jury trial in this country <e> <s> bearing in mind those conclusions of the lord chief justice the government think it undesirable in principle that jurors should be free to disclose the secrets of their deliberations <e> <s> discussions will be <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no oath of secrecy therefore it is not an offence <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say to the noble and learned lord that i shall draw the attention of my right honourable and noble and learned friend the lord chancellor to what he has said <e> <s> i was at pains to explain that it is the view of the government at the moment that the way to proceed is by discussion with all the various interested parties and the noble and learned lord will understand the scope of that phrase better than i as the noble and learned lord has put this particular point to me i should like to draw the lord chancellors attention to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord with his <e>",

its charter and licence agreement <e> <s> in the exercise of this responsibility the bbc acknowledges a duty to treat controversial subjects with due impartiality <e>", "<cs> well my lords in this

russia <e> <s> i really am certain that these are matters for the bbc not for the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand from the newspaper reports that these programmes were filmed and planned long before the afghanistan invasion <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the point which the noble lord lord sefton has raised this of course was the intention of the report of the committee under the chairmanship of the noble and learned lord lord edmund-davies upon which the drafting of this bill is based <e> <s> it is for that reason that one-third of the official side of the police <e>", "<cs> my lords it reflects the make-up of police authorities throughout the country and therefore seems self-evidently right <e> <s> certainly it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has bowled me rather a fast ball and i shall have to write to him on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords the right reverend prelate did not mention the precise recommendations on which the government had not announced particular action <e> <s> if the right reverend prelate had in mind fiscal matters then so far as the goodman committee recommendations on these are concerned the government are considering these and other proposals including those put forward by a recent working party of the national council of social service <e> <s> so far as political activities by charities are concerned in their annual report the charity commissioners have given guidance on the extent to which charities may engage in political activities and the great majority of charities experienced no difficulty <e> <s> i must say at this point that the government do not believe that any legislation is required on that particular subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that <e> <s> i should like to look at that point and if i feel that i ought to do so to write to the right reverend prelate about it <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government have a closed mind they are in good company for charities law in its present form has existed since <e> <s> the government do not believe that any change in the scope of charities as a legal concept is needed at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of what my noble friend said <e> <s> it was for that reason among others that in reply to the right reverend prelate i said that the government are considering not only the goodman committees recommendations but other proposals including those put forward by a recent working party of the national council of social service <e>", "<cs> my lords i honestly do not know what the noble lord is referring to <e> <s> as a general reply if the noble lord has a particular case in mind and cares to draw it to the attention of the house now or to my attention in writing i shall look into it as urgently as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can say in reply is that the scope of charity is wide and my right honourable friend does not have the responsibility for the charity commissioners handling of the individual cases <e> <s> that makes it sound as though i believe the <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are conducting a general review of electoral law and procedures on the basis of which we shall consider what changes are needed and how best to proceed <e> <s> although the electoral advisory committee which last met in has been abolished as part of the governments review of non-departmental public

government to say that the home office will continue to consult the political parties the local authority associations and the returning officers who mainly comprise the electoral advisory committee

been expressed by the noble lord <e> <s> i should like to look again if i may at the particular instances which the noble lord has just specified <e> <s> so far as the sale and the dealing in of prohibited weapons within the united kingdom is concerned there are the licensing procedures which i outlined in my reply <e> <s> so far as getting weapons out of the united kingdom is concerned there is the export of goods control order <e> <s> taken together that range of controls provides a very close control over the sale and movement of what are called prohibited weapons <e> <s> certainly my noble friend has an open mind as to whether more legislation might be needed and of course he will take very seriously into account anything which may be said in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my

scrutiny by different government departments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that the answer to the first question which the noble lord asked me is yes <e> <s> if by any chance i am wrong i will

fundamentally the findings of the aglionby report then i must say to him that i disagree fundamentally with what he is saying and i will now explain why <e>", "<cs> i must say my lords that i find these interruptions of the noble lord quite extraordinary <e> <s> let us for a moment consider what happened <e> <s> in july last year there were a number of allegations in the press relating to the

therefore not an illegal entrant <e> <s> it does not follow that the courts would take the same view in other cases where a change in status was not disclosed and where the facts were different <e> <s> in cases where the validity of a leave to enter is in question the home office will continue to seek to follow the decisions of the courts in these matters and in any future legislation most careful consideration would be given to any proposals for clarification of the law in this regard <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lords first question as i understand the decisions of the court of appeal as best i can the difference between the cases of mangoo khan and mohammed zamir is that mangoo khan was over the age of and was held to have entered this country outside the immigration rules whereas mohammed zamir was aged under and was held to have entered this country within the immigration rules <e> <s> so far as the important second question which the noble lord has asked me is concerned namely what is expected of an entrant arriving in this country <e> <s> may i draw the attention of the noble lord to the white paper of my honourable friend where in paragraph the noble lord will notice that it is permissive for an immigration officer to examine an entrant in order to determine whether any changes in circumstances have occurred since the entry clearance was issued abroad <e> <s> if after that the entrance is in dispute then it is a matter for the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend is going a little wide of the question originally asked by the noble lord lord avebury <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not actually say that a review of the legislation was taking place <e> <s> we have undertaken a review of the immigration rules and these have been the subject of a long debate in your lordships house <e> <s> i should like to draw the attention of my right honourable friend the home secretary to what the noble lord lord brockway has said on the second point <e> <s> i would not wish to appear unhelpful on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the question was a little long <e> <s> it was certainly extremely difficult to understand but so far as i know as always with the noble lord it is in order <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already answered the noble lord on that point <e> <s> paragraph is permissive if afterwards the matter is in dispute then it will be for the courts to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly do so <e> <s> i was hoping that i might be free to do so when i wind up if the noble lord will forgive me <e> <s> if the noble lord will not be here at such a late hour may i say very briefly that the provision of shelter accommodation which i know is an absolutely vital question forms part of my right honourable friends review <e> <s> meanwhile going on within the home office and it has been going on for some time is a most urgent study of how it may be possible to advise the public that they can have easily-provided family shelters against <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord peart for the speech he has just made <e> <s> as a senior minister in the previous government over a period of many years the noble lord knows what needs to be done in this field <e> <s> it was the noble lord lord shinwell in his remarks during this debate who said that it was essential in his view that your lordships house should have this debate <e> <s> indeed we are indebted to the noble lord lord clifford of chudleigh for the debate which has been important for civil defence planning in this country <e> <s> i should like to give an assurance to the noble lord lord hunt <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord for misinterpreting the speech he made to the house and i repeat that apology <e> <s> but the issue surely is whether one conducts ones foreign policy from a position of strength or from a position of weakness <e> <s> i have to say to this house that this government follow the previous administration in doing our very best to follow our foreign policy from a position of a firm defence and civil defence policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble lord that the handling and treatment of long-term and violent prisoners is not successful in this country <e> <s> in england and wales we have the dispersal systemthe prison at grendon has its therapeutic regimethere is c wing at parkhurst which exists as a structured regime for prisoners who suffer from mental disorders and of course there are a number of prison hospital annexes <e> <s> in addition to that the noble lord referred to the rehabilitation of prisoners in the community <e> <s> this is what the parole system and the pre-release employment scheme are all about <e> <s> the visit of officials from my right honourable friends department is precisely to meet the second point which the noble lord put to us <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i know and this falls slightly but not completely outside the question the noble lord is asking what the noble baroness is saying is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly take into account what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to say to the noble lord that that question falls very far wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with what the noble lord said to begin with and i should like to make that crystal clear <e> <s> so far as the subsequent remarks of the noble lord are concerned may i repeat that although the barlinnie experiment is so far as we know and there is no research on the subject a very interesting one it involves a very heavy commitment so far as resources are concerned for the prison service <e> <s> the prison service in scotland is in better shape so far as numbers of prison officers is concerned than in the rest of the united kingdom <e> <s> it is for that reason that i had to say to the noble lord in my first reply that this is a matter finally for my right honourable friend the secretary of state for northern ireland to decide <e>", "<cs> yes my lords indeed i would <e>", "<cs> the amendment which the noble baroness lady david has moved is in fact if she will forgive me for saying so a wrecking amendment <e> <s> it would effectively remove from authorities any obligation to meet parental preferences and would put their decisions beyond the challenge of appeal committees <e> <s> the noble baroness asked a question of my noble friend to which i shall try to give the answer <e> <s> as i understand it the question relates to clause <e> <s> that reads <e>", "<cs> i do not like to be unhelpful to the noble baroness but i do not think that this amendment is acceptable <e> <s> the situation as we see it is that an authority or governors of a voluntary school will only refuse a child admission if they believe that they are not under a duty to admit him or her <e> <s> if they wish to plead that the childs admission would prejudice the provision of efficient education or the efficient use of resources they must have good grounds for believing so which will stand up to challenge on appeal <e> <s> these are bound to relate to their own locality but the considerations involved may it is true cross local education authority boundaries <e> <s> your lordships will notice that the provisions of clause <e>", "<cs> may i try to do a little better for the noble lord and as i am not quite as familar with this as my noble friends on these benches i may help myself at the same time <e> <s> if i am not out of order may we look one clause ahead to clause and i shall keep this brief because i think this is getting rather near to offending against the rules of order <e> <s> i think that the answer to the noble lord lord ross is this <e> <s> the way in which an appeal and i am thinking of the point which the noble lord made will work so far as this point is concerned is that the arrangements which the local authority will have made for admissions to schools will be published and that is required in another completely different clause clause <e> <s> should a parent be dissatisfied the parent will have the opportunity to go to an appeal committee under clause and put his case <e> <s> the committee will be bound to have regard to the authoritys published admission arrangements but it will be for the local authority to demonstrate that any limitations on parental preferences which are set out by the arrangements are justifiable in terms of the provision of efficient education which is what the noble lord is asking about or the efficient use of resources <e> <s> it will be for the appeal committee to listen to the case which the local authority is makingto listen to the case the parent is putting and to decide on those two criteria if those are the two criteria which are relevant to the appeal whether the parents appeal has been made out or whether it has not <e>", "<cs> at the end of quite a long interchange may i remind the committee that the effect of this amendment would be to do away completely with selective education <e> <s> i thought it might be a good idea to remind ourselves what we are talking about <e> <s> i remember very well when the noble lord lord heycock and i met for the first timeit was a long time ago now <e> <s> it is perfectly true that he and i met because he wished to establish a comprehensive school in the local authority area in wales which he <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should tell the committee the reasons why the government decided on these provisions <e> <s> there were three options open to the government in pursuing their view of the rightness of providing an appeal procedure for parents <e> <s> let me set them out <e> <s> one could have had a totally independent form of appeal committeeone could have had an appeal committee which was independent but advisory only or one could have had some other form of committee <e>", "<cs> i think that the meaning of sub-paragraph is absolutely as the words denote <e> <s> it states that <e>", "<cs> i will certainly take it away <e> <s> i am not entirely sure that large parts of the bill are clear to me <e> <s> that is no reflection on the draftsman the department or anybody else <e> <s> it is simply a reflection upon me and probably the time at which your lordships committee is only just starting to sit this evening <e> <s> of course i will ask my right honourable friend the secretary of state at the department of education whether this can be looked at again <e> <s> the difficulty is that sub-paragraph is put in the negative <e> <s> but of course i will ask the department whether it can be put more clearly and will be ready to reply to my noble friend if he raises the matter again <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the answer is yes in england only <e>", "<cs> i am surprised to hear what the noble baroness lady david says <e> <s> i know that she is not only very experienced in these matters but that she is always very fair <e> <s> i have to say to <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend lady young has been at pains to try to say this evening we are trying to make sure that authorities emulate the best practice of other local authorities <e> <s> it may well be that some of the local authorities which the noble baroness has just mentioned are ones that have co-opted members authorities which have gone to very great pains as many of them i know have done over the years to try to see that politics do not obtrude too much in their educational affairs locally <e>", "<cs> i think that it has rather slipped the mind of the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge that voluntary aided schools are not the same as county schools or indeed controlled schools <e> <s> the governors of aided and special agreement schools are after all responsible for admissions <e> <s> therefore i put it to the noble lord that it seems to be right if we leave the making of appeal arrangements in the hands of the governors of these schools <e> <s> clause provides for the local education authorities to do what the noble lord wants donenamely to publish the details of the arrangements of voluntary aided schools about their admissons procedures but by mutual agreement <e>", "<cs> i do not think there is very much between the two sides of the committee <e> <s> what the noble lord is asking us to agree to can be done by agreement specifically set out in writing in clause <e> <s> all the government are saying is that they do not want to make it a draconian measure <e> <s> because of the long tradition of voluntary aided school governors being responsible so far as possible for their affairs we would like to see not only the preparing of the admission procedures remaining in the hands of the governors of voluntary schools but the publication of them as well unless by agreement the governors of voluntary schools take the same line as lord donaldson and they look at clause and say very well we will get the local education authority to do this for us <e>", "<cs> that is right <e> <s> my lords surely this exchange has been helpful because the question which the noble baroness put and the final remarks of the noble lord lord donaldson persuade me that the regulations are going to have to be put in a clear way <e> <s> we must consider how the general public can most easily read the published details both for the county schools and for the voluntary schools and understand what the admission arrangements are <e> <s> i should not like the noble lord to think that as a result of this exchange i and representatives of the department have not been listening <e> <s> i am sure that to that extent this amendment has been valuable and helpful <e>", "<cs> i very rarely use the word promise and i have not done so this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer to my noble friend is that <e>", "<cs> i would rather not look forward at this stage to forthcoming clauses <e> <s> i would tell the noble lord lord avebury before we leave this amendment that the matter is clearly set out <e> <s> the responsibility for preparing admission arrangements is upon the governors of aided schools and the local education authority of county and controlled schools and the responsibility for publication rests in the same places both on the governors and on the local education authority <e> <s> we therefore not only believe it will be done but there is a statutory duty that it shall be done and we on this side of the committee believe that the statutory duty rests in the right place in both cases <e>", "<cs> i can give the noble lord an assurance that what he seeks to do by his amendment is already covered in the bill <e> <s> local education authorities and the governors of aided and special agreement schools are required to publish particulars of their admission arrangements and that is to be found in clause <e>", "<cs> i can give the assurance that the regulations determining the manner in which publication should take place will ensure what the noble lord is asking while leaving open the possibility of authorities charging for supplying information for other purposesfor instance someone wanting to do research <e> <s> with that proviso i give the noble lord the assurance he requires <e>", "<cs> i am genuinely grateful to the noble lord for the two points that he has made <e> <s> as regards the first point i realise that in another place concern has been expressed about the use of the procedures in clauses to so far as primary schoolchildren are concerned <e> <s> i point out to the noble lord that certainly we shall look at it again before the report stage <e> <s> i give the noble lord that assurance <e> <s> however i should like to make two points <e> <s> first i am sure that the noble lord would agree that the primary stage is no less important than the secondary stage <e> <s> indeed he in no way suggested that that was not the case <e> <s> his case was that the machinery was too cumbersome for the primary stagebut if one accepts the premise that the two stages of education are of equal importance then it is difficult to get away from the fact that they should therefore be treated in the same way from the point of view of appeals <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble lord has drawn attention to the nature and size of the annual intake of pupils because it brings pupils into clause which otherwise seems to deal only with capital expenditure matters <e> <s> however with regard to the nature of the annual intake of pupils i think that this is covered because as the section process under the education act stands at the moment if an authority wishes to make a significant change in the character of a school and that means for instance changing a school from being mixed to single-sexfrom being an to to a to schoolor from of course being selective to <e>", "<cs> that is a matter for the parliamentary draftsman <e>", "<cs> yes that is a matter for the parliamentary draftsman <e> <s> i think i have begun to learn enough about legislation to know that words are not put into legislation if the parliamentary draftsman takes the view that they would be otiose <e> <s> often i would be only too ready to agree with noble lords when they say they would like to put words into a bill and then i am generally told that the parliamentary draftsman will not agree because what parliament has to do is to produce legislation which is as effective as possible <e>", "<cs> without any hesitation i give the noble lord that assurance <e>", "<cs> might i first of all repeat because the noble lord lord mishcon was generous enough to mention it in moving the amendment that the government have written into the bill the requirement that if a nursery school is to be closed then the section procedure as we will call it must be gone through <e> <s> if i may say so without going into detail i think it is a very considerable advance on the situation which we find ourselves in today <e> <s> your lordships who took part in the second reading of this bill will know better than i do that the governments contention is that the duty which it was thought had been laid on local authorities by the education act had not really been a duty at all <e> <s> indeed what had been happening as anyone who had been taking an interest in nursery education over the years knows is that the duty had been regulated by successive governments by circular and so we do not stand today finding all our under-fives in school more is the pitywe find only a proportion of them in school <e>", "<cs> no a great advance <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord does so may i reply to the noble lord lord stewart of fulham about the point he made regarding clause <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that until when the then secretary of state for education withdrew the circular all secretaries of state for education among whom the noble lord opposite was a very distinguished one operated under what was called circular / <e> <s> if <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon has moved amendment no <e> <s> and has spoken to that amendment and to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> perhaps i may reply in the order in which he dealt with them <e> <s> as far as amendment no <e> <s> is concerned the effect of this being to widen the grounds for a clause procedure to include a significant change in an authoritys recruitment policy for an individual school the noble lord will appreciate that the drawing of catchment areas has never been a statutory requirement <e> <s> it has never had statutory authority <e> <s> although i realise that local education authorities will wish to continue to have school catchment areas clause let us not forget gives the parent the statutory right to choose a school regardless of where the family home is <e>", "<cs> the only thing i would add if i may is that so far as the first amendment that the noble lord lord mishcon moved is concerned that is amendment no <e> <s> to make any significant change in the manner of the area of recruitment of any school part of the section procedure i would just like to draw the noble baronesss and the noble lords attention to the fact that clause of the bill provides for the annual publication of details of admission arrangements including the policy followed in deciding admissions <e> <s> that means that parents should be in no doubt as to the prevailing arrangements and the catchment areas if any that are being used <e> <s> if i may say so that is a better way of getting across to the general public what the catchment areas for schools are bearing in mind that catchment areas are a non statutory procedure <e>", "<cs> the effect of the noble lords last three amendments nos <e> <s> c d and e would be that all objections relating to proposals affecting county schools should be sent to the secretary of state and not to the local authority concerned <e> <s> i can only say from my own brief experience many years ago that i know from working at the department of education that the procedure as it is at the moment is expensive time consuming and leads to delays <e> <s> at present all those entitled to do so submit their objections direct to the secretary of state and then are referred back by the department to the local authority concerned for their observations since without these comments the secretary of state cannot give due weight to the objections when he considers whether to approve the proposals <e> <s> it is to try to get round this that the new procedure in clause which the noble lord is criticising has been put in <e>", "<cs> if a proposal attracts no objections and is therefore decided under clause i think we may reasonably assume that it is in accordance with local needs and wishesin other words there have not been any objections <e> <s> therefore i do not see why it is necessary to place on the authority a duty to do more than is expected of the secretary of state in the case of proposals which are opposed <e>", "<cs> i am not speaking with advice now <e> <s> most certainly we will look at it but my assumption is that it is not inconceivable if this bill becomes law that at some stage there may well be an accompanying circular or some form of advice which will flow from my right honourable friends department to local authorities <e> <s> i should have thought that that would be the appropriate way in which modification could be interpreted <e> <s> i know that does not satisfy the point that the noble lord has put to me and we will certainly look at the wording of the clause in the light of what he has said <e> <s> in the meanwhile may i leave him with the assurance which i gave to him when i gave my first reply <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the right reverend prelate for what he has said because i think that amendments nos <e> <s> and are not reasonable <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would place a duty on authorities to consult with the governors of all county schools as well as with governors of voluntary schools that might be affected by a proposal relating to a voluntary school <e> <s> frankly do not think that is reasonable <e> <s> i do not want to rehearse the arguments at this late hour but i think that what the right reverend prelate has said about this pushing consultation further than was reasonable fills the bill <e>", "<cs> the answer to the noble lords question is yes <e>", "<cs> what a sensible wording of an amendment <e> <s> however i am afraid that i cannot possibly accept it <e> <s> the truth of the matter is that local education authorities bear a share of the maintenance costs of the premises of voluntary aided schools and it is plainly right that they should be consulted about building projects designed by architects employed by promoters or governors <e> <s> to that extent i genuinely agree abso lutely with the noble lord lord mishcon and the noble baroness lady birk that there must be consultation for the reason given <e>", "<cs> so far as amendment no <e> <s> is concerned the deletion proposed by this amendment would remove the duty on authorities and governors to publish their proposals in such a manner as required by regulations made by the secretary of state <e> <s> i should assure noble lords that it is intended that the regulations referred to in this clause should be on the same lines as the county and voluntary schools notices regulations <e> <s> they will lay down where the proposals should be publishedthat is in one local newspaper at or near any main entrance to the school concerned and in at least one other conspicuous place within the area <e> <s> that of course is the minimum <e>", "<cs> the amendment which the noble lord has moved is concerned with educational and training opportunities and financial support for those who have the misfortune to be made redundant and who may wish or indeed need to retrain for a new occupation <e> <s> the amendment impinges not only on the student award system but also on the special provisions made by the manpower services commission <e> <s> the noble lord said in moving the amendment that he hoped it would commend itself to the government <e> <s> i do not think that anything that the noble lord said would not commend itself to members of the committee but in this country we live in a real and at the moment a harsh economic world and in view of the provision which is already made by local education authorities and in particular by the manpower services commission i do not feel that it would be possible to create a further scheme to enable the secretary of state for education and science to bestow grants in the way that the noble lord would wish <e> <s> it is for that reason that i cannot accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> the clause to which the noble lord has drawn attention will make it possible for my right honourable friend the secretary of state for wales to pay specific grants towards the costs of teaching the welsh language and the use of welsh as a medium for teaching other subjects <e> <s> your lordships will be delighted to hear that it is identical in terms with a clause in the education bill introduced by the last administration in and lost with the election of last year <e>", "<cs> that is not in my brief <e> <s> what is in my brief are these words wales enjoys a rich and ancient culture distinct from englands <e> <s> its cornerstone is the welsh language <e>", "<cs> the amendment is not necessary <e> <s> section of the education act already prohibits charging in respect of admission to any school maintained by a local education authority and in respect of the education provided in such a school <e> <s> therefore it would not be possible for a drafting reason to write it into the bill <e>", "<cs> i have no idea <e>", "<cs> perhaps i had better first say that i have thought of the answer to my noble friend <e> <s> the answer subject to any correction is that it would not have any effect upon charges in a voluntary aided school <e> <s> perhaps i rather live in the past so far as this is concerned <e> <s> it occurred to me when i was looking at this amendment before your lordships met this evening that when in the s the plowden report was published the noble baroness will remember that there was in that report a minority report on the possibilities of charging for nursery education <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it can be said too often that the order before us is an exceptional measure and it is right that it should not be renewed without critical scrutiny <e> <s> it has certainly been given that scrutiny by noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> as the noble lord lord boston of faversham said it is a repugnant measure in many ways in a free country but it deals with acts which are repugnant to a free society <e> <s> i thank the noble lord for reaching the same conclusion as the government and indeed all your lordships have reached which is that however reluctantly we do so this legislation should be renewed for a further year <e> <s> let us remember that in a free society we lay upon ourselves the responsibility to have to come back to parliament to review and renew this legislation from year to year <e>", "<cs> my lords people ordinarily detained at a police station can also in the end be found to be innocent of any charge brought against them <e> <s> the point i am making to the noble lord is that compensation cannot be paid in those cases <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that and i shall certainly look into it <e>", "<cs> my lords the decisions of the world administrative radio conference so far as they may <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for those kind words <e> <s> i will certainly draw my right honourable friends attention to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for the remarks which he has made from his side of the house <e> <s> it was a very long conference and made very great demands on the united kingdom team who went to geneva <e> <s> i will also draw my right honourable friends attention to the words which the noble lord has been good enough to speak <e>", "<cs> the review was announced by the previous home secretary on th january and i understand began immediately thereafter <e> <s> at the request of sir henry yellowlees his deputy dr n j b evans visited the british embassy at islamabad and our high commissions in new delhi bombay and dacca during september last year <e> <s> interim instructions were given in october to posts in the indian sub-continent

or by both indeed after a fixed period <e> <s> i say indeed because i am a little perplexed by that proposal <e> <s> it seems to me that that really would prolong matters even further than they are prolonged at the present time <e>", "<cs> i accept that my lords but the automatic right then suffers from the first problem i tried to point out namely that it would be in danger time and again of raising the hopes of prisoners only to dash them to the ground <e> <s> i will try at this late hour quickly to answer some of the points raised by noble lords in the debate <e> <s> the noble earl referred to the resolution passed in by the committee of ministers of the council of europe <e> <s> that resolution recognised there were great differences in the existing practice of member states due to tradition divergence of public opinion and differing social conditions <e> <s> i want to take this opportunity to say that the government have accepted the principles contained in the resolution but consider that the procedure i have been describing for reviewing the cases of life sentence prisoners meets the spirit of the committees recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is going around the argument yet again <e> <s> he is going back to the same point that there ought to be an automatic moment when every case is considered <e> <s> no one is more compassionate than the noble earl but i believe that such a proposal would be less than compassionate because it would be a way to raise the hopes of a prisoner only to dash them to the ground <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite understand the concern of my noble friend <e> <s> of course it depends on the form that the statement takes <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are treating it as a matter of importance <e> <s> i am not aware that either <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly take into account what the noble lord has said and will pass it on to my right honourable friend so that he may take it into account in the review which he is conducting <e>", "<cs> my lords there is nothing between the government and the noble lord in what he is saying in his question <e> <s> the review which my right honourable friend has been conducting covers many departments in whitehall but it is the home office which is answering in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that i shall need even more time than the noble lord to assimilate the facts <e>", "<cs> my lords what i meant when i replied to my noble friend and said that it depended on the form of the statement is that of course if the report to parliament is made in the form of a parliamentary statement then there is nothing further to publish because the statement is being given to parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have had this issue under review for some time <e> <s> we have already concluded that it would be inappropriate to introduce citizens band radio on mhz the frequency band commonly used in other countries but we are still examining the regulatory and administrative difficulties involved in legalising the facility on a higher frequency <e> <s> we hope to announce a decision before long

are model controllers <e> <s> so far as the practice in other countries is concerned we find that the experience of other countries who have citizens band on mhz confirms the reservations which we have in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that we are having a national review of frequency allocations following the recent world administrative radio conference <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the radio regulatory department of the home office <e>", "<cs> my lords there is nothing between the noble lord and the government in the desire to see that these funds are used

in consultation with other representatives of the trade and other government departments <e> <s> the scheme has to be studied and in addition to that it has also to be decided how a trust should be administered <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure i can answer that question and the answer is no <e>", "<cs> my lords i reported to your lordships house last july that the brewers had just put forward their proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the general view of my noble friend about the desirability of members of the general public taking on these responsibilities when they feel

offenders or prevent offences or in assisting constables engaged in such activities <e> <s> so far as financial compensation is concerned there is of course the criminal injuries compensation fund

hooson <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not in any way disagree with what the noble and learned lord has just said <e> <s> may i add to the noble lord who previously asked a question that i think it is right to bear in mind that the function of the senior member of the judiciary will be to monitor the general system <e> <s> however in case that sounds vague do not let us forget that each individual interception requires the personal authorisation of my right honourable friend the home sec <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot forecast what will be in the first report of the senior judge which as my noble friend has said will be published <e> <s> may i add that my right honourable friend the home secretary has made it quite clear in another place that after that the home secretary will of course keep parliament informed as he has always done in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what the noble lord has said but what is at issue here is not the actual or potential capacity of technology but the effectiveness of the warrants procedure which requires individual authorisation by my right honourable friend for each individual interception <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly take note of what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> it is to be on a continuous basis my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i have nothing to add to the statement which was made in by the right honourable gentleman sir harold wilson when he was prime minister <e> <s> i think that it would be best in order to get it straight from the horses mouth if the noble lord would care to glance at that parliamentary statement made some years ago and the practice which was set out then has never subsequently been changed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords we are always indebted to my noble and learned friend <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement being made in another place by <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord boston of faversham and lord hooson for what they have said on this very difficult matter <e> <s> both noble lords in essence have asked me to give an assurance that the house will be kept informed <e> <s> i can certainly say to your lordships that i know that my right honourable friend the home secretary will consider whether it will be helpful for him to make a further statement to the house in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his final words <e> <s> i agree with him on his first point <e>", "<cs> my lords i would hope that i speak for all sides of the house when i say that we are all concerned that in those areas particularly inner city areas where there are many different communities relations should be as good as possible <e> <s> i am not going to jump to any hasty conclusion as to the exact causes of this particular trouble except to draw to the attention of the house the fact that my right honourable friends statement does not make any reference at all and quite deliberately so to who actually caused the trouble because at the moment we simply do not know <e> <s> so far as my noble friends second question is concerned this is a matter that he and i have discussed before now outside this house <e> <s> i think that i must repeat what i have said previously and privately to my noble friend that the point he is putting to me is not government policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully understand the noble lords concern but <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for the information that she has given to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wigg advises that we should not jump to conclusions <e> <s> that is good advice which the government have already taken <e> <s> i said earlier that my right honourable friends statement makes no mention in any line that this matter was connected with race relations <e> <s> we must await what will come out of the report by the chief constable <e> <s> after we have had the full report from the chief constable which my right honourable friend is receiving as a matter of urgency and after the minister of state has been to bristol to see the situation on the spot and to discuss the matter my right honourable friend will as lord wigg wishes consider carefully in the light of that and other reports what further action may be appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord knows programme content is a matter for the governors of the bbc and for the members of the independent broadcasting authority within the terms of the charter and the independent television act <e> <s> however i shall draw the noble lords remarks to the attention of the chairman of the governors of the bbc and the chairman of the iba <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat that my right honourable friends mind is in no way closed on the way in which he should proceed once he has received the reports to which i have already referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with much of the noble lords remarks and i do not wish to add to them significantly except to take up his last point <e> <s> i remind the house that there are agencies of which the police are one community relations councils locally are another and other people working in the field are a third who will have been involved in the st pauls area of bristol <e> <s> my information is very much the same as the information which has come to the noble lord and to which i referred in a supplementary answer <e> <s> the reports received by my right honourable friend indicate that relationships between the local community and the police for instance were not bad they were in fact good <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble baroness should believe all that she reads in the newspapers <e>", "<cs> well my lords i think the noble baroness would be well advised to take my advice <e> <s> the reply which i gave to the noble baroness represents a considerable increase over the period to which was taken into account when the government made up their expenditure white paper and i repeat that there is no reason why there should not be an expansion over the period that i am talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that what the noble lord is saying may very well be and knowing the noble lords experience almost certainly is a consequence of the non-making of grants in certain cases by certain authorities <e> <s> but the government believe that the discretionary grant system works not unreasonably well and it is a system which they have no intention of changing at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that unemployment and particularly the tragedy of youth unemployment was something which was new it has been with us for some years and i for one would not make a political point about it <e> <s> i was also not aware that youth unemployment trenched upon the question which i am being asked today namely discretionary grants by <e>", "<cs> my lords the discretionary awards are made by local authorities <e> <s> the assurance the noble baroness wants me to give is therefore totally beyond my power to give although of course i would wish to do everything i possibly can for the noble baroness in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will forgive me i do not think i can have made myself clear in my original answer <e> <s> i said that the governments public expenditure plans in the white paper provided for a growth in the provision for home students in non-advanced further education and our estimate is that this should permit a per cent <e> <s> increase in the number of students enrolled on non-advanced courses up to <e> <s> that does not square with what the noble baroness has just said <e>", "<cs> my lords

likely at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that our predecessors in parliament were wise in their generation <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware that when they passed the act it was written into it that it could come into operation only by order in council and it was provided that in bringing the draft order in <e>", "<cs> my lords i gather that the world council of churches was very much exercised with this at the world council of churches fifth assembly at nairobi in <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not had the pleasure of replying to questions recently from the noble baroness <e> <s> i have only been able to sit on the sidelines and watch as she manages to steer matters in the direction that she particularly wants <e> <s> the question the noble baroness asks does not arise from the question on the order paper <e> <s> i will however try to find out the answer and i promise the noble baroness that i will write to her <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the right reverend prelate for the information which he has given to the government and the questions he has asked <e> <s> all we can do is to pray that the churches will soon reach a conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i ought to add that i am advised that since successive governments have always looked for the full assent of the ecclesiastical authorities <e> <s> we believe therefore that the view of the orthodox church is important in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords it is most unfair but that is life <e>", "<cs> yes my lords on this particular matter <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their response to this statement <e> <s> if i may reply to the noble lord lord boston certainly the points which were made in your lordships house on the occasion of the first statement on this subject have been very much taken into account <e> <s> your lordships may have noticed from the statement which i have just made that the review of police contingency arrange <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not necessarily accept that on a local basis <e> <s> when the noble and learned lord with his experience takes a view on a matter of this sort i would not take it upon myself to say that he is wrong <e> <s> so far as a particular place of the size and importance as bristol is concerned however surely your lordships house would want to find out what at local level the elected representatives think <e> <s> it is because my right honourable friend the home secretary wants to find out what is really thought on this as well as on other points by the county council and the city council in consultation with other agencies which i have mentioned including as i said the manpower services commission that i think it would be right to wait for the result of those local deliberations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot answer my noble friends question <e> <s> there is no question but that a great deal of the damage and the injuries was probably done by missiles which were thrown <e> <s> all i think i ought to say in reply to my noble friend as i cannot answer the specific question she has put to me is that the numbers have changed somewhat since i reported to the house on the first occasion <e> <s> we do now know that police officers were injured more had minor injuries and members of the public were also injured <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the police are concerned the point of the statement is that the police are looking into their own contingency arrangements for the future <e> <s> the police inquiry has nothing to do with the social conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that this matter arises from the statement which i have made <e> <s> it was for that reason that i let go that point which the noble lord lord boston made <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry my lords <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for helping me in this matter <e> <s> the reason why there is this meeting together of people on a national basis for what has happened in local circumstances is that my right honourable friend the home secretary has an overall responsibility for the efficiency of policing in this country and it is my right honourable friend who has asked these representatives to come together to look at contingency arrangements for policing against spontaneous outbreaks of violence and trouble in england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that the noble lord should talk about scepticism now as regards the commission <e> <s> if i may say so that reflects on members of the commission who have accepted the secretary of states invitation to serve for a further term <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord will not mind if i remind him that the chairman of the commission has made it clear publicly that since it was established the commission as a whole has been critical of government policies those of the previous as well as of the present government and that the commission will remain independent in the day-to-day conduct of its business <e> <s> as for the second part of the noble lords supplementary question about investigating immigration procedures the home office were advised that the commission did not have power to undertake such an investigation <e> <s> this question is now before the courts in friendly proceedings to establish the extent of the commissions powers <e>", "<cs> my lords i must put it to the noble lord that the chairman of the commission has himself categorically <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for that comment my lords <e> <s> the appointment of those members was not renewed and the reason why their appointment was not renewed was given in my original answer <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble and learned lord knows the members of the commission are appointed in an individual capacity and not as representatives but i give him an assurance that of course my right honourable friend is anxious to ensure that the commission has members drawn from the main ethnic minority groups <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little surprised that the noble lord would reach conclusions about a statement which my right honourable friend the home secretary has not made and i think that the noble lord would wish to wait for anything that my right honourable friend might say on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i was impressed by the speech made by the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> he spoke with obvious feeling and put the case very clearly <e> <s> indeed the other speeches made by your lordships in the debate this evening have followed the noble lord in those respects <e> <s> but i think that the case that has been made has disregarded to some extent three important points the first is the nature of the relationship between the government and the bbc the second is the scale of the last licence increase and the third point relates to the statements made by the bbc governors for alternative support for music in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the financial price is concerned i certainly appreciate the force of the question which the noble lord asks of me <e> <s> it is to see whether the balance between the rights of demonstrators and the interests of the rest of the public is correct that the government are undertaking a review of the public order act and related legislation on which my right honourable friend published a green paper last week and upon which i know my right honourable friend would welcome the views of noble lords <e> <s> of course in that respect my right honourable friend will be taking into account what the noble lord said in his supplementary <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not presume to depart from the conclusion which the noble and learned lord has reached that this constituted a threat and clearly the commissioner of police of the metropolis took the threat very seriously <e> <s> but the commissioner has to operate within the terms of the existing law and as the noble and learned lord will know better than i do the commissioner has to believe that serious disorder cannot otherwise be prevented before he can apply for a ban or impose conditions <e> <s> the commissioner reached a conclusion that serious disorder could otherwise be prevented and if i may say so in the final analysis the commissioner was proved right <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that this is something which has not been taken into account in the green paper <e> <s> what has been canvassed in last weeks green paper is whether it might not be right to require those who demonstrate to contribute to the cost <e> <s> this presents difficulties because in some cases it would be difficult to apportion blame for the disorder between the organisers and those who oppose them <e> <s> in regard to the suggestion that the right reverend prelate has put to me i should like to <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that each case is a matter for the courts to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as the first supplementary question is concerned these are costs which have been assessed by the metropolitan police for the expenses they incurred <e> <s> i am not trying to be unhelpful but i do not think i can go further than that <e> <s> so far as the second and important supplementary question is concerned what the noble lord has said is taken seriously into account from the operational point of view by the commissioner and his officers before these decisions are arrived at <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks hypothetical questions <e> <s> the only way i could respond to be helpful to the house is to make it clear that the powers under the act to ban or impose conditions on marches require that the decision is made on public order grounds alone <e> <s> before going to my right honourable friend the secretary of state it is on those grounds and those alone as the law now stands that the commissioner and chief constables throughout the country must make up their minds <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords are saying many things with which i find myself in agreement but i seriously ask the noble lord lord janner and all noble lords if they have time to read my right honourable friends green paper cmnd <e> <s> and perhaps to respond to the invitation that i sought to offer at the beginning of this exchange <e> <s> i repeat that the home secretary would very much welcome observations from members of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the home secretary on prisons <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may reply to the noble lords who have spoken from the front benches and thank them for the constructive response which they have given to my right honourable friends statement <e> <s> in essence both the noble lord lord boston of faversham and the noble lord lord foot have asked me about the prison building programme <e> <s> because of the need to take old prison accommodation out of use the legacy of years and years of neglect running over <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may answer the noble lord lord soper i thank him for the advice he has given on this which is valuable and helpful to the government <e> <s> the plan is for shelter for people suffering from alcoholic problems which otherwise would land them in prison which will be provided by existing voluntary organisations who are already running some form of accommodation facilities people in the field who already know what they are doing <e> <s> nevertheless i should like to draw the attention of my right honourable friend to what the noble lord said about advice from the department <e> <s> already there have been negotiations between the home office and some of the voluntary organisations which of course we had to have before we could come to parliament to suggest that this is a road down which we wish to go <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend for the three questoins she has put because if i may say so they are most relevant <e> <s> so far as the first two points are concerned made by my noble friend lady faithfull whether immigrants awaiting deportation could be kept in bail hostels and whether juveniles could not be kept in some sort of accommodation outside prison of course my noble friend would be the first to realise that there are some people although by no means all those in prison who require to be kept in secure accommodation <e> <s> i think we have to keep that in mind when we look at what the noble baroness has suggested <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i understand that that is so <e>", "<cs> i think i can answer the noble lord very swiftly on the important points which he has made <e> <s> as to the adequacy of what the government are attempting to do at a time of severe restraint of public expenditure we are not restraining the recurrent expenditure on the prison service <e> <s> in other words we are welcoming as many prison officers as will apply and are suitable for service in the prisons <e> <s> as i sought to explain to the <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to my noble friend is in the affirmative <e> <s> i think that the record of the community service order which of course sprang from recommendations from the noble baroness lady wootton who sits on the other side of the house but was introduced by the party that sits on this side of the house which is one of good co-operation speaks for itself <e> <s> what i will do is to send my noble friend a short note showing the percentage of those offenders who are on community service and also how successful these community service orders are <e>", "<cs> my lords the provisions of this bill are very wide and they have enabled the noble lord lord avebury to express his long-standing and deep concern for ethnic minorities and the difficulties which they face <e> <s> but although your lordships who have also spoken in this debate clearly share the noble lords concern not all noble lords who have spoken see the solution to the problems we have been discussing as being best met by the provisions of this bill <e> <s> i should like to make it clear that the government share the concern which has been expressed but if the principle of equal opportunities for all our citizens is to be genuine then i suggest that we must recognise the extent of the problems which face all people whose circumstances call for special help and who live usually in the most deprived parts of our inner cities <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly the previous government and this government will be seen as i say a little more not to be seeing matters entirely eye to eye but the paragraph which i have just quoted i think illustrates the point which has been made by many noble lords in this debate which is that this bill goes off in a direction which many noble lords feel is ill-advised in that it would set up a wider-ranging special fund involving significant additional resources <e> <s> at the moment the level of expenditure grant aided by section of the local government act amounts to a considerable sum <e> <s> the grant was paid on a total expenditure of just under million and we know from the figure given in connection with the previous governments bill that additional expenditure was proposed for that of some million in the first year if that bill had become law rising to some million additional expenditure in the third year at prices if that bill had become law <e> <s> moreover legislation of the kind which the noble lord lord avebury is laying before the house would require not only that but additional staff both centrally and locally <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the understanding and support of both noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both the noble lord lord boston and the noble lord lord widoger for their response to my right honourable friends statement in another place <e> <s> i assure both noble lords that the obvious feeling of your lordships house this afternoon will be drawn to the attention by my right honourable friends department of

which had to be taken in the last few days were difficult as noble lords opposite and from all parts of the house obviously appreciate judging by the sensitive way in which they have responded to the two statements on this subject which have been made in the last few days <e> <s> i shall draw the remarks of the right reverend prelate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the case about which the noble lord lord avebury is talking because he has asked me about it <e> <s> those who have been discharged from hospital have been taken to a place where they are receiving medical care and are being well looked after <e> <s> i understand that they have all expressed a wish to remain there until the police have taken detailed statements from them but they are free to leave if they wish <e>", "<cs> my lords i can quite understand the concern which my noble friend is expressing and i am sure that the cordoning-off will be taken away as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it was with precisely those thoughts in mind although of course her majestys government did not envisage what was going to occur that we put into the immigration rules what we thought was a reasonable provision about the period of time during which students should be here if they are on genuine courses <e> <s> so far as visas are concerned in accordance with the luxembourg declaration of nd april we have decided to suspend the visa abolition agreement between the united kingdom and iran <e> <s> the exact timing of that will be fixed shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords the computer which i have mentioned in previous immigration debates is due to become operational this year <e> <s> it will produce information more reliably and quickly than at present about cases in which overstaying may have occurred <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> there are conditions on the admission of students in the changes in the immigration rules which were laid before parliament on th february but i think those conditions are fair and reasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords under rule a student wanting to be admitted to this country must satisfy the immigration officer that the intention is to come for a full-time course and that the student will leave when the studies are completed <e> <s> in answer to my noble friend the checks on a students attendance set out in the immigration rules for control after entry enable the immigration and nationality department to require educational establishments to produce their attendance registers for inspection as a prerequisite to their overseas students receiving any extensions of stay <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot tell the noble baroness when the computer will come into operation <e> <s> i can understand the concern she is expressing but may i just say to her that the control in the new immigration rules is tighter although as i have just told the house i think it is fair <e> <s> perhaps i might partly repeat myself and say that there are three criteria on which a student be it a language student or a student of any other kind must satisfy the immigration officer among other things that the student is coming for a full-time course that a student can accommodate himself or herself and any dependants during the stay and that the student will leave when the studies are completed <e> <s> if those criteria cannot be satisfactorily fulfilled to the immigration officer then the student is not admitted <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with what the noble lord has said <e> <s> none the less i think that the control of people who wish to come to this country should be firm but fair <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with what the noble lord has just said <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friends the home secretary and the minister of transport held a working conference on violence on public transport on tuesday th may <e> <s> i am pleased to be able to say that underground services in london were operated normally last weekend and that the union representatives at the conference indicated that they would be recommending their members to continue normal working following the conference <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with the concern which my noble friend has expressed <e> <s> my noble friend might like to know that at this conference last tuesday the british rail representatives described their plans for mobile groups of british transport police who would be able to respond quickly to reports of incidents <e> <s> my right honourable friend the minister of transport has agreed to consider urgently with british rail how this might be achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the answer that i have just given to my noble friend is a reply to the question which the noble lord has just asked <e> <s> in addition to the british transport police the metropolitan police assist the british transport police whenever necessary <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware i am glad to say that during the last year the numbers of the metropolitan police have increased enormously <e>", "<cs> my lords again i entirely agree with what the noble lord has said <e> <s> british rail are at present considering a by-law which would enable them to ban alcohol on selected trains <e> <s> the government are concerned that the courts should have adequate powers to deal with juveniles who behave in the way that the noble lord has described <e> <s> the government have announced a number of specific measures in this area which we have either taken or which we intend to take <e> <s> they include of course an increase in the number of attendance centres an experimental regime in two detention centres the removal of section <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the best way i can answer my noble friend is to say this <e> <s> i have tried to deal with the numbers of british transport police and metropolitan police and i have spoken about what the government are doing <e> <s> however i would add in reply to my noble friend that the government are considering a recommendation from the criminal law revision committee that the maximum penalty for assault should be increased to six months imprisonment or a fine of or both <e> <s> subject to the necessary consultations the government are ready to accept that recommendation <e>", "<cs> my lords that is why i told the house just now that british rail are considering a by-law in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords that question again falls within the scope of the answer which i have just given <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i really must make the point that the government are entirely satisfied with the level of co-operation between the two forces <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships have all expressed gratitude to my noble friend lord inglewood for introducing this bill into your lordships house this evening and we are grateful also of course to my honourable friend mr james hill in another place <e> <s> may i just say that my noble friend is being absolutely consistent in introducing the bill this evening because of course it was he who was responsible for introducing the similar legislation last year which passed through all its stages and was in another place when the general election intervened <e>", "<cs> my lords written representations should be sent to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science as soon as possible and so far as the timetable is concerned in any event not later than the end of june <e>", "<cs> my lords the examination will indeed need to assess and to take account of the inner london education authoritys performance to which the noble lord lord mishcon has just referred in the light of the situation in inner london <e> <s> my right honourable friend and his colleagues are concerned to ensure that the administrative structure for education is such that teachers their advisers and officials are able to give their best performance and that taxpayers and ratepayers are getting good value for money <e>", "<cs> my lords this is in essence an internal government review which was commissioned really by the london government act which said that such a review should be put before parliament in <e> <s> but of course that provision was removed by the labour government in <e> <s> in undertaking this review the issues which i have indicated to the noble lord lord mishcon will be before the review <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason why i made a point about the nature of the review and from what it stems namely originally the london government act is that this is not a public inquiry <e> <s> however i should like to repeat the assurance that i gave at the beginning of this exchange with the noble baroness that all the representations which my right honourable friend receives will be very carefully considered <e>", "<cs> my lords in all friendliness to the noble lord and recognising his long experience of politics i really think that the first assertion which he has made in his question is unfounded <e> <s> as regards what will be the outcome of the review i must say that that is precisely why the review is being undertaken and i think we must await its result <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend the minister of state who cannot be here today in fact said during the previous exchange on th april that it would be published <e>", "<cs> my lords a case of this nature is wholly inconsistent with my right honourable friends policy of trying to see that fewer people are kept in custody <e> <s> people like mrs de-silva cause very great problems to the prison service and i should like to make that crystal clear to the noble lord <e> <s> i confirm to the best of my knowledge that the dates that the noble lord put to me are correct for the period of time that mrs de-silva was kept in custody and the reason was that she had committed a series of criminal offences and in spite of her explicit undertakings had engaged in unauthorised employment and this record inspired no confidence as to her likely conduct if she was released <e>", "<cs> my lords we would like to find a solution to this particular problem but if one takes a case of this kind where someone who comes as a visitor to the country commits criminal offences quite apart from the undertaking which that person gave with regard to immigration control it really is then extremely difficult to see how such a person can be released pending deportation <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that in this case neither the court nor my right honourable friend felt able to direct such release <e>", "<cs> my lords i absolutely take the point which the noble and learned lord makes <e> <s> the reason why i attached it to this particular case was that it is the sort of case as the noble <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad my noble friend made that point a point which remains always in my right honourable friends mind <e>", "<cs> my lords without prejudicing or appearing in any way to interfere with the judicial discretion of the courts my answer to the supplementary questions asked by my noble friend is yes in each case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most concerned that by the first part of that supplementary question the noble lord should suggest to your lordships house that in some way the way in which this lady was dealt with was not consistent with the maxims of british justice <e> <s> the period of time that mrs dc-silva was kept in detention was a period during which a right of appeal might be exercised and which under the act must be allowed to expire <e> <s> the noble lord then intervened as he had every right to do and that had to be considered <e> <s> it was a week later that the deportation order was signed and mrs de-silva left three days later <e> <s> regarding the point the noble lord raised about holloway prison as he will be aware that prison is being rebuilt at the present time and that project is being pushed ahead with at the greatest possible speed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i must admit that i was advised about this only recently before the debate in your lordships house this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of what i have endeavoured to say to the house this evening i do not think that is a practical proposition and i do not accept the proposition which the noble lord has put to me in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords all that is actually new in paragraph as compared with the birkett report is the reference to cases where <e>", "<cs> my lords i think if i start to cross swords with the noble and learned lord i shall get into deeper and deeper water <e> <s> all i think that i ought to say and can say is that these <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure whether we are straying from the bounds of order <e> <s> i am not trying to protect myself in saying that but we are on an unstarred question and i had finished my speech <e> <s> all that i think i ought to say to the noble lord in case as i said i get into water in which i am out of my depth is that the words which i read out originally in reply to the noble and learned lord because i was reading from a note which i had in my hand i think hold good in reply to the final question put to me by the noble lord lord hooson <e> <s> it was for the reason which i gave to the noble and learned lord that the words which are new in paragraph have been injected into the white paper <e> <s> i am sorry my lords but i really do not think i can go further than that this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that saturday sittings and bank holiday sittings can be arranged at short notice but as my noble friend is very probably aware they are arranged at the discretion of the court very often at the request of the police and not least when hooliganism appears to be likely <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend that when this happens it reduces the number of offenders who for instance the police would be required to hold in custody and is therefore desirable <e> <s> however this is not a situation in which the home office would be giving directions to the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with the noble and learned lord that there are many cases which simply cannot be dealt with by holding courts called together at very short notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lady macleod of borve for what she has said <e> <s> perhaps i may just add one matter which arises from my noble friends question <e> <s> the point made by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones is important for me to take on board <e> <s> clearly there are cases which cannot be dealt with in any courts the magistrates court is the subject of my noble friends question when the courts are called together at short notice <e> <s> like my noble friend lord orr-ewing we are all concerned that hooliganism should be contained and reduced and i suggest to your lordships house that there are other ways of looking at this <e> <s> your lordships might be interested to hear that the number of attendance centres throughout the country which are a way of instilling some discipline into the lives of some young people has been very considerably increased during the period of the last year <e>", "<cs> my lords that is rather a fast ball <e> <s> as far as i remember the suspended sentence most certainly came after that particular date <e> <s> on the other hand i do not draw the same conclusion that the noble lord draws from the question he has asked <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested that the noble baroness thinks that if the final sanction of imprisonment were to be done away with one would not revert to the sort of figures for soliciting that were found before the act <e> <s> i am not saying that in any way to cross swords with the noble baroness <e> <s> i am genuinely trying to listen to what has been said in this debate because it is an important debate this evening <e> <s> in this connection may i say that i discerned a difference between the speeches and the objectives of the noble lord lord avebury and the noble lord lord harris <e> <s> the bill of the noble lord lord avebury and the speech which he made on it would not only remove custody as a final sanction for soliciting but also reduces the maximum financial penalties which there would be for someone who is soliciting <e> <s> as i understood the speech of the noble lord lord harris he spoke of the desirability of removing the final sanction of imprisonment but also spoke of the necessity of substantial financial penalties <e> <s> this evening all i can say is that we shall have to see what the criminal law revision committee has to say about this aspect of the matter <e> <s> but certainly there is an important distinction here between those attitudes of the two noble lords who spoke <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the figure which my noble friend gave in the first part of the supplementary question the figure last year for settlement in this country was in the order of <e> <s> with regard to the overall government view of this general figure for which my noble friend asked of course the government take a very serious view of those who attempt to circumvent the immigration control and who come here not lawfully in other words who do not fall within the figure given <e>", "<cs> my lords the question asked by my noble friend lord barnby is about the number of people coming into this country not the number of people going out and both my noble friend and i have confined our questions and our answers to that aspect of the case <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to ask me about other aspects of the case then if he cares to put down a question i shall of course be at his service to answer it <e> <s> so far as overstayers are concerned perhaps it would be to the convenience of the house if i said this <e> <s> during the whole of last year there were about overstayers recorded over during the final quarter <e> <s> i understand that the increase in the first quarter of this year because that is what the figures show was due in part to the improved methods of detection and was also due to the fact that it was only during the course of the last year that the overstayers section of the home office became fully established <e> <s> before that the numbers detected would not have been recorded in such a systematic way <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer which i gave originally speaks for itself <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not agree with what the noble lord is saying <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures which governments collect and this government are no exception to this refer to settlements on arrival here acceptances on arrival of citizens from the new commonwealth and pakistan and settlements on removal of the time limit as it is called <e> <s> i think it is absolutely right that the figures should be collected in this way but beyond that i repeat that the answer which i gave originally speaks for itself <e>", "<cs> i should like to register the governments support for the noble baroness in this long amendment <e> <s> in homely terms as i understand it it is right that those whose livelihood may be affected by the proposed new powers of the licensing justices and the magistrates courts which are contained in this bill should have as a collorary rights of appeal <e> <s> the noble baroness has explained those rights absolutely clearly <e> <s> i find them most acceptable <e>", "<cs> i ought to give the committee an assurance that if the bill is approved the government will endeavour to bring the provisions of clauses <e>", "<cs> my lords all of your lordships who have spoken in this short debate this evening for the initiation of which we are grateful to the noble lord lord hill of luton have made the point that the services of the bbc are of the greatest value <e> <s> that point has been made finally in the very interesting speech to which we have just listened made by the noble lord lord ponsonby <e> <s> i associate myself with the speeches of your lordships in this matter <e> <s> the way in which the bbc has provided public service broadcasting over the years has been an object lesson to anyone who cares to listen and to see and therefore any debate of this nature particularly one raised by someone who has the experience not only of public life but also of broadcasting as has the noble lord lord hill raises questions which must be taken very seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord anticipates what i was about to put to your lordships <e> <s> your lordships may remember that the chairman of the bbc sir michael swann while making no secret of the serious implications for the bbc of the level of the licence fee none the less in his lecture to the royal television society speaking of the governments decision on the new licence fees said <e>", "<cs> my lords the second part of the question the noble lord asks is of course a matter for the bbc governors <e> <s> the first part of the question is a matter of fact <e> <s> there was a ceiling on the borrowing powers of the corporation which was raised the word i used in my speech was relaxed by the previous government for perfectly understandable reasons early in <e> <s> but the effect of that relaxation was that certainly last year the bbc was running a formidable debt on current account which amounted to some million <e>", "<cs> my lords we have said certainly in another place i am not sure whether it has been said in your lordships house that my right honourable friend is instituting and has instituted discussions between his department and the bbc on the future financing and financial arrangements of the bbc <e> <s> this is of course in an attempt to ensure that when the licence fee is fixed in the interests of the corporation and everybody that licence fee fixing will be for sensible periods of time <e> <s> i do not think i can go further this evening along that particular path except to say to the noble lord that although we have this evening discussed at some length some of the great problems which undoubtedly arise as a result of the licence fee system i think that would be as nothing compared to some of the suggestions which are occasionally made for instance that perhaps the bbc should be financed out of direct taxation precisely the sort of thing which would mean that the bbc would lose the independence which we all so much desire <e>", "<cs> my lords may i merely express my gratitude to the noble lord for the support he has been good enough to give me <e> <s> i think that it was a nice touch that his colleague the noble lord lord wells-pestell who as the noble lord said had been responsible for introducing this order previously when the last government were in office is in your lordships chamber this evening listening to this short exchange of remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot say on what date the report of the law commission was laid before ministers in fact it was submitted to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor but i understand that it is to be published on thursday of next week <e> <s> anything which my right honourable friend the home secretary will have said in another place indeed anything that my right honourable friend has said anywhere of course i agree with <e> <s> i am afraid it was rather at that point that i lost track of the noble lord lord avebury <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his intervention and i take the point which he makes that this is a matter which is of concern to those who are responsible for enforcing the law <e> <s> but so that there shall be no misunderstanding may i repeat what i said in my original answer to the noble lord lord avebury that the government accept the need for a change in the law but what we are saying is that this area of the law including that of attempted theft must be looked at as a whole to ensure that there are no unwanted gaps in the law or in the police powers to enforce it <e> <s> i should like to give my noble friend an assurance that certainly the home office is anxious to learn the views of anyone who is interested in this matter not least magistrates the police bodies concerned with race relations including the commission for racial equality and the legal profession and of course members of both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i have figures for charges but not for convictions which have been secured <e> <s> i will send those to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly copy anything which i send to the noble lord lord wigoder and send it to the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> it is always a pleasure to correspond with the noble lord <e> <s> i do it quite often <e> <s> if the noble lord will now bring himself up to i think if he glances at paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord lord boston of faversham that it has been not only for the convenience of your lordships house but for the interest of anyone who will be reading the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the authorities on both sides of the border will do their best <e> <s> however the answer to my noble friends supplementary is that although the travelling and subsistence rates for witnesses follow those agreed by the civil service department for the civil service it takes some time to obtain clearance for and issue circulars to the courts notifying them of changes in the rates payable <e> <s> the home office has sought to avoid unnecessarily adding to the burdens on the magistrates courts by refraining from back-dating whereas the scots appear to adopt the date of the civil service increase <e> <s> this creates some retrospective discrepancies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to say that in this matter there is perfect harmony between england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted to the noble earl lord halsbury not only for his speech but for a bill on a subject which is both complex and controversial and which your lordships house decided last october to commit to a select committee and had it not been for the bill which the noble earl brought forward and the many hours of work and no doubt of negotiation which he put into the matter it would not be possible for us to have the report of the select committee and indeed the bill which is now before us <e> <s> i pay tribute too to the work of the noble lord lord ashby and to your lordships who were members of the select committee <e>", "<cs> in case the committee should think that the home office has anything to hide may i remind your lordships that the noble earl has been good enough to complain of the mass of statistics which are given in the annual report <e> <s> however i think it is valuable that the home office should have expressions of opinion on this matter <e> <s> the noble earl kindly gave me notice before the proceedings today that he would be referring to the annual report and the noble lord lord airedale now delivers <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not dissent from anything which my noble friend has just said <e> <s> i think the best way of avoiding the problem my noble friend has raised is for everyone to get a real understanding of the facts so that the influence of language itself is minimised <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say that i have thought of the problem entirely in the terms that the noble lord has put to me <e> <s> i think that i would support the spartan principle of calling that which is just equal not that which is equal just <e>", "<cs> my lords the definition which i think i can put to the legislation which this government put their name to as far as community relations matters are concerned would fall within the scope of my last answer to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will know at present the rampton inquiry which was set up by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education last year is looking into the serious matter of the education of children from the ethnic minorities <e>", "<cs> my lords may i congratulate the noble baroness on reaching this stage with her bill <e> <s> arising from my noble friends speech it is a bill on which a good deal of care has been taken because it has been amended in committee in your lordships house and it therefore does not pass to the statute book where i hope very soon it will be but it goes back first to another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to write to the noble lord on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords the problem of prison escorts is one that we must get right <e> <s> it is a problem which highlights the need for increased recruit <e>", "<cs> my lords the relief given to pentonville lies in the fact that the deportees who were there have in turn gone to ashford remand centre which was not full and i understand that the prison at which my noble friend is a member of the board of governors hopes ultimately to absorb to prisoners from brixton <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i am not in possession of those statistics <e> <s> during the course of the debate i asked in case i could reply to the noble lord <e> <s> if after the debate i find that i have the statistics at the department they are certainly not here at the moment and they can be provided to the noble lord then of course i will most certainly see that they are provided <e>", "<cs> my lords the existing programme is at the moment a provisional programme <e> <s> this provisional programme extends over the next three or four years and will provide more places but as they are not absolutely firm in other words the places are not absolutely firmly in a programme but are provisional at the moment i should not like to be drawn on the exact number <e> <s> but i should like to repeat what i said to the noble lord that it is the intention of the department and of my right honourable friend that at the end of the programme the major centres of population will be served by bail hostels and as the noble lord may remember i gave an assurance at that moment in my speech about the reviewing of the programme in the light of the working of the bail act <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the first question is that the answer is yes but of course it would be premature to say what proposals the parliament will make or whether indeed the council of ministers will adopt those proposals <e> <s> the state of play regarding my noble friends second supplementary question is that the matter is presently being considered by a sub <e>", "<cs> it is not a question of waiting until the report is received from the committee my lords but a question of waiting until unanimous agreement has been reached in the council of ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords as the question is hypothetical we have not yet given consideration to the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i would say with respect that this is the difference between the optimist and the pessimist <e> <s> the noble lord will remember that the optimist is the man who believes his glass is half full while the pessimist believes it is half empty <e> <s> it is entirely for the noble lords imagination as to what view parliament will take of proposals if they come forward and if they are unanimously agreed by the council of ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord i can only conjecture <e> <s> as i have said at least twice we must wait to sec what those proposals are and then whether they are agreed unanimously by the council of ministers <e>", "<cs> that also is pure conjecture my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords that of course is a matter for the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend is referring to the last elections for the european parliament i can only answer that parliament took the view that the most appropriate system was that of direct single member representation in individual constituencies and that is the basis on which that election was contested <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the facts which my noble friend puts to me but i must repeat at the end of these several questions that we are first of all waiting not only for proposals but for unanimous agreement and it will then be for parliament to decide exactly how that agreement should be translated if it is translated into the law of this country <e>", "<cs> i entirely understand from the clear explanation which my noble friend has given the intentions which lie behind her two amendments <e> <s> however my noble friend mentioned that the date upon which the housing standards had been set down was now many years ago <e> <s> i do not think that just for that reason they are necessarily out of date <e>", "<cs> speaking without notice i know that the department of the environment will look closely at what my noble friend has said but as i think he will know better than i do with his knowledge of legislation there has to be some point at which legislation comes into effect and this particular point has been held to be the right point so far as this legislation is concerned <e> <s> unless one chooses a different point at which this particular clause comes into effect and if my noble friend will not mind my saying so i am not persuaded of the need for that or unless there was some graduated way in which one could make the clause come into effect and certainly i am not persuaded that that is possible then i do not think that what my noble friend is asking for would be possible <e> <s> i simply say that now to prevent unnecessary communication between my noble friend and the department <e> <s> if what i have said is correct i think probably there will be no further communication with my noble friend who may like to consider whether to table an amendment at report stage <e> <s> lf <e>", "<cs> i am not surprised that two of my noble friends have joined with my noble friend lady faithfull in speaking to this amendment because in listening to previous amendments this evening i realised that the matter of empty properties is something which has exercised the concern of members of the committee <e> <s> i should like to say first that i would hope that local authorities will review systematically and regularly their vacancy <e>", "<cs> i think that i can satisfy my noble friend in replying in this way <e> <s> the only particulars of which details must be supplied by this subsection of the bill are those which the applicant himself has provided <e> <s> it would not be right for applicants to have the right to see reports supplied by doctors which were mentioned by my noble friend social workers or others which may have been given on a confidential basis to the housing authority <e> <s> authorities have pointed out during the consultation process on this bill that such reports would cease if confidentiality were not assured <e> <s> i think that if the committee looks at the wording of this part of the bill it will see that my noble friends apprehensions in this respect are groundless <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady david in moving her amendment amendment no <e> <s> asked whether the government would give a friendly reply <e> <s> that amendment and the succeeding amendment of the noble baroness lady denington give me the opportunity to explain very briefly what the government are doing by way of response to the objectives of both amendments <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble baroness will not think i am being discourteous if in answer to quite a long and detailed amendment which has a lot of meat in it i reply fairly briefly <e> <s> i do so in the context of the new mobility housing scheme which i sought to explain on the previous amendment <e> <s> this scheme would for instance cover the cases which are set out in subsection of this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am quite sure that my noble friends department would do exactly what the noble lord is asking but it would be of course as the noble lord would he the first to understand in the context of legislation which exists already to deal with rights in the matrimonial home the matrimonial homes act the matrimonial causes act and the domestic violence and matrimonial proceedings act all of which the noble lord has referred to during the committee proceedings this evening <e> <s> these acts give substantial protection to spouses in cases of family break-up and of course anything the noble lord put forward would have to he looked at in the context of that existing legislation <e>", "<cs> there is every reason not to accept this amendment <e> <s> the reason is that rent arrears stand at the moment at the scandalous total of million <e> <s> that is what is owed to local authority exchequers <e> <s> on this ground alone i should not have the slightest intention of accepting what i consider to he a totally ill-conceived amendment <e> <s> in moving the amendment the noble baroness was good enough to say that she did not want too long an answer and having perhaps been a little brusque in my first response may i say that the noble baroness is absolutely right <e> <s> the present government have changed their minds on this matter i admit it openly <e>", "<cs> the answer to the noble lord lord pitt lies in this extremely high figure which i quoted at the beginning <e>", "<cs> but this is the way that local authorities see it <e> <s> what they say to the government is that if this amendment were accepted then the proceedings would be more protracted and the amount of rent arrears which would need to be recovered would be even greater than it is if there can be distraint immediately <e> <s> that is the case which is put by the local authorities and as they are the people who have to weigh up this very difficult matter at local level i have to say to the noble lord that the government have to take very serious account of what is being said at local authority level <e>", "<cs> my lords having regard to the advice that has been given by the noble and learned lord from the opposition front bench i think that the less said the better <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not government policy and indeed so far as i know it has not been government policy to hypothecate its sources of income <e> <s> perhaps i may just add that as i think the noble lord knows very well the basis of the levy has always been that the public should share in the exploitation of a public monopoly and that is an argument for the proceeds going generally for <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and that is one of the reasons why my noble friend lord cockfield mentioned in answer to an earlier question on the order paper that my right honourable friend the home secretary and also the chancellor of the exchequer are together looking at the system of the payment of the levy <e>", "<cs> my lords when i hypothecate i take something and i give it somewhere else and that is precisely what i am telling the noble lord lord aylestone we cannot do in this particular case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord boston of faversham and indeed to the noble lord lord mcnair and the noble lord lord underhill for the welcome which they have been good enough to give to the regulations which arc made under the act which was passed earlier this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to cross swords with the noble lord with his very long and deep experience of electoral registration matters but i can only say that from my reading of regulation and from the advice i have received from my right honourable friends department i do not think the noble lord is on to a sound point <e> <s> if i might repeat what i said in case there was a misunderstanding i am advised that claims received after th december will be treated as relating to the next new register <e> <s> for that reason the point that the noble lord raises is not a valid one in this particular case <e> <s> with that i hope correct advice to your lordships i beg to move that the first of these regulations be agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that these regulations be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that these regulations be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that these regulations be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i was sorry to hear the noble lord lord boston of faversham give expression to a view which i know he made it clear he does not hold particular strongly but which he realises others do hold that this could be said to be a further attempt to regulate our lives <e> <s> i think that the noble lord and i would probably agree that when one comes to look at the actual terms of the articles of the order one finds that the united kingdom is going in one direction in one week in order to meet our colleagues in the european community and that the other members of the european community are coming one week in the other direction in order to meet us <e> <s> therefore there is fairness as a basis for the introduction of this order <e>", "<cs> my lords precisely but i am telling the noble lord that if they care to get up earlier in the morning they will still find that there is just as much daylight to enjoy <e> <s> when they come home in the evening by the time one gets towards <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may answer my noble friends two supplementaries together of course the boundary commissions must complete their reports by the spring of at the latest that is the extreme of the to years since their last general review although i said in my reply earlier that we hope it will be in <e> <s> clearly after this lapse of time there are serious disparities i agree with my noble friend on that between constituencies and to have to await the reviews of the european constituencies could delay matters by many months more <e> <s> it is in this context that the government are considering the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords there is some inter-relation between the work of the local government and the parliamentary boundary commissions but i am not aware of any serious delay on this account in the reviews of parliamentary constituencies now in progress <e>", "<cs> my lords although i agree with the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede that with the wide range of speeches which have been made in your lordships house today which are the product of a very wide range of experience which has been brought to bear in this debate it is therefore not entirely easy for the government to respond with firm announcements of action because so many points interesting though they are go very wide none the less this has been a very valuable debate because first and foremost it has shown a wide measure of agreement about the general character of the fourth channel which this bill seeks to establish <e> <s> of course it was in this that the annan committee showed the way and it is fair to claim that clause together with the important provision for opportunities for independent producers in clause should translate the widely-held desire to have a distinctive and original programme service into legislation <e> <s> perhaps i may embark on the very first answer which i have to give in this reply <e> <s> my answer to my noble friend lord drum-albyn is that this is to be a national television service but of course it will be for those running it and for the iba to decide as the service develops what regional variations may become possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that i would not substantially say any more on this subject and i am not going to do so because i made quite a long passage on this in my speech in the beginning to which the noble lord and the noble lord lord hooson responded and this is a matter which all of us ought to look at again when we come to the committee stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl lord longford for giving us the opportunity this evening to debate parole because i take to heart the expression of opinion which has come from several noble lords that it is possible to fall into a belief that a system is right in every respect and it needs people such as the noble lord lord hunt who was the first chairman of the parole board and the noble lord lord donaldson who has just spoken and who has had a deep and long interest in these and other penal matters and lord hooson who is at the bar my noble friend lord milverton speaking from his own particular point of view as a member of the church and also we have with us the chairman of the <e>", "<cs> my lords there is an indication always if i may say so in what the noble earl says when he speaks on the subject of life sentence prisoners that in some way they are dealt with at official level only and ministers really have no idea what is going on at all <e> <s> i must just say before this debate ends that this simply is not so <e> <s> quite apart from instances in which particular cases are brought to their notice by members of this house or another place home office ministers are probably more closely involved with life sentence cases than with any other aspect of the work of the home office <e> <s> almost all proposals relating to the release or continued detention of such prisoners are submitted for approval either to my honourable friend the minister of state or under other administrations it may be the parliamentary under-secretary who currently is concerned with that field of work or to the home secretary personally <e>", "<cs> no let me finish this and then i will give way to the noble earl <e> <s> such a proposal is always submitted to a minister as also is any proposal that he or she should be released <e> <s> i hope therefore that the noble earl will accept from me that the suggestion that in some way it has been suggested by the noble earl again in the debate this evening ministers really have no idea what is going on in the life sentence field is quite unfounded <e>", "<cs> my lords anyone wanting to make a journey across the irish sea will of course have the weather forecasts for that shipping area which i think are important if one is planning a journey but i repeat that so far as the forecasts for the republic of ireland are concerned it is entirely a matter for the broadcasting authorities to decide what is included in their forecasts <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not make recommendations for the reasons which i gave in my original reply but i will certainly draw to the attention of the chairmen of the iba and the bbc the exchange which has taken place in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that but i am grateful to my noble friend for making me aware of it <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of whether consultation should take place and the desirability of what the noble lord is asking is really a matter for the broadcasting authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am finding it extremely difficult to follow the width of the questions <e> <s> i should like to reveal to your lordships that when my noble friend first tabled her question i was credibly informed in the department in which i work that it referred to france when i finally discovered that it referred to the republic of ireland i felt like the person who complained <e>", "<cs> my lords the trouble is that the noble baroness asks such very difficult questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for the replies they have given to the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords as i tried to make clear in my reply the government consider that the local authorities already have sufficient power and it is for the local authorities to enforce the law <e> <s> of course if the noble lord has any particular plans in mind which he wants to put into legislative form then as i think he knows we would always be very ready to discuss those with him and my right honourable friends department <e>", "<cs> i do not think i can add much more my lords except to <e>", "<cs> my lords the commission achieved considerable savings on the level of expenditure planned for last year and those savings went beyond those required as a result of last years cuts in public expenditure in other words the commission made extra savings over and above the cuts made in public expenditure <e> <s> all the savings made by the commission last year have been carried through into the budget set for this year which therefore represents a significant cut in real terms <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not agree with my noble friend but possibly the fault was mine in that i did not make myself entirely clear <e> <s> i do not think my noble friend is placing enough weight on the fact that the budget figure for the equal opportunities commission for the present year which is the same as the final revised estimated expenditure for last year was a figure which was reached including some substantial cuts which were made entirely voluntarily by the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot answer the second part of that supplementary because it falls outside the knowledge i have at the moment <e> <s> regarding the first part the level of funding for each organisation in receipt of grant from my right honourable friends department has been carefully considered on its merits in the light of its needs and government financial policy and i would guess that that is the policy <e>", "<cs>

commission for last year <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to say that that is entirely a matter for the commission my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that would be the view of all women and at any rate my right honourable friend sees a continuing need for this commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not had the pleasure of being able to view the activities of the equal opportunities commission from abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make it quite clear that the expenditure of the equal opportunities commission is subject to strict cash limits but within those limits it is a matter for the commission as to how they spend their money <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to have a question to which i can answer an unequivocal yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i gave what is in fact the reply to the second part of my noble friends supplementary question a little while ago the answer is give or take a bit about million <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for the reception they have given to my right honourable friends statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord boston asked me about the defence assumptions and mentioned certain words which were spoken in your lordships house by the noble and gallant lord lord carver <e> <s> military defence planning is of course already based on the assumptions set out in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like quickly to reply to the points which have been put to me by the noble lord lord chalfont <e> <s> again i am grateful to him for his recognition of the importance of this statement <e> <s> i should like to pick up one of the points which he made in the middle of his remarks <e> <s> the increase in expenditure which is now committed by the government by this statement is an increase of per cent <e> <s> by the financial year <e> <s> in the present economic climate that is a significant sum of money and i think it shows a significant commitment by the government and when i say the government i am of course speaking for all the government departments not least the ministry of defence <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady vickers has raised the very important subject of shelter design to which the statement does refer and your lordships may like to look at the relevant paragraphs <e> <s> however my answer to the specific point which my noble friend raised about deep shelters is that of course those should certainly form part of the discussions with the local authority associations which the government have proposed to carry forward in order to see whether existing structures suitable for communal shelter purposes can be repaired <e> <s> clearly the point which my noble friend makes should form part of that <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may reply to the noble lord lord brockway <e>", "<cs> my lords under the circumstances perhaps i could reply in only one sentence to the noble lord lord brockway i would draw the attention of the noble lord to a sentence which came quite early in the statement where my right honourable friend said <e>", "<cs> my lords this is precisely the sort of matter into which we can look into in more detail if we have a debate when we return after the recess <e> <s> the statement was at pains to point out that these matters cover almost all the government departments as many of your lordships know <e> <s> i think that the noble lord will find that we can look into this when we come back after the recess as indeed we can look into the first point which he put to me to which i think the increased spending by local authorities and voluntary organisations has some relevance <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is most important and i welcome the opportunity to say this in reply to the last question that the role of the coordinator whom my right honourable friend will be appointing which i think will be an extremely important post is to harness voluntary effort to best effect <e> <s> i think that that is how i can best answer <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend kindly showed me a copy of the <e>", "<cs> my lords the government agree entirely with the views of the noble baroness so far as the question of the use of the word church is concerned <e> <s> my right honourable friends statement on th july indicated that scientologists will not be allowed the special concessions for admission outside the work permit scheme for ministers of religion and missionaries <e> <s> on those grounds we certainly agree with the noble baroness <e> <s> where i must register disagreement with the noble baroness is that we do not believe at the moment that an inquiry would be appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords the government appreciate the concern which exists about the activities of sects such as the scientologists and continue to watch the position carefully <e> <s> my right honourable friend considered all the available evidence before taking his decision <e> <s> may i repeat that the decision was mainly based on the fact that there is no current <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can add any more to the information which i have given to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the opportunity to repeat what i have already said the government will continue to watch the position carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will not think me discourteous when i simply say that the expression of opinion which the noble lord has attributed to me is not what i said in the past few minutes <e> <s> if the noble lord cares to study the record he will see that what he has been suggesting i have been saying is not the case <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can say is that i cannot agree with what the noble lord is saying <e> <s> if the noble lord reads the <e>", "<cs> my lords the ban on entry extended in to people from overseas coming to work for or study scientology and to those who were engaged in promoting or extending the interests of and activities of scientology or otherwise engaging in its business <e> <s> for the third time i repeat that the main basis of my right honourable friends statement on th july in lifting the ban was because there is no sufficiently strong reason on current evidence to justify continuing the ban on medical grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter for your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i am not briefed to answer that particular question <e> <s> i will try and find out and let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords this would be entirely a matter for the police to follow up if there were any evidence to this effect <e>", "<cs> of course anything that my noble friend puts forward will be carefully considered by the government in their reply at the report stage but i cannot give him an undertaking that we would agree to an amendment on report about police buildings <e> <s> i say that for the reason that i gave in my speech namely that this matter has been the subject of discussions between the home office and the local authority associations in a working party and i feel that we ought to secure agreement from that working party before we insert a single amendment of that kind in a local government bill <e> <s> i trust that that is not too unhelpful a reply and with that i hope that my noble friend will now withdraw this particular first amendment <e>", "<cs> taken as a whole these two amendments to which my noble friend lord ridley has spoken propose a fundamental change to the fire services act which has been the basis of the organisation of fire brigades since the war <e> <s> if the changes proposed in the two amendments were made they would remove all the powers which the home secretary and the secretary of state for scotland have possessed in relation to the fire authorities since the days of the national fire service about which the noble lord lord underhill spoke <e>", "<cs> i am not going to criticise the wording of the amendment <e>", "<cs> it may be for the convenience of the committee if i repeat i am afraid i did not make myself clear that i am moving amendment no <e> <s> but i was speaking i think with the agreement of the committee to a list of amendments which i went through at the end of my speech <e> <s> then i added that as we came to each of those amendments i would if there were questions which were put at that moment do my best to answer them <e> <s> but first i am going to have to answer questions on this amendment <e>", "<cs> as i said when i first addressed your lordships on amendment no <e> <s> to which i repeat a whole <e>", "<cs> the hours of welsh language programming have been discussed in the exchanges which have taken place in the last few minutes <e> <s> i think that it is fairly clear from what has been said by the iba over the past months and also in another place what will be the totality of the hours of the new fourth channel <e> <s> that means that there will be both welsh language programming on the new fourth channel as well as english programming <e> <s> but i must repeat in response to the noble lord lord raglan because it is important that i should do so that it will be a matter of course for the new welsh fourth channel authority but if it sees fit to do so the bulk of the programming at peak times on the new fourth channel in wales will be in welsh <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord winstanley <e> <s> in reply to the noble lord lord donaldson i must say that the government would of course welcome the showing of programmes of international news and world current affairs on the new service to be established <e> <s> we welcome such programmes now but as the noble lord lord winstanley has said itn serves independent television very well indeed <e> <s> i think that for that reason alone there is a question mark if i may put it that way over the amendment <e>", "<cs> we have some pleasant surprises in your lordships house <e> <s> earlier the noble lord lord hill of luton referred to the day when he went to the post office <e> <s> if i were to say i am going to the post office one would assume i was going down the road to buy some stamps or post a letter <e> <s> of course the noble lord in a long and distinguished career was referring to the day when he became postmaster general and added that important office to the many others he has filled and the experience he therefore has of broadcasting matters generally <e> <s> therefore even though his name is down to the amendment i take seriously a short remark he made namely that it is possible that the amendment however much sympathy one may have with it is perhaps not directed to the right television channel a matter to which i shall return shortly <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend lord ferrier will allow me to say so if it is his intention to withdraw the amendment that would as the noble lord lord davies of leek has advised give a chance for those in broadcasting to look at such a proposal to see whether it would affect the financial viability of the fourth channel <e> <s> once again it would give broadcasters a chance because it would be for them to decide to consider whether for instance as the noble lord lord hill of luton suggested something such as breakfast time television if it comes to pass would be the medium by which the objective of my noble friend lord ferrier can best be achieved <e> <s> therefore i should not in any way wish to stand in the way of my noble friend withdrawing his amendment <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will allow me to intervene once again may i say that the noble lord invites me to arrange for this matter to be discussed on the floor of the house of commons <e>", "<cs> i do not think i can accept the amendment not because i do not agree with the noble lord lord ponsonby but because i genuinely believe it is not necessary <e> <s> the noble lord first asked me whether i could explain what is meant by the encouragement of innovation and experiment <e> <s> my answer to that is that one needs to look a couple of lines further down to see that there is the general responsibility placed upon the fourth channel to have a distinctive character of its own <e> <s> it is within that general responsibility that there are the specific responsibilities of encouraging innovation and experiment to have a special leaning towards education because clause <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may just give the view of the government at this stage of your lordships discussion and then noble lords whom we want to hear could perhaps tailor their remarks to what very briefly in only a minute or two i shall seek to put to the committee <e> <s> the noble lord lord hatch and the two noble lords who with him have put their names down to this amendment have made a very powerful case for the claims of world development international news and current affairs to be dealt with by the media <e> <s> but it is a separate matter to require the iba to ensure that such programmes are shown in substantial quantities and on a regular basis a matter to which the noble lord lord kilmarnock referred <e>", "<cs> i have answered that already in two ways <e> <s> one is that it is not unique in the sense that although as is clear from the speeches made this evening the claim is very strong there will be other extremely strong claims <e> <s> therefore one should be thrown back upon the accepted wisdom in broadcasting which is to set the guidelines <e> <s> here those guidelines are very strong <e> <s> there are three specific recommendations in clause <e>", "<cs> i should like to make a few comments in reply to the first point which the noble lord lord donaldson has made <e> <s> the noble lord contends that there is no monitoring of the way in which clause will work <e> <s> however if he will allow me to say so if we look ahead to clause we find specific legislative duties laid upon the independent broadcasting authority to include reports about the way in which the fourth channel is operating in its annual report <e> <s> if the noble lord were to say to me as he would have every right to do ah but this is a hit like being judge and jury in your own cause because it is the iba that is reporting on the working of the fourth channel there are two points that should be made <e> <s> first the subsidiary which also we have yet to come to is actually going to be the body which will gather the material together and make up the working of the channel and therefore it will be a report on how the subsidiary is operating <e> <s> secondly we must not forget that the iba report is laid before parliament <e> <s> as regards the matters raised about the open university i shall wait to see whether the noble lord wishes to put down any amendments at the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> the independent broadcasting authority is a regulating authority and in this bill we have sought to try to distance it from the obtaining and assembling of programme material by requiring the authority to set up a subsidiary for that purpose and to devolve on the subsidiary such other activities as seem appropriate to achieve this <e> <s> where i very much agree with the views which have just been expressed by the noble lord lord ponsonby and which prompt the amendment is in the fact that it is difficult to envisage how the subsidiary could operate within its terms of reference without the powers to enter into contracts with suppliers of programmes and such contracts will undoubtedly involve the acquisition of rights of one kind and another in a programme <e> <s> this is exactly what the subsidiary undoubtedly will do <e> <s> it will have a separate corporate identity and will be expected to conduct its affairs in a businesslike and commercial manner <e> <s> i think that this can be taken to include turning to account such rights and options in programmes as it may acquire <e>", "<cs> i think it is valuable that the noble lord lord donaldson has <e>", "<cs> he is normally an attender of the meetings on i gather a regular basis <e> <s> without advice i cannot tell the noble lord whether in fact he is a member of the board <e>", "<cs> i shall try to satisfy the noble lord on that particular point <e> <s> in addition to that the appointment of the editor of itn has to be approved by the iba so there is a little more to it if i may put it that way than perhaps appears at first sight <e> <s> i believe that the success of itn lies in its professionalism <e> <s> perhaps i may come to the members of its board because it may have seemed that i was sounding slighting towards them <e> <s> they are professional broadcasters with an interest in making the service as good as possible and it is open to argument whether the same motivation would necessarily exist in an expanded board the majority of whose members were not representatives of programme contractors <e> <s> however i realise that that is open to argument <e> <s> what is not i think open to <e>", "<cs> i have listened very closely to what my noble friend lord drumalbyn has said this evening indeed my noble friend has spoken to me and to the home office about this bill before it came into committee <e> <s> all i can really say first of all is that i remain unconvinced by the arguments <e> <s> i owe it to my noble friend lady macleod as well to explain why i remain unconvinced <e> <s> it is not that i am simply taking up a prepared position <e> <s> having listened to my noble friends speech i can say that the reason is that i did not hear anything my noble friend said which would make me believe that the competitive sale of advertising between two commercial channels <e>", "<cs> that may be so but if there were competition for the fourth channel it would not be possible for there not to be competition to see how to maximise the revenues from advertising between the two channels and inevitably one would have a ratings war <e> <s> the government think that this <e>", "<cs> let me just finish if i may <e> <s> for myself i do not think that we can go any further than this in broadcasting legislation <e> <s> my noble friend says what action <e> <s> i am sorry to be negative but i do not think we can create the sanctions which my noble friend wants in amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> those amendments talk about the competition act <e> <s> the provisions of the competition act referred to by my noble friend set out the criteria for establishing what is an anti-competitive practice <e> <s> a determination of whether a practice is anti-competitive remains within the competence of the director general <e>", "<cs> parliamentary scrutiny <e>", "<cs> i will add little to what has been said because those who have spoken have first hand knowledge of what they are talking about and it would be better if i maintained a modest brevity not total silence and say that i do not want not to be able to return a good turn <e> <s> the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge was good enough to support the case which the government have been making out consistently against competitive advertising and i find myself now unable to agree with his noble friend on this amendment <e> <s> it really will not do <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to appear unhelpful but there is a genuine difficulty here if we say that a report shall be detailed and details are then left out of the report <e> <s> it occurs to me perhaps <e>", "<cs> this is new clause h is it not <e>", "<cs> i cannot do it in two sentences i am afraid but this requires the iba to pay to the welsh authority for each financial year appropriate sums to enable that authority to meet their reasonable outgoings <e> <s> the sums are to be agreed between the two authorities but in the absence of agreement the committee will notice that there is provision in this new clause for the secretary of state in practice the home secretary to determine what sums are appropriate by a form of arbitration by the home secretary <e> <s> that is the essence of the new clause <e>", "<cs> perhaps for the record i should repeat words which i spoke earlier today when i said that my right honourable friend the home secretary after consultation with the chancellor of the exchequer will be discussing the details of the financing of the welsh fourth channel with the iba and that the provision in new clause would enable him to have regard to any increased costs when setting the rates of the levy <e> <s> beyond that i cannot go this evening <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i cannot for one moment understand what possessed the noble lord lord donaldson to speak in that way of the law <e> <s> the tones of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones are as crisp and sweet as the coxs orange pippins which he loves so well <e> <s> having said that i do not think that i agree with either the noble and learned lord or the noble lord lord donaldson <e>", "<cs> i quite understand the reason which has prompted this amendment and indeed the noble lord lord winstanley has made it crystal clear in what he has said <e> <s> the government have a good deal of sympathy with the amendment because as the commission is dealing with complaints about broadcast programmes it should include a member who has practical experience of programme production and who can bring his insight of the broadcasting world to the commissions deliberations <e> <s> however it may be difficult to tie in the way that the wording of the amendment would like to do the secretary of state to his choice of members as the amendment proposes <e> <s> i think that he could be left free to make his choice of members <e>", "<cs> i take very seriously what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> what i called the modified assurance which i gave was that the broadcasting scene may be expected to be among the matters taken into account when members are selected <e> <s> what i was trying to say which perhaps i did not put very clearly was that my understanding of radio and television is that there are many different skills represented in the media and when one then starts putting into legislative form who representing the media should be on the complaints commission i think that one starts running into difficulties <e> <s> therefore i repeat that i hope that my modified assurance may be acceptable to the noble lord who has moved the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not totally disagree with all that has been said on this amendment <e> <s> indeed the noble lord lord hooson made a very strong case for this <e> <s> i do not think that i need say to the committee that the obvious difficulty that was in the minds of those who were preparing the bill was the conflict of interest that there could be <e> <s> this is why the provision was put in <e> <s> it is a conflict of interest that to a member of the general public could show a member of the complaints commission who was actually working in the media as being a prejudiced party when hearing a complaint <e> <s> the noble lord said quite understandably that we could get round that by having some more people on the commission and seeing that the member of the commission who would be looked upon as being prejudiced simply did not sit that day <e> <s> of course that is a way out but i have been at pains to try to point out that the idea is to try to keep the commission small and informal <e>", "<cs> there is no problem if we accede to what the noble lord has said and make the size of the commission larger <e> <s> but there are reasons for not doing that as i have already explained <e>", "<cs> i do not think i would add anything on the merits of the amendment to what the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones has said <e> <s> what i would just add is that so far as the insertion of unwarranted in paragraph <e>", "<cs> there is a statutory duty on the iba and my noble friend lord nugent very fairly reminded us of it <e> <s> it is incorporated in section <e>", "<cs> i was not under the impression that in the speech i have just made i have confused taste with morals <e>", "<cs> the annan report dealt with the role of the consultative councils and registered in the report different points of view which other bodies had of the advisory councils <e> <s> i think that that bears re-reading <e> <s> but broadly speaking i would agree with what my noble friend has said that the advisory council have themselves got a valuable role to play in bringing to the attention of the broadcasting authorities what representatives of the general public on those broadcasting councils actually think <e>", "<cs> my lords the commission is considering the allegation that certain restrictions on prisoners correspondence violate the convention and will report its opinion to the committee of ministers <e> <s> we are considering changes in the regulations on prisoners correspondence as set out in the prison standing orders and this would affect all prisoners in england and wales <e> <s> to answer the last point raised by my noble friend as an experiment it was <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult for me to answer a question from the noble and learned lord when he refers to an earlier matter before the commission which referred to a different subject <e> <s> if he could be more specific i would do my best to answer him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for his clarification <e> <s> the case which he recalls resulted in an amendment to the prison rules by the addition of what is now rule <e>", "<cs> there is net chaos in the prisons my lords <e> <s> there is some industrial action but it does not result or arise from this question <e>", "<cs> i would need notice of that question my lords <e> <s> i will if i may write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that information is not readily available in the form requested <e> <s> however available records show that the numbers of men notified to prison department regional offices as being segregated under rule for the maintenance of good order and discipline at the end of each month totalled and <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked me about psychiatric advice <e> <s> if i may give a more general answer i should say that there is a vigilant regional oversight of the use of the power of rule and for the reasons that the noble lord has given in his supplementary questions this is of course necessary <e> <s> establishments are required to submit information to regional offices showing the relevant circumstances and authority for each individual decision to segregate and providing regulations for further action so as to enable regional offices to keep individual cases under review <e> <s> incidentally it is of course always open for a prisoner to present a petition to the governor or go further than that <e> <s> so far as the last remarks of the noble lord are concerned about the period of three months or more no the answer to that is that i cannot give the noble lord clarification on that for reasons that i think were implicit in the original answer that i gave <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right if i may say so <e> <s> the opening words of prison rule are where it appears desirable these are cases where it appears desirable and this is not something that is wished on prisoners by governors or staff <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i should like to look further into that <e> <s> however if the noble lord is suggesting that the prisoner has no idea at all why he has been segregated under prison rule all i would say is that the noble lord is making himself out as being more naive than in fact i think he is <e> <s> i do not think that question time is really the occasion to bandy semantics across the floor of the house but in regard to the case which the noble lord says was referred to in one of the letters that i have had the pleasure of writing to him recently all i can say is that seems to have been one of those cases in which it appeared desirable that the prisoner should be so segregated <e>", "<cs> my lords the only information that is readily available relates to the numbers of reports prepared on persons remanded in custody for psychiatric examination <e> <s> the figures for the years to inclusive are as follows males females and and and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little surprised that the noble lord refers to the assessment of the organisation mind that these figures are excessive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i really cannot help my noble friend on the specific point which he puts to me but there is one thing i think i ought to say and that is this <e> <s> i know that many people and not least the national association for the care and resettlement of offenders feel deeply that there should be court lists of doctors and psychiatrists more readily available so that the sort of cases which my noble friend lord renton is referring to need not occur <e> <s> action is in hand to see what progress has been made on this by the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall look carefully at what has been said from all parts of the house so far as statistics are concerned because different points have been made but i think that in fairness to the government i should end by making one point and that is this <e> <s> there is a difficulty in the question which the noble lord lord avebury has put down in the sense that he referred to the number of men and women respectively remanded in custody and as a matter of fact the statistics which we hold refer to the number of reports made on cases where a remand has been necessary <e> <s> that is the reason for the way in which my original answer had to be given and that is the reason why i cannot give the statistics for which the noble lord originally asked <e>", "<cs> my lords this will become clearer when the action which i referred to as being in hand to see what progress has been made by the courts so far as having available lists of doctors and psychiatrists has been completed <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can only repeat that this will become clear when the court returns are received <e> <s> there is one final thing which if i may i should like to say <e> <s> for convicted persons remanded on bail for sentence the courts within the catchment areas of four establishments holloway brixton durham and risley may remand prisoners on bail subject to their attending the establishments for medical examination but for some reason which we are not clear about very limited use is being made of these facilities <e> <s> for their part the government would welcome more use being made of these facilities and we i am sure will try to find out the reason for this <e>", "<cs> my lords i have nothing to add to what i have said on the general subject of this question today <e>", "<cs> there is no intention on the part of the government that the land authority should neglect the needs of business and industry and so as regards that matter i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> where i must confess that i have to disagree with my noble friend is in that we believe that subsection <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might intervene at this moment to give the view of the government <e> <s> i was a little disturbed when the noble lord lord goodman said that he felt that the whole of part iii because it was to the whole of part iii that the noble lord was directing his remarks was misconceived and he would seek to extract the whole of part iii when we came to the report stage of the bill <e> <s> the noble lord in his interesting remarks did not refer to the fact that to have a complaints commission of this kind was a recommendation from the annan committee and of course a recommendation from the previous government which would in certain respects have gone possibly a little further than part iii goes at the moment <e> <s> but without seeking unduly to widen the debate i was intrigued that the noble lord if he will allow me to say so in his absence was under the impression that in some way part iii would not allow witnesses to appear or evidence to be given <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones dealt very well with the question of the appearance of personages <e>", "<cs> i do not disagree with my noble friend in any way in what he says there but i think it is reasonable to say that in tandem with the press council we also have other bodies entrenched in statute <e> <s> i gave an example of the pca and i believe that works well also <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to see that the noble lord lord goodman has rejoined us <e> <s> i hope he will not think me discourteous if i delivered myself of a remark or two in general disagreement with the noble lord and it will be possible for us to return to the more general disagreement on the whole of part iii on the report stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> going to the first of the amendments of the noble lord lord hooson which refers to the removal of organisations from the complaints procedure i think i would simply reiterate what my noble friend lord drumalbyn said <e> <s> consider a mental hospital or a tourist agency a school or a football team <e> <s> why should they not be able to make a complaint if they felt that they came within the scope of this part of the bill <e> <s> the bill was purposely drawn to provide that a complaint should lie where a programme might be held to have treated an individual or an organisation unfairly <e>", "<cs> i think that the answer is quite easy <e> <s> we are of course talking if i may remind the committee and i almost forget myself so wide have we ranged about clause and therefore we have already passed clause <e> <s> thus it is not unreasonable for me to say to the committee that in clause to which the committee has already agreed there are the terms of reference which give the scope of the functions of the commission <e> <s> those are more or less exactly in line with the terms of reference of the scope of the function of the bbcs complaints commission <e> <s> we felt that it was right to make this statutory and that i believe is the right road to go down <e>", "<cs> for the reason which i have given <e> <s> i think that these rights are self-evident and if there are loopholes in other parts of the law i hope that they will be rectified as a result of this bill <e>", "<cs> that also even for me is quite an easy question to answer because the whole function of the commission was to do with what is broadcast <e> <s> if i may venture to look forward in the bill which i am not supposed to do but which in his absence i asked the noble lord lord goodman to do the noble lord lord strabolgi will find that there are ample powers for the commission to require that it can see what was actually broadcast <e> <s> as a result of that and as a result of evidence which will be given by people who come to the hearings of the commission it will finally make up its mind <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just make one remark <e> <s> obviously what has been said today will be looked at extremely carefully in the department of my right honourable friend because it is quite right that this committee should look very carefully at part iii of the bill <e> <s> as a non-lawyer i would not in any way want the impression to be gained that i have not tried to listen very carefully to what has been said <e> <s> but i would add that i find myself in a slightly difficult position <e>", "<cs> i apologise if i misheard i shall re-read what the noble lord said <e> <s> perhaps i can take it that i misdirected myself in that end therefore i must think only of the apprehensions of the noble lord lord hooson <e> <s> therefore in looking again to the noble lord lord hooson and without trying to call the noble lord lord goodman to my aid may i say that one must look at the text of the bill <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord is mistaken in his apprehensions because there is a provision firmly <e>", "<cs> i think that it would be very strange on the face of it if a body which had a function of the kind that the annan commission the previous government and the present government think in general terms is the right way to go turned away well-founded complaints simply on the grounds of nationality <e> <s> it is perfectly true that complaints could be made across national boundaries but there will still be the rules which are to be found in part iii to ensure that those complaints are not frivolous and that the people making the complaint fall within the scope to which i referred earlier which is to be found in clause <e>", "<cs> i would not like the committee to think that i had been cavalier in the way i had listened to the quite lengthy debate we have had so far <e> <s> indeed i was at pains a little earlier to say that if i was giving that impression that that was indeed not the case <e> <s> i think that the advice of the noble and learned lord lord gardiner to me is good and that the government should look very carefully at what has been said today without any commitment <e>", "<cs> i was interested in the intervention of the noble lord lord hill of luton <e> <s> my information is that the original constitution of the bbcs programmes complaints commission stipulated that complaints had first to be raised in writing with the broadcasting authority the bbc <e> <s> public comment at the time suggests that this provision was unduly restrictive and the report of the younger committee on privacy in proposed that the bbc should amend the procedure for the submission of complaints to the programmes commission by allowing the commission additionally to accept a complaint if it had been raised directly with the commission within days of the date of the programme or at the end of the series of programmes concerned <e>", "<cs> absolutely but i am about now to resist the amendment of the noble lord lord hooson on these brief grounds <e> <s> the first one is of degree only and that is this <e> <s> i think that the drafting of this part of the bill will achieve very much what the noble lord lord hooson wishes to achieve <e> <s> i think a person who considers that he has been treated unfairly in a programme will complain in the first instance to the broadcasting authority and will complain to the commission only if the authority either fails to respond in good time or responds in a way which the complainant thinks is unsatisfactory <e> <s> if your lordships care to glance at clause <e>", "<cs> the noble lord can make no such assumption with regard to the reactions of the home office to the younger committee on privacy <e> <s> indeed it was to the younger committee on privacy that i referred only in passing as it were <e> <s> what i was really referring to was the fact that the bbc had decided as a result of the younger committee it was for the bbc to decide it not for the home office that they would change their system <e> <s> the system they have now runs counter to the effect of this amendment and i was reporting to the committee that it is my understanding that the bbc finds that so far as the system is concerned it does not give the sort of problems which have been raised in the debate this evening <e>", "<cs> i ought to say in response that the noble lord lord hooson may say that days is like the twinkling of an eye to the law but the whole idea behind setting up the broadcasting complaints commission is to try to give the advantage of informal and speedy hearings to those who are making complaints <e> <s> as i understood it my noble friend lord drumalbyn favoured a procedure <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to say i can accept not only the amendment but also the advice of the noble lord lord hooson <e> <s> he has given me a good deal of advice on this bill and i am genuinely delighted to be able to take his advice <e> <s> ought to give our thinking behind this <e>", "<cs> i do not think the position of the government in this bill goes quite to the position which the noble lord lord hill has taken in his very interesting intervention and certainly the position is not that taken by the amendment <e> <s> i think the government position falls somewhere in between and in the time-honoured way that possibly means we have almost got it right <e> <s> the point i should like to stress is that it really would be a mistake to attempt to turn the commission into a court <e> <s> my noble friend lord morris almost made a slip of the tongue he almost called it a court and then remembered that it was not <e>", "<cs> with his great experience of broadcasting the noble lord lord hill of luton has answered for me the question of the noble lord lord strabolgi <e> <s> the noble lord lord hill made a most persuasive speech as to why he would hesitate about having hearings in public and in essence his <e>", "<cs> subject to correction by the noble lord lord hill may i say that you cannot distinguish between the initial complaint and the hearing <e>", "<cs> i shall be extremely interested to know how the noble lord lord strabolgi would distinguish between the initial complaint and the hearing <e> <s> perhaps we shall be favoured with an explanation of that <e> <s> but i am telling the committee that you cannot distinguish between the two and that you either decide to have both the making of the complaint and the hearing in private or you decide to have it in public <e>", "<cs> i was most interested to listen to the lord ponsonbys <e>", "<cs> consequent upon moving on the first day of committee amendment no <e> <s> which set up the welsh fourth channel authority clause is no longer necessary in the bill and therefore i beg to move that clause be omitted from the bill <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to appear unhelpful but i really do not think that i can add very much to what i said when moving the welsh amendments on the first day in committee and in answer to a question which was put to me by the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos and then i repeated the words to the noble friend of the noble lord lord donaldson lord taylor of gryfe <e> <s> i made the point that the financing of the fourth channel in wales is a matter which must be subject to discussion between my right honourable friend the home secretary together with my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e> <s> of course there will be discussions also with the independent broadcasting authority and i really cannot go further than what i said on that occasion <e>", "<cs> i think that it should be borne in mind when considering this amendment or rather the amendments to which the noble lord has spoken that the iba as a matter of practice has always maintained national advisory committees under the discretionary powers conferred on it by section of the act and that the new section a will do no more than put the arrangements on a formal footing <e>", "<cs> i welcome the fact that we have now moved on to discussing local radio because i think that this is a very important part of the bill <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for the speech which he has made in which i was very interested <e> <s> as regards his amendment if he will forgive me for saying so i differ from the amendment in the view that it takes of the need which the amendment by implication says has not yet been met for these local radio advisory committees to publicise themselves further <e> <s> indeed the noble lord in his speech said that the local radio advisory committees do not have very strong contracts with the local communities <e>", "<cs> may i intervene for a moment <e> <s> in moving the amendment i said that the need for the amendment arose from an undertaking which was given in another place that the bill should place an obligation on the iba to re-advertise contracts when they come to an end <e> <s> i think i perhaps misled the committee in a way in that although that statement is true of course the substance of the amendments i am moving of which amendment no <e> <s> is the really substantial one refers to the consequences of that which is that in amendment no <e> <s> we are providing as the noble lord lord ponsonby i think will approve that first contracts in new independent local radio areas and only new contracts shall be given a -year period to run and it is for contracts which start operating after st january <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ponsonby asked me a direct question whether there was anything in amendment no <e> <s> which would prevent the independent broadcasting authority from having new stations within the area of existing stations <e> <s> although i am not going to say that i necessarily think that that would be desirable there is nothing in amendment no <e> <s> which would prevent that procedure from coming about <e> <s> as the noble lord is i am sure aware recommendations for new local radio stations are in the first instance always put up by the home office local radio working party which consists of representatives of the bbc the iba and the home office with the final decision as to their licensing resting with the home secretary <e>", "<cs> it was really for this reason that i said i would not make any comment on the merits of such a move but i added that the recommendations for all establishment of local radio stations have to come from a working party on which the iba the bbc and the home office are represented <e> <s> therefore it is <e>", "<cs> i suggest with respect that the noble lord is trying to tie up the iba in cotton wool rather too much with these amendments <e> <s> surely what matters is that people should have the chance when they feel deeply about a public matter either to object or have their say <e> <s> i worked some years ago in a <e>", "<cs> i should like to reply to both my noble friends lord buxton of alsa and lord crathorne by saying that the bill simply puts into effect what as we know the iba does at present <e> <s> it looks very carefully at who will be the contenders <e> <s> we believe that it should be put in statutory form <e> <s> with regard to what my noble friend lord buxton said there is not the slightest reason why the iba having complied with the conditions of the amendment if your lordships agree to it will not find itself letting the contracts to the same contractor again after a seven- or eight-year period <e>", "<cs> i was under the impression that what i had said when i was replying to my noble friend lord buxton of alsa and to the first point of my noble friend lord crathorne covered to a considerable extent the apprehensions that the noble lord voiced <e> <s> may i reiterate this is a practice in which the iba has quite rightly been indulging over the years <e> <s> we thought it right that it should be put in statutory form <e> <s> we thought it quite wrong and incidentally if i may say so i think unfair to the iba to make it appear that there was no question that contracts were not open to tender <e> <s> they are open to tender <e> <s> that is what the iba in fact does and we believe that it is only fair both to the iba and to competitors in the broadcasting field that this should now be put in statute <e>", "<cs> it is of course no secret that the previous government had in mind some changes in the division of functions between county and district councils <e> <s> however i think your lordships would agree that it would be wrong to consider piecemeal adjustments that could create new anomalies <e> <s> at any rate that is the case really being made by my noble friend lord digby <e> <s> it is a case which has a considerable amount to be said for it <e>", "<cs> i shall come to that in a moment <e> <s> or are we to adopt another yardstick <e> <s> if we are i have not heard that so far this evening <e> <s> i think that this is an amendment which does not have enough regard for the wider implications <e> <s> so far as i can find out there seems to have been little proper consultation about the proposal <e> <s> none so far as i know with the existing magistrates courts committees at any rate so far as the plymouth proposal is concerned <e> <s> that is the committee which of course the amendment is proposing to dismember <e> <s> or with the existing paying authorities <e> <s> that is to say the county councils which might have been expected to have some relevant comments to make about the alleged benefits and savings <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord davies of leek is making a substantial point <e> <s> if there has not been discussion at local level with the paying authority and with the magistrates courts committee both of which bodies it is proposed should be replaced then it is extremely difficult for this committee to get an idea of both sides of the case in particular about the alleged benefits so far as money is concerned <e> <s> i feel that for that reason alone despite the felicity with which the noble lord lord mishcon moved the amendment at very short notice this is no way to write an amendment into a bill <e>", "<cs> if there are discussions with both the local authority and the magistrates courts committee i think it will be found there is probably not agreement and if there is not agreement at local level i suspect that the department of the environment would not wish to carry the matter any further <e>", "<cs> with regard to amendment no <e> <s> a as the noble lady suggested we have objection to the list of bodies mentioned in that particular amendment because in some cases the bodies referred to in the new clause have only limited powers to control pleasure boats and these powers may not extend to safety matters but may be directed to other purposes for instance the control of pollution <e> <s> in other cases while the bodies in question may have responsibility for the waters themselves there may be no power to attach conditions to the boats operating on them <e> <s> in short the position is confused and it is a matter which the department of my right honourable friend the home secretary is looking into <e>", "<cs> is it possible that we could debate the amendment by the noble baroness lady seear at the same time or would that not be for the convenience of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> if this is the case possibly the noble lord lord aylestone who was about to speak might like to listen first as i would to the noble baroness if she felt that she would like to speak now <e> <s> then perhaps we could take into account what the noble baroness says before others of us speak if that suited the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> having listened to this short debate i find myself in a great deal of agreement with what was said by the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede concerning the desirability of improving training arrangements <e> <s> however i part company with the noble lord and his noble friend lord donaldson and the noble baroness <e> <s> lady seear in their view that clause will not achieve the result that is desired <e>", "<cs> the drafting of the amendment is defective but i do not think that need detain us <e> <s> the noble lord lord donaldson said his primary purpose was to probe and perhaps the best contribution i can make to the discussion is to say that the home secretary under section of the act has power to make regulations to prevent the making of exclusive arrangements for the broad <e>", "<cs> in considering the amendment of the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge i think that it is right to bear in mind that in carrying out its functions the independent broadcasting authority is advised by a statutory advertising advisory committee on which medical experts and consumers are strongly represented <e>", "<cs> indeed speaking on behalf of the government i am grateful to the noble lord for the information he has given to the committee and i welcome the words of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend that owing to discrepancies in the sizes of the electorates in constituencies the reviews of the boundary commissions are of the very greatest importance <e> <s> perhaps i may remind my noble friend that the commissions are statutorily required to report by the spring of at the latest <e>", "<cs> that my lords is so <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have been considering the matter which my noble friend has just raised and the result of our deliberations will be announced in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords no we take our cue on this from the party opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has raised this matter before and i have checked on it again <e> <s> i understand that the interrelation between the work of the local government and the parliamentary boundary commissions is not causing any delay in the present review of parliamentary constituencies <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the parliamentary boundary commissions for england scotland and <e>", "<cs> my lords that is quite another question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that information <e>", "<cs> my lords practically all the questions which the noble lord is asking me in supplementaries are premature <e> <s> it is for the commission to determine the scope of any investigation pursuant upon the court judgment on th october and we shall then have to see where we go <e> <s> meanwhile the home office and the commission are having informal discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords i have previously in your lordships house expressed the support of the government for the work of the commission <e> <s> so far as any possible investigation pursuant to this court judgment is concerned i think there is nothing that i can add to what i have already said to the noble lord lord avebury <e>", "<cs> my lords the recent judgment has of course been helpful in clarifying the scope of the commissions powers <e> <s> but although the court found in favour of the commission in regard to the proposed investigation the judgment as the noble lord i am sure knows also made it clear that the grounds on which the commission could conduct an investigation are limited <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to reveal to your lordships that recently the thinking and indeed the action of the home office has been running very much in the same direction as obviously the thinking of all your lordships <e> <s> i say that after the speeches which i have just heard made on this amendment <e> <s> for that reason i do not think that these amendments would remove tedious administration <e> <s> may i explain exactly why i say that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that the noble lord wished this film to be shown and i am also aware that the bbc have not shown it <e> <s> i have not seen copies of correspondence between the corporation and the noble lord <e> <s> there are other ways than seeing this particular film that the people of this country can become acquainted with the possible effects of nuclear war <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that to be seen to be as much prepared at home as possible as well as capable of military deterrence and defence will make war less likely and that is the policy the government intend to pursue <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware whether officials of my right honourable friends department have either seen or vetted this film <e> <s> i have myself not seen it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks me whether i am aware of a variety of things <e> <s> i am aware that since the peace of this country has been kept by the contribution which we have made to the north atlantic treaty organisation <e> <s> part of that contribution means being prepared so far as we can be both at home and abroad <e> <s> in answer to the second part of the noble lords supplementary question of course i reply yes i shall indeed draw the attention of the bbc to the exchanges in your lordships house on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole basis of all the answers i have given in the last few minutes is that the government do not interfere with what is actually broadcast <e>", "<cs> i think that is going very wide of the original question my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement which is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may just reply to the two front bench spokesmen <e> <s> the noble lord lord boston asked me if i would draw to the attention of my right honourable friend the desirability of thanking the police for the work that they are doing <e> <s> my right honourable friend did indeed see the association of chief police officers in this regard last week and the superintendents association and the federation representatives this morning <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord though for what he said in that regard <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with a great deal of what the noble lord has said about prison conditions which have built up over the years <e> <s> it is for this reason that we now have a realistic prison building programme and this is another reason why it is most regrettable <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord has said that the proposals for powers to be taken in emergency legislation would be unprecedented <e> <s> i do not differ from the noble and learned lords use of wording <e> <s> but the proposal is that those powers shall be <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend with his experience of these matters at the home office in previous years has referred to a narrow dispute with wide implications <e> <s> i have to say with regret that i regard the action which has been taken by the prison officers as going indeed far beyond the limits of what is permissible in the cause of an industrial dispute let alone an industrial dispute on this particular subject and wholly disproportionate to what is in issue <e> <s> my noble friend asks when the government would hope to get these proposals if parliament agrees on to the statute book <e> <s> i think this is the moment when my noble friend the leader of the house would like to make a business statement <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can say off the cuff is that prison rule as the noble earl will know allows for the release of prisoners i have the rule with me and in a moment or two i will look up the exact wording but it was really to put the matter beyond any doubt at all that for the consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the amendment could have the presumably unintended effect of obliging the youngest prisoners whom i hope very much are going to be few in number to remain in police cells and thus endure conditions worse than those in temporary accommodation <e> <s> normally prisoners of and under would be detained in a borstal or a detention centre <e> <s> i think the committee may like to know that at the present time the industrial action is not affecting unduly the reception of prisoners at both those types of accommodation <e> <s> the whole problem of the situation stems from prisons not receiving those who are due to come to them <e> <s> this at the moment i am relieved to say is not the situation so my information is with regard to the accommodation in detention <e>", "<cs> there are two points that i should like to make here <e> <s> the first is to reiterate the point that i made to the noble lord lord donaldson that clearly the action that has been taken has not as far as receptions are concerned affected in the same way the establishments which are responsible for young offenders in other words detention centres and borstals <e> <s> i cannot honestly say to the noble baroness because i do not have the information whether in all those particular establishments the education services are running normally <e> <s> perhaps i should reveal to the noble baroness that obviously my right honourable friend is made aware from time to time of what the situation is in different establishments <e> <s> essentially the pattern is different in different parts of the country and in different establishments <e> <s> for that reason i cannot give the noble baroness the assurance that i know she wants <e> <s> all that i can say is that we are watching the situation carefully and that this is the sort of matter which undoubtedly would be discussed when the prison officers association and <e>", "<cs> i do not think i can add very much to what i have said <e> <s> i hope that we can meet absolutely what the noble lord is saying <e> <s> we shall certainly endeavour to do our best to do so <e>", "<cs> it is a wholly reasonable request <e> <s> i hope however that the noble lord will not ask for it to be written into the bill <e> <s> i should like to give him an absolute assurance that our minds are working on the same lines <e> <s> i am grateful for the prodding which this amendment gives to us <e> <s> the whole committee will understand that while it is our intention that persons detained in places which are to be approved under clause should be treated as far as possible in the same way as those detained in existing prisons it may not be practicable to achieve that object fully <e>", "<cs> the government are determined to ensure that so fas as is humanly possible conditions in approved places under clause shall meet all the objectives of the prison system proper including the requirements of the prison rules not only those listed in the noble and learned lords amendment but in the prison rules at large <e> <s> however the house will recognise that there are limitations which the situation we are now in is bound to impose and to require absolute compliance with some rules could be detrimental to the broad interests of security staff safety and inmate welfare <e> <s> such a provision moreover could imply that less importance should be attached to other important rules <e>", "<cs> i fully understand the reason the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones has moved this amendment <e> <s> it is true that since the amendment was put down before the house met this afternoon i have sought to follow my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor and i repeated the assurance which my honourable friend the minister of state gave in another place that a circular would be sent out about this matter <e> <s> but this does not change the fact that this is an important amendment <e> <s> may i try to do two things <e> <s> first of all may i briefly repeat the effect of what my honourable friend mr brittan said in <e>", "<cs> i am sure we will certainly endeavour to send them copies <e> <s> in the time-honoured words i will pass this on to my right honourable friend with some alacrity because as the noble lord can guess we intend to try to send out very shortly a circular about this matter <e>", "<cs> the aim behind this amendment is of course very clear and the noble and learned lord has explained it <e> <s> since the objective of the amendment appeals very much to the hearts of those who listened to the noble and learned lord i mean that quite genuinely i deploy with a little trepidation any arguments that i have against it <e> <s> but i would ask the committee in looking at this amendment to bear in mind that the powers in part i of this bill are temporary they last for only one month at a time <e>", "<cs> as with practically all the proposals which the noble and learned lord puts forward this is helpful <e> <s> but i wonder and i hesitate to cross swords with the noble and learned lord on my interpretation whether it would help other people who are caused to be brought before a court bearing in mind that the courts are very full of business at the present time <e> <s> it occurs to me that acceptance of this amendment would mean that there would be to put it in old-fashioned terms a certain amount of immediate queue-jumping by those who had availed themselves of remaining in freedom having been given executive bail under clause and who then had to be arrested by a constable under subsection <e> <s> it is simply for that reason that i wonder whether it really would be very helpful to accept the present amendment and whether there really is justification for interfering with the normal processes as proposed in the amendment <e>", "<cs> the purpose of clause is to place beyond any legal doubt the power of the police to detain in their custody a person who has been committed to prison by a court but whom the police cannot deliver into prison custody <e> <s> i think it is important for me to remind the committee that this is an attempt to put beyond legal doubt this power but it is attached very much to the <e>", "<cs> this is a hypothetical question because we have not got so far as designating what is an approved place <e> <s> so i cannot go further than to say that we take very firmly on <e>", "<cs> the operational responsibility for the way in which a force discharges its policing responsibilities is of course for the chief constable <e> <s> this means that when a force is particularly stretched on let us say a very busy saturday night maybe it would not be as welcome as it might be at another time if somebody said they would like to look round the police station <e> <s> but i can give my noble friend an assurance that facilities would as a matter of course and of right be provided for members of police authorities to visit police accommodation <e> <s> so far as the metropolitan police is con <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept the first supplementary question of the noble lord indeed i do not accept <e>", "<cs> my lords in parenthesis my answer is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords immigration as covered by the immigration rules <e>", "<cs> my lords it is assisting race relations due to the fact that we are a very small island with only a limited amount of capacity <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that on two separate occasions on the afternoon of th october the proceedings at the conservative party conference in brighton were interrupted by a protester <e> <s> in each case the man concerned was first approached by the conference stewards and was then escorted from the hall by plain clothes police <e> <s> both men were released later that day and no complaint of assault has been made by either of them <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can say is that the information which the noble lord has is not the same information as i have <e> <s> i understand that neither of the protesters was unconscious when escorted from the hall and neither has complained of an assault <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may reply to the question asked by the noble lord lord hale the answer is that we have been in contact with the sussex police about these incidents and it was on the results of that contact that my replies to the noble lord lord bruce of donington were based <e>", "<cs> my lords the obvious thing to do on being asked a question of this kind was to get in touch with the people who escorted the two young men from the hall <e> <s> they were the sussex police and it is upon that contact that my replies this afternoon have been based <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that i understand the reason why the noble lord lord jacques and his fellow peers have moved this amendment both at committee stage and this evening <e> <s> my home has always been near a county borough and i genuinely understand the reaction of civic pride to some of the alterations that were made in the powers under the local government act <e> <s> but there was a logical thought which ran through the arrangements for the magistrates courts committee under the act <e> <s> that was that the boundaries of the magistrates courts committee should be related to the boundaries of the local authorities which financed them <e> <s> so it was that the act provided that there should be a separate magistrates courts committee for the whole of each non-metropolitan county <e>", "<cs> my lords if the house will allow me of course i am always ready to look at any matter which the noble lord puts to me but in what i said <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with interest to the comments of the noble viscount lord hanworth because we had these amendments down in committee and i think they were taken very late at night <e> <s> certainly i think this particular amendment or something not unlike it received rather scant debate <e> <s> i certainly accept that circumstances can arise in which there is duplication of licensing controls and that this can be confusing and inconvenient to pleasure boat operators <e> <s> i agree that it is unsatisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i should remind your lordships that the right of private prosecution and the exercise of police discretion in bringing prosecutions fall within the terms of <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter for the court concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord puts the problem very accurately <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the suggestion that the noble lord is specifically making is as easy practically as would sound from the felicitous way in which the noble lord puts it <e> <s> having said that i would not want the noble lord to think that my right honourable friends department were being wholly inactive in this matter <e> <s> the home office standing committee on crime prevention in published a report which was called <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the statistics i quoted included juveniles <e> <s> if i am wrong i will write to the noble baroness <e> <s> what i know for a fact is that as for other types of offence the proportion cautioned is higher for juveniles <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lords first question is yes <e> <s> the answer to his second question must be that surely we ought to wait and i hope now it will not be very long <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of the specific statistics to which the noble earl has referred <e> <s> i am grateful to him for telling us about it and i think there is a lot in what the noble earl has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the eagerness with which the legal profession and indeed others concerned are awaiting the report is rivalled only by the eagerness of the chairman and members of the commission to get the report out <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor says it is not him <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that it is in fact the department where i work <e>", "<cs> absolutely my lords and of course the level of the fines imposed is a matter for the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise from the speech which my noble friend lord drumalbyn has made on this amendment that this is an area of genuine concern on the part of advertisers and advertising agencies and their two organisations the incorporated society of british advertisers and the institute of practitioners in advertising in past months have clearly and forcefully been making their case <e> <s> my noble friend has very clearly and thoroughly made the case again on these amendments today <e> <s> without saying that i accept the truth of the allegations that have been made i should like to assure my noble friend that it is the governments view that if bad practices of the kind to which my noble friend referred exist they should be dealt with <e> <s> where we differ however is in our view of the means which should be used to tackle them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make it clear that the government would be very happy indeed to see programmes which include education with an international content on the fourth channel and i think it could be wholly in keeping with the general character of the channel <e> <s> i would add that no one who has listened to this debate and indeed to the opening speech by the noble lord lord hatch and the final speech by the noble lord lord donaldson will fail to realise the importance which is attached in many quarters to the widening of understanding in this and other countries of the developed world of the problems of the developing world <e> <s> now among those who will have read in the debate on the last occasion if they had not heard the discussion today the very cogent pleas which have come from many noble lords are of course the independent broadcasting authority and the chairman and members designate of the board of the fourth channel subsidiary which is actually going to run the channel and i do not think that the pleas which have been made are going to fall upon deaf ears <e> <s> indeed i know that the iba and the prospective chairman of the fourth channel board have already reacted favourably to approaches which they have had on this question <e>", "<cs> my lords that again is an assertion which we could debate for a very long time <e> <s> i would claim and many other noble lords in this house this afternoon would claim that in fact it is <e> <s> my noble friend lord home asserted in his speech that really you should not detach the educational content from the rest of the content of the new fourth channel and despite the fact that some of your lordships have parted company with the views of my noble friend i was interested that the speech which supported my noble friend lord home came from one of the most distinguished educationists this country has had in recent years lord alexander of potterhill <e> <s> as lord alexander was speaking i remembered an old saying that i seem to have in the back of my mind that educationists refer sometimes to education as being a seamless robe something which has got different sorts of education running imperceptibly one into another through it just as at best education should imperceptibly form part of all our lives <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the third time in the course of the debates on the bill that the proposition of my noble friend lord ferrier that there ought to be a regular television report of the proceedings both in this house and in another place has been debated <e> <s> i am most grateful to my noble friend and to the two noble lords out of the total of three who also put down their name to my noble friends amendment for having made it clear in their speeches that they appreciate that there are doubts which i hold on behalf of the government as to whether such a programme would be a suitable addition to the daily radio reports which the bbc provides given that our proceedings and the proceedings of another place are not actually televised at present <e> <s> that is of course a different issue <e> <s> the issue to which my noble friend lord hill of luton attached the most importance in putting down his name to the amendment is one upon which members of another place and maybe your lordships have strong and possibly conflicting views <e> <s> none the less it has been enormously valuable that we have had this continuing debate for it has enabled many who are concerned in one way or another with broadcasting to focus upon this issue <e> <s> however i regret to say that i cannot recommend to the house that the amendment should be accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all your lordships who have made speeches but i am afraid that i do not agree with a single one <e> <s> if i may be forgiven for saying so i find this a very strange amendment <e> <s> first there is no such thing as the educational advisory committee which appears in the amendment <e> <s> the iba appointed an educational advisory council so the first item on the agenda is that the amendment is defective let us be quite clear about that <e> <s> secondly there are more educational advisory bodies than one for the iba <e> <s> there is the appointment by the iba of what is called the schools committee and the iba also take the trouble to have an adult <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that that is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords the functions to which this amendment refers as the noble lord quite rightly said at the end of his remarks are laid down in the bill as a matter of fact in clause <e> <s> but i would like to put this point to the noble lord <e> <s> i wonder whether he would agree that it is more important when one is talking about the annual report that the authoritys arrangements for consulting the public should be made known before and during the period of consultation which forms part of the process leading up to the award of contracts rather than putting a statutory duty on the authority to report on how this is done later on <e> <s> in this regard the iba cannot really be faulted <e>", "<cs> my lords i have sympathy with the noble lord lord hooson and other noble lords who have put their names to this amendment in regard to the intention which the amendment has <e> <s> indeed i endeavoured on the previous stage of the bill to give an assurance on this matter <e> <s> i also take to heart what the noble lord lord annan has said so far as his support for the amendment is concerned <e> <s> i have also taken on board what the noble lord said about the somewhat wider remit which the complaints commission under part iv will have compared with the complaints commission which was envisaged by the noble lord lord annan although the two are similar creatures none the less there are differences and i have taken that on board <e>", "<cs> my lords the arguments about extending the terms of reference to the broadcasting complaints commission were of course explored in some detail in committee but bearing in mind the adjurations of the noble lord on the front bench opposite none the less i must say that following the committee debate and the speeches which have been made in your lordships house this evening i certainly regard this issue and i am speaking on behalf of my right honourable friend the home secretary in this as being of such importance that i hope your lordships will bear with me for just a few moments if i try to answer the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that is because the annan committee took the view which the previous government agreed with and so do the present government that the desirable objective was to have a complaints commission which should be seen to be independent of the two broadcasting authorities in certain selected areas which did not include programme content and it is that path which the bill is following <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter which i very much hope will also be included in the annual reports which of course are pretty comprehensive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little concerned about my noble friends amendment because although my noble friend referred to it as a drafting amendment a drafting amendment of substance none the less there is a difference of substance which the amendment introduces in relation to complaints made in cases where an individual affected by alleged unfair treatment is unable to complain himself or to authorise another person to do so for him <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord donaldson of kings-bridge has just explained very clearly and very persuasively as part of his argument on this amendment that it is vitally necessary if we are to expect the best as we do from our creative artists in radio and broadcasting in this country that they have reasonable freedom in which to work <e> <s> but of course broadcasters are not the only section of the community who deserve consideration although i go along with the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge who has much greater experience of this subject than i have and it is vital that we should pay heed to what he said <e>", "<cs> just one moment my lords <e> <s> let us first clear the point made by the noble lord <e> <s> we are certainly <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether it would be helpful to your lordships if i reminded the house of the procedure under part iv when a complaint is made to the commission <e> <s> the first thing that the commission will do is to decide whether the complaint is one which it can entertain and which it is prepared in principle to consider <e> <s> next and before the commission can proceed to consider the complaint it must under clause send a copy to the appropriate broadcasting authority <e> <s> in doing so the commission can ask the authority to do a number of things including providing the commission and the complainant with a written response to the complaint <e>", "<cs> that intervention is not quite on my lords <e> <s> i was at great pains when introducing my remarks in reply to the noble lord lord hooson to explain that what will happen as the bill is drafted is that very often because of the interaction which is written into the clause between the complaints commission and the broadcasting authority when the complaint is first made to the commission there will be satisfaction from the broadcasting authority <e> <s> having said that i believe for the reasons i have given that the actual direct line of approach should be from the ordinary member of the public to the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to my noble friend lord morris i do not think it is quite as clear cut as that <e> <s> under the amendment of the noble lord lord hooson if the commission were to think it best to hold a hearing on a complaint of unjustified infringement of privacy but the complaintant perhaps for understandable reasons of the sort mentioned by lord goodman wishes the hearing to be in private and the broadcasting body does not agree that is too bad for the complainant <e> <s> he perhaps will withdraw his complaint <e> <s> i am sure that is not what the noble lord intends but that could be one effect of the amendment <e> <s> possibly the commission in some cases may decide under the bill as they can not to hold a hearing at all but to consider the complaint by interviewing the parties separately <e> <s> i am surprised that lord hooson has not put down an amendment to that <e> <s> i should have expected him not entirely to approve of that particular procedure although i am not inviting the noble lord to put down such an amendment <e> <s> i am saying to my noble friend lord morris that i do not think these issues are as clear-cut and easy under the amendment <e> <s> another thing that is not clear cut and i am not deliberately nit-picking is <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i was able to convince noble lords at committee stage that the home secretary has adequate powers under section <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a genuine problem about the amendment <e> <s> advice from local advisory committees as a matter of practice is generally on two levels <e> <s> there is the on-going day-to-day advice praise or criticism about the output of local radio stations <e> <s> in addition the noble lord mentioned this himself in his speech the authority may seek a comprehensive assessment of a contractors performance before considering whether to extend a contract <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ponsonby who is always very fair in the way he presents the case for his amendment none the less had made it sound not only as though the iba do not conduct their public meetings very well but as though the system for taking public opinion when contracts come to be re-negotiated is deficient in some way <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord would like to consider with me for a moment the way in which schemes for secondary reorganisation of schools in this country are arranged statutorily at least they have <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i am a little perplexed by the first of the amendments in the name of the noble baroness lady seear amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> as the noble baroness herself pointed out in her speech and as both my noble friends lady trumpington and lord de la warr have also said there is the effect of the race relations act and the sex discrimination act firmly embedded in the law of the land and i really would not have thought it was necessary to write the provisions of these acts yet again into this bill <e> <s> indeed i am not quite sure what my noble friend lord renton would say and he is by way of being a considerable expert on legislation but i think he might have some well-chosen words to say about putting unnecessary provisions into legislation unnecessary because they are already firmly embedded in the law of the land <e>", "<cs> my lords of course it is for the house to decide as to whether the annual report of the iba and indeed the annual report of the bbc are debated in your lordships house similarly for members in another place <e> <s> there is nothing to stop the members of your lordships house doing their best to dissect the annual report and to find out exactly what lies not only in its words but behind its words <e> <s> for some reason which is totally unexplained in this amendment a duty would be placed upon this particular advisory committee to write part of the annual report but apparently none of the other advisory committees has got a similar duty <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord lord ponsonby moved this amendment at the report stage of the bill in the reply i gave i sought to indicate how much information the independent broadcasting authority already gives about this aspect of its activities <e> <s> it is true that in my reply i referred particularly to what the authority had said it was going to do in order to consult public opinion in the present round of itv contract applications rather than to any description of what it had done <e> <s> my intention was simply to indicate that this area of its activities was one which the independent broadcasting authority regarded as proper and necessary for it to comment on in its annual report <e>", "<cs> my lords off the cuff i am not entirely certain whether transposing the words which amendment no <e> <s> seeks to insert into the position where they would fall immediately after the word occasion in line would not alter the sense <e> <s> i am not confident on my feet to say whether or not that is so but i have a feeling that they could alter the sense <e> <s> on the other hand the noble lord lord mishcon who is a distinguished lawyer and takes great trouble about the way we try to word our legislation may be right <e> <s> i do not think it is possible to change the position in which these words would be injected into the bill <e> <s> if when we come to that amendment which of course will not be put until amendment no <e> <s> has been put your lordships would not object i hope it will be agreed that none the less the sense will be secured consequentially on amendment no <e> <s> by inserting those words in the place at present intended <e> <s> i thank noble lords who have spoken on the amendment <e> <s> it is a compromise amendment no <e> <s> taken with amendment no <e> <s> but it is i believe a solution to a difficult problem and i am most grateful to noble lords for recognising that <e>", "<cs> in that case my lords i of course give an assurance to the noble lord lord mishcon that we shall look at this point very carefully indeed <e> <s> if we are persuaded by his argument that the amendment should be altered in the way that he suggested we shall of course do our best to meet his point <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my gratitude to your lordships for the work that has been done on this bill which has made it a more generally acceptable measure on leaving this house than i think it was when <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord but it resulted originally from a deputation which came to my right honourable friend the home secretary and the secretary of state for wales which was led by a member of your lordships house lord cledwyn <e> <s> secondly by refining the provisions dealing with the award of programme contracts in clause i think we balanced the need for regular public scrutiny of performance against that of the contractor to enjoy a reasonable period of operation <e> <s> the third change that has been made followed some discussion and i am grateful for advice from the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge and from other noble lords in the area of the complaints commission <e> <s> we have just agreed to limit complaints about the treatment of a person who has died to cases where the relevant programme was broadcast within five years of the persons death <e> <s> one other amendment was made to the bill when earlier we removed the exclusion of complaints made on behalf of persons who had but no longer have a remedy through the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords the access to the european court is of course through the commission and subject to the findings of the commission <e> <s> that is the effect of the continued acceptance by her majestys government of articles and <e> <s> so far as matters to do with domestic courts in this country are concerned that is a matter for the courts of this country <e> <s> the noble lord asked finally whether the governments acceptance of these two articles should be on a permanent footing <e> <s> i should like to point out to the noble lord that we believe that the acceptance that we have given is in the best interests of this country and that we have renewed for as long a period as any of the countries which have renewed for specified periods <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for the support that he has given for the machinery by which we have accepted these articles <e> <s> so far as the last remarks of the noble and learned lord are concerned the government attach importance to support of human rights in europe and it is for that reason that we have given this acceptance that i have announced today <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagine that this is a matter for the court but certainly we will look at what the noble lord is asking <e>", "<cs> my lords this may be so but i do not think it alters the terms of the original answer which i gave to the noble lords first supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the governments responsibility is concerned we certainly take note of the support that the noble lord has given to the noble lord opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord wells-pestell has been in hospital recently it is more than a mere politeness to say that it gives me great pleasure to be following the noble lord and to recognise that no one is better qualified than he is to speak of care for those who are in need <e> <s> but i must follow the noble lords speech by making the point that i think it is fair to say that almost every one of the problems that your lordships have spoken about today depends essentially upon the health of the economy of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i take on board what the noble baroness is saying <e> <s> i was trying to point out that very often without such an order there comes a moment in the career of a youngster who re-offends when there is no alternative but to send that youngster to a very different sort of custody <e> <s> may i come back to what is i think common ground in your lordships house that it is far preferable to deal with juvenile offenders in the community <e> <s> the government very much agreed with my noble friend lady faithfull when she drew attention to the importance of intermediate treatment <e> <s> an important proposal in the white paper is that the courts should be able to order an agreed programme of intermediate treatment activities <e> <s> this will renew the courts confidence in supervision as an alternative to custody <e> <s> finally may i say that fundamentally and i think that we would all agree on this the influence of the family is the thing which determines the development of young people <e> <s> the white paper therefore proposes that the power of the courts to order parents to pay fines imposed on children under should be strengthened and that the amount of the financial recognisance which parents can be ordered to forfeit should be increased when an undertaking given to the court to take proper care of and exercise proper control over a juvenile is broken <e>", "<cs> my lords i am now going to express the reason why i think that the noble baroness has been misled <e> <s> in the education act we have implemented our parents charter to give parents the right to express a preference for a school for their child i do not know to how many parents the noble baroness has been talking and to provide for the appointment of parents to governing bodies <e> <s> we have strengthened the position of the denominational schools regarding admissions and the composition and powers of their governing bodies <e> <s> we have established an assisted places scheme and we have embarked on a major reform of the exams taken mainly by pupils at -plus in a way which if i may say so is a considerable improvement on the plans of the previous government <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science is undertaking a review of the curriculum which i believe has been widely and warmly welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords we are certainly not complacent about the activities of any extremist groups and the police have the position under close review <e> <s> but i repeat that it is for the police in consultation as necessary with the director of public prosecutions to decide whether action should be taken over any particular publication <e>", "<cs> my lords because there is no power to ban publications or to seize imported books unless they are indecent or obscene <e>", "<cs> my lords this will be a matter for parliament to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords whether to bring a charge would be a matter for those who are responsible for prosecutions to decide and then the decision would be for the court <e>", "<cs> my lords if the document is called <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly i will draw my right honourable friends attention to the exchanges on this question <e> <s> i am sure the noble and learned lord who is always very fair in this house would wish me to remind him that i was at pains to say the precise opposite of what he just said i was at pains to point out that we are not complacent in this matter that the police have matters of this kind under very close review and that this is something for the police to take action on if they think it is right to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always at the service of the house for any questions which may be asked of me <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that both the noble lord lord brockway and i would agree that it is just plain subversive <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to reply to as many of the questions which the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge and the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones have put to me as i can <e> <s> there has been no use of sections and of the act <e> <s> i am very glad to be able to reply to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i do apologise <e> <s> it was rather a long list of questions and i thought perhaps i was losing my way in the middle of them <e> <s> with regard to facilities being provided i have on my right honourable friends behalf visited cells both in the metropolitan police area and also in other parts of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords the police are of course charged with looking after the prisoners concerned at the moment and although they do not have to conform to prison rules the police use their discretion to allow normal rights and privileges to prisoners wherever possible <e> <s> i am absolutely certain that all will be done which can practicably be done to make sure that christmas for prisoners if there are prisoners in police cells at that time is not cheerless <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not my information but i will certainly look into the matter for the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for saying that because i very strongly believe that to be true <e> <s> we must hope that the prison officers association will soon end their action so that prisoners may enter the prisons where they belong and so that the police may be able to get on with their primary duties <e>", "<cs> my lords about <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an operational matter for chief constables <e>", "<cs> my lords i take on board and i am sure that any members of the police service who read these exchanges will take on board the burden of the question which my noble friend has asked but again this is a matter for individual chief constables <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that there are serious disparities between constituencies as is shown by the figures which my noble friends question has elicited <e> <s> this will be redressed by the proposals which are to be put forward by the commissions for the different parts of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as my noble friends first question is concerned the rules which guide the boundary commissions include rule which specifically enjoins the boundary commissions that they may depart from the norm if special geographical considerations including in particular the size shape and accessibility of a constituency need to be taken into account <e> <s> i absolutely agree with what my noble friend said on that point <e> <s> so far as my noble friends second question is concerned i must admit that i was not aware of what he said <e> <s> i will certainly look into it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the machinery by which parliamentary democracy survives is sharpened up and generally made better if these reviews take place as they do between and years after the previous review <e> <s> that is what is happening now and as soon as the review is completed and as soon as practicable the government will be laying orders for that purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think even the electorate of newcastle-upon-tyne central would claim that for themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is indisputable <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the size of the largest and the smallest constituencies with which we are concerned at the moment will bear the interpretation that in some way a party political advantage can be construed from the reviews of the boundary commissions <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the question of reinforcing the service is concerned i am most anxious to make the point that the problem has not been one of not increasing the size of the service <e> <s> recruitment has been and is buoyant <e> <s> the problem is that the rate of wastage has suddenly fallen dramatically <e> <s> that is most acceptable and welcome in many ways but of course it causes the particular problem which occasions the question asked by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that a healthy probation service is an absolutely essential ingredient towards trying to reduce the size of the prison service <e> <s> to that end and my answer crosses the boundaries of both the previous administration and the present government i should like to make the point that the numbers in the probation service have increased from when there were full-time probation officers <e> <s> at the end of december there were while by the end of september of this year the numbers had risen again to <e> <s> we did indeed make provision for an increase of per cent <e> <s> in the current year in the size of the service <e>", "<cs> my lords i absolutely agree with the noble baroness <e> <s> i am not going to dodge the fact that local authorities are of course being asked to restrain their expenditure very severely indeed i accept that absolutely <e> <s> none the less in that general context i should like to remind the noble baroness that the home office has maintained the support that it gives to the voluntary hostel service in which of course nacro takes the lead and my right honourable friend has taken an initiative in providing a small amount of money to establish particular hostels for offenders suffering from alcoholic troubles <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another question <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may just reply to the speeches which have been made on this order may i thank noble lords for the support which they have given at this difficult time for the continuation reluctantly of this order <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones was good enough to make this quite clear among his other remarks and i shall try to reply to his other points quite briefly <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord peart has reminded us that he is an associate fellow of the royal college of veterinary surgeons <e> <s> it is quite right that the noble lord should have mentioned this because at the end of this debate it has reminded us of the very wide range of interests which have lain behind the speeches made by your lordships at the end of a long week and just before we break for christmas on this very important subject <e> <s> like the noble lord lord peart i think and the government think that clause is perhaps in some ways the most important part of the bill although there is an aspect of clause to which i want to refer before i finish where the government still see difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords when i say to my noble friend that subject to consultation with the local authorities it is the intention that the circular will give county councils and the glc freedom to recruit up to double their present emergency planning team complements i hope my noble friend will see that as being a real and practical encouragement to local authorities to do just that <e> <s> with regard to the first part of my noble friends supplementary question the responsibility for civil defence under the home secretary will be in the safe hands of the new minister of state at the home office <e>", "<cs> my lords i take my noble friends last point <e> <s> consultations are going on at the present time and when i said to my noble friend lord renton that the circular would be issued shortly i meant just that <e> <s> my noble friend lord inglewood is not entirely accurate in claiming that per cent is paid by central government for approved civil defence expenditure it is in fact per cent of approved expenditure and i join with my noble friend in hoping that this will mean that once the circular has been agreed local authorities will recruit up to the levels which are we hope going to be recommended in that circular <e> <s> if authorities wish to recruit beyond that it would such is our intention still be possible for them to do that too <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for making that point and it was with this very much in mind that my right honourable friend the home secretary in his statement to the house of commons on th august last year made the point that some million extra will be spent on civil defence in the next three years <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a very large assumption and it is one with which i would not agree but perhaps we could discuss that on another occasion <e> <s> i should have thought that the noble lord with his record in local government would have been the first to agree that local authorities very properly have the primary responsibility laid on them under the civil defence planning regulations for discharging these emergency functions in the event of war <e> <s> i think that the right way to go about facing the formidable expense is as the government have already announced to continue for the moment at any rate the specific per cent grant which the central government pay <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend and this was a matter i think i remember rightly which was referred to in my right honourable friends statement on th august of last year <e>", "<cs> my lords the government announced on th december the special appointment of air marshal sir leslie mavor to co-ordinate volunteer effort in civil defence and i think we must await a definitive circular on the role of volunteers including any consideration as to the financing of volunteers when sir leslie has firmly taken into his hands the reins of this particular office <e> <s> sir leslie in fact took up his functions on st january <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord about the desirability of trying to see that those who have committed offences which are not violent and not serious should if the court so sees fit be given sentences which they serve within the community and it is for that reason that so far as the responsibility of the government is concerned we are investigating and will continue to investigate alternatives to imprisonment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord talks about what in effect adds up to executive release <e> <s> there is nothing on that subject that i have to say to the house this afternoon but i would repeat what i have said to the noble and learned lords noble friend that we are at all times pursuing and looking into alternatives to custody <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to be unhelpful to the house but this started off as a question about the number of places in prison establishments which were completed last year and the number which will be completed this year <e> <s> if we are to go as wide as the noble earl wishes to lead me perhaps this ought to be the subject of a different question <e>", "<cs> my lords this again is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i would say to the noble lord that when the government announce as they have been announcing what we hope is a realistic building programme for the next three years when we intend to start the building of six new prison establishments this does not mean in fact a very large net increase in the number of prison places <e> <s> all the time that one is building new places the old places in the decaying state of the prison system are going out of use <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already said that we are at all times looking at the possibilities of alternatives to custody and that includes the possibility which the noble lord has mentioned in his supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and to the noble lords lord hooson and lord cledwyn of penrhos for the welcome which they have been good enough to give to this statutory instrument <e> <s> the noble and learned lord asked me what is the significance of the two new forms which are the meat of this statutory instrument forms z and p and indeed the noble and learned lord quoted from form p elegantly and incomprehensibly <e>", "<cs> my lords the government believe that our present simple majority system is most appropriate to the elections to another place <e> <s> it is well understood by the electorate and provides close and correct constituency representation <e> <s> regarding the noble lords second supplementary question i really think that the work of your lordships house speaks for itself <e> <s> we revise but we also initiate <e> <s> i think that anyone who listened to the debate held on wednesday of last week which was initiated by the noble baroness lady masham would agree that important matters can be discussed here giving rise to independent views being voiced <e> <s> doubtless a royal commission would draw attention to these advantages as well as warning against the dangers of single chamber government but i suggest to the noble lord that the electorate is very well seized of these points already <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the whole house would want to join with my noble friend lord balfour in what he has just said <e> <s> lord amory was distinguished not only for the achievements of his career but also for the regard and affection in which he was held by all who knew him <e> <s> many of us believe that his gentle manner his sense of humour and also his support for this house are now going to be very sorely missed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what sort of reform the noble lord has in mind <e> <s> the government are carefully considering various proposals for legislation designed to protect the constitutional powers of this house but so far as the general question of house of lords reform is concerned the government have not yet made up their minds <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already made it clear that i do not follow the right reverend prelate down that particular path <e>", "<cs> my lords the question is about the method of election to another place and we must each have our point of view <e> <s> the governments view is that the present system of election to another place is the one which has the greatest advantages <e> <s> therefore <e>", "<cs> it might my lords <e> <s> but there are some people who will not leave this subject alone <e>", "<cs> my lords i can well understand that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and that to the liberal party there are certain reasons why proportional representation is desirable <e> <s> this does not necessarily mean though that proportional representation in the system of elections to another place is in the best interests of that house <e>", "<cs> may i just add my support for these amendments <e> <s> the noble lord lord wigoder has explained to the committee that the new clause does <e>", "<cs> my lords in his question the noble lord makes it sound as though in northern ireland civilian clothes can be worn and in great britain they are not allowed <e> <s> the situation is not quite so clear cut as that <e> <s> in northern ireland convicted prisoners can during working hours as a result of the change which the noble lord has recorded now wear civilian type clothes issued by the prison <e> <s> in england and wales and in scotland a standard range of clothing is issued though in england and wales long-term prisoners in dispersal prisons may wear certain items of personal clothing <e> <s> so i do not think we are as far apart in the two systems as has been suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends question is interesting because he has put his finger on the point of the prison accommodation but if i may say so that is a rather different criterion which leads to a continuing difference between england and wales and scotland and northern ireland in this matter <e> <s> the different arrangements in northern ireland rely partly on the fact that there is a difference in scale <e> <s> in northern ireland there are more long-term prisoners whereas in great britain there are many more short-term prisoners <e> <s> this is one of the factors and i will not go into it further which lead to the differences in the arrangements for those prisons at the moment still being in existence <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just reply to the noble lord lord donaldson <e> <s> as i understand it the judge suspended his own order for a period of six weeks the effect of the judges own order <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord donaldson for the acceptance and welcome he gave to the order and to the noble lord lord foot for his remarks <e> <s> i agree with lord donaldson that it was desirable to try to reduce the scope of the order and i feel from what both noble lords said that they accept that my right honourable friend has taken the first opportunity to do just that in moving the continuation of the order in this house and in another place today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am simply responding to the noble lord by saying that whatever may have been said from my right honourable friends department which is always in everything helpful to those who inquire of it i nonetheless am not in a position to respond to the noble lord this evening and i know he will not think i am being deliberately unhelpful <e>", "<cs> my lords with characteristic modesty the noble lord lord houghton gave credit to others for the history of previous legislation in this field in the last years or so but i join with the noble lord lord peart in acknowledging that although on occasion i am in a position where i have to disagree with the noble lord lord houghton none the less i recognise always the motives of the noble lord in wishing to help animals and he is this evening seeking <e>", "<cs> my lords all the other markets to which the noble lord lord houghton referred and indeed to which the noble lord lord peart referred are subject in the same way as club row to the provisions of the pet animals act and the acts of and which i mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i think that there is a double responsibility <e> <s> there is this is a matter for the chief officer of police of the area the question of the police responsibility and in this connection i know that the commissioner is anxious to take steps and is taking steps that will result in more officers being released from administrative duties <e> <s> this policy combined with the increase in the strength of the metropolitan police that has taken place means that there will be more policemen on the streets preventing crime <e> <s> the other responsibility is a responsibility of members of the general public to make houses more difficult to break into <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that there is a direct connection between the two <e> <s> perhaps the noble baroness would like to draw the connection to my attention <e>", "<cs> my lords at the present time i do not think that we should pursue this <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not give the clear-up rate as we call it to my noble friend in reply because my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter asked about the number of convictions and as the noble and learned lord says the clear-up rate does not of course always equate with that <e> <s> but broadly speaking what has happened is that taking the years to the number of offences committed has increased enormously from to some <e> <s> therefore the clear-up rate has declined from some per cent <e> <s> in to some per cent <e> <s> in <e> <s> however i would just add that over the last five years to inclusive the number of convictions secured has averaged about which is very much in line with the figure which i gave to my noble friend in my first reply <e>", "<cs> my lords not without notice <e> <s> however if the noble lord would care to have a word with me about this i shall see whether i can help him <e>", "<cs> again my lords not without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords the clear-up rate indicates to what extent offences are finally cleared up <e> <s> that does not always mean securing a conviction <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and the noble lord lord wigoder for the questions which <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for what he has said and i am sure there are others who will be grateful as well <e> <s> i do not want to appear unhelpful but as it is not possible for the reasons i have given to publish mr fowlers report at the present time it really is not possible for me to start to go into the details which quite naturally i know the noble lord would wish me to do <e> <s> i am afraid that i really cannot be any more helpful on the particular point which the noble lord has put to me <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first question which the noble lord lord shepherd has asked me is concerned namely his call for a further statement after court proceedings what we are really talking about is whether or not publication of the report should take place <e> <s> again without in any way wanting to be unhelpful i know that my right honourable friend would have to say in answer to that question and i must say in your lordships house that it will be necessary for the home secretary to take the advice of the attorney-general at the relevant time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to noble lords for what they have said <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boston in giving a welcome to the order for which i thank the noble lord asked me in essence whether something has been built into the level of expenses provided for in this order to take account of inflation <e> <s> the short answer to the noble lord is no because the order-making power in the act allows only for changes to be proposed to the level of expenses <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords who have spoken on this bill even though not giving it a welcome from both benches which have been represented in this debate <e> <s> none the less it has been a interesting debate and the noble viscount lord barrington has added to our debate as well <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a perfectly fair point but it is also fair for me to say that i think i am right in saying that my right honourable friend at no stage said that he thought it was a good idea <e> <s> the reason why neither my right honourable friend nor indeed anybody else at that time could see very much further than that was because it was only later when events began to unfold that we began to realise the effects which the act was having upon the work of the boundary commissions <e>", "<cs> in his remarks on clause stand part the noble lord lord houghton took up the point which i sought to make on second reading that if this bill were to pass into law it is arguable that it would hit far more than its target <e> <s> when i said that i had in mind the requirements in the act for the holding of a licence and during second reading i gave some details of those requirements <e> <s> i reminded your lordships then of the existence of the protection of animals act and of the abandonment of animals act <e> <s> i had that legislation in mind when i spoke <e> <s> i went on to refer to the way in which the tower hamlets borough council environmental health department had strengthened its requirements for the holding of a licence under the act <e> <s> thus in saying that the bill would hit more than its target i meant and indeed i think i said that it would affect markets where traders are conforming to the conditions of their licences <e> <s> i said this also in the context of the strengthening of the licence requirements by the tower hamlets environmental health department <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of the poll to which my noble friend has referred but i am aware that this is a very controversial matter <e> <s> the proposal that my noble friend puts to me was one of the proposals contained in the recent bill before the house of commons <e> <s> i think it fair to say that the criticism of that proposal is that whereas the power to make orders to exempt shops from the restrictions on weekday trading hours and on sunday trading might have been attractive to local authorities it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is due to a combination of the shopkeepers and the noble baronesss ingenuity <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not comment upon the second point that the noble lord makes <e> <s> he speaks from great experience and i would not seek to improve on what he has said <e> <s> with regard to the first point i think it important that i draw the attention of your lordships house to what my honourable friend the minister of state mr raison said when replying to the debate on the bill in another place last week <e> <s> he said he was sure that the house would agree that if the bill went ahead it would be desirable that its provision for setting a limit on shopworkers hours should be discussed fully with the shopworkers union and with others with an interest in this important matter <e> <s> that is yet another aspect of what is a very complicated subject <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord monson will find that there is plenty of freedom to be able to shop as he wishes <e> <s> if the noble lord does not believe me i suggest that he goes shopping with my noble friend lady trumpington <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes an important point <e> <s> it was because i thought that a point of that kind should be made that i took particular care to repeat what my honourable friend the minister of state had said during the debate on the bill in <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends on what my noble friend wishes to buy in the chemists <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree and that is of course absolutely the basis for the running of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not like the house to feel that the home office is flippant or neglectful of what is a very important but a very complicated subject and it is because we realise that government has a position in these difficult matters to do with trading and sunday trading that we have been conducting a review within the department <e> <s> that is not yet completed but we hope that when it is we shall be able to reach some conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords the policy of the marriage law as to capacity to marry has been debated in your lordships house on four occasions in the last two years <e> <s> two of those debates were in the first part of on bills in the same form as that now before the house and indeed on the first occasion the noble lord lord boston of faversham replied on behalf of the government and more recently many of your lordships took part in or heard the debate on the personal bill introduced by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran which was subsequently passed into law <e> <s> today we have another opportunity to express our views on the present restrictions in england and wales on marriage between persons who are related by reason of a previous marriage <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not understand the beginning of the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> my right honourable friend carried out a review in consultation with the commissioner of police of the metropolis and the association of chief police officers into procedures for instituting searches in the case of those who are in breach of the immigration laws and as a result the circular letter to which the noble lord referred was sent out <e> <s> so far as the second part of the noble lords supplementary question is concerned there is a statutory procedure for investigating complaints against the police and i hope that the noble lord will encourage anyone with a complaint against the police to use that procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord avebury and i really are not talking from the same base <e> <s> parliament has imposed on the police and on the immigration service the duty of enforcing the immigration laws and the circular which after all contains valuable guidelines says that the secretary of state is confident that chief officers will continue to enforce the law without fear or favour but that equally the police will take the need for care in this very sensitive area fully into account <e> <s> now if those guidelines are going wrong if in any way they are being flouted that is a case for a complaint against the police and i ask the noble lord a second time to see that the statutory procedures for this set down in the act are followed <e>", "<cs> my lords there is of course an independent element in the complaints procedure the director of public prosecutions where a complaint suggests a criminal offence and the police complaints board where a complaint suggests a disciplinary offence <e> <s> none the less the line of thought which the noble lord has suggested was mentioned in the triennial report of the police complaints board and this is the subject of a review by a working party at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> it is difficult to find the right balance in this particular very sensitive area of operations and i think the police go a very long way towards achieving success <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord made a series of assertions in that supplementary question and i disagree with all of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for understanding the reason for the reply which i have given him <e> <s> the school is not in operation yet <e> <s> i understand that the premises are still empty and that alterations to the premises for which planning permission from the local authority has been obtained are being carried out <e> <s> but the school when it starts will be required to be registered with the department of education and science and will be subject to inspection by her majestys inspectorate of schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly accept the first part of the noble and learned lords supplementary so far as it goes <e> <s> but none of the reports quoted by the noble and learned lord was commissioned by or reported to the present government <e> <s> none the less the action taken on these reports has received the close attention of my right honourable friend <e> <s> all these reports raise matters of major public policy of concern to parliament <e> <s> as the house will know pressure on parliamentary time is one of the main determinants of the speed at which action on reports can be taken <e> <s> so far as the second part of the noble and learned lords supplementary is concerned of course the government appreciate the very great deal of time which is taken on preparing reports of committees which are set up but i do not think we should forget that in appointing committees of inquiry governments do not commit themselves to implementing those committees proposals <e> <s> still less can one government commit their successor <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that part of the report is based on a misunderstanding <e> <s> the misunderstanding is that the report appears to criticise the home office as though it were in some way separate from the government of the day <e> <s> the present government have accepted full responsibility for the handling of these matters since may <e>", "<cs> that is another question my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may pick from the fairly long supplementary which the noble lord has asked me what in fact he is saying as i understand it it is that my right honourable friend the home secretary is inactive in these matters <e> <s> there have been two recent reports which have very much affected the home office that is to say ministers in the home office under the present government <e> <s> the first was the committee on police pay under the noble and learned lord lord edmund-davies <e> <s> within a few days of its going to the home office my right honourable friend implemented in full all the recommendations of that report and put them into effect <e> <s> the second report which i have in mind is the report of mr justice may on the future of the prison service <e> <s> on the very day that that report was published my right honourable friend accepted many of the recommendations and accepted in full and without question all the recommendations on pay and allowances for the prison service <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the wish of the noble lords lord banks and lord kennet who have moved this amendment and are speaking to both amendments that a new electoral system for the election of united kingdom representatives to the european parliament should be introduced <e> <s> but i think it may be of assistance if i just describe the procedures which might be involved in the introduction of a uniform system <e> <s> article of the european community treaty provides that it is for the european parliament to <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be a logical one so far as the noble lord is concerned but what i am saying is that in addition to it being i think quite wrong that it should be put into effect by a directive which would be a european community directive and not a directive which is supposed to apply to the rest of the world the effect of the directive would be to make the effect of what the noble lord calls a logical extension very much wider indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the noble lord that i was perhaps making it sound as though i departed from what the noble lord lord mcgregor was saying instead of calling his words into aid which was not very good tactics on my part <e> <s> i am glad that the noble lord therefore would agree with me that there should be as i understand what the noble lord is saying a discretion for member states to vary the period of validity of the residence permit according to circumstances <e> <s> these are just some of the areas of concern which the government would hope to see clarified before the draft directive could be finally adopted <e> <s> i believe that some of them are shared by other member states while a few countries may see more fundamental objections <e>", "<cs> my lords that was the reason why i said that my noble friend mentioned this in good faith <e> <s> he was advised that this was the situation and i am afraid that this was not the situation <e> <s> if there is any responsibility for what went wrong then i must take it and not my noble friend <e> <s> the reason for the change of course was that we had discussions afterwards and we felt that it would not be appropriate for the government to table an amendment because although the government have very great sympathy with the objective of preventing the misuse of guns we believe that we ought to adopt a somewhat wider and more voluntary approach to the question of air weapon misuse <e> <s> several of your lordships have made the point in speeches probably founded upon experience with your own families that airguns are very much used by the young and a recognition also in speeches if i may say so that the problem that we are dealing with is to a very considerable extent a problem of the young <e>", "<cs> no my lords i will finish if i may and then i will put in context what i am saying <e> <s> the noble lord lord houghton obviously will say to me what are the government going to do <e> <s> is this just words or are the government going to do nothing at all <e> <s> if i may suggest it there is a way forward <e> <s> it could be to try to concentrate on the general issue which we all know is present of trouble from time to time with air weapons and to try to seek to heighten public awareness and a sense of responsibility about the dangers that there are <e> <s> consideration is now being given by my right honourable friends department to the possibility of mounting a campaign on these lines <e> <s> i should like to give your lordships an assurance that the misuse of air weapons against wildlife could well form part of that campaign <e> <s> then the whole question of what should be done could be reviewed in consultation of course with organisations concerned including the british shooting sports council and other organisations when the outcome of the campaign has been evaluated <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i apologise for not giving way to the noble lord but i have given way twice <e> <s> i do not think that we can conduct the report stage as a kind of musical chairs <e> <s> regarding the specific question which the noble lord has asked me if i may say so it does not alter the main thrust of the argument that i was trying to put to your lordships on this amendment <e> <s> what we need to do is to carry people with us in recognising the difficulties which there undoubtedly are so far as the misuse of air weapons is concerned <e> <s> it is for that reason that again i would repeat that the government would very much prefer to see if your lordships agree that we go ahead by way of the campaign to which i have referred and with the consultations which i assured your lordships would follow rather than by writing something on this particular matter into the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know that my answer will be very satisfactory because perhaps not for the first time in your lordships house i have to admit that i do not know the answer to the question put to me by the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> i am not aware that amendment no <e> <s> a which is in the <e>", "<cs> i was under the impression that your lordships wished me to reply <e> <s> that is the answer to one leg of what the position may be <e> <s> if on the other hand this is not a restatement of the law as it stands it still might be held to be desirable <e> <s> before embarking on any long explanation and there are one or two points which i should have liked to draw to the attention of the house as to whether or not it would be desirable i should like very much to go down the road indicated by my noble friend lord caithness which is wholly reasonable <e> <s> if we could have a discussion between now and third reading so that he and his noble friend can be absolutely certain as to whether or not this is a restatement of the law as it stands and the exact effect of it and then be free to come back on third reading that would be the best way to leave the matter for the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the way in which the home secretary has announced how the inquiry will enable the views of all concerned to be gathered effectively and as i said in my main answer it is intended to hold discussions and they will be two-way discussions with a wide range of community relations organisations and ethnic minority groups as well as local authorities and the police <e> <s> i think that is the most effectively way of proceeding with this inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords this inquiry is being conducted into the incidence of racist attacks and of course it follows a visit paid to the home secretary by the joint committee against racial discrimination <e> <s> as i said i think this is an effective and sensible way to proceed and i would assure the noble lord lord brockway that my right honourable friend condemns racist activity anywhere <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might correct what the noble lord said at the beginning of that my lords <e> <s> people who are concerned with this will all be involved in it <e> <s> the discussions will be two-way and they will be conducted at local level <e> <s> all who are concerned and who feel they are concerned will be welcome to have their say <e> <s> the answer to the last part of the noble lords supplementary is that it is open to any person or organisation to send us their views in writing <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no idea what the answer to that question is <e> <s> the point is that this is a sensible way of proceeding <e> <s> i must confess to the noble lord that it had not occurred to me that i should count the heads of those who actually will be conducting the inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords i can neither confirm nor deny that particular figure <e> <s> the level of resources to be made available in to has not yet been finally determined <e> <s> i endeavoured to make that clear earlier on in the remarks that i was making <e> <s> until it is to speak with any precision of a given number of redundancies is if the noble earl will allow me to say so premature <e>", "<cs> my lords that is true and that is why the noble baroness did not mention this particular matter <e> <s> there is something i should like to add which i think is certain i do not think that we can go back to the days of indiscriminate subsidy <e> <s> we can and we shall continue to offer selective assistance through our overseas aid programme <e> <s> as your lordships will have heard steps have already been taken to allocate sufficient aid funds to training programmes in another million in fact to restore the number of new awards for students and trainees from developing countries under government-to-government programmes and bring the commonwealth scholarship and fellowship plan up to about the levels of and <e> <s> i am sure that that is right and i believe that your lordships will weclome it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his intervention <e> <s> he is quite right to give me the advice that he has done <e> <s> but it was because i was talking about the general situation in the universities through the recurrent grant to the universities rather earlier on in my speech that i devoted what i had just said to the work of the research councils <e> <s> that was the reason although i am grateful to the noble lord for the advice which he has given me <e>", "<cs> my lords i think really i have now said as much about the university sector as at this stage i either can or should say <e> <s> there will be many speeches to come from those who are closely involved in the university sector of education and i shall do my best to answer the questions they will ask at the end of your lordships debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this has been a useful debate because it has been an informed debate <e> <s> it has also been a very long one and i hope your lordships will forgive me if in replying i am not able to deal with all the points which have been put <e> <s> particularly come to mind the very interesting speech which the noble lord lord ritchie-calder made about the open university and the points made by the noble baroness lady seear on links between schools and industry which perhaps at this hour i would not go into <e> <s> i think what we should all agree is that it has been a great pleasure to have the noble lord lord swann making his first speech in your lordships house <e> <s> the noble lord described himself as an academic and indeed he is and most distinguished at that <e> <s> but the noble lord has also those wide abilities and tastes which of course made him until very recently a most distinguished chairman of the bbc <e> <s> the noble lord in his speech said that it was a matter of some alarm to speak for the first time in your lordships house <e> <s> i will confess to your lordships that when i am pursuing the even tenor of my work at the home office i have in the past viewed it also as a matter of some alarm when i have seen the noble lord lord swann coming in my direction <e> <s> but this evening or rather today i have been very pleased to see the noble lord <e> <s> i have welcomed the speech which he has made and i am sure all your lordships will join with me when i repeat what has been said many times this evening that we hope very much that the noble lord will return to speak here again many times in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i see nothing wrong in parents contributing towards the cost of additional hooks provided that contributions are made on a genuinely voluntary basis and provided that the local education authorities are fulfilling their duty under section of the education act <e>", "<cs> my lords it is precisely because the government share the kind of concern expressed by the noble baroness that after a considerable period of falling expenditure on books in schools the government are as i said in my original reply now making provision in the rate support grant for a growth in real terms of per cent <e> <s> on this spending if the local authorities see fit to do so by <e>", "<cs> my lords i was seeking in my replies not to bring a political element into this but when the noble baroness lady gaitskell says that everything the government are doing is leading to a situation which gives all of us cause for concern then i must repeat what was said by my right honourable friend the secretary of state in column of <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord had any responsibility for public expenditure i do not think that he would call a per cent <e> <s> increase cumulative over four years pitiful <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord the assurance he requires <e> <s> all i can do is to refer the noble lord to the white paper published on th march <e> <s> however i repeat that i think that the provision which is being made in rate support grant which bears directly upon the problem referred to in this particular question is something which should have some effect <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the question of monitoring is concerned as the noble baroness knows the figures come in annually and that allows everybody to see what expenditure has occurred <e> <s> it is a fact known from these figures that over recent years whereas expenditure on equipment in schools has gone up relative spending on books has not <e> <s> it will be possible to monitor what is happening from the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to your lordships who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> in case anyone may think that your lordships house takes the annual renewal of this act which has such serious implications on the nod i think that the speeches which have been made this evening will show that that is in no way the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i must make it clear to my noble friend that the government are sympathetic to the case for permitting united kingdom citizens resident abroad to vote at elections in this country particularly elections to the european parliament <e> <s> but there are issues of principle as well as a large number of practical problems which must be resolved before such arrangements can be introduced <e> <s> so far as the numbers question is concerned we must await the statement which my right honourable friend hopes to make <e>", "<cs> my lords the review did not deal with the question in the way that the noble lord has put it <e>", "<cs> this my lords is of course one of the matters of principle which would have to be considered seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that this is a point which will be well taken by my right honourable friend the home secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords that again would be among the many considerations to be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords may i give the noble viscount a genuine answer <e> <s> i do not know the answer to that one <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot answer the first question which the noble lord lord boston has put to me but i think that it might go some way to satisfy the noble lord if i say that arrangements could be made if the committee wishes to place a copy of the document to which i referred in the library of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be convenient to the committee if at this stage i beliefly give the governments point of view on this matter <e> <s> it occurs to me that in for instance the case of a stepdaughter who has scarcely previously known her stepfather and who has never been a member of his household it might be argued that it would be inconsistent with the spirit of the bill that a marriage between such a stepdaughter and her stepfather who might for instance be a widower should be forbidden even for the three years until the girl reaches years of age <e> <s> however i suggest that it must be accepted that a statute very rarely accommodates every single case that might conceivably arise <e> <s> moreover the concern which has been expressed for the need to provide relief from the absolute bar which the bill seeks to remove has generally focused on couples who are very much older than <e> <s> despite the possible general objection which the noble lord lord boston of faversham mentioned concerning the recommendations of the latey committee the proposal regarding the age of might go a long way to meeting the <e>", "<cs> the government also are certainly sympathetic to the intention of this amendment which as the right reverend prelate has said has precedent in a provision of the matrimonial causes act <e> <s> but i think the amendment is defective in the sense that it does not quite achieve what the right reverend prelates who have their name to it intend <e> <s> as i understand the wording of the amendment it would go too wide inasmuch as it would enable a clergyman to refuse to marry or allow another clergyman to marry in his church persons related by affinity who under the law as it stands today and as is also set out in canon b of the church of england are permitted to marry each other for example a man and the sister of his deceased wife i doubt whether that is what the right reverend prelate really intends <e> <s> i imagine that he would wish his proposal to be limited to cases of affinity in the direct line whether ascending or descending which under this bill would for the first time fall outside the prohibited degrees of marriage <e> <s> may i make a suggestion to the right reverend prelate <e> <s> it is that if the committee agree to the amendment perhaps it could be moved into the bill and then could be further slightly amended at report stage <e>", "<cs> there is a serious point here in the sense that i put it to the noble baroness lady wootton who is not here this evening that of course the bill does not extend to scotland and that this could cause certain problems <e> <s> i ask the noble baroness if she would perhaps consider whether it ought to extend to scotland and if so the services of the home office so far as we are able to make them available would be at her disposal <e> <s> the noble baroness has not been able to respond but maybe it is right for me to say a second time that perhaps the noble baroness advised by the noble lord lord boston would like to think about this matter again before the report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not equivalent to solitary confinement <e> <s> while in a local prison men from dispersal prisons will be treated in the same way as any other prisoner of the same security category held under rule in that prison <e> <s> in particular they will do the same work and receive the same pay on the same basis as their fellows and they will receive the same privileges as any other rule prisoner who is segregated in the interests of good order and discipline <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that when you are dealing with prisoners who are in security category a or security category b it is the duty of the governor of the establishment to take a practical forward look at what the situation is going to be in his particular establishment <e> <s> you have to look at what the effect of the behaviour of a prisoner in a particular situation may be upon the establishment as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords you do it by discharging your duty as a governor in the prison service <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord lord houghton tell the house in what way the present amendment prevents a cat from being shot at with an airgun <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been at great pains to tell the house that those problems are already covered by existing legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships leave perhaps i may briefly reply <e> <s> may i also say that the onus of replying to amendments on this difficult bill seems to have been too much for me and i attempted to move amendment no <e> <s> which has in fact got nothing to do with this clutch of amendments under the name of my noble friend lord caithness and other noble lords <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> we come to in a moment and is in the name of my noble friend lord bellwin <e>", "<cs> it is a matter of the greatest importance that those who are representing her majestys government in the discussions on the draft convention should bear in mind what is said in the debate on this committee stage when they next go to strasbourg in just over a months time <e> <s> i am certainly bearing very much in mind that we have to await the final draft of the convention before we can see what is to be done this is the argument i have put again and again to your lordships so far as our domestic legislation is concerned <e>", "<cs> i shall not repeat what the noble earl lord halsbury and the noble lord lord energlyn have said <e> <s> in essence the noble earl said that the amendment was teaching the secretary of state how to do his job with the advice he also received from the inspectorate <e> <s> i need not add to that <e> <s> it might be of interest to the committee to be reminded of the present state of the draft convention article is worded in much the same way as clause <e>", "<cs> i do not think that this afternoon we want to discuss whether or not an amendment is correctly technically drafted <e> <s> i am sure that this amendment so far as its objective is concerned is drafted exceedingly well <e> <s> however as i understand the amendment it is not drafted in such a way as to require anyone to have regard to certain factors but rather it lays down a duty <e> <s> it states <e>", "<cs> if i may respond to the question which has been asked of me the government accept the desirability of alternative methods being used whenever practicable and when the noble lord lord houghton chides the government with distancing themselves from this matter and not becoming involved in it i think the noble lord may have temporarily forgotten that an exhortation was sent out in december to all licensees under the act urging them to consider and if practical to adopt whatever alternatives are available to them in their particular field of work <e> <s> that exhortation has been repeated in each year since then in and in <e> <s> it is not sent out by the department of education and science it is sent out by the home office on behalf of her majestys government <e> <s> we do care and we are continuing the system which was started by the previous government in this respect although i must admit to my noble friend that we are not accompanying the exhortation with financial inducements <e> <s> i had not really intended to speak on the amendment because for reasons which have been deployed by the noble earl i do not think the government would wish to support the amendment as it stands but i have ventured to make this intervention in order to put what i have just said on the record <e>", "<cs> if i may reply to the noble lord lord houghton i gave a written answer to a question which the noble lord put down on th march <e> <s> in the answer i said that a sub-group of the <e>", "<cs> the form which the pain condition should take in the council of europe convention has still to be settled <e> <s> that is clearly understood this evening in the committee <e> <s> i should like to make it clear on the general point that so far as the government are concerned we believe that the starting point for our reconsideration of this matter must be the present pain condition attached to all licences issued to persons wishing to carry out experiments on live animals under the act which empowers the secretary of state to attach such conditions as he sees fit to any licence <e> <s> the pain condition has remained in its present form as the noble lord lord adrian <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to say that suspended sentences are not effective <e> <s> i am aware of criticisms and indeed research is being undertaken to try to throw more light on this particular aspect <e> <s> with regard to what the noble lord said in the second part of his question i assure the noble lord that the government recognise the strength of the argument for introducing partially suspended sentences but we really must be confident that the overall impact of the provision would be to offer relief and not add to the prison population <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree with the noble and learned lord <e> <s> this is the danger and this is what causes the government to hesitate <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the area we want to look at is the prisoner serving the shorter sentence and indeed the lord chief justice has emphasised in cases in the court of appeal that that is the area at which he would wish the courts to look <e> <s> it is intended shortly by the home office to publish the results of a review of the parole scheme which will look not only at its operation within present statutory limits but also at the possibility of some extension to shorter sentences of early release arrangements <e> <s> i think that is the way we should proceed <e>", "<cs> shortly my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord lord jacques and the government are committed to ensuring protection for the public against violent and dangerous criminals <e> <s> however violent offenders are i am glad to say still in the minority in our prisons and there is reason to believe that a reduction in the use of imprisonment for non-violent offenders could be achieved without sacrificing the protection which the public are entitled to expect <e>", "<cs> my lords the objective of the operation of embarkation control is to identify and record the departure of persons subject to immigration control <e> <s> if the embarkation control were temporarily abandoned some persons admitted to the united kingdom would not have their departure recorded <e> <s> the noble lord asked me how many people are detained as i understood it either coming in or going out <e> <s> i am afraid i am not furnished with those figures <e> <s> the noble lord asked me finally whether it did not drive a coach and horses in essence through the system that people could travel to the republic of ireland <e> <s> my lords almost anything can happen if you travel to the republic of ireland and i have no doubt that driving a coach and horses is among them <e>", "<cs> my lords a person is guilty of a criminal offence if without reasonable excuse he refuses or fails to submit to an immigration officers examination or to furnish information or to produce a satisfactory identity document or embarkation card where appropriate or obstructs an immigration officer lawfully acting in the execution of the immigration act and it is the immigration act which is the controlling legislation <e>", "<cs> that is a very ingenious question my lords but it has one fatal flaw we are not talking about arrivals we are talking about departures <e> <s> the answer to the question which the noble lord has asked me is that the point of the embarkation control is that if people come here in a temporary capacity then it is highly desirable to see when they leave <e>", "<cs> my lords during the period of the industrial action which the government very much regret in fact the integrity of the immigration control has been maintained <e> <s> none the less i assure the noble earl that this is a matter on which we are keeping a very close eye <e>", "<cs> my lords this opens up a very much wider field <e> <s> i take on board what my noble friend has said and of course i know that my right honourable friend will study it closely <e>", "<cs> my lords i really think that i cannot do more than i have done which is to refer your lordships to the primary legislation under which the immigration officers operate <e> <s> when there is industrial action which causes trouble with the working of that legislation this is a matter for the very greatest regret and i hope that this action will be ending soon <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends supplementary question once again points to the importance of the embarkation control and i repeat that the embarkation control is necessary for the proper immigration control in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the home secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their response to my right honourable friends statement and for the expression of sympathy from both noble lords for those who have been injured in the violence of the weekend <e> <s> the noble lord lord boston expressed the view that the police must protect all law-abiding citizens in this country and preserve the law wherever it has to be preserved <e> <s> i confirm what has already been said in my right honourable friends statement that during this very difficult weekend the metropolitan police discharged their duty very bravely indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to reply to the right reverend prelate who was good enough to welcome this inquiry <e> <s> the right reverend prelate of course speaking with his knowledge now of the diocese also mentioned the need for sacrifices to be made for this particular area of london <e> <s> no one i think would gainsay the needs of people living in the area of brixton but i believe that it is just worth putting on record in reply to the right reverend prelates observations that lambeth received assistance of about million in the last year under what are known as the partnership arrangements for inner cities and without in any way prejudicing the findings of the inquiries of the noble and learned lord lord scarman i would doubt whether financial matters are the whole story <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may answer those questions one at a time <e> <s> the noble lord lord brockway asked me about other appointments to this inquiry <e> <s> my right honourable friend the home secretary much appreciates the swift reply of the noble and learned lord lord scarman in agreeing to undertake this inquiry and my right honourable friend has not indicated that he intends to make any other appointments to this inquiry <e> <s> as regards the other two questions which the noble lord asked i think that they are both matters for the noble and learned lord lord scarman when the inquiry begins <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure with respect that i would agree with the premise on which the noble lords question is fixed <e> <s> however i should like to repeat the information which i have given and i do so in the form of an assurance to the noble lord lord boothby that at the same time as this inquiry will be running there are of course other inquiries which are going on at present in this country one is the inquiry of a select committee of another place into racial disadvantage and another is a study promoted by my right honourable friend the home secretary into the incidence of racialist attacks in this country <e> <s> we take very seriously the trend of the question which the noble lord lord boothby has asked me but i repeat that i do not agree with the premise on which the question was asked <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so the noble lord lord gifford overlooks the efforts the very real efforts which have been made by the metropolitan police to try to improve police/community relations within the boundaries of the metropolis and not least <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for the two questions he has asked <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that whatever the reasons for the violence which occurred over the weekend nothing can condone it because it has caused misery to so many people and such a threat to law in this country <e> <s> i also agree with the noble lord and thank him for saying that with an open mind we should now support the fact that the most thorough examination into the events of the weekend will be undertaken in the inquiry which will be headed by the noble and learned lord lord scarman <e>", "<cs> my lords i should express my gratitude to all noble lords who have taken part in this second reading debate for providing not only a stimulating debate but also for giving me some guidance as to the lines of thought that your lordships intend to pursue perhaps at later stages of the bill on a subject which i realise is sensitive and has highly technical features <e> <s> i assure your lordships that i have listened with great interest to the speeches which have been made <e> <s> i will not repeat the arguments for repealing the suspected person offence of the act in this bill <e> <s> i think that every speech made on this second reading has said that noble lords feel that it is right to do this <e> <s> the only thing that i would say in passing is that i join with the noble lord lord mishcon in not agreeing with lord giffords assessment that there was racial motivation in bringing charges under the sus offence <e> <s> i should have thought that paragraph of the report of the select committee of another place put the matter fairly and i would not want to depart from what the select committee said in that paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i will look with my advisers closely at what the noble lord lord mishcon has said <e> <s> i do not think that i can go further than that this afternoon but probably and i will be ready on a subsequent occasion to try to explain why we find difficulties with this and one of the difficulties is the one which i have rehearsed just now <e> <s> the noble baroness lady wootton said that looking at clause she felt that there was no need for this specific offence <e> <s> rather than rehearse again the arguments to rebut what the noble baroness has said i would just say that the noble lord lord wigoder said as i understood the noble lord in his speech that there are difficulties under the law as it stands at the moment in bringing a charge of attempt in a case of this kind <e> <s> therefore may i go on and answer a point which was put by the noble lord lord pitt in his speech <e> <s> he said in essence that he would like to see what he called a tightening of clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord is not right <e> <s> for the reasons that i attempted to give just now this is a specific offence <e> <s> it requires overt acts and i would have thought that this was self-evidently fair but this is a matter which we can come back to again in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords off the cuff i do not think that the new offence in clause affects the other powers which my noble friend lord inglewood has mentioned <e> <s> certainly i would be ready to come back with my noble friend to this matter in committee <e> <s> the noble lords lord mishcon and lord pitt and <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly give an assurance that we will endeavour to consult in a more practical manner in the future <e> <s> i should like to assure the noble lord and your lordships that no discourtesy to the commissioners was intended <e> <s> it is right for me to put on the record that when we found that the drafting of the offence which the noble lord referred to as being virtually impossible raised great difficulties the way in which the government felt it was necessary to turn was towards the recommendations which had been made by the law commission <e> <s> of course almost the entire bill which is before your lordships house today is based almost verbatim upon the recommendations of the law commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i do apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i was under the impression that he was referring to clause <e> <s> of course exactly the same argument applies to clause in that the bill is following exactly word for word the recommendations which have been made there also by the law commission <e> <s> may i again thank your lordships for the speeches made today <e> <s> i realise we have differed on points but if i may say so it has been extremely <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for giving us the opportunity to hold this important short debate today <e> <s> it is an important debate for the noble lord reminded us in a brief story he told of the tradition which we have in this country of identifying with the police force of the area in which each of us lives and of course the events of this weekend remind us forcibly of the disastrous course people embark upon if they turn their backs on this tradition <e>", "<cs> no my lords not in london because so far as london is concerned it is the one case where people living in the metropolis have the good fortune if i may put it that way to have their police authority directly responsible to parliament in that the police authority is my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> i believe that that is absolutely the right system for the metropolis <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole burden of my speech has been trying to underpin the case that this is an expression of what is happening and that so far as in any parts of the country it may not be happening it is the desire of my right honourable friend with his general overall responsibility to draw to the attention of authorities that this should be the situation and this is the way he would wish to see it develop <e>", "<cs> my lords i am saying that most of the members of the british council of churches would be reluctant to see easter day kept within the period th to th april without general agreement among the western churches <e> <s> my information is not the same as that of the noble lord for i understand that that agreement is unlikely for the present <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i am as keen on that compromise as is the noble lord lord wynne-jones <e> <s> this year we are celebrating easter a week later than the last date on which under the easter act we could have done so <e> <s> that means that without the easter act this year we still have easter to look forward to <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the government position is and it is the right position that we leave things as they are at the moment until there is general agreement from the churches <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the right reverend prelate in that opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords it has always been the view of the government ever since the act was passed in that regard shall be had to any opinion officially expressed by any church or other christian body and it is to that view that we continue to pay regard <e>", "<cs> i have with me a wealth of information about foreign law my lords but i do not think i have anything which would help the house in regard to the amendment and i therefore do not feel i can add to what i said <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness for what she has said concerning the advice which we have offered to her on the drafting of this amendment but i should like to make it clear again that this does not mean in any way that the government depart from their line of being neutral on the policy of this bill <e> <s> the only thing i should like to add as an explanation as to why the government support this amendment at the technical level is that we think it is very desirable that any general alteration in the law relating to marriage even if it is an alteration unlikely to affect many people should be made in the main act affecting this branch of the law in england and wales <e> <s> that of course is the act and this is what the amendment achieves <e> <s> this we believe is the best way to change the law in this area so that those concerned can most easily find out what the law would be if this bill becomes an act <e> <s> that is all i would wish to add to what the noble baroness lady wootton has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the problems of people living in a locality where there are large concentrations of people gathering together for a particular reason <e> <s> if it appears to the commissioner of the metropolitan police that a public procession will unavoidably give rise to serious public disorder he can apply to my right honourable friend the home secretary for his consent to the making of a banning order <e> <s> that is the only criterion for a ban and that is a matter for the commissioner at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i share my noble friends views and hopes <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not in any way dissent from what the noble lord has said but i think the way to ensure a peaceful occasion in this particular context is for there to be close liaison with the police and with those who organise the carnival if it is to be held <e> <s> however the carnival of course if it is to be held will be due in august and it is a little difficult to assess the prospects so far ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble baroness and i am most grateful to her for making the point <e>", "<cs> my lords here again i agree with what the noble lord lord hunt has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can only repeat what i have already said in answer to previous questions <e> <s> i believe that with close liaison with those who are responsible for keeping law and order in other words the police it will be possible if the carnival is to be held again this year to ensure a peaceful occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords we are now assessing all the views which have been expressed on this particular <e>", "<cs> my lords i have little doubt that all concerned will wish to consider carefully the lessons to be learned from the way in which this inquiry has gone <e> <s> i must emphasise that operation countryman is a police investigation into allegations of serious criminal offences some of which are now before the courts and therefore i think it would be wrong of me to comment further <e> <s> this is a matter for the two commissioners concerned and they are well aware of the need to continue as fast as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the view expressed by the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand my noble friends concern and also i share her expression of views about the sympathy with the families of the victims who are so distressed by the reports to which my noble friend has referred <e> <s> my right honourable friend the home secretary finds it abhorrent that criminals should benefit from publication of accounts of their activities <e> <s> but although i do not dissent from the last part of my noble friends supplementary question for legislation there are real difficulties of <e>", "<cs> my lords of course arising from my noble friends question what we are talking about would be legislation which would create a criminal offence <e> <s> i think i ought to say that the creating of a criminal offence for something which in a profession ought to be regulated by the profession would be a very serious step indeed <e> <s> that leads me to the supplementary question asked by the noble lord lord boston <e> <s> all that i can say this afternoon is that i understand that all aspects of press treatment of the sutcliffe case are to be investigated by the press council as soon as the criminal proceedings have been concluded <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this is something which the press council themselves will want to consider in looking again as i have no doubt they will at their own guidelines <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he shows that concern over this matter is shared on all sides of the house <e> <s> i share with the noble lord his expression of views as to the right way forward in the immediate future <e>", "<cs> my lords although i am not a lawyer i am aware of the effect of what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> but the effect of it is that it does not prevent publication <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i repeat that i think there is a view being expressed in all parts of the house that this is a matter which in the immediate future should be and i have no doubt would be in their discretion looked at by the press council <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a suggestion which was made just now by my noble friend lord lauderdale <e> <s> i repeat the answer that i gave to him <e> <s> in looking at its own guidelines which i have no doubt the press council will be wishing to do this is an aspect it will wish to consider <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord has spoiled his question <e> <s> i was teeing myself up to agree cordially with what he said but the second half of the noble lords supplementary question i cannot agree with <e> <s> therefore i confine myself to saying that i agree with the noble lord and i deplore and my right honourable friend the home secretary deplores the practice of what loosely we call cheque-book journalism <e> <s> i believe this is a matter to which the press council will turn its attention <e>", "<cs> my lords under the constitutional arrangements which govern broadcasting in this country the broadcasting authorities are subject to the general law and within the framework of obligations laid down in their governing instruments entirely responsible for the programmes they broadcast <e> <s> the policy of successive governments including the present government is that the authorities should be assured of their independence in the day-to-day conduct of their undertakings particularly in relation to programme content <e> <s> i am sure that the authorities are fully aware of their responsibilities as trustees of the public interest in broadcasting in relation to their coverage of events in northern ireland and that they will take note of any views expressed on this matter in your lordships house and elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked me the view of the government about particular programmes on a particular evening <e> <s> once the government say either that they approve or disapprove of a particular programme or series of programmes we are on very dangerous ground indeed <e> <s> however may i respond to the noble lord in this way there is one general consideration which my right honourable friend the home secretary has previously referred to and which in essence i should like to repeat <e> <s> terrorists seek and depend upon publicity <e> <s> because they make war on society they outlaw themselves from its provileges including the privileges of publicity <e>", "<cs> my lords again i must repeat that once the government say that they approve or disapprove of a particular programme any government of any political colour is on very dangerous ground indeed <e> <s> i trust that the remarks of the noble lord lord paget will be taken account of indeed i know they will by the broadcasting organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat the general remarks which i made earlier because terrorists make war on society they should outlaw themselves from its privileges including the privileges of publicity <e> <s> my noble friend asked me specific questions about specific programmes <e> <s> i should just like to add this <e> <s> my noble friend may remember that during the passage of the broadcasting bill last year in response to views which were strongly expressed in all parts of your lordships house an undertaking was given that the broadcasting authorities would each year in their-annual reports give an account of complaints received and what they have done to meet those complaints <e> <s> may i suggest to your lordships that in addition to asking questions in your lordships house to which of course i must reply it could also be the right way to correspond with the broadcasting authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the government condemn atrocities by terrorists wherever they are and whoever they are <e>", "<cs> that is another question my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall make it my business to discover whether the attention of the broadcasting authorities has been drawn to the exchanges this afternoon <e> <s> if by any chance it has not then i shall accede to what the noble lord has asked me <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wells-pestell has mentioned the home office quite properly of course because we together with the scottish office were the government departments which were most interested in the bill of the noble baroness lady wootton <e> <s> during the course of the several debates that we have had on the bill i have on behalf of the department of my right honourable friend the home secretary tried to point out the implications of its proposals and i wish briefly once again to mention three of the implications <e>", "<cs> the reason for the delay in bringing the act into force which my noble friend is asking me about is because of the amendment to the crown court rules to which i have just referred <e> <s> it is hoped that these amendments will be incorporated into the rules very soon and the act brought into force in the early summer <e>", "<cs> i should like to think about this for a moment or two <e> <s> i might be in a position to reply to my noble friend if he will bear with me when we come to clause which deals with the other limb of conspiracy <e> <s> would that be agreeable to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i do of course take very seriously any advice which my noble friend gives on the drafting of legislation <e> <s> as i understand my noble friends <e>", "<cs> i undertook to reply to my noble friend lord renton on the point he raised concerning manslaughter which referred to attempted conspiracies <e> <s> i said that i would attempt to reply to my noble friend on this clause <e> <s> manslaughter cannot be attempted so it is the government suggest unnecessary to mention it expressly in clause <e> <s> it was on that stage of the bill that my noble friend lord renton raised the point <e>", "<cs> this clause of course abolishes the offence of attempt at common law and provides that references in existing enactments to attempt at common law shall be construed as references to the new statutory offence <e> <s> it corresponds to clause of the law commissions draft bill with a minor addition to subsection <e> <s> may i just refer to the two subsections of <e>", "<cs> does my noble friend mean instead of referring specifically to clause <e>", "<cs> i will take my noble friends final remark away and look at it and possibly i can include something about it in the letter which i promised to write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord lord mishcon who in moving this amendment said that we ought all to look carefully at clause <e> <s> i agree with him because i realise that when the government are proposing to parliament the creation of a new offence it is the responsibility of members of both houses to look carefully at the proposals made <e> <s> i attach particular importance to todays debate because so many of your lordships have taken part in it <e> <s> but with respect i do not find that i agree with the noble lord and many other noble lords that we should draw an analogy between clause and the suspected person offence which has been done away with in clause <e> <s> if i may say so i think that one fact that so many of your lordships are drawing an analogy between clause and the offence of sus has led the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge to remind the government in this debate of the views of the home office working party on vagrancy and street offences <e> <s> the views of that working party on the need for two acts before a conviction should be secured were in the context of a revised sus offence and not an entirely different offence as is the proposal in clause of the bill <e>", "<cs> let me develop the argument for a moment <e> <s> if i may i should like to explain why i attach such importance to the fact that the two offences are not the same and the burden of proof in both offences is as i see it clearly different <e> <s> before doing that however may i pick up a point made by the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge in his first remarks when in essence he said that proof under the provisions of clause was going to be easier to obtain than would have been the proof necessary for the former offence of sus <e>", "<cs> i acknowledge the reason which the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones gave for drawing attention to the need for shorter sentences of imprisonment as one of the main reasons for moving this amendment <e> <s> the noble and learned lord spoke not only persuasively but also in generous terms so far as my right honourable friend the home secretary is concerned about the wish which i think is felt quite genuinely on all sides of your lordships committee to head in that particular direction <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry to have answered my noble friend lord swinfen in that way <e> <s> the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge is absolutely right to pick me up <e> <s> of course my noble friend lord swinfen what a pity that i did not get it right the first time is on to a good point <e> <s> i think that i might have been a little less dim in taking on board my noble friends suggestion and welcoming it instead of trying to rebut it <e>", "<cs> i am not a lawyer and i think the point will be picked up by the noble and learned lord lord elywn-jones when he addresses us on the course which he has decided to take on the amendment <e> <s> surely the answer to the question asked by the noble lord lord robbins was encapsulated in some of the words which my noble friend lord renton spoke to your lordships committee <e> <s> the courts have room to manoeuvre within the maximum which is set <e> <s> it is necessary so my noble friend was advising the committee to see that the maximum is set to provide for various different contingencies <e>", "<cs> it would be churlish of me not to respond to the noble and learned lord and to the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i think first it is right to say again that this is a question of balance and of judgment and we are talking about an area where nobody can be absolutely certain <e> <s> but secondly in the context of wishing to see shorter sentences in appropriate cases it is fair to say that the government have among other things as i said in my original answer looked at the penalties which are available for the substantive offences to which the preparatory offences could lead <e> <s> these are substantial penalties for offences which earlier today my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson reminded the committee are being committed in very substantial numbers every day of the year <e> <s> that is why we felt that on balance it was right that with remission of course the maximum penalty should be three months imprisonment and the alternative of the fine with as the noble and learned lord has reminded my noble friend lord swinfen the right of the courts and we all know that increasingly they are making use of this to look to alternatives such as community service in appropriate cases <e>", "<cs> as i understand it again my noble friend is not questioning the effect of subsection but is questioning the drafting of it and of course i am only too ready to take that away and have it looked at <e>", "<cs> as your lordships know this clause was tightened in another place <e> <s> i see the noble lord lord pitt nodding <e> <s> i am sure he felt that that was the right way to go if there was to be a clause in the bill <e> <s> we will certainly look at it but i must be straightforward about this i think it is highly unlikely that we would be able to tighten the clause further <e> <s> i will not conceal from the noble lord that there has been a great deal of discussion in the home office as to how the clause ought to be drafted <e> <s> indeed a point which the noble lord lord mishcon put to me at second reading and we will not go over it now was looked at very carefully before the bill came to your lordships house and has been discussed again since the noble lord put the point to me <e> <s> i would not want the noble lord lord pitt to feel that the government have simply got the clause drafted and then turned their back on it and gone on to other things <e> <s> continuing thought as to whether this was the right way has been given to the drafting of the clause while the bill has been going through both houses <e> <s> we will look at it once more but i can give the noble lord no commitment to change it further <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend that the use of fire during disturbances is a particularly worrying feature and a dangerous development which we have recently seen <e> <s> the protective shield which the police can carry if the chief constable thinks it right resists attack from burning petrol and work is in hand on the possible use of fire-resistant materials for uniforms <e>", "<cs> my lords the working group referred to in my original answer which my right honourable friend the home secretary set up on st may and which consists of representatives of the home office her majestys inspectorate of constabulary the police organisations and the local authorities will among other things be looking most seriously into the point raised by the noble baroness lady gaitskell namely the possibilities of further developing the use of fire-resistant materials <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely understand the concern which prompts the question put by the noble lord but i think that it is worth noticing that when my right honourable friend the home secretary met police representatives before announcing the establishment of the working group on st may they all agreed without any dissenting voice that any departure from traditional policing methods is undesirable <e>", "<cs> my lords the use of equipment such as water cannon can of course be effective in certain circumstances but it could in the long term alienate the public from the police <e> <s> as i have said my right honourable friend has set up this working group which includes representatives of all the police organisations and the local authorities as well as the government <e> <s> i think that this is the right way to proceed and that we now ought to wait until those deliberations are over when as i have promised my right honourable friend will be making a statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord is absolutely right in what he says as regards the knowledge which is in the possession of fire brigades generally and i think that that relates incidentally to the use of non-inflammable materials for clothing as well <e> <s> i assure the noble lord that the working group to which i have referred will take most seriously any information which the fire service can give <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we have shown in government that we will do everything that we can to support the work of the police <e> <s> now i think that we must wait to see the results of the deliberations to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> no my lords i very much doubt it <e>", "<cs> my lords the home secretarys mobile radio committee is at present engaged in a review of the spectrum requirements of private land mobile radio services until the end of the century and the scope for meeting them in the light of the outcome of the recent world administrative radio conference <e>", "<cs> well my lords i am not aware of the point that my noble friend has mentioned because i have not seen the draft report <e> <s> we are talking about a committee which does valuable work and which is an advisory committee to my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> i think that we should wait to see what the committee has to say before i state on behalf of the government any conclusions that we may reach <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for the reception she has given to my answer <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the home secretary said in his foreword to the review that the government had reached no conclusion on these proposals and was publishing them as a basis for informed discussions <e> <s> we shall decide as soon as possible in the light of reactions to the review whether to ask parliament to approve a scheme on the lines proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for what he has said as a result of the reply i gave <e> <s> yes indeed i am aware that the lord chief justice has already commented that the proposed scheme could prove successful and worthwhile <e> <s> if i might register my agreement with what the noble lord lord hunt then went on to say it can be argued of course that statistically parole has worked <e> <s> statistically we can see that those who are granted some parole are less likely to commit subsequent offences than those who have not had parole <e> <s> frankly i attach a very great deal of importance to that <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord with his experience for the importance he attaches to it too <e> <s> as far as the noble lords final question is concerned my right honourable friend hopes to be able to reach a decision in time to take advantage of any opportunity for legislation which may be available next session <e> <s> i hope the noble lord can decipher what i mean and that i have made myself clear <e>", "<cs> my lords the central concept of parole release under supervision with liability to recall <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly i will look into the question of making available copies of the document to the prison service <e> <s> copies have already been made available on a wide scale <e> <s> as to the general thrust of what the noble lord is saying in his second supplementary question i think it is certain that if the scope of this scheme were to run at the lower end from those with six-month sentences to those at the upper end with three-year sentences there would be no anomalies and therefore the rest of the supplementary question which the noble lord asked would fall <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not wish to make any comment on what the noble lord has put to me about that except to say that with regard to the suggestion and it was no more than a suggestion because this review is for consideration and indeed my right honourable friend the home secretary has asked for views to be expressed by the end of july so that the government can then think of their position which i put to the noble lord lord avebury that the scope of the scheme could be between six months <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord ferrier <e> <s> the recall rate of those who misbehave while on parole under the parole scheme ever since the scheme was brought in under the parole boards supervision under the noble lord lord hunt in has remained pretty constant at between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> i ascribe one of the reasons for this steadiness of the recall rate to the work done by the probation service in supervision <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to give any undertakings as to the way in which the courts should exercise their judicial discretion <e> <s> perhaps it is more seemly for me to repeat as a final word a point i made at the beginning that the noble and learned lord the lord chief justice has commented that the scheme proposed could prove successful and worth while <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is most important that i should repeat that my right honourable friend has asked for reactions to this review <e> <s> the review is of course a review of the whole of the work of the parole system during its first to years <e> <s> also he has asked for reactions to the paragraphs within that review winch deal with this scheme which is the subject of the question today <e> <s> my right honourable friend will of course take very serious account of any views which are expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had made it absolutely clear to the house that what we wished to do what we intend to do and what we said to the subcommittee on racial disadvantage which is considering that matter in another place is that we want to consider how the new arrangements for rate support grant will in fact work out in practice <e> <s> the noble lord has made the suggestion that they will work out in a highly disadvantageous way <e> <s> i am not so sure that the noble lord is right but at least in order to show that we are genuine in what we say we are making it clear that we shall not make any changes in the section grants until it has become clear and we said to the subcommittee in another place that this would not be until at least after the autumn how the new arrangements are working <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i think that that was a fair and reasonable answer and i must get on <e> <s> in addition to the effects of government spending programmes and existing legislation the commission for racial equality established under the race relations act has the task of eliminating racial discrimination and promoting good race relations <e> <s> however i do not mind admitting at once that spending programmes legislation and the work of the cre are not enough <e> <s> i accept that good race relations overwhelmingly depend on a positive effort by everyone in this country and i accept that here the government have their part to play <e>", "<cs> my lords i must admit to the noble lord that i do not see the matter in those terms <e> <s> i see it in the terms that i have just set out <e> <s> if he would like to read what i have just said he may see it in my terms as well <e> <s> i was interested to hear the tribute which was paid by the right reverend prelate the bishop of lichfield to the work which the police have undertaken in recent years in wolverhampton <e> <s> i think that cooperation is a two-way process and while the police constantly have to bear in mind the importance of their relations with members of the community which they serve so all of us must understand that only by co-operating with the police and that means reporting crime to the police when it occurs can we get on top of the problems of public order which from time to time beset this country <e>", "<cs> then i just have to make it clear that i reject that charge completely <e> <s> so far as the commission for racial equality investigation into immigration control is concerned the home secretary has said that the home office will respond as helpfully as possible to requests for information by the commission in connection with its investigation <e> <s> some material has already been made available to the investigating team and senior officials are discussing with the commissioners the general line to be followed in relation to the provision and protection of sensitive information <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee will acquit me of any discourtesy if i say i shall try not to speak on very many of the amendments <e> <s> on this first one it is important that from the government benches i should make clear what is our attitude <e> <s> i should like strongly to support the words of my noble friend lord nugent when he asked the committee to take serious account of the consequences of making a substantial amendment to a bill of narrow but extremely useful scope <e>", "<cs> i have nothing to add to what was said by my noble friend lord nugent except that i am a little concerned about an alliance not of course an unholy alliance between my noble friend and the noble lord lord houghton in pushing for more comprehensive legislation in this field <e> <s> however that is another matter and it falls well outside the scope of this limited but extremely useful bill <e> <s> i join with my noble friend in hoping that the noble lord lord houghton as he has indicated to us will not feel it is worth pressing this amendment to a division <e>", "<cs> after a rather brief glance i think that this amendment could be said to be technically defective and we ought to have another look at it before we decide whether to agree to it <e>", "<cs> my advice is that the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby is quite right and that other legislation of various kinds of which the noble lord mentioned one example would cover the kinds of eventuality which he had in mind <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has asked a question as to the course he should take on a matter about which there is clearly a difference of opinion <e> <s> would he see fit to look again at the amendment before report <e> <s> i was a little surprised to see that the right to bring a prosecution would be restricted under the amendment to a police officer of or above the rank of superintendent <e> <s> i am advised that the government do not know any precedent for a provision of that kind and although i admit that i have not consulted the police it would surprise me if that provision were not seen as an unjustifiably rigid requirement <e> <s> on those grounds the noble lord may be prepared to look at the terms of the amendment again and not press it now <e> <s> i do not think that is an unreasonable request for me to make and he may consider it a sensible course to take <e>", "<cs> my advice on this amendment is that the power of seizure afforded to the police by subsections and of clause applies only to an article which a constable has reasonable grounds for believing to have been used for the commission of an offence <e> <s> it applies therefore only to an article which is believed to be indecent and to have been publicly displayed within the meaning of the bill and in most cases therefore a single item or only an item or two would be seized <e> <s> that is not exactly i think the same as my noble friend lord nugent said but where my noble friend and i certainly meet in giving the same advice to the noble lord lord houghton is in saying that what this certainly does not mean is the sort of situation which i know the noble lord lord houghton <e>", "<cs> it is worth noting that the working party on vagrancy and street offences which reported in recommended that this would be an appropriate maximum penalty <e> <s> i underline my noble friends remarks <e> <s> this is a maximum penalty that we are talking about <e> <s> i speak as a non-lawyer but i apprehend that the courts take the view in these cases that they should be dealt with summarily and custody would not enter into it at all <e> <s> what do you do if somebody continually breaks the law in this way <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord lord mishcon has a view on this matter but i would have thought it was reasonable to have in reserve the maximum penalty which incidentally the working party in recommended as being appropriate <e>", "<cs> it was put to my noble friend lord nugent by the government that it would be highly desirable to do this in the cause of keeping the laws of scotland and england in line on this particular matter they having got out of line for the reason that my noble friend has explained <e> <s> we approached my noble friend and he agreed to put the amendments down <e> <s> they went down a little late the day before yesterday <e> <s> i am afraid that i am entirely to blame for that and not my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure my noble friend that i understand the anxiety which he is expressing but i believe that the commission has all along been trying to devise an acceptable solution as soon as possible <e> <s> delays have arisen through the inability of the interested parties to reach agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it would be helpful for me to say that the point at issue is that the charity commissions approval is needed for the sale of the lease of the house <e> <s> the commission as i understand it has to ensure that the best interests of the charity are served not only financially but in the furtherance of the charitys stated objects <e>", "<cs> my lords the commissioners must ensure that the best interests of the charity are served in financial transactions and their dealings officially i understand would be with the trustees <e> <s> so far as intervention by the government is concerned it is important for me to stress that the powers of my right honourable friend the home secretary under the charities act do not extend to intervening in decisions of the charity commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that it is evident from the replies that i have tried to give that this would be among the functions and responsibilities of the charity commissioners <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree with what my noble friend said <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat that i understand the anxiety which my noble friend is expressing on a matter in which he has a close concern and which is very important <e> <s> i repeat that the charity commission has functions and responsibilities which are clearly set out in the act <e> <s> we must keep in mind that the government have no authority to intervene in individual decisions which are made by the charity commission <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble friend i was shocked and saddened to read about the death of michek francis on th june <e> <s> he was a baby and so far as we know he died as a result of an attack by alsatian dogs <e> <s> there is some doubt whether the dogs in the case were guard dogs <e> <s> however if they were guard dogs and had a licensing system been in operation we could not say for certain that the incident would have been prevented <e> <s> however that does not prevent the thrust of my noble friends question and the answer i have to give him is that to bring in the licensing provisions of the act would impose <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends on how regulations would be drafted under the act <e>", "<cs> my lords the regulations are under section of the wireless telegraphy act to which i referred in my original reply <e> <s> if the noble lord was thinking of wider discussion through debate that would be a matter for the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords i must admit to the noble lord that i am not wholly sure of my answer to that question but i am almost entirely certain and i will certainly write to the noble lord if i am wrong that the regulations are not subject to the affirmative procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords all of us who have spoken so far would agree that whatever the relativities there are causes for concern not least regarding the trends of alcohol consumption at the present time <e> <s> it is for that reason that i am particularly glad that this bill has reached your lordships house and i hope that it will be given a second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of the matters being considered by my right honourable friend the home secretary as part of his review of electoral law and procedures <e> <s> as i am sure my noble friend is well aware it raises issues of principle and indeed practical problems but my right honourable friend hopes to make a statement about these matters before long <e>", "<cs> my lords my original answer said that we felt it right to await the deliberations of the european parliament <e> <s> when they have been completed they will be put forward to the council of ministers <e> <s> i think we must go through the proper procedures although no doubt as in many other things we rely on the good offices of the foreign and commonwealth secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is referring to my right honourable friends hoped-for statement i cannot be any more specific than i was in the first supplementary answer that i gave to my noble friend lord orr-ewing <e>", "<cs> my lords f find it curiouser and curiouser that the noble lord lord kennet should think that the proper consideration which is being given to this and many other matters by the european parliament for recommendations to the council of ministers should be translated into stubborn resistance by the government of this country so far as these particular matters are concerned <e> <s> i believe that the way which i have outlined in my supplementary answers is the right way to go about these important matters and i think it is both fair and constitutional generally <e>", "<cs> that is correct my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am concealing nothing <e> <s> i said quite openly that the government are awaiting the review which the european parliament will bring forward and i have said quite openly that my right honourable friend the home secretary hopes to make a statement about these matters before long <e>", "<cs> my lords no promise has been given that i am aware of <e> <s> what i should just like to repeat to the noble lord is that this important matter raises issues both of principle and of practice <e> <s> that is why i have been at some pains to say that it is being looked at carefully in europe and that my right honourable friend hopes to make a statement about this and other matters before long <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised at the noble lords question <e> <s> the noble lord might be interested to know that this was the first item that was ever considered at the first business committee meeting of the civil defence research committee in may <e> <s> so the home office has had this very serious subject in mind for years <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend <e> <s> i think that the basis of our policy should be a firm commitment to peace while maintaining a firm posture in our military deterrents abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot improve on the question which the noble lord has asked <e> <s> i only hope that the noble lord who asked the original question will have taken note of what the noble lord lord shinwell has said <e>", "<cs> my lords for some years now successive governments have worked on a revision of our nationality law <e> <s> the reason is simply that citizenship of the united kingdom and colonies created by the british nationality act no longer indicates who has the right to enter the united kingdom and live here <e> <s> there are citizens of the united kingdom and colonies who do not have the right of abode in this country and there are people who have the right of abode but who are not our citizens <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to welcome the noble lord lord elystan-morgan <e> <s> as the noble lord is a former minister at the home office i am bound to admit to him that i feel myself to be rather in the position of a conjuror who is welcoming someone who is in fact seeing behind his hand <e> <s> nevertheless my welcome to the noble lord has no reservation <e> <s> he made a most distinguished speech and throughout the rest of the day he has shown that he is a very good listener <e> <s> the house very much enjoyed listening to the noble lord this afternoon and i hope indeed with this bill before us i am sure that he will return to take part in our affairs again very soon <e>", "<cs> my lords that is perfectly true <e> <s> i agree entirely with my noble friend <e> <s> but the reason for the discretion in clause is because the whole purpose of the bill is to ensure that those who are continuing to transmit their citizenship shall retain links with the home country <e> <s> that is the reason why the basis of the entitlement is set out absolutely clearly in clause <e> <s> so far as crown servants are concerned that is a different matter and if for no other reason because we know that crown servants posted abroad will always return to live at home <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may go on now my lords i have answered the noble lord and we can pick this up in committee <e> <s> may i now go on to the citizenship of the british dependent territories <e> <s> i reject entirely any suggestion that it is one of the aims of the bill to put people from the dependencies at a distance from the united kingdom <e> <s> i thought the noble lord lord brockway spoke as though the people of hong kong and the falkland islands were to be british overseas citizens <e> <s> the government have departed in this respect from the green paper of the previous government which would have given everyone connected with the dependencies british overseas citizenship <e> <s> instead the special position of the dependencies is recognised in this bill by the proposal to give them their own distinctive citizenship <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can best deal with the question which the noble lord has asked me as my noble friend lord renton did by reminding your lordships of the view which was put forward by mr alexander lyon a former home office minister in the labour party in another place who took a leading part for the opposition on the bill in committee <e> <s> after hours and hours of discussion on the third reading he said that after the bill is enacted a british citizen will have all the rights all the obligations and all the privileges that now attach to his status as a citizen of the united kingdom and colonies who is patrial <e> <s> after all those hours of consideration mr lyon added that he reckoned that would mean about per cent <e> <s> of the people living in this country <e> <s> he then went on to say of the other per cent <e> <s> who have come here from abroad in recent years or who were born to those who are here from abroad that they will also be british citizens <e> <s> i am suggesting to the noble lord lord mishcon that so far as hearts and minds are concerned in this bill after hours and hours of debate an opponent of the bill delivered himself of that particular judgement <e>", "<cs> my lords the respect and affection which the whole house and not least myself have for the noble lord prevented me from giving the real answer to his question which of course is no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his supplementary question and my answer to the first part of it is a resounding yes <e> <s> the government most certainly agree with the noble lord in his assessment of the importance at all times to this country of civil defence measures <e> <s> the noble lord asked me whether we are in a position to put into effect civil defence measures and i should like to refer him to circular no <e> <s> es / issued at the beginning of this year by the department of my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> a copy of the circular is in the library <e> <s> both the measures that we have taken in the circular and the additional money in government grant that we are making available mean that our posture for civil defence is now very definitely improving <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord clifford of chudleigh talks about stymieing plans for civil defence <e> <s> of course the noble lord knows that the primary responsibility for planning for civil defence rests with county authorities under the civil defence planning regulations <e> <s> the responsibilities range from those relating to the due functioning of public utilities in time of emergency to care for the individual <e> <s> i find it difficult to believe that authorities would simply neglect these duties <e>", "<cs> my lords the government believe that a firm adherence to both peace and adequate defence reduces the anxieties of war <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why in the circular which was issued earlier this year and to which i referred a few moments ago the government made clear that considerable additional funds were being made available so far as they were concerned so that within the next three years expenditure on civil defence could be doubled <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry but the noble baroness has left me not only behind but a long way behind <e> <s> if she would care to explain exactly what her question means i shall answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer that i gave to the noble lord lord shinwell put into many more words what in fact was the effect of the answer <e> <s> the effect of my answer to the noble lord was no <e> <s> but because the question that the noble lord lord shinwell asked was an important one of considerable interest and concern to the house the answer that i gave was elaborated upon but the effect of it was the single word no <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend about the need to make improvements in our civil defence capacity <e> <s> however i think it is fair for me to say that the answer to my noble friends question is contained within the circular to which i have already referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i would wish to comment upon what has been said in the media <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can improve upon what i have just said <e> <s> i shall answer any questions put to me in your lordships house but i would not wish to comment upon what is either said or written in the media <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to both parts of that supplementary is yes we are waiting for a conclusion of the proceedings in the council of europe and we shall then of course need legislative time <e>", "<cs> i think we must wait and see how we go my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add the voice of the government to this <e> <s> i think my noble friend and the honourable member for harrogate in another place are both to be congratulated on the work they have done in steering this bill through both houses <e> <s> i agree with the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones it really is very valuable that these funds have been unlocked and i am sure they will now be put to good use <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall detain your lordships for only one moment for this reason the noble baroness lady gaitskell opened up the point that the formula used in the williams report was really dealing with a much wider ambit than the much narrower scope of this bill <e> <s> that point was taken up with great effect by my noble friend lord nugent and has been referred to other by noble lords including the noble lord lord sainsbury <e> <s> i shall not therefore go over that ground because it would be tedious <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord crawshaw on the way in which he has sponsored the bill in your lordships house and taken it through the house <e> <s> the bill was originally introduced in another place by mr charles morrison and has been introduced into your lordships house by my noble friend and i believe that it will be a very useful measure <e> <s> my noble friend asked me one direct question namely when will more general legislation be on the way <e> <s> it is true that on second reading i stated that the government are aware of the need for more general legislation but i am not today in a position to say when legislative time can be found <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the provisions of section of the countryside act <e> <s> i think that the best way to reply to him is to say that on behalf of the government i have made it my business to find out and i understand that the advisory committee for wales who are acting on behalf of the ncc in this matter has deferred coming to a final decision on the extent of the sssi to allow for further discussions to take place with farmers and other interests <e> <s> i understand that the advisory committee for wales are anxious that all outstanding problems should be resolved by consultation <e> <s> i am sure that this is the right way to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the first supplementary question about the constraints which notification of designation would impose as i understand it notification does not necessarily prevent agricultural and forestry development schemes <e> <s> there is a requirement to consult the ncc if application is made for grant aid for such schemes <e> <s> the response to such consultations would be taken into account in determining any applications for grant <e> <s> it is open to the ncc as i am sure the noble lord will know to negotiate management agreement with an owner or occupier and where such an agreement is reached the council are able to pay compensation <e> <s> but not all improvements will jeopardise the scientific interests in the area and in those circumstances there will not necessarily be a need for a financial contribution <e> <s> nevertheless the second supplementary question stands <e> <s> what about the resources for management agreements <e> <s> i am advised that the ncc are confident that sufficient funds will be available to meet the cost of possible management agreements in the berwyns <e>", "<cs> my lords the statutory duty under section of the national parks and access to the countryside act about notifying the appropriate planning authority of the existence of an sssi falls to the ncc <e> <s> in this case it is the advisory committee for wales who are acting as their agents <e> <s> so when my noble friend asks is it a bit excessive that this substantial area should be considered for notification in this way <e> <s> i think i must answer in that way <e> <s> my noble friend asked about the actual amount of money that there would be for supporting the possibility of management agreements <e> <s> i cannot give my noble friend an answer in cash terms but i should like to remind him that the amount of grant-in-aid to the ncc has remained more or less constant in real terms over the past three years <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise that i do not have the information on the first supplementary question asked by the noble lord <e> <s> so far as the second supplementary question is concerned it is difficult to be precise about the extent of any damage or possible damage because of the very large area we are talking about <e> <s> but of course it is with a view to avoiding this problem that the ncc have considered it necessary to propose to notify the berwyns as a site of special scientific interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i must admit that i was not aware of the detailed question which my noble friend lord digby asks me <e> <s> may i go back to almost the first answer which i endeavoured to give on this question <e> <s> i know that discussions are taking place between the advisory committee for wales and all the interested parties including the farmers and other interests <e> <s> i feel sure that the points which my noble friend has just put to me will be taken into account in those discussions which are continuing <e>", "<cs> my lords as this exchange is revealing there is a problem of balancing different interests in these matters <e> <s> the only way through a problem of this kind is for the body which are finally responsible namely the ncc represented by the advisory committee for wales to go forward by way of discussion and if possible by agreement <e> <s> that is what they are trying to do <e> <s> that is the right way of proceeding <e>", "<cs> my lords the ncc has a statutory duty by virtue of section of the national parks and access to the countryside act to notify the appropriate planning authority of the existence of a site of special scientific interest and the secretary of state has no power to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a serious question which my noble friend is asking and i hope that he will not think that i am being flippant when i say that the only thing that i am absolutely sure about as the result of his question is that it would be wise for us now to stand back a little from this difficult problem and possibly proceed to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give a partial answer to my noble friend in that i am advised that the berwyns contain some per cent <e> <s> of the welsh population of hen harriers and between and per cent <e> <s> of the merlin population <e> <s> this is one example of why it is an important area from a conservation point of view <e> <s> it is a matter of balancing different interests <e> <s> i ought to repeat yet again that this can only satisfactorily be concluded by discussion and i hope finally by agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are fully satisfied with the present system of voting at elections to another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point which my noble friend is making <e> <s> it is fair to say in reply that the particular form of voting which my noble friend has chosen for the subject of his question is one which has been tried in several countries and it now only exists so far as i know in france because it has not been found to be a suitable system in the other countries which tried it <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a question on which perhaps a modest silence is desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble lord has just asked me strengthens my conviction that what we <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that is a matter on which i ought to comment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> before i describe the provisions of the bill i hope it will be for your lordships convenience if i refer briefly to the legislative history of the disqualification of prisoners <e> <s> i wish also to refer briefly to the immediate circumstances in northern ireland which in the governments view have made fresh legislation desirable indeed essential <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an important debate <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon referred to this bill as being an important constitutional measure and i would respond by saying that the government do not lightly withhold the right to be elected to the house of commons from any group of people <e> <s> but i think it is important in the light of the speeches that have been made by your lordships this evening for me to make the point that the question of basic principle here is a basic principle which in the main goes back years and with respect to the noble lord lord blease it is not cutting a new furrow in constitutional history <e> <s> it is important to remember that our predecessors have disqualified from membership of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested to hear the noble lord say that <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord will acquit me of any discourtesy when i say that that was not the impression that i gained from the speeches that i heard this evening <e> <s> until the noble lord made that interesting suggestion i had not heard it made at all <e> <s> the burden of the speeches which have been made in opposition to this bill has been that this is a matter not which is wrong as a matter of timing but one which is wrong as a matter of principle and therefore not unreasonably i come back to asking whether as a matter of principle this bill were not to be put on the statute book would we then put nothing <e> <s> the reality of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am coming to that in just a moment but before doing so i should like to point out that the government have to deal and indeed parliament has to deal with the reality and not with the theory of the situation <e> <s> the reality is that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is most uncharacteristically being a little naive <e> <s> the noble lord realises and i realise that there is a very great deal of difference between someone whoever he may be and whatever his motives putting up for election for another place and someone who is on hunger strike and in prison being used by evilly-disposed people with all the attendant publicity of an election campaign and simply using the campaign for totally other reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall of course look very carefully at what the noble lord says and this is no mere politeness because i do endeavour to do so when the noble lord is speaking of legal points and indeed others <e> <s> although there is little point in raking over ancient history i am advised that the disqualifications under the act were automatic <e> <s> perhaps i may refer the noble lord to the case of alfred lynch in where the disqualification in that case did not require a specific resolution of the house <e> <s> i am advised that that was the case with the act in each case <e> <s> i will look at what the noble lord has said and perhaps the noble lord would care to glance at what i have said in reply <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter which we can take up again at the other stages of the bill <e> <s> i think that it would be wrong if i did not make it clear on behalf of the government that i do not agree about the desirability of the course which the noble lord is putting forward <e> <s> but i think that it would perhaps be tedious if i explained in any detail why that is so <e> <s> my reasons i hope are clear for believing that this as a matter of both practice and principle is a timely bill to bring before your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding the first point that the noble lord put to me about those who do not believe in the need for civil defence the government have taken practical steps <e> <s> we have made increased finance available <e> <s> in publishing the booklet <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with much of what the noble lord says in expressing his concern about these matters <e> <s> but one of the most practical things that the government could do at a time of severe economic cutback was to make available some more money <e> <s> this is precisely what we have done <e> <s> supported by per cent <e> <s> grant we have made it clear that the national civil defence expenditure will be increased by about per cent <e> <s> to million annually by <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the exact date when the circular to which i referred in my original reply on the important activities of volunteers will come out <e> <s> i hope the very fact that the appointment of air marshal sir leslie mayor has been made will indicate to my noble friend who is so closely involved in this work that the air marshal will not as indeed he never has in the past let the grass grow under his feet <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a distinction of course between protection against nuclear blast and protection against nuclear fall-out <e> <s> the important efforts which are being made at the present time both locally and nationally are particularly geared towards trying to improve our protection against nuclear fallout <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not going to improve on what the noble lord has just said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any truth in that particular statement <e>", "<cs> my lords the defence against nuclear war is to be prepared abroad and to be ready and alert at home <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may refer the noble lord lord cledwyn to the circular which was sent out on th march a copy of which is in the library numbered es/ <e> <s> may i add that the important aspect in civil defence is that we do not have a form of inspection <e> <s> what seemed important above all else was therefore to have a good system of co-ordination <e> <s> the obvious appointment seemed to be the man who had until a few months ago been at the head of the home defence college at easingwold near york <e> <s> that is why the appointment of air marshal sir leslie mayor was made <e>", "<cs> my lords it would not be appropriate for the government to comment on this matter while the by-election to which the noble lord refers is in progress <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can quite safely say that i do not know the answer to any of the questions my noble friend has asked <e> <s> my noble friends original question of course did not refer if i may say so to him to two people having the same name it referred to somebody changing his name and doing it by deed poll <e> <s> i think it is important that i should say that i am not aware of a case in which a name has been changed specifically for the purpose of contesting an election <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason i originally said that this was not a matter for the government to comment upon is that if the electorate has been misled in any particular case that would be a matter for the court <e> <s> that is why i really think it is better not to pursue this in any greater depth at the present time <e> <s> however may i just add that as i understand it in the event of there being a genuine difficulty about this because people have the same surnames and christian names there is on the ballot paper also the provision that there should be addresses given <e> <s> although in the final analysis that may not be a very good answer it does mean that some distinction could be indicated to the electors <e>", "<cs> my lords the returning officer as i understand it has no discretion to say that he will not accept the nomination for a candidate if he believes that in some way the candidate is not a suitable candidate in other words is debarred by law <e> <s> as i understand it however and i must write to the noble lord if i am wrong in this there is a discretion so far as the name is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord that probably it would be extremely sensible to look at this matter if there is a point to look at after the election is over but not on a point which is referring to <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says no <e> <s> i say yes <e> <s> my view is and i put this on behalf of the government that it would be wholly wrong for the government to continue to comment on this matter while the election is on <e>", "<cs> my lords one thing i am absolutely certain about is that it is not for the government to say whether they think that one candidate is either adequate or inadequate <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord left me when he crossed the border <e>", "<cs> my lords let us end this by saying let us see how this election goes <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i do not propose to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper today <e> <s> i will table another motion to take account of discussions which are presently being held through the usual channels and upon which i am sure agreement can be reached <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> there is one fundamental point which i should like to make in reply to the noble lord lord jenkins of putney <e> <s> the bill is not concerned with people who are qualified to stand who are in prisons outside the british islands or the republic of ireland <e> <s> the government accept that it would be offensive to public opinion if say a british subject who was in prison in a dictatorial country for let us say political offences lost the civic privilege in this country of standing for parliament <e> <s> such people would not be returned to serve their sentence in this country or in the republic of ireland <e> <s> this bill cannot apply to them <e> <s> that is not the point of the noble lords amendment but i thought it right to make this fundamental point clear at the beginning of the committee stage <e> <s> the persons to whom this bill must apply in all equity are those who are convicted and who serve their sentences either here or in the republic or who are transferred as a matter of routine to british prisons <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> like my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson of ewell i acknowledge on behalf of the government that there is a balance to be weighed in this matter <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon certainly made a strong case in terms of justice and equity to the individual that there is a right that the penalty of disqualification from nomination and election to the house of commons should not be incurred until an appeal within the statutory time limit has been resolved <e> <s> in saying that i am endeavouring to speak to the first of the two amendments with which the noble lord has dealt <e>", "<cs> i am advised that the answer to the noble lords question is that clause only covers criminal contempt <e>", "<cs> certainly i will consider what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i would remind the noble lord of what i ventured to say to the committee on the first of the noble lords two amendments which we have just been discussing <e> <s> if on nomination day for instance a person has been adjudged a bankrupt he is then caught <e> <s> therefore although i realise that i am not comparing like with like the fact that the time factor works in the way the noble lord is putting it i do not think is necessarily as unfair as the noble lord appears to think <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord underhill is of course entitled to ask what has prompted the <e>", "<cs> if i may reply to the noble viscount lord simon i would say that the point that i was seeking to make during my remarks is that under the previous scottish local election rules and i think that by a slip of the tongue i said the present scottish election rules if a person was disqualified a returning officer could have thrown out the nomination <e> <s> it is that point which i believe is on all fours with what is being proposed in the bill at present <e>", "<cs> i do not want to make my speech all over again <e> <s> i itemised the kind of ways in which the person could be disqualified and perhaps the noble viscount would care to glance through <e>", "<cs> on second reading and again this afternoon the noble lord lord underhill has expressed concern that as a result of the changes in the parliamentary election timetable there will be less opportunity for electors to make postal voting applications in that we may now only have a minimum of working days rather than working days notice of a parliamentary general election while in the representation of the people regulations applications for postal votes have to be disregarded by the registration officer if they are received after the twelfth day before the date of the poll <e> <s> may i say in passing that although i am a member of your lordships house i am very much aware working on the opposite <e>", "<cs> i welcome the opportunity to make again a point that i have made before but which i think bears repeating <e> <s> i do not think that the country will believe it to be right this year next year or the year after that a prisoner serving a substantial sentence should be elected to another place because it is then impossible for such a person properly to represent all his constituents including those who did not vote for him <e> <s> the people of the constituency are in effect disenfranchised <e> <s> moreover the candidature of prisoners who have been convicted of serious offences and people who as we have seen in the recent election in northern ireland have no intention or wish to represent anyone in parliament and yet are still able to enjoy all the privileges of candidature really does provoke a feeling of outrage among the public and brings our electoral system into disrepute <e> <s> the government therefore have no hesitation in bringing forward this measure and see no justification for constricting its operation by an arbitrary time limit <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to cross swords with somebody with such experience of this whole subject as the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> but all the bill is doing is imposing on a returning officer a duty to examine a candidates qualification on the one ground alone namely that the candidate is not serving a sentence of imprisonment of more than one year <e> <s> that will be a matter of fact and if the returning officer is clear that the candidate is in prison for more than one year it is on that one ground alone as a matter of fact that the nomination will be rejected <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords it only remains for me to say as the house would expect me to say that both my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson and the noble lord lord mishcon are both right speaking for the different branches of the law <e> <s> i shall not say <e>", "<cs> and this is only the first course my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just add my voice to those of your lordships who have taken part in the other stages of this bill to say that the government believe this to be a thoroughly worthwhile measure <e> <s> the discussions we have had in your lordships house and the welcome it has received from your lordships have served to confirm and strengthen the government in that opinion <e> <s> i should also like to express my appreciation for the skilful manner in which my noble friend lord nugent has piloted the bill through the house <e> <s> i am sure that not only the sponsor of the bill mr sainsbury in another place but the house as a whole is greatly indebted to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that the governor had expressed that view but the situation is this <e> <s> mr odoherty is in the highest security category category a he is not allowed to have a typewriter in his cell as staff resources do not permit adequate supervision at that prison <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> there could be security implications in people using a typewriter unsupervised <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord must pursue his case through the usual channels <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> it has been in force for some time <e> <s> the rule is set out in what is called a circular instruction dated <e> <s> it was circular instruction of and that sets out in detail the interpretation of the rule <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion which is in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords something tells me that the noble lord would like a little amplification <e> <s> the attitude of the noble lord is that in some way the government are looking upon those who would die in the event of a nuclear attack purely as statistics <e> <s> that is not the case <e> <s> the government never make light of the effects of an all-out nuclear attack on this country <e> <s> in that event millions of innocent people would die <e> <s> but that is very far from saying that people cannot be saved by taking precautions and that nothing can be done for the many millions who would survive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord george-brown <e> <s> the objective of civil defence of course is to endeavour to reduce anxiety and to increase our state of preparedness and i must leave it to the judgment of the house as to whether the attitude of the noble lord lord jenkins of putney is liable to achieve either of those objectives <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> it is along those lines that the government have endeavoured to give advice to the general public and i think it was high time that such advice was given <e>", "<cs> my lords nothing would please this country or the government more than if there could be general agreement on disarmament but not unilateral disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me for saying so the premise on which the noble lords question is based is not entirely correct <e> <s> the government have carried out a survey on the possibilities of designs for domestic shelters and have made those available to the public in order to try to combat the effects of fall-out to which my noble friend lord renton drew attention <e> <s> but may i make it clear that there is no question at this stage of recommending householders to acquire nuclear shelters of <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank both noble lords for their reply to the statement <e> <s> i thank the noble lord lord boston for his clear condemnation of the violence <e> <s> i suggest that we must wait and study carefully the detailed accounts which will come from both the commissioner of the metropolitan police and the chief constable of merseyside so far as looking <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the governments support for the work of the police the most direct answer that i can give to my noble friend is to say that my right honourable friend the home secretary was with and was talking to the chief constable of merseyside at a quite early hour this morning and a little later he was with the commissioner of the metropolitan police <e> <s> i believe that those two senior officers were as glad to be talking to my right honourable friend about these really appalling occurrences over the week-end as he was to be talking to them <e> <s> i believe they feel that my right honourable friend supports the work that they are doing <e> <s> of course my right honourable friend for his part is deeply appreciative of the difficult work that the police do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord george-brown for the two points that he has put to me <e> <s> on the first point about what i think i would call needs must i would not wish to add anything to what the noble lord has said <e> <s> with regard to the second point that he raised of course on behalf of my right honourable friend the home secretary i would be ready to discuss with the noble lord and any other noble lords who might so wish this point or any other point connected with policing <e> <s> my right honourable friend appointed this working group on protective clothing and equipment for the police following the serious disorders at brixton last april and certainly that group is going to take account of the urgent new dimension which has been presented over the weekend <e> <s> but may i repeat to the noble lord that even before the work of that working group is finished the decisions which my right honourable friend has taken so far as helmets and flame-resistant clothing are concerned will go ahead with all possible speed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is absolutely right to voice his concern but at the same time i do not think either the noble lord or the house would wish to leap to conclusions <e> <s> the government concerned as the noble lord is at the high level of ethnic minority unemployment believe that the best single thing that they can do for the minorities is to control inflation and try to create real jobs and to see that in that way unemployment will fall <e> <s> meanwhile may i remind the noble lord of what i ventured to say to the noble lord lord boston that at the moment massive funds are being injected into merseyside <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the important point which the noble lord has raised is of course forming a major part of the inquiry that my right honourable friend the home secretary set up into racialist attacks and of course that inquiry includes racialist attacks which have occurred in london <e> <s> but i cannot let the noble lords question pass without making the point with which i think the whole house will be familiar that it may sometimes seem as though the police are not able to prevent attacks when in fact it is the duty of the police through the oath which they take when they take up their police duties to discharge those duties without fear or favour <e> <s> in other words the police service is often left standing in the middle <e> <s> this is what makes their job so exceptionally difficult and i ask the noble lord as i know he will to bear this in mind <e>", "<cs> of course my lords most of the ethnic minority community in liverpool come from families which have lived in that city for some generations <e> <s> they are british citizens by birth and there can be no question of their repatriation <e> <s> but the more general suggestion which my noble friend makes for repatriation of members of ethnic minorities is not a part of the policy of her majestys government <e> <s> having said that i agree with my noble friend on one <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the general point that the noble lord has made is concerned that is part of the inquiry into racist attacks which is going on at the moment <e> <s> so far as concerns the specific point that the noble lord makes about the incident which started the trouble in southall at the beginning of the weekend i think we should await the report of the commissioner of the metropolitan police <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be helpful if i said a fairly brief word on behalf of the government at this stage of what appears to be a quite lengthy debate <e> <s> first the effect of the amendment and of the amendments which hang with it would be to remove from the bill the governments proposal that in future a child born in this country should be a british citizen if one of the parents either the father or the mother because this is a bill which for the first time in the law of this country will if parliament passes it bring equality of the sexes into our nationality arrangements is a british citizen or is settled here <e>", "<cs> of course <e>", "<cs> it is absolutely true that of course the previous government never got as far as actually turning its discussions and its intentions into policy and into action but it is quite clear from the preface to the previous governments green paper and from the words which are used when it says that the main ideas canvassed in this document are summarised below that the things which were said in the discussion paper were included because the government of the day felt that they were worth consideration <e> <s> some of the things which were considered in paragraph of that green paper were warnings of what could happen if indiscriminately citizenship was conferred upon people who were either in transit with the mother it may be <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the right reverend prelate the bishop of rochester would want to draw this debate to a close and because i have already spoken i beg leave to comment briefly on one or two of the points which have been made <e> <s> the first point i should like to make arises from the speech which has just been made by the noble lord lord pitt <e> <s> the noble lord was putting forward the case very ably and in some detail that as a matter of principle the move away from <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness will let me progress a little further maybe i can give her more satisfaction in this matter <e> <s> what i would say absolutely openly to the noble baroness is that there will of course be a difference in the application for a passport <e> <s> until now a birth certificate and a certificate alone showing birth in the united kingdom has been given although of course the application has had to be countersigned as many of your lordships will know probably from having countersigned passport applications <e> <s> in the future the application form could be perfectly simply designed so that the parent would give details of his or her own claim to british citizenship or to settled status in the united kingdom because we are talking about alternatives to the satisfaction of the counter-signatory and then of course to the satisfaction of the foreign office <e>", "<cs> no i am afraid i cannot <e> <s> i do not have those figures with me <e> <s> i have an extremely long note on the case of <e>", "<cs> this is indeed not a very easy problem and i hope i can add to what has been said <e> <s> i am genuinely grateful not only to the noble lord lord aylestone who moved the amendment but also to lord avebury who is conversant with these matters and to the noble and learned lord and my noble friend who have spoken on this amendment <e> <s> incidentally if the argument is circular it has not got such a bad pedigree <e> <s> i think one of the few pieces of legislation which i am capable of remembering is that if i remember rightly the definition of charitable purposes in the charities act is <e>", "<cs> may i say that i owe my noble friend lord drumalbyn an apology <e> <s> i am looking also at amendment no <e> <s> in the name of my noble friend <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> has a similarity with amendment no <e> <s> in the name of my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> i feel sure that my noble friend will be moving that amendment therefore probably my noble friend lord drumalbyn will have two bites of the cherry <e> <s> while on my feet and subject to any correction may i say that i feel that the definition of settled has two limbs to it <e> <s> the first limb is being ordinarily resident and the second limb which goes with it is being not subject under the immigration laws to any restriction on the period for which the person may remain <e>", "<cs> i do not think that at this stage i can add to what i have said <e> <s> the question which my noble friend lord hylton has asked has been answered by the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> the only thing that i would add is that i sought to explain why in the governments view we cannot change horses in midstream <e> <s> we have got the definition of settled in the immigration act <e> <s> it is that definition which has been reproduced in clause of this bill <e> <s> that is the reason why we have gone about it in that way <e> <s> of course i will look carefully at what has been said in this debate but that is not the same as saying that i am looking at it with a view to making a change <e> <s> i will seriously look at it and ask members of the home office to look at what has been said because this is important <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord aylestone will not mind my saying that the one thing that i am certain about is that with respect i do not think this amendment is right <e> <s> this amendment removes what is certain in the definition of settled and leaves us with the greyer area <e> <s> that would not be something that the committee would want to do <e>", "<cs> we began this amendment with a requirement that the insertion should be made in clause page line that settled is as defined in section <e> <s> if i may address myself to that first this is really the effect of both lord rentons and lord drumalbyns amendments <e> <s> the difficulty is that the term settled appears in the bill many times <e> <s> it is not only used here in clause <e> <s> it appears again both later on in this clause and in other clauses of the bill <e> <s> every time that it appears it has the same meaning and it is this meaning that is set out in clause <e> <s> but it seems to us that this identity of meaning might <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i certainly give an undertaking that i shall make it my business to consult the parliamentary draftsman and i think this is a point on which i should get in touch with both my noble friends <e>", "<cs> this amendment would give anyone born here after the commencement of the bill who did not become a british citizen at birth an unqualified entitlement to british citizenship and the right of abode in this country an entitlement which he or she could exercise at any time <e> <s> this amendment would restore a form of <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord avebury on one point <e> <s> the noble lord put with absolute clarity for the benefit of the committee the people whom we are actually talking about in this subsection <e> <s> if i may in a few words repeat what the noble lord said we are talking about people who have still got conditions on their stay or they may be illegal entrants or they may be overstayers <e> <s> therefore we are not talking about people who have been able to claim citizenship for a child because one of the parents is a citizen under clause or can say quite definitely that they are settled under clause or who have become citizens or become settled since the children began to grow up under clause <e> <s> we are not talking about those people at all <e> <s> we are talking about the people the noble lord has identified <e>", "<cs> i will correct myself before many minutes have passed if i am wrong but my understanding is that the answer to my noble friend is yes because the person concerned will be a british citizen and with british citizenship goes the right of abode <e>", "<cs> it may not entirely surprise the committee that with unerring accuracy i have <e>", "<cs> the permitted absence specified in subsection is as we all know days in each year since the date of birth <e> <s> taking that as a base line i think it is a reasonable provision <e> <s> earlier this evening i ventured to give reasons as to why the government felt that the -year period was reasonable but if your lordships will bear with me for one minute i will explain why i think the -day period is reasonable <e> <s> i repeat we are talking about people who have not been able to go through the ordinary avenues of citizenship from their parents or citizenship from settlement or because their parents have become citizens or have become settled after the children have been born <e> <s> therefore these are difficult cases <e> <s> i think there is a very strong case for saying that they should therefore show that they really are intending to live in this country and in cases where they want to be abroad for longer it does not seem unreasonable that there should be a requirement that such a child should eventually apply for naturalisation or if a minor for registration under the secretary of states discretionary power to register any minor under clause <e>", "<cs> my lords the connection is that under article of the treaty the european parliament is charged with drawing up proposals for elections in accordance with a uniform procedure in all member states and this has been interpreted we know by the political affairs group of the european parliament as relating to the extent of the franchise <e> <s> however i entirely agree with my noble friend that this is a most important matter and something on which the government should keep an eye so far as both the principle and the timing are concerned <e> <s> may i add that so far as the extent of the franchise for westminster parliament elections is concerned this matter has been thoroughly examined in the context of the governments recent review of electoral law and procedures <e> <s> my right honourable friend the home secretary hopes to make an announcement about that examination to parliament shortly <e> <s> a system which enables people abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord lord stewart but unfortunately the previous government representing the party of which the noble lord is a distinguished member thought otherwise <e> <s> when in my honourable friend mr douglas hurd moved an amendment which would have gone at any rate a long way towards the objective which the noble lord is putting to me it was defeated by the previous government <e> <s> when the present government came into office we found that we were stuck if i may put it that way with a serious review which is being carried out by the european parliament and it does now seem that we must await the outcome of that review <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that there are questions of both principle and practice which will have to be considered very carefully by parliament in regard to these matters <e> <s> so far as a speakers conference is concerned i think that is a matter for another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the other countries to which my noble friend has drawn attention may very well find that the arrangements which they have set up ahead of the review of the european parliament will have to be changed when the european parliament brings out its report which of course will require a uniform system <e> <s> that is why we think it best to wait <e> <s> i had hoped that my noble friend might consider the <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lords party was in government it did not even keep an eye on it <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the position of the report in europe i understand that the draft report on a uniform procedure for european elections is now before the political affairs group of the european parliament <e> <s> that situation has been the case for longer than many people would wish in fact it has been the case since <e> <s> the report will then have to go to the parliament and then to the council of ministers <e> <s> on the second point which the noble lord put to me yes of course i think that the understanding of all of us is that this report will deal with the method of election <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend that tribute should most certainly be paid particularly in this the th year of the start of the special constabulary to the work that the special constables do <e> <s> my noble friend is right <e> <s> numbers have declined over the last five years <e> <s> a significant factor in this has been that the report of the working party on the special constabulary included a recommendation that the retirement age should be reduced to with an option of five years more service at the chief constables discretion in any particular force <e> <s> we have found that although it is true that numbers have very much gone down the number of hours of duty performed by many special constables has increased <e> <s> finally yes in most forces <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for adding his voice in tribute to the work of the special constabulary at the present time <e> <s> one cannot stress too often the importance of the work that they do <e> <s> it also cannot now be said too often that i believe that relations between the regular police force and the special constabulary are very much better than they were before and there is recognition on both sides of the important work that they can do both pulling in the same direction in trying to see that the policing of their area is as good as is possible <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so to the noble lord the suggestion which the noble lord has made and an increase in the size of the special constabulary are both important matters <e> <s> they are both things to which attention needs to be given <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord did hear correctly with an option at the discretion of the chief constable for retirement at the age of <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would await the report to the police advisory board next week of this up-to-date report on the special constabulary <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for his welcome to the bill but i should make clear the governments view even if it does not accord with the view put forward by him namely that the offence in clause is narrowly drawn so far as the act itself and the criminal intent is concerned <e> <s> it was for those reasons that i was a little concerned to hear the noble lord talk about the vagueness of the offence <e> <s> we hoped there might be agreement that this is an offence which is reasonably narrowly drawn <e> <s> however i am grateful to the noble lord for his welcome that sus as it has been known has now by this bill been abolished a welcome to which the noble lord lord avebury added his voice <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be convenient to the committee if i were to say a few words at this stage after which other noble lords can speak and then my noble and learned friend the lord advocate will probably answer the debate <e> <s> first i owe an apology to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> the words that my noble friend read out from the report of the second reading debate are of course perfectly correct i said what is attributed to me in <e>", "<cs> it is not met maybe in the way that the noble lord lord beloff thought but it is met by clause which specifically goes out of its way to say that if one and the noble lord has given the example takes a chair in a foreign country and then comes back with a family to take an academic chair here the children will then be citizens and they will be citizens incidentally by birth <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness would like to repeat her question it would be helpful <e> <s> it was very difficult to pick it up <e>", "<cs> i think that the answer to that question is no but i must take advice on that <e>", "<cs> this is a very important point which is going to be the subject of two or three different amendments <e> <s> i think that i am going to have the rather doubtful pleasure of replying to them when we come to them <e> <s> it is not the subject of the present amendment <e> <s> we are going to be in danger of finding ourselves debating the whole of clause before we have even arrived at it <e> <s> i am not slipping the question as i say i think that i am due to reply on this particularly important point <e> <s> we must wait until the right moment for that <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord spens has made it clear that he disapproves of the principle of clause <e> <s> i have to say that we are doubtful whether an intention to maintain a close connection is by itself an objective criterion sufficient to justify the conferring of citizenship because that is what the noble lord lord spens wishes to do in his amendment <e> <s> this is particularly so where genuine though the intention to maintain a close connection with this country may be the intention is not at that particular moment being put into effect <e> <s> the explorer whom the noble lord had in mind may be on the other side of the world and may have been there for years and years <e> <s> the author may be on the other side of the world and may never have any intention of ever coming back again <e> <s> let us recall that the people whom we are talking about in clause are not those who have been born in this country they will have no problem over transmitting their citizenship immediately to their children <e> <s> we are talking about those whose parents were born overseas and now we are concerned about the children who were born overseas <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord elystan-morgan asked me whether the expression close connection had been used before in legislation <e> <s> the answer which i have for the noble lord is that it is used in section <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i am going to make a golden rule throughout this bill i shall not answer any specific cases at all whoever <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> it is perfectly fair for the noble lord to chide me with that <e> <s> the question of approaching the home office it will be the home office to find out in advance is quite an understandable question <e> <s> i hope the noble lord also will understand when i say that obviously all the practicalities have not been worked out but at the same time it would be wholly unreasonable if i did not say on behalf of the government that people will want to clear their lines before they go abroad and obviously we shall have to think carefully about the firm guidance which can be given to people when they apply to find out <e> <s> i do not think at this moment i can go further <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether we are in the last hour or hours of discussion on the bill as my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls suggests but i wish to impress on him that if we are talking about self-employment then that is taking the discussion rather further than that with which my noble and learned friend the lord advocate was dealing it is a very important matter and we shall come to it later particularly on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> the basic purpose of this amendment is to add an entitlement to pass on citizenship for british citizens in an occupation which the secretary of state is satisfied is of benefit to the united kingdom and i am grateful to the noble lord for putting the point so succinctly <e> <s> i genuinely sympathise with the noble lords brief argument because for the first time on this clause this raises the claims of the self-employed and indeed i think it could be argued the claims of partners in overseas firms <e> <s> it is possible that a way through the difficulties may be found so far as partners in overseas firms are concerned but these are for amendments which will come later and we must wait to debate those in a few minutes <e> <s> the fact is that self-employed persons are a little different <e> <s> they are of course wholly independent of employers and it is their own choice which takes them overseas <e>", "<cs> all i would add if i may before the noble lord lord spens decides on his amendment is what i think i said to my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls on a previous amendment <e> <s> there is a double responsibility here <e> <s> of course as my noble and learned friend the lord advocate has said we are listening extremely carefully to what is being said on clauses and we have no option but to do so and this exactly shows the importance of your lordships house and committee <e> <s> but having said that i think there is a responsibility upon noble lords if i may say so with respect to try also to think how their wording might be refined so that it would be possible to put it into legislation <e> <s> this particular attempt by the noble lord lord spens although i say for the second time it has my sympathy i really do not think will do <e> <s> it raises a criterion which i do not think could possibly stand up as it is worded in this particular amendment without causing doubt and anomalies all along the line <e> <s> it is for that practical reason that i am resisting this particular amendment <e>", "<cs> the reason why my noble friend lady trumpington has had to wait for so many days for an answer to the very perceptive question which she asked on second reading is because the question is such a difficult one to answer <e> <s> it is demonstrated by not only the amendment which we are actually considering amendment no <e> <s> but also amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> they approach the matter from completely different directions <e> <s> my noble friend lord geddes simply says that self-employment will do <e> <s> i am sure my noble friend moved the amendment in order to give us a good chance to thresh this question out <e>", "<cs> i think it is important that i should add that there are in clause avenues into citizenship for people who have not been able to meet the relevant employment criteria <e> <s> one of those avenues has been mentioned this evening <e> <s> it is in clause where people return to the united kingdom and where by right by birth the children have citizenship conferred upon them <e> <s> there is the other very familiar provision in clause which is a repeat of the provision for the discretionary registration by the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i must be a little more downright on this amendment <e> <s> i am surprised at the enthusiasm with which my noble friend moved it <e> <s> we have discussed at great length whether employment should be the criterion in clause <e> <s> but if one is not going to have a cross-reference with the criterion of a close connection with the united kingdom it seems to me that then one is accepting the situation which this country is stuck with today that citizenship however proudly held it may be is none the less held by people who have either never had a connection with this country or who have lost connection with it <e> <s> so that special barriers have had to be put up by governments of different political parties to prevent those people from being allowed to enter the united kingdom <e> <s> the whole idea which is most certainly workable that citizenship should be tied to an absolute right to enter and live in the united kingdom must surely be underpinned by a cross-reference to the criterion <e> <s> the government believe that relevant employment should be part of that cross-reference <e> <s> we also believe that a connection with the united kingdom should be another part of it <e>", "<cs> it is important that the effect of clause <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the responsibility of the government in this country to see that the agencies of law and order can do their work effectively and i certainly join with my noble friend in his wish to see that their work is done as effectively as possible <e> <s> i think it is fair for me to claim that my right honourable friend the home secretary has shown very effectively that the necessary equipment is being made available to the police for them to deal with those who are rioting and looting and as your lordships will have read in the newspapers the courts are dealing with cases arising from recent violence effectively and swiftly <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first part of that supplementary question is that i do not think anyone could get better value for money than they get out of my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> as for the second part it might be of interest to the house to know that we now have more policemen in this country than we had in may <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord the government have not been lacking here <e> <s> the whole basis of the answer to my noble friend lord massereene and ferrard is as the noble lord with his long experience will know much better than i do that in this country the police cannot be directed for good reasons of democracy and freedom in what they do it is the chief constables who are responsible for their operations <e> <s> and the courts cannot be directed by any member of the government in what they decide <e> <s> however where i absolutely take the noble lords point is that it is up to the government to see that matters work and i would add to the information i have already given that one of the valuable things which my noble friend has set in train is a co-ordinating system which is based here in london so that different forces around the country can decide where and how police should be moved between police forces <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for that supplementary my lords and his comments at the end of it were of the greatest importance <e> <s> my noble friend may have noticed from todays newspapers that the courts are dealing swiftly and i am sure effectively with the very serious troubles which have been occurring in the last days <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i said that the police forces taken nationally have increased by men and women since may of <e> <s> may i point out that the increase had begun before the time of the general election and resulted in the edmund-davies inquiry set up by mr merlyn rees <e> <s> so that there is no misunderstanding i would add that that has brought more or less all the police forces throughout the land up to establishment except the metropolitan police which is still below establishment but is recruiting month by month <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend refers to very serious matters which have been of great concern throughout the s <e> <s> however i would point out that i did refer to the action taken by mr merlyn rees under the previous government and i do not detract from one word of what i said with reference to the right honourable gentleman <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend on the woolsack is the most law-abiding noble lord in the country <e> <s> both my noble and learned friend and the noble lord lord blyton would surely see the force of the fact that there are now more men and women in the police forces throughout the land than there were two years ago <e> <s> this is of vital importance at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i shall reply to both the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and the noble lord lord hooson who in essence both said the same thing in the sense that the noble and learned lord spoke of a new dimension in the english scene and the noble lord lord hooson spoke of those who wished to promote violence wanting to see an escalation of response <e> <s> the reply i give to both noble lords is that the decisions which have been made about equipment are precisely directed to promoting public confidence in the ability of the police to deal with a wave of violence of a new intensity and the fact that the police must have equipment available to them to use as a last resort will i give an assurance to both noble lords in no way reduce police efforts to enhance day by day ordinary contact between the police and the public on which we all know the real value of policing in this country depends <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord donaldson will allow me i do not know to what statement my noble friend lord inglewood was referring at the beginning of his supplementary question <e> <s> i am not aware of any weak statement which has been made as a result of these very serious matters which started to occur nine days ago <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and i am grateful to the noble lord for putting those points to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord shinwell and indeed i think my right honourable friends thinking is exactly the same as the noble lords thinking upon this <e>", "<cs> well i have mistaken what the noble lord said <e> <s> i understood the burden of the noble lords remarks to be that if those who are rioting are availing themselves of weapons of various kinds is it not then important that the police should be equipped to be protected <e> <s> i understand from the noble lord lord shinwell that that is what he said and therefore my right honourable friends thinking is exactly the same as lord shinwells on that particular matter <e> <s> but it goes one step further indeed two steps further <e> <s> if the police are properly protected they can take positive action to end the riots which are causing such misery to law-abiding people <e> <s> from that comes the further point that once that has been achieved we may be able to get back to the close connection between the police and the community upon which i repeat so much depends in this country for good policing <e>", "<cs> my lords again i would not wish to add to what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> my lords again i would not wish to add anything to what my noble friend said at the end of his supplementary question <e> <s> so far as his initial remarks are concerned i think what he said will be much appreciated by the police <e>", "<cs> my lords this of course was a statement requested by the right honourable gentleman the leader of the opposition and the right honourable gentleman the member for sparkbrook and it was to be on equipment paving the way for the debate in another place tomorrow <e> <s> that is why the statement does not go into the causes <e> <s> but i repeat i hope the noble lord and the government can meet on common ground about this that however worrying the causes may be nothing but nothing can excuse or in any way condone the appalling violence we have seen in the last nine or days <e>", "<cs> my lords at the very end of the statement there are the words i shall be talking meaning my right honourable friend will be talking to chief officers about the circumstances in which such authorisation should be given and that authorition referred to plastic bullets and the use of cs gas <e> <s> i know that the words of the noble lord lord hunt will be taken into account in any discussions which my right honourable friend will have <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there is no disagreement between the government and the noble lord lord pargiter on this matter <e> <s> the noble lord has put in very clear terms what i have referred to as positive police action in these very difficult circumstances <e> <s> so far as other pieces of equipment are concerned what the statement is saying is that these should be available but only used as a last resort <e> <s> that was the intention and the only intention <e>", "<cs> i was disappointed to hear that my noble friend felt that the noble and learned lord advocate and i had not given enough heed to amendments which have been moved on the two previous sittings in the committee stage of this bill in your lordships house <e> <s> i consider that we listened closely and we showed that we had done so by accepting an important amendment which was moved by my noble friend lady trumpington to clause <e> <s> then there was almost the last amendment to be moved at our previous sitting which was also moved by my noble friend the lord geddes <e> <s> i should have thought my noble friend would have noticed that the very next amendment which is in my name is in response to opinions expressed in another place by the honourable member for uxbridge mr michael shersby <e> <s> furthermore i feel sure that before long this afternoon my noble and learned friend the lord advocate will also be demonstrating that we have indeed taken seriously other amendments in the names of my noble friends lord drumalbyn and lady elles and indeed my noble friend lord geddes himself <e>", "<cs> i will if i may confine my remarks to the effect of the amendment which is to delete the words full-time from the text when talking about relevant employment <e>", "<cs> although many of the remarks which have been made in this short debate have been informative they have gone a little wide of the amendment <e> <s> my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter expressed the hope that i would not find him offensive <e> <s> of course not <e> <s> however i do find my noble friend uncharacteristically somewhat inconsistent on this occasion if he will forgive me for saying so <e> <s> i say that because my noble friend with his characteristic ability has in previous debates on the bill expressed some criticism of the need for the secretary of state to have so much discretion in the bill which my noble friend has said is bound in the circumstances of today to be in fact the discretion of officials of the home office who of course in certain cases will give advice to the home secretary <e> <s> the inconsistency which i feel is there on this occasion is that if this amendment were to be accepted and my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter would support him then i think there would be endless arguments about what constitutes relevant employment <e> <s> there would be an increase of discretion and incidentally an enormous increase in the amount of time which is taken to decide particular cases <e>", "<cs> very well the government will certainly look at the remarks made by my noble friend and the noble baroness in that light <e> <s> indeed we shall look carefully at what has been said by many of your lordships first by my noble friend lord drumalbyn about the position of people who are doing valuable jobs often very valuable jobs but the very nature of their job means that it is not defined as full-time <e>", "<cs> there was a reason why i used that particular argument and it was not a reason i had to resort to because i could think of nowhere else to resort <e> <s> it was because we are talking in clause about an entitlement and i genuinely think that there is some difficulty here when my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls talks about going wholly towards the secretary of states discretion <e> <s> in considering the value of an amendment of this kind i would ask the committee to consider that one has to decide first of all do we really want to abandon what is meant to be and indeed is written into the text as an entitlement or do we want to foresake that and go wholly to a matter of discretion <e> <s> it is that which the government will go on considering in the light of what has been said but i hope that i have been able to point out some of the problems inherent in this amendment <e>", "<cs> the answer to the noble lord is no <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> so far as the point made by the noble lord lord avebury is concerned i endeavoured on the last sitting of the committee to point out the reasons why the government felt that it was necessary to have what i called a cross reference between relevant employment and having a close connection with the united kingdom <e> <s> i think that it would be tedious if i were to go over that ground again <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his clear explanation of this detailed and interesting amendment <e> <s> i think that it raises problems and i should like to respond by trying to point out some of the problems as the government see them <e> <s> the normal avenue to british citizenship for an adult under the bill is through naturalisation unless the person concerned holds citizenship of the british dependent territories or british overseas citizenship or is a british subject under the bill or a british protected person and then there is the entitlement to citizenship under clause which we shall come to shortly <e> <s> an adult should be considered in his own right and upon the strength of his own connections with the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> when my noble friend felt the government have a fixation about tying an entitlement to british citizenship by descent to employment in british firms this is not borne out if one reads clause <e> <s> the whole point of widening the scope of clause was that it would give an infinitely wider scope than that particular interpretation which is the impression which my noble friend had <e>", "<cs> i was more downright i was saying the people that my noble friend wishes to deal with in the amendment who will be adult should become british citizens by naturalisation <e> <s> that is the way which is favoured under the bill <e> <s> i am not trying to avoid replying to the question but we are going to come to these matters on clause and schedule <e> <s> this will arise again and again <e> <s> to suggest in some way that naturalisation cannot be an avenue to citizenship because of rules about entry is to suggest that nobody can ever become naturalised <e> <s> that is not the case <e> <s> the avenue for naturalisation is going to be there for people who are able to enter the country under the immigration rules and fulfil the requirements for character language and residence <e> <s> therefore it is perfectly reasonable for me to suggest that the people who my noble friend lord drumalbyn has in mind should have because they will be adults and not minors the avenue of naturalisation under the bill <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to enable a child to be registered if he or she is born overseas to a british citizen by descent and later comes to this country with one of the parents to live <e> <s> subsection as it stands at present requires the child before he can acquire an entitlement to be registered to come to the united kingdom and live with both parents unless for reasons which are set out in subsection he is effectively part of a one-parent family <e>", "<cs> since i have been guilty of not replying to two questions perhaps i may answer now <e> <s> the definition of terminated is of course a legal termination and no other definition applies <e> <s> a legal termination is what is meant by the word terminated in this subsection in the context of this bill <e> <s> with regard to the question asked by my noble friend lady vickers in a situation involving a common law wife the child would benefit from the mothers citizenship but not from the fathers citizenship <e> <s> i believe the difficulty which the government see is that each case would probably be different and would have to be the subject of value judgments <e> <s> in making his remarks the noble lord lord avebury made a series of value judgments <e> <s> the noble lord is absolutely at liberty to make those judgments but even if one were to agree with all that was said by the noble lord and i do not know that i did it would be very difficult to write those value judgments into the statute <e> <s> that is why i personally believe that these are cases which should be dealt with under the general discretion of clause <e> <s> whether that is also the view held by my noble friend lady elles i do not know but i think the moment has come to find out <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord geddes for putting down this amendment because i think it is important that we should have a short discussion about this expression which lies really at the heart of clause although i think the dangers of trying to be specific have already been demonstrated by the short exchange which has occurred between the noble lord lord mishcon and my noble friend lady elles <e>", "<cs> i believe that if i were to set out at length anything more on this amendment many of my noble friends and many noble lords opposite would go into a decline <e> <s> i must just point out to the noble lord lord avebury that he has not quite <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can answer that off the cuff <e> <s> we are of course talking about employment <e> <s> if the noble baroness was referring to the nature of the persons intention then this matter is one that would have to be looked at in view of all the circumstances of the case <e>", "<cs> yes indeed and therefore what the noble baroness has said would need to be looked at in all the circumstances of the particular case <e>", "<cs> as that is a waiver that has been put in by the government i think that i should try to reply to lord massereenes question but if he will forgive me in a moment <e>", "<cs> i do not want to disappoint the noble baroness who has moved her two amendments in a very moderate and interesting way but there would be no question of the government coming back with another amendment in reply to these <e> <s> i say that for these reasons <e> <s> the first is the previous governments green paper on this difficult subject and i acknowledge that it is a difficult subject the question of what <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> what i do not think has become entirely evident from the short debate on this although i think your lordships are well aware of it is that this is a new provision which is being put into the bill and if parliament accepts it it would enable the secretary of state to waive the language requirement on the two grounds of age and physical infirmity <e>", "<cs> this contrary to what the noble baroness has just said is not absurd <e> <s> we are living through a time when it is in the forefront of all our minds that it is a bad day for this country if people are cut off one from another <e> <s> maybe who knows <e> <s> a great deal of the troubles we have in the country arise because we do not in one way or another communicate <e> <s> one of the barriers only one to communication is simply language and i really do think that to encourage people to take up citizenship in this country when they have great difficulty in communicating with others and as the noble baronesss own governments green paper expressly pointed out would not be able to take up their civic rights would be a disservice <e> <s> the thing to do is to try to encourage people to have a command of the language before the conferment of citizenship <e> <s> i do not think that is unreasonable <e>", "<cs> this is a fair point and indeed it is one that has already been raised in the debate this evening <e> <s> i know that the government would be prepared to look at the matter <e> <s> i do have to say that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot give my noble friend the number of police who are seconded to interpol <e> <s> within the limits of its constitution which of course strictly prohibits any activity of a political character being undertaken interpol plays a valuable part in the international arrangements to counter criminal offences connected with terrorism and i should like to make it absolutely clear to my noble friend that her majestys government strongly support the work of interpol <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that particular television programme and if it did take the line that my noble friend says then i should certainly want to take this opportunity to rebut it <e>", "<cs> again my lords i shall certainly look into what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> i think it is important though that we bear in mind that one of the benefits of the european community is the regular meetings which take place among the european community governments so far as terrorist matters are concerned <e>", "<cs> again my lords i have not had the advantage of seeing todays <e>", "<cs> my lords the greatest importance is attached to standards and training <e> <s> the service has well-established schemes of quality assurance <e> <s> it has its own training unit where to date several hundred scientists have been trained in basic principles and instrument use <e> <s> the units programmes are kept under review <e> <s> emphasis is given to the development of new methods and techniques to improve the operational skills of the forensic scientists in regional laboratories <e> <s> to this end the services central research establishment regularly conduct colloquia and specialised training projects <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the second point my noble friend put to me i cannot answer but i will certainly write to him <e> <s> so far as concerns the first point that my noble friend put of course in view of the increase in crime in recent years the work of the forensic science service is of the greatest importance <e>", "<cs> my lords the likely effect of the recommendations of the royal commission on relations between the police and the communities whom the police serve will be an important factor in our consideration of the royal commissions report <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned urgency in his supplementary question <e> <s> perhaps it would be helpful if i made it clear that i think i am right in saying that my right honourable friends written answer to a question today will make it clear that we would be hoping for replies in the light of the memorandum by the beginning of october <e> <s> if my right honourable friends written answer does not make that clear i am saying it now <e>", "<cs> my lords the government would welcome a debate if time could be found for it through the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords anything which emerges from the inquiry of the noble and learned lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i did make the point to the noble lord lord evans of claughton that the government would be hoping for responses to the memorandum by the beginning of october <e> <s> the memorandum will not be just a general document <e> <s> its intention is to try to focus the attention of different interested groups who have already expressed their interest in different parts of the royal commissions report on what my right honourable friend considers are some of the particularly important and difficult parts of the report <e> <s> therefore we are following a timetable <e> <s> having said that the noble and learned lord mentioned in particular tape-recording <e> <s> there would be difficulties about considering tape-recording separately from other parts of the report <e> <s> the implications for the dispatch of court business for resources generally and for the safeguards afforded to suspects will however be factors influencing the governments consideration of this and of the other proposals contained in the report <e>", "<cs> my lords ahead of final decisions which have been taken the noble lord will not expect me to be specific <e> <s> but the report is called <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones has referred to this as being an important <e>", "<cs> i was venturing to suggest that the argument about the european community is an argument against the amendment and for the clause <e> <s> the clause endeavours to encourage people by giving them another five years none the less to get on and register as citizens if they have the entitlement <e> <s> subject of course to our negotiations with the european community when the bill has gone through we can be pretty well sure that it will give such people the entitlement to move around in europe as they want <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter speaks it might be for the convenience of the committee if i make it clear that what the government wish to do on amendment no <e> <s> a in the name of the noble lord lord pitt is to try to meet that amendment <e> <s> but before i can meet it i must obviously hear the speech of the noble lord lord pitt <e> <s> that is why i felt that as that is a self-contained subject a most important one on children it would probably be for the convenience of the committee if we waited to debate it then <e> <s> i must be absolutely straight about this the effect of the amendment of the noble lord lord pitt and the effect of this amendment are by no means quite the same <e> <s> none the less i leave it to the committee to deal with it as they think <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness lady birk for her kind words to me <e> <s> i do not seem to have been skilful enough to get over to the front bench opposite that the effect of the amendment would be to make the situation of claiming citizenship through the provisions set out in clause which are based broadly on the main provision namely that someone shall have been resident here before st january and shall have been ordinarily resident here after that for a period of five years remain open indefinitely and that would make matters more rather than less complicated <e>", "<cs> because as the years go by people would continually need to hark back over a long period of years to what their situation was maybe or years beforehand <e> <s> in addition i wish to make it crystal clear that what we are talking about is the right to claim an entitlement to which most people finally became entitled on st december because that was the five-year period after st january <e> <s> therefore most of the people about whom we are talking under clause have at the very least been entitled to claim citizenship of this country for getting on for four years and many of them for a great deal longer than that <e>", "<cs> it would be dishonest if i did not say this <e> <s> the difference between clause <e>", "<cs> three of your lordships have put their names to this amendment in addition to the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead and so i thought that it might be for the convenience of your lordships committee if i indicate that having heard the speech made by the noble lord i should like to accept the amendment on behalf of the government <e>", "<cs> this amendment would mean that for five years after commencement a person born overseas before commencement to a woman who becomes a british citizen on commencement or would have done so had she not died would be entitled to british citizenship on application <e> <s> the noble lord has explained the underlying reason which is that the bill establishes equality from the point of view of the sexes in nationality matters in the future after commencement <e> <s> if the noble lord will forgive me i shall not go into enormous detail although his amendment raises very real problems <e> <s> the noble lord says why is it not right to go into the past <e> <s> my answer is two-fold <e> <s> the first is that i do not think that this amendment if it is right actually belongs here at all since this subsection is concerned to preserve entitlements held under our present nationality law and those who would benefit from this amendment do not have this entitlement <e>", "<cs> the merlyn rees concession is no longer necessary after the bill has become law because of transmission in the future through the female line <e> <s> but the answer to the question which the noble lord has asked me about what happens to children who are too old to be registered under the concession for minors is absolutely straightforward <e> <s> it is that children who are of age and wish to become british citizens and who have not under the concession been registered already should do so through naturalisation <e>", "<cs> i am speaking off the cuff but i think that the answer is precisely the same as the one i have just given to the noble lord <e> <s> again that avenue would be through naturalisation <e>", "<cs> i was about to say the same but i did not like to be quite so adventurous because i thought i had got it wrong <e> <s> but as my noble friend lord renton invariably gets it right i think that at the moment that is my reply to the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would be helpful if i just said this <e> <s> the difference between the periods of time which are proposed in clause for the entitlements to remain valid five years six years and eight years is explained in this way <e> <s> the five-year period deals with the case where someone has an entitlement at commencement and we believe that it is reasonable to give that person five years in which to claim that entitlement <e> <s> but subsection covers people who acquire their entitlement at different points of time after the commencement of the bill <e>", "<cs> it only remains for me to say on this amendment that the position of the government is that we feel there are bound to be people who had a legitimate expectation of acquiring citizenship as an entitlement in this way by in this way i mean the clocking-up of their entitlement over a period of five years having not done so on commencement and who for one reason or another fail to exercise their entitlement even within the six years after the bill comes into force <e> <s> therefore we attach importance to the extra two years <e> <s> on those grounds i hope that the noble lord who moved the amendment will perhaps reconsider it <e>", "<cs> these amendments as the noble baroness has explained would preserve indefinitely the provisions in clause of the bill which cover certain women who are currently entitled to their husbands citizenship of the united kingdom and colonies under section of the british nationality act <e> <s> they will continue to be able to acquire our citizenship on more favourable terms by virtue of the marriage some still as an entitlement others at discretion because their marriage no longer subsists and their links may no longer be with the united kingdom at all <e> <s> clause provides for this phasing out of the current entitlement to take place over a period of five years whereas the effect of this amendment is that it would last indefinitely <e>", "<cs> if i may say so the noble lords remarks overlook the desirability of a three-year period for naturalisation for both husbands and wives <e> <s> not only is the three years a concession and i do not really like using that word because i think that it is a perfectly natural movement so far as citizenship on marriage is concerned and of course i think that it should be shorter than for other people but in addition a husband or wife seeking citizenship by naturalisation does not have to say what his or her intention is so far as residence is concerned <e> <s> therefore the matter is very much easier so far as people who are getting citizenship by marriage are concerned <e> <s> but the noble lord overlooks the desirability of the naturalisation procedure <e> <s> if someone has waited for the comparatively short time of three years then not only does the country which is conferring the citizenship upon the person in other words the united kingdom know that that person is someone whom they wish to have as a citizen but in addition the person who is applying for the status of british citizen will know that that is what he wants himself <e>", "<cs> i should like to reply to that point <e> <s> this is supposed to cover the situation where for instance a woman after her marriage has ended may well have remarried and settled abroad in her own country or have gone to live in the country of her second husband or she may for other reasons have totally left this country and maybe will never come here again <e> <s> in those circumstances it seems very reasonable that the power for conferment of citizenship should be at discretion <e>", "<cs> then the discretion will be exercised no doubt in her favour <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to appear churlish but i am afraid my answer remains the same or more or less the same as the one that i gave to the noble lord lord avebury in the middle of our debate on amendment no <e> <s> when the noble lord raised the matter <e> <s> i think that under the circumstances which this amendment covers it is right that there should be a discretion <e> <s> of course if somebody is in sad circumstances their marriage having broken up because their husband has died or indeed if the marriage has broken up because divorce has occurred if they have real links with the country obviously the discretion would arguably be exercised in favour of the applicant <e> <s> in saying that i am not tying any future secretary of state but i am saying that arguably the discretion would be exercised in that way <e> <s> the noble baroness lady birk speaks a little as though there would be nothing left for the wife concerned <e> <s> this of course is not the case at all <e>", "<cs> before we leave this amendment let me remind the committee what it is that the opposition are saying in general terms on this clause <e> <s> the general attitude of the opposition is that there should be an absolute entitlement upon marriage for husbands and wives <e> <s> at least i assume it would be for husbands and wives because so far as i know both sides of the committee agree that there should be equality between the sexes in nationality matters when a new bill goes upon the statute book <e> <s> that would mean that we would run into the difficulty that if a wife had citizenship conferred upon her immediately and automatically upon marriage she would find that she had perforce lost her original citizenship <e> <s> i do not think that is a very good idea <e>", "<cs> first the good news <e> <s> of course the government entirely accept that there should be transitional arrangements so that women who are currently able to apply for their husbands citizenship but who have not exercised their entitlement do not face undue hardship through a sudden change in their situation but and here we are talking about one of the discretionary parts of the clause we do not believe that it would be compatible with our overall objectives to provide for either the entitlement or the discretionary arrangements to go on indefinitely <e>", "<cs> i think i ought to say on behalf of my noble friend lord renton that without realising he was echoing it my noble friend has been good enough to show me that i was i hope on the right lines when earlier today i attempted to point out some of the difficulties which would arise as the years go by when people claim entitlements as they would under the present amendment <e> <s> it could be years and years later and there is then opportunity for subterfuge <e> <s> but more practically and more reasonably there is room simply for genuine doubt as my noble friend has quite rightly pointed out <e>", "<cs> i am genuinely sorry to disappoint the noble baroness but i am afraid i cannot give any comfort on this particular amendment <e> <s> indeed i think this is the least deserving of all the amendments <e> <s> i will not go through the effects of clause but any of your lordships who cared to glance at subsection i believe would agree i hope so that this is the sort of case where there should be discretion a discretion not to try to do somebody out of something which they ought to have but discretion in order to make sure that if the woman who is applying for citizenship under discretion really is going to maintain the close links and is going to want the citizenship then it can be accorded to her <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has moved amendment no <e> <s> b with which he is taking amendments nos <e> <s> c and a <e> <s> with regard to the first two amendments section of the act broadly speaking gave an entitlement to registration to people who renounced our citizenship as a necessary preliminary to acquiring another commonwealth citizenship and not a foreign citizenship <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> c would extend clause to cover foreign citizenship or nationality as well but that would go far wider than extending the present entitlement <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly look at the point which my noble friend has raised <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will take the view after i have explained the governments position that no meanness is either intended or inherent in subsection of clause but rather that it is putting right a legacy of the no <e> <s> act which i think was unforeseen at the time <e>", "<cs> may i just ask the noble lord lord mishcon whether it is his understanding that this is amendment no <e> <s> zab <e> <s> if so could the noble lord tell us so that we are absolutely certain what the terms of the amendment are <e> <s> i am only seeking clarification <e> <s> my understanding was that this was amendment no <e> <s> zb and that we came to amendment no <e> <s> zab at the next amendment <e> <s> i should just like to be certain of that when i am listening to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> we have listened to a debate which has surprised me <e> <s> the noble lord lord avebury said quite clearly that he believed that there should be one citizenship <e> <s> the noble lord used the word we <e> <s> whether it was the royal we or whether it was meaning both the noble lord and the other noble lords on the opposition front bench all of whom have their names to this amendment i do not know <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for clarifying that <e> <s> the noble lord is consistent in being open-hearted kindly and wanting to let as many people into this country as it is possible but when the noble lord says to the committee that he believes that there should be one citizenship and one citizenship only all can say is that the noble lord is in a minority of one <e> <s> no one not even the previous government in their green paper has suggested anything quite like that <e> <s> yet when i listened to the noble lord lord mishcon it sounded to me for a moment or two as though he was coming perilously close to the line which the noble lord lord avebury had taken <e>", "<cs> i accept that but if the noble lord says that british overseas citizenship means nothing then presumably the only alternative is to make it in the view of the opposition mean something <e> <s> in this particular amendment we now find partially at any rate what it is that the noble lord lord avebury and the opposition believe that british citizenship should mean for two different sets of people <e>", "<cs> i am replying to the noble lord on the amendment which reads <e>", "<cs> let me now continue <e> <s> let me deal first with the or so future british overseas citizens from africa who have gone from there to india who hold no other citizenship and are currently eligible to come to this country under the voucher scheme and who fall within the terms of this amendment <e> <s> to grant british citizenship to this group would enable them to enter this country immediately and to settle here at any time and it would be possible for all of them to come here at once <e> <s> this would not be acceptable particularly at the present time to the country at large and i do not think it would be in the interests of those concerned at the present time <e>", "<cs> the people who are covered by this amendment are of a group which is married <e> <s> the largest element referred to in the amendment are citizens of the united kingdom and colonies and british protected persons admitted on special vouchers and their dependents who are citizens of the united kingdom and colonies or british protected persons <e>", "<cs> i suspect that the noble lord lord gifford is very much more expert in the immigration and nationality law than i am and i am not saying that out of politeness because i have heard the noble lord make speeches in the past from which i recognise the noble lords expertise in this matter <e> <s> therefore the noble lord will know very well indeed that there are circumstances under the law at the moment in which a person who claims to have acquired the right of abode is required to prove it <e> <s> that is why at the moment a period of time is required from somebody before they can move on to citizenship and that is why we are requiring precisely the same thing now <e>", "<cs> to reject any appeal to me from the noble baroness goes to my heart but i hoped i had made it clear that because this amendment goes infinitely further than the law as it stands at the moment and because we believe that the way in which we have re-interpreted the law as it stands at the moment in clause is fair and just we would not agree to this amendment on principle <e>", "<cs> my noble friend asks me on this amendment what is the position of people who are settled here and do not choose to take up citizenship <e> <s> i would make it crystal clear that there is nothing in the bill which would jeopardise the position of people who are settled in this country and do not choose to take up citizenship <e> <s> and there is nothing in the bill which would in any way detract from such rights of people who are settled here and have not taken up citizenship here <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will look at clause to which the committee has now agreed the remarks he has made about people being made to be british overseas citizens when they have been here for many years of their lives are not in fact accurate <e>", "<cs> i must not mislead the noble lord <e> <s> the amendment which is being moved is wholly unacceptable to the government in whatever way it is drafted <e>", "<cs> in order to help the noble lord let me say that in that event both amendments will be unacceptable <e>", "<cs> on the contrary i liked the noble lords speech very much it was an impassioned speech about british overseas citizens but i thought the noble lord was moving amendment no <e> <s> zc which is all about children who have the right of abode in this country when their mothers do not <e>", "<cs> i should like to reply to the noble lord <e> <s> i am afraid that the government see grave difficulties in a provision of this kind <e> <s> to confer british citizenship and hence the right of abode in this country on those concerned would as i indicated previously enable some or more people mainly in malaysia india and east africa to enter this country freely and settle here at any time <e> <s> i do not think that that would be either acceptable to the country or in the interests of those concerned <e>", "<cs> i owe my noble friend an apology because he warned me that he was raising a series of points which of course all stem from the position of the electress sophia and i am afraid that i am not yet in a position to give my noble friend replies on the points that he has raised <e> <s> if it is acceptable to my noble friend i shall most certainly write to him <e> <s> however it is conceivable that i might even be able to let him know what the position will be before this evening is over <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for raising this because if for no other reason i found when i was trying to study the bill that i was not entirely sure of the difference between the clause which my noble friend is questioning clause and clause to which the committee has now agreed both of which are to do with resumption <e>", "<cs> i would only say that i think that my noble friends lord boyd-carpenter and lord renton have perhaps not given quite the weight that i would have given to the words of my noble friend lord drumalbyn and i will not repeat them or try to better them at all <e> <s> i would only add that although my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter is assiduous in asking in cases where he believes it right that there should be proper discretion in the bill i should have thought that under clause these are cases that could arise in the sort of way that my noble friend lord drumalbyn has outlined where some discretion would be both compassionate and right <e> <s> i know that my noble friends will be looking again at this clause and now that i have been warned so will i <e>", "<cs> my lords i am entirely in agreement with my noble friend lady elliot <e> <s> this was why we produced a paper and why we have been looking very carefully at the provisions of the act <e> <s> however may i add that in the very difficult times which we have been going through i think my right honourable friend the home secretary has acted with speed and with decision so far as supporting the actions of the police is concerned <e> <s> although we in the home office are now looking urgently at the matter in consultation with my right honourable and learned friends if we rushed into legislation it would be something which i think we should repent at leisure <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord is absolutely right <e> <s> this was among the issues discussed in the green paper on the public order act and related legislation <e> <s> it raises a difficult question of balance between the freedom of people in this country to do things which are within the law and the desire and the right of us all to live in peace <e> <s> we hope to be able to come up with some views on this matter for parliament to consider again in the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i shall draw what he has said to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord gifford has explained this amendment would automatically confer british citizenship at birth on the child of a parent who was a citizen of the british dependent territories a british overseas citizen or a british subject if he would otherwise be stateless <e> <s> he would not as under the bill as it stands take his parents citizenship or status <e>", "<cs> all it means and i must try to put this with the greatest precision that i can is that a child whose parents have two of the relevant statuses gets both unless one of them is british subject status in which case he gets only one and does not get british subject status <e> <s> that bit is set out in sub-paragraph <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee the noble lord lord gifford was of course speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> a and b along with nos <e> <s> c and d <e> <s> my arguments on nos <e> <s> c and d were going to be the same not of a supportive nature i am afraid as they were on ia and b <e> <s> in principle the arguments are the same except of course that all the references which i would have <e>", "<cs> in arguing that a stateless child born here should have an unqualified entitlement to british citizenship on application without having to show any other connections with the united kingdom and equally that a stateless child born in a dependent territory would have unqualified entitlement to citizenship of the british dependent territories both the noble lord lord gifford and the noble lord lord avebury have overlooked matters which are either explicit in the bill or are set out in other pieces of legislation <e> <s> i believe that i can honestly say that the government are sympathetic to the needs of stateless children and these needs can be met under the bill <e> <s> the difference is that the government are saying that we think it reasonable that the child concerned should have to show that he or she has certain ties with this country or with a dependent territory before being entitled to british citizenship or citizenship of the british dependent territories under the provision <e> <s> that is why we have provided that applicants for citizenship in this way should be of a specified age and should have lived here or in the dependent territories for a period of five years <e> <s> the noble lord lord gifford asked why the specified age <e> <s> the reason is that the <e>", "<cs> if i may say so i am disturbed by the speech which the noble baroness lady birk has made <e> <s> i recognise her concern with schedule <e> <s> it is an important schedule and the noble baroness has every right to express her interests and concern in how the schedule works <e> <s> i do not think that the noble baroness has the right to make such remarks and i am paraphrasing her words that apparently the government have now decided that they will restrict the citizenship of this country more and more with the implication that the opposition benches could not understand the reason why <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson <e> <s> he is looking as i am to see what the general view of the opposition is to the bill as we go along <e> <s> it is fair to say in the middle of dealing with a particular amendment which i accept from the noble lord lord mishcon has to be answered and looked at on its merits that it is a fact that general remarks were made by the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> the noble baroness has every right to make any remarks that she wishes but one of the general remarks was that apparently there was an increasingly restrictive <e>", "<cs> i do not accept that and if the noble lord has a particular case which refutes what i have said i hope that he will let me know <e> <s> i promise him that i will look into it very quickly indeed <e> <s> i might say to the noble baroness that her general complaints which still exist about schedule wholly overlook the fact that i endeavoured to point our earlier that there really is not a great deal between the noble lord lord gifford and the government <e> <s> we have in schedule age and residence requirements and those requirements are more generous the age requirements infinitely more generous than those of the united nations convention <e> <s> we believe they are sensible because there will be people who will come to this country who will have children who are stateless and who will want to go on elsewhere <e> <s> indeed the children may not wish to have had british citizenship conferred on them because they may find they are in great difficulties from a dual nationality point of view if they go to another part of the world <e> <s> i think on those grounds that the dividing line in this debate so far as schedule is concerned is comparatively narrow <e>", "<cs> i should like first to reply to the noble lord lord gifford who moved amendment no <e> <s> f <e> <s> this amendment would mean that a stateless person whose father or mother held one of the statuses created under this bill would be entitled to his parents status without having to meet any residence requirement <e> <s> he would no longer have to show that he had been in the united kingdom or the dependent territories for three years preceding his application and that he had not been absent for the periods laid down in the schedule <e>", "<cs> certainly <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> i am not looking at the text at the moment but one of the entitlements to citizenship to which this provision relates that in paragraph of this schedule may be exercised at any time during a persons lifetime and the parent of the applicant could well be dead by the time an application was made <e> <s> the other entitlement admittedly has to be exercised before the applicant reaches the age of but it does not depend in any way on the status of the applicants parents and their movements are therefore of no concern in this context <e>", "<cs> i think i shall have to look with a <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure whether my noble friends intervention would be supported from both sides of the house but certainly i will take on board what my noble friend has said <e> <s> so far as the case raised by the noble lord lord gifford is concerned my advice is that while they are minors such children would probably qualify as children of their parents but once they have become adults they would have to qualify under the immigration rules <e> <s> the noble lord and the noble lord lord avebury have asked what about the immigration rules and the bill <e> <s> we have made it clear consistently while the bill has been going through another place and i think i have said it during the committee stage here that we shall look at the immigration rules when the bill has been passed into law and will then consider what amendments may be necessary <e> <s> it is absolutely necessary for me to give that reply because the bill is subject to the scrutiny of parliament and therefore amendment in parliament <e> <s> therefore there is no other reply that i can possibly give <e>", "<cs> i was chided by the noble lord lord mishcon for remaining silent but it was only because i watched fascinated while one noble lord after another succeeded in hitting the wrong nail on the head <e> <s> i know after five days in committee that any mention of the previous governments green paper is liable to give noble lords on the opposition front bench sleepless nights <e>", "<cs> the reason why the wrong nail has been hit on the head in the last minutes in this -minute debate which the noble lord lord mishcon said would be just the right length is contained in that paper which dealt briefly with civil rights <e> <s> the green paper said <e>", "<cs> i will certainly look carefully at what the noble lord lord gifford has said but i would have thought having listened to the noble baroness lady birk and to the noble lord that the right way to deal with these cases would be for them to be taken up in the courts <e> <s> i believe that the system of being able to do that offers this particular advantage over what is being proposed in the amendment <e> <s> at present the courts are very much a matter of last resort where a person has already provided the home office with what they regard as sufficient and reasonable evidence of their claim to citizenship but without success <e>", "<cs> if it is appropriate of course we shall do our best to see that those who should receive letters do get them <e> <s> this is not a case where i promised to write what i promised to do was to look carefully at what the noble lord lord gifford said <e> <s> the noble baroness said that she understanding that i would do that would feel that she was free to return to the subject <e> <s> that was how the matter was left <e>", "<cs> i do not think we can undertake to write too many letters <e> <s> my undertaking was to look at what the noble lord lord gifford said <e> <s> that was my undertaking <e> <s> i do not think that i am going to go any further than that this evening <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord gifford has asked me four questions of which he gave me notice and which i shall now briefly answer <e> <s> the first question was about applications which are made for registration and for other things on behalf of minors by those with parental responsibilities <e> <s> the regulations prescribing the persons by whom applications are to be made will be likely to follow closely the existing regulations and in cases of this kind applications have to be made either by the parent or by the guardian of the child <e> <s> however there are no regulations governing applications under section of the act <e> <s> the home secretary has discretionary power to register any minor <e> <s> it is therefore possible for older minors to submit applications on their own behalf under this provision or for local authorities to apply on behalf of children in their care <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been the policy under both the previous government and the present government that those who have come to this country from cyprus because of the situation in the island should be granted stay here exceptionally under the immigration rules <e> <s> arising from what the noble lord asked at the beginning of his supplementary my understanding is that no greek cypriot is expected to return to that part of the island now controlled by the turkish authorities <e> <s> similarly turkish cypriots will not be returned to the greek controlled area <e> <s> however the convention which is the whole point of the noble lords question does not apply <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> this is the policy which the previous government followed and which the present government are following and i believe it is the right one <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is any particular case which the noble lord has in mind i shall of course make sure that it is looked at carefully and seriously but i understood from what the noble lord said that these are cases which have already been looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords this is exactly the case <e> <s> in his question i think that the noble lord lord molloy has outlined the procedures which are followed at the present time <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it would be more fair <e> <s> we have got to be realistic and to take into account that the number of those admitted from the island of cyprus for all purposes into this country has risen from in to <e> <s> so the numbers have doubled in a period of some seven years <e> <s> we are therefore again talking about an immigration situation which is serious and important <e> <s> within this there is nothing i think between us that these particular cases the people who after felt that they had to leave and could not go back must be dealt with as sympathetically as possible <e> <s> i should like to add to what i have already said that in deciding whether a person could reasonably return to the island full account is always taken of all the circumstances including for example the availability of accommodation and funds and the extent to which relatives have been able to re-establish themselves in cyprus <e>", "<cs> my lords this of course is an avenue down which if people can go there would be a solution to the whole problem which is the subject of the question tabled by the noble lord lord brockway <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will send me details of the case i will most certainly make sure that it is looked at carefully and sympathetically <e>", "<cs> my lords the department supplies a range of cell cards to every prison and governors are required by standing orders to ensure that each prisoner is provided in his cell or room with copies appropriate to his status <e> <s> if cell cards are not available in some establishments or parts of establishments this is likely to be because persistent vandalism by prisoners has led to alternative arrangements such as keeping sets of cards to which prisoners have access in a wing office and the library and providing induction sessions <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the view of the prison department that the cell cards need updating <e> <s> that is the reason why they are being updated <e> <s> so far as standing orders and circular instructions are concerned those are for the guidance of management and that is the reason why they are not communicated to prisoners <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not agree with that <e>", "<cs> my lords that is one of the matters at which i think we are looking at present <e> <s> it is true as the noble lord lord avebury says that the present cell cards needed overhauling <e> <s> but i should like to say to my noble friend lady vickers that one of the general practices which goes on in prisons is to encourage prisoners to consult wing officers governors and members of boards of visitors so that they can say if they do not understand things which should be told to them <e> <s> immediately they come into prison it is the general practice to hold what are called induction sessions where immediately of course it can be seen if there is a prisoner who simply cannot speak english and in remand prisons governors are encouraged and have for a long time been encouraged to display wall notices in the reception areas <e>", "<cs> my lords we are looking at the necessity for supplementing the cell card at present and i think that we must await the outcome of that study <e>", "<cs> no my lords it is not an easy thing to complete <e> <s> we must get it right and i can assure the noble lord that we are pressing ahead with it <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a difficult problem <e> <s> there are people still using -line television and the only fair way i think of making the transition to -line television is through a phased programme <e> <s> my noble friend specifically mentioned the question of the mobile radio services <e> <s> i might add that it was at the request of my right honourable friend the home secretary that the mobile radio committee is undertaking a study of the spectrum requirements for land mobile radio in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what my noble friend the duke of atholl has just said about communities in scotland <e> <s> my noble friend may wish to have his attention drawn to the fact that when my right honourable friend the home secretary on th may last year answered a question for written answer about the programme of phasing out the -line television services my right honourable friend also announced what are called self-help schemes for communities which will not be able to receive -line television <e>", "<cs> my lords i generally take my noble friends advice in matters of broadcasting but in this particular instance i think that next year would be too soon <e> <s> there is the need to try to look after the smaller communities and at the moment both the bbc and the <e>", "<cs> i listened to my noble friend lord colville and it may or may not be that the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead will feel that as a result of my noble friends speech it would be right to ask for the decision of the committee this evening on these particular amendments <e> <s> none the less i believe your lordships would expect me to answer the main thrust of the amendment which the noble lord has moved namely amendment no <e> <s> a which is that reasons should be given to the applicant in writing so far as decisions on discretionary cases is concerned and of course your lordships have confined their remarks to naturalisation cases <e> <s> when taken with amendment no <e> <s> a the effect of the amendment now before the committee would be that national security cases would be excepted from the effect of the amendment <e>", "<cs> we have discussed this matter earlier on in dealing with the bill and i remember that on the previous occasion i said on behalf of the government that the term ordinarily resident is a question of mixed law and fact which has not as far as i know been interpreted by the courts in a nationality context <e> <s> although i know at first sight this sounds unsatisfactory i do not think that the absence of a definition of this term in the bill will cause serious problems in deciding whether someone is settled here or not <e> <s> indeed i think it could be harmful to attempt a definition since such a definition could exclude many deserving people <e>", "<cs> i recall some time ago making a lengthy speech about some northern ireland legislation and protesting against the use of the word lunacy <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones in his capacity as lord chancellor then dealt in very kindly fashion with my speech and indeed i believe to some extent met what was in fact a protest at the use of what i and others believed was an out-of-date term <e> <s> this of course is a rather different amendment in that the noble lord is objecting not so much to the term but to the imprecision which is inherent in the use of the term <e> <s> the difficulty which i see in the amendment is that the term unsound mind is not actually defined anywhere in the european convention although it is used in article <e>", "<cs> on behalf of the government i will be ready to look at the point that the noble lord has made <e> <s> however the point which the noble lord has perhaps overlooked and which perhaps some other members of the committee have also overlooked is the supreme importance of having the word british in the title <e> <s> this is what the government all noble lords and members of another place attach enormous importance to and of course so do the people of those territories <e> <s> this is the no <e> <s> priority <e> <s> as regards the rest of the title we shall look at what the noble lord has said but i cannot say that we shall necessarily come up with any bright ideas <e> <s> before i sit down may i ask whether it is noble lords understanding that with clause goes schedule and then there are three other schedules which go with clause <e> <s> i was a little worried about the sequence with which we are taking matters and i thought that i would make sure before we continued <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord avebury undoubtedly has a point <e> <s> nevertheless the full process of naturalisation which is expensive will have been gone through in these cases or if not in all these cases in many of them then there would have to be decisions as to exactly where the line should be drawn <e> <s> no decision has yet been reached but we will of course look carefully at the matter as put to me by the noble lord and will try to reach a decision before the report stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the question of when the current research will be published <e>", "<cs> my lords there is little firm evidence about the benefits of community policing but we all know that what the noble and learned lord says is true <e> <s> what the chief constable of devon and cornwall and other chief constables have found is that among other things there is a major task in this area of persuading people and local organisations that they are responsible with the police for the maintenance of law and order <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that no reluctance has been shown by my replies <e> <s> all the pieces of research which were the basis of the question tabled by my noble friend lady faithfull are already being undertaken either by the home office research unit or at the behest of the home office <e> <s> on the second point which my noble friend lord inglewood has made this is exactly what i tried to say at the end of my reply to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e>", "<cs> my lords we are in touch with chief constables about the importance of crime prevention panels <e> <s> i shall certainly take into account what the noble baroness has said in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend and i shall draw my noble friends words to the attention of the commissioner of the metropolitan police <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness makes a crucial point <e> <s> at a time when i suppose that the percentage of the police force taken nationally is younger than it has ever been there is a very real difficulty about getting the more mature men and women actually on the beat <e> <s> however i know that chief constables have this very much in mind and do their best to try to take some action in this particular respect <e>", "<cs> my lords that is right but we have a problem at the moment and the noble baroness quite correctly identified the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords an order prohibiting the holding of public processions may be made only when serious public disorder is otherwise unavoidable <e> <s> in the metropolitan police district this is a matter for <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first of all say that i fully appreciate that inconvenience can be caused to people living locally when an event such as the carnival at which there are large crowds takes place <e> <s> but having said that really it is too soon for the commissioner accurately to assess the prospects for this years carnival although i can say to the house that the commissioner of the metropolitan police has in hand detailed plans for the maintenance of public order <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is absolutely right <e> <s> i think that the only thing that i ought to add is that habitually there have been two organising agencies for the carnival which has always made the organisation perhaps a little more complicated than it otherwise would have been <e> <s> none the less i am sure that the organisers whoever they are should heed what the noble lord has said in his question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i can understand why the noble marquess asks the question because large gatherings of people can create difficulty for people living near but i really think that the evidence of the last two days has shown <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think any of your lordships or the government are putting the two together but i think we can all learn from what has happened in the last hours including those who will be organising carnivals and other things for the rest of this year <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall certainly take into account the question of the noble lord and so i know will the organisers and the metropolitan police <e>", "<cs> my lords the problem which lies at the heart of the noble lords question is that there is a radio frequency constraint but i do not think that the picture is quite so dark as it is painted by the noble lord in his supplementary question because there is scope for more intensive use of the existing radio allocation for this purpose <e> <s> since the beginning of the radiotelephone service the standard adopted has been kilohertz channel spacing giving channels which have accommodated some subscribers in the london area <e> <s> i know that british telecom is now going to reduce the band width to kilohertz channel spacing and this should substantially ease the backlog of applications <e>", "<cs> my lords the problem which the noble lord lord bruce of donington is raising is in fact to be found in london only <e> <s> in the seven other areas where british telecoms service is available there is the ability to meet demand and i am referring there not only to british telecom but also to the various private operators who are licensed to produce this service <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that it will substantially reduce the delay and indeed i think it is right that british telecom should be doing this <e> <s> they will be making the same use of their frequencies as is being made and has been made over past years by commercial operators <e> <s> however the noble lord asked me a perfectly fair question about the future and may i respond in this way a band around megahertz is next year going to become available for allocation to the mobile service including radiotelephones though it will remain allocated at the same time to the existing users who are in fact ministry of defence installations <e> <s> i know that the mobile radio committee established by my right honourable friend the home secretary will be looking very carefully not only at an allocation within that wave band but also for the mobile radio services generally for the rest of this century <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e> <s> i must apologise to the house for the fact that in some copies of the order paper i believe that the motion i now move is shown as relating to the transport bill which obviously is an error <e> <s> in the copy of the order paper that i have there is no mention at all of the motion relating to any bill except that there appear in manuscript the words british nationality <e> <s> i should like to assure your lordships that the motion refers to the british nationality bill and that the clauses and the schedules are set down in the same order as your lordships thought it right to take them in committee <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for the reasons that the noble lord has given to the house in his supplementary question that this is now a matter for the director of public prosecutions to give advice upon <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it would be proper for me to disclose the contents of the investigating officers report but i think i am right in saying that the fact that an investigation was needed was made clear at the time of the appeal <e> <s> certain statements had not been made available to the prosecution and therefore those witnesses had not been made available to the defence <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the general situation is that where the prosecution have taken a statement from a person whom they know can give material evidence but they decide not to call him as a witness they are under a legal duty to make him available as a witness for the defence <e> <s> it was because it was apprehended as a result of the hearing of the appeal that that could not have been the case that the police set up this special investigation <e>", "<cs> that is so my lords <e> <s> it is not normal for police investigation reports to be made public <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones for his generous remarks at the beginning of his speech intro <e>", "<cs> if i may say so my lords i think that depends upon a four-year period here <e> <s> four years is the normal period for people admitted to work here as well as staying here as a refugee before being granted settled status and that avenue into citizenship and i do not think that the distinction that the noble lord lord avebury made in that particular respect is a valid one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure that the mathematics which the noble lord is throwing at me works out uncharacteristically for the noble lord as a mathematical expert for he has spoken first of two years and then adds four years on to his argument <e>", "<cs> oh no my lords i have already given way to the noble lord <e> <s> i would remind him that lie also charged the government that a view might be taken by the united nations high commissioner on refugees <e> <s> my understanding is that no contrary view is taken by the united nations high commissioner on refugees so far as this matter is concerned <e> <s> it is true that it takes time when a refugee comes to this country in order to get the processes right <e> <s> it is a <e>", "<cs> my lords clause to which the amendment of the noble lord lord pitt is directed is a provision which the government hope will assist children who in later years may have difficulty in producing evidence of their parents status <e> <s> perhaps it is worth just repeating that the status which needs to be proved for citizenship is quite wide either that the mother or father is a citizen or that either the mother or father is settled in this country <e> <s> if it is not possible to prove either status under clause the government genuinely hope that clause will help by saying that if there is evidence of continuous residence in this country on the part of the child for a period of years with certain absences written in to which i shall come in just a moment then as of right there shall be an entitlement for citizenship <e>", "<cs> your lordships will recall that in committee we discussed an amendment very much on the same lines as the amendment which is now being moved by the noble lord lord avebury and that that amendment in committee was tabled by my noble friend lady trumpington <e> <s> in replying to the debate on that amendment on july th i indicated for the government that we accepted the case for a discretion to relax the permitted periods of absence for applicants under clause of the bill <e> <s> as the noble lord has said there is a government amendment to this effect amendment no <e> <s> which we have not yet reached <e> <s> i do not want to split hairs but i think that the government amendment was put down a week ago and was first printed on the following day <e> <s> we had prepared it with care to ensure that it achieved the objective desired by my noble friend <e> <s> the noble lords amendment was put down so that it appeared on the marshalled list at the end of last week <e> <s> it differs slightly in drafting from amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i had expected the noble lord to explain why its drafting is preferable <e> <s> i am not criticising the amendment <e> <s> i am delighted that the noble lord and the government see eye to eye on this matter but if there is no reason why the noble lord feels that the drafting and placing of his amendment are preferable then i should prefer to adopt the drafting of the parliamentary draftsman who is responsible for the bill would ask the noble lord to await amendment no <e> <s> and would ask the house to agree to that amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly take on board what my noble friend has said <e> <s> it had not escaped my notice that we had not placed the amendment in the place which my noble friend lord renton favoured at the committee stage <e> <s> but i have already said that advice has been taken and clearly on a matter of this kind that included advice from the parliamentary draftsman <e> <s> i shall certainly have a look at it again but with no commitment at all because i think that it is implicit in what i have said that we did take the advice of the parliamentary draftsman <e> <s> as things stand at the moment we think that this is the right place for the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to reply to the noble baroness lady birk who spoke to the amendment in committee though she wanted to see made a very much wider point than did my noble friend lady elles whose point we are meeting in this amendment <e> <s> my reply to the noble baroness lady birk is that in the case of a separation which is not a judicial separation it is right that both the mother and the father should give consent to the application for registration <e> <s> if they cannot do so under clause perhaps because one parent is living in the united kingdom with the child while the other parent is living abroad then indeed they can apply for registration under clause <e> <s> the noble baroness asked me the meaning of the words which we have used in the amendment where we talk about parents being legally separated <e> <s> we mean a separation that is formally recognised in law <e>", "<cs> my lords we discussed an amendment moved by my noble friend lord drumalbyn in committee but there is a difference between my noble friends previous amendment and this amendment namely that under the present amendment the guardian would have to be a british citizen or settled in the united kingdom <e> <s> since the kind of case that my noble friend puts before your lordships house is bound to attract sympathy perhaps i should begin by saying that i am genuinely sorry that we find <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been asked about children who have been orphaned overseas <e> <s> of course it would still be possible to consider these children under clause although obviously the cases would be more diverse <e> <s> the noble lord lord avebury asked me for an absolute undertaking <e> <s> of course one of the things among others which has always been taken into account in clause cases is where the child is living and where the child is likely to live <e> <s> the answers to those questions are not decisive but those are things which are taken into account <e> <s> therefore where the child was not even in the country but was already living abroad obviously the secretary of state would want to know rather more <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord avebury has moved amendment no <e> <s> a and has also spoken to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> although i think that your lordships may agree with a great deal of what the noble lord and the noble baroness lady birk have said <e> <s> i think the effect of both these amendments would be contrary to what the noble lord intends <e>", "<cs> my lords in case there should be any misunderstanding about it of course it has been absolutely standard provision of independence legislation that when a dependent territory a colony has acquired independence the people lose their citizenship of the united kingdom and colonies because those people acquire the new citizenship of the country from which they come <e> <s> i only start by saying that in case the impression may have been gained that in some way this is some provision of this bill <e> <s> it is not <e> <s> as the noble lord lord pitt and the noble lord lord elystan-morgan made clear it has been so for many years <e> <s> but it is a fact that in the belize act earlier on this year this principle was modified to the extent that no one lost citizenship of the united kingdom and colonies if they had the right of abode in the united kingdom under section of the immigration act <e> <s> as lord avebury said the same principle was followed in the citizenship provisions made for antigua <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is making a perfectly fair point <e> <s> in essence he is saying that he is talking about people here who are settled <e> <s> my answer to that is perfectly direct <e> <s> for the people who are settled there are perfectly good arrangements <e>", "<cs> well i put it to the noble lord that there are perfectly good arrangements which are going to be carried on for a transitional period of five years <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord avebury has said in moving this amendment the bill already gives the secretary of state a discretion to waive the language requirement on grounds of physical condition but the noble lord is seeking to write into the bill a duty that the language requirement should be waived on grounds of deafness or blindness <e> <s> may i say that i quite understand the reasons which prompt the noble lord to move this amendment <e> <s> i should like to respond in this way should any difficulties arise in this respect in future <e> <s> as i have already mentioned the bill already has specifically provided in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house this gives me the opportunity to respond to the point that was made by the noble lord lord mishcon on more than one occasion when we were in committee <e> <s> this was what about publicity for the bill <e> <s> i should like to say that the government feel that the noble lord lord mishcon was making a valuable point in this respect <e> <s> subject to the resources which are necessary in order to be able to publicise the provisions of the bill if and when parliament sees fit to put the bill on to the statute book and bearing in mind that it has not been such a bad thing that the government have not already given out a great deal of publicity about the wording of the bill because it has undergone some change in your lordships house i certainly give an undertaking to the noble lord lord avebury that within those parameters of course we would consider very seriously putting into any publicity about the bill the effects of the naturalisation provisions regarding people who are disabled <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> i am afraid that i omitted to mention the noble baroness by name <e> <s> indeed she has a prior claim because it was in her name that the portmanteau amendment putting the words for any other reason into the language requirement was presented in committee <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble baroness for urging us in what i consider to be the right direction so far as that was concerned and i am grateful for the welcome she has given to these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords there is obviously a great deal in what the noble lord lord pitt says that is true but that does not i think contradict the main point in the answer which i gave to my noble friend the duke of portland which was that there were reasons concerning the capacity of this country to receive people which prompted parliament to agree that the legislation was necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords the government made it clear from the time they came into office that they were committed to a both firm and fair immigration policy as was set out in the election manifesto <e> <s> part of that is dealing firmly with those who are illegal entrants into this country <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i should like to thank my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for his words about the amendment which i moved <e> <s> i think i should just make it clear to your lordships that this amendment was to build upon an amendment which was moved by the noble lord lord pitt in committee and which the committee accepted <e> <s> a great deal of the speech made by the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead as he admitted himself was in fact directed towards amendment no <e> <s> which the noble lord will move in a few moments time <e> <s> incidentally i shall be fascinated to hear what speech the noble lord makes on that particular occasion <e> <s> i have not worked in politics for very long but in the time that i have worked in politics i have begun to discover that one always makes the same speech but starts at the end and finishes with the beginning and then it always seems like a different speech <e>", "<cs> my lords in this amendment the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead is suggesting that the period during which commonwealth citizens and citizens of the republic of ireland may claim any current entitlements to our citizenship should be extended from five years which is the effect of clause to eight years <e> <s> this is a matter which has been given recurrent attention since this bill started its passage through parliament many months ago in the house of commons <e> <s> when the bill was introduced the transitional period of time allowed to people to take up their current entitlements was put to parliament as two years under clause <e> <s> this was reconsidered <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i first reply to my noble friend lady elles who asked me whether under the discretion of the secretary of state in clause an application to register must be made by the parent <e> <s> the answer is that i think i am right in saying that there is no such stipulation in clause <e> <s> anyway applications from <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may reply to those points it is i think interesting and it is a pointer to the complication of this subject that even the noble lord lord avebury who knows a great deal more about it than i do i think made a slip of the tongue when he referred to children up to the age of who might lose the opportunity to be able to register as british citizens by the particular avenue set out in clause <e> <s> with respect the noble lord is not quite right because it would be children of that age who would benefit from the amendment which the noble lord lord pitt has managed to get the house to agree to the government accepted it at a previous stage <e> <s> it does show that this really is a complicated area and because it is a complicated area although i have resisted the amendment which the noble lord lord pitt moved i have promised to look at this point about the information which it would be proper for central government to offer to local authorities <e> <s> in doing this central government always have to tread warily <e> <s> one of the first things is to see what the local authorities are in fact doing <e> <s> therefore i do not think i can go further than the undertaking i have given <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady birk is asking for consistency between clause which we have now reached and clause which we have just left <e> <s> however the two situations which the noble baroness has outlined are rather different and it is not appropriate that the drafting of this amendment which of course is very much the same as the drafting of the previous government amendment as regards clause should be the same and the reason is as follows <e> <s> clause applies not only to people who have an entitlement immediately before commencement but also to young people who acquire an entitlement to citizenship after commencement <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment moved by the noble lord lord avebury and spoken to by my noble friend lady trumpington the noble lord lord elystan-morgan and also the noble baroness lady lockwood would open the way to retrospective transmission of citizenship in the female line <e> <s> we see difficulties in this amendment from the point of view of the government <e> <s> while it is true that present nationality law does not allow automatic transmission of citizenship in the female line it is in fact the case that many of those with mothers who are citizens of the united kingdom and colonies will already have been able to obtain citizenship <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in the hands of the house but since we were speaking to two amendments but are now debating four amendments if your lordships agree i shall reply to the points that have been put to me <e>", "<cs> on that my lords if the house will allow me i really must reply <e> <s> the answer to the noble lord is that it is true that the noble lord lord avebury is moving his amendments on the grounds that the power in them would be used solely at discretion and would as the noble lord says be an extension of policy which was set down by previous government ministers in the s <e> <s> but the difficulty of the noble lords amendments would be that the discretion would be wholly at odds with the main aims of this bill so much so that it would be difficult to foresee that the discretion would be used at all <e> <s> its existence would lead people to hope and to expect that it would be used in their case and the result would be to disappoint expectations in a way which would be regarded i think as cruel and misleading <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord bethell has said that the government may have reservations about clause other than drafting ones <e> <s> i would remind your lordships that of course that is the case <e> <s> when the clause was moved by my noble friend lord bethell in the committee stage of the bill the government front bench spokesman spoke extremely strongly against the advisability of accepting this clause and this still remains the view of the government today <e> <s> we have decided nevertheless that in view of the decision which your lordships took we should not seek at this report stage to remove the clause <e> <s> i can however give absolutely no commitment as to the view which the government shall invite the house of commons to take bearing in mind that a contrary view was taken during proceedings in another place <e> <s> so far as the merits of my noble friend lord rentons amendment are concerned i will not tread the ground which has already been trodden very expertly and with considerable care having listened to the noble lord lord elystan morgan already in this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords first it might be helpful if in replying to the amendment i said that my understanding is that my noble friend lord campbell of alloway is right <e> <s> by i am sure a mere slip of the pen my noble friend lady elles has included in her amendment the words <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i will go on for just a moment and then i shall give way to my noble friend <e> <s> it seems to me that there is then a third category of people <e> <s> the first category that occurs to me is that of the people who come back and go on living here <e> <s> the second category consists of the people who come back for a time but go abroad and have <e>", "<cs> they do not indeed my lords <e> <s> the noble lord lord avebury says that they do not know that <e> <s> that is precisely why i am saying that now that that provision is in the bill <e> <s> it is not in there for nothing <e> <s> i have not given a commitment but i have given a marker towards it in an endeavour to try to be as helpful as possible in what i think is a difficult matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the equipment to which my noble friends question and my answer referred does indeed include supplies of shields helmets and fire-proof clothing <e> <s> some new-style protective helmets are now with the police in great britain again i understand that supplies of some fire-retardant overall suits are with the police and indeed there is the facility for supplying more <e> <s> so far as concerns the last point which my noble friend made in his supplementary question i think the right balance must be struck between the prudent provision of equipment and not allowing such provision to set the police apart from the communities for which they are responsible <e> <s> but the house may be interested to know that the devon and cornwall force have a supply of helmets and shields and indeed the force assisted in the policing during the merseyside disorders <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lord lord wells-pestell is yes it does include cs gas and it does include certain supplies of what are known as baton rounds <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think necessarily that criticism was implied by my noble friend and i do not think the house will take it that any criticism was implied in the reply <e>", "<cs> my lords those who would acquire the right of abode under the provisions of this amendment are varied <e> <s> the largest element would be citizens of the united kingdom and colonies and british protected persons who would be admitted on special vouchers and their dependents who are citizens of the united kingdom and colonies or british protected persons <e> <s> but there are others who would benefit also <e> <s> there are the people who have come here from the dependencies and are settled here under the provisions of the immigration rules <e> <s> their numbers would be relatively small <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord elystan-morgan has explained that the purpose of this amendment is to probe the effect of articles and of the treaty of accession when taken in conjunction with this bill <e> <s> may i first say a word about article <e> <s> that is the article which as the noble lord explained provides for freedom of movement for workers to be secured within the community and indeed having been handed the actual text by my noble friend lord campbell the noble lord lord elystan-morgan read out the different sub-articles <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead reminded your lordships the house at committee stage debated a similar amendment which the noble lord moved which was replied to by my noble friend lord trefgarne and which ended in a division <e> <s> the house decided on that occasion against the amendment moved by the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead <e> <s> although i understand the reasons which have prompted the noble lord to move this amendment i cannot conceal from the house that there is an absolutely fundamental point here which divides the government from the noble lord and very briefly i shall do my best to remind your lordships of it <e>", "<cs> my lords the right to an inquiry against a refusal of naturalisation is a matter within the discretion of the home secretary and it is because this is a matter for my right honourable friend that i am replying on this occasion to my noble friend lord colville of culross <e> <s> my noble friends amendment would set up a right to an inquiry in only certain circumstances confined to three of the criteria which are to be found in schedule to the bill <e> <s> they are the residence requirement for somebody who wants to be naturalised the language test and the requirement that an applicant if naturalisation is granted intends to make his home in the united kingdom or intends to serve united kingdom interests overseas <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that the noble and learned lord should suggest that of any home secretary <e> <s> i would have assumed that if the grounds for refusal of naturalisation were on mixed grounds the honesty of the situation would require those who are in such positions where we are always being told in this house that officials should deal in a straightforward and upright way with cases as i believe they always do that they would have to say so <e> <s> what would happen in practice is that there <e>", "<cs> my lords two basic points arise from the amendment moved by the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> the first is whether this is an appropriate area to give relief to people who may not be able to afford to pay the fee for registration or for naturalisation and the second whether the method of offering relief proposed by the noble lord is a practical one <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the noble lord lord pitt when i was speaking to this amendment a moment ago and was replying to the point about the cost of the notional family which the noble lord put to the house i said that the total cost of registration for such a family would be <e> <s> that is not the case it would in fact be because all four children come to together <e> <s> that is just to put the record straight <e> <s> there is of course a fundamental difference between the two sides of the house on this amendment and i think there is nothing i can add to what i have already said <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is in the bill a provision for an extension of the time to pay fees <e> <s> if i find that i have got that wrong i shall certainly communicate with the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord avebury asked me for figures of overseas adoptions endeavouring to prove thereby that the potential immigration commitment would be very small <e> <s> on the existing figures which i do not have i do not doubt that the noble lord would be right <e> <s> but the basis of the reply of my noble friend lord trefgarne at the previous stage of the bill was that we believe that an amendment of this kind and i accept that the noble lord lord avebury has changed the terms of the amendment would be liable to exploitation and therefore would change the situation <e> <s> it could be used by people seeking to evade immigration control on the entry of children and could lead to the entry of adopted children who did not have the same status as a natural born child in the eyes of their adoptive parents yet who would have acquired our citizenship on that basis <e> <s> i meet absolutely squarely the point which has been made by both the noble lord lord avebury and the noble baroness lady birk that the authorities of the countries concerned would do their best to see that an adoption is a proper one <e>", "<cs> my lords i would be very ready to compare the merits of an amendment to replace ordinary residence with the existing concept of ordinary residence if on this occasion it were possible to do so <e> <s> i say that because i agree with the noble lord lord elystan-morgan that there is something unsatisfactory about having a concept which is undefined <e> <s> yet at the same time it is important that the concept of ordinary residence should depend on the facts which are relevant in any particular case <e> <s> therefore i return to saying that if it were possible to compare a definition of ordinary residence with that i would do so <e> <s> that may sound rather discourteous because the noble lord has laid before the house such a definition but the difficulty is if i may say so without discourtesy that the definition is pretty defective <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is the case but if by any chance i am wrong i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i shall have to think about that one <e> <s> this of course refers back to an amendment which the noble lord moved at the very beginning of our proceedings today amendment no <e> <s> on which the house has already reached a decision <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords if indeed the house will give me leave i think the technical answer to my noble friends point is that this is just a drafting device for the purposes of that particular act only <e> <s> it does not have a wider application which i think was rather the hope of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment of my noble friend lord bethell will materially improve clause in one important respect the right of abode in gibraltar will no longer be one criterion for access to british citizenship under that clause <e> <s> it is clearly undesirable that merely because someone held the right of abode in a dependent territory a matter that was determined exclusively by local immigration ordinances he or she should in consequence have an unqualified entitlement to british citizenship <e> <s> such an arrangement would mean that access to british citizenship was effectively in the hands of the gibraltar legislature if that legislature decided to alter the ambit of the right of abode then this would decide who had an entitlement to british citizenship under clause <e> <s> from my noble friends remarks i do not think that this was his intention and the house would not consider it appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to this amendment i should first like to repeat a view which was expressed by my noble friend lord trefgarne to which i believe my noble friend lord geddes alluded that this bill in no way alters the present constitutional relationship between the united kingdom and its dependencies <e> <s> the government nonetheless accept the force of the argument made by my noble friend lord geddes that many people in the dependencies may well prefer that their citizenship title should begin with the word british <e> <s> in principle therefore we accept the amendment <e> <s> i must just add one point about the nuts and bolts <e> <s> when moving his amendment my noble friend pointed out that the consequential amendments which he reckons would be needed amount to exactly one hundred <e> <s> at this late stage of the bill it is perfectly understandable that my noble friend has not attempted to draft those amendments and it would be asking a lot of the other place to do so instead <e> <s> the government would therefore wish to suggest that my noble friends amendment be replaced in the other place with a provision that would make the term british dependent territories citizen interchangeable with citizen of the british dependent territories <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will agree that that is a reasonable way in which to proceed and subject to that the government are pleased to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that if it is made perfectly clear in the bill that citizen of the british dependent territories shall be british dependent territories citizen as an interchanged definition this would wholly meet the point which has been made by my noble friend lord geddes <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones may ask why are the government responding in this way <e> <s> when we are accepting as indeed we are my noble friends amendment <e> <s> the answer is although it would be impertinent of me to suggest that i have any understanding of the rules of procedure in another place that i doubt whether an amendment of this kind would <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am not a printer i cannot answer that question and as i am not an official member of my right honourable friends department neither can i answer how long it would take to go through the bill and physically do the homework of getting it ready for the printer <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord garner <e>", "<cs> my lords if with the leave of the house i may speak once more of course i will take on board on behalf of the government what the right reverend prelate has said on this particular point <e> <s> but we have looked at it again with some speed because quite naturally the noble lord lord geddes was not able to give either himself or the government a great deal of time that was no fault of my noble friend at all it was a question of the time factor <e> <s> all i can say to the right reverend prelate is that if your lordships accept this amendment as i very much hope you will do we will look carefully so far as another place is concerned at the points that have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords if your lordships will bear with me yet one further time the reason why i replied in single negative to my noble friend lord lauderdale was that the one thing we are sure about having looked at the amendment of my noble friend lord geddes is that it really does entail quite a lot of work <e> <s> there are the two limbs <e> <s> there is both the printing and the sheer work of going through the bill and getting it right before you can get it to the printer <e> <s> if i am not sure of very much at least the one thing i was sure about was that i could not accede to what my noble friend said to me which was that it ought to be done and done pretty quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords if the house will give me leave that of course is a matter for another place <e> <s> the second point which i ought to make is that i do not think in my reply to my noble friend i talked about a clause of interchangeability <e> <s> what i was suggesting to your lordships house i envisage may be done in another place by a simple amendment <e>", "<cs> i am accepting the principle <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> despite the fact that a piece of important work at the very end of the third reading stage was nearly not completed i am glad of this opportunity to express my thanks to your lordships for the work which has been done on the bill <e> <s> the house has taken great care over the details of the bill and has shown yet again concern that the individual should be properly protected in his or her dealings with the state <e> <s> i will not attempt to detail one by one the amendments we have made but perhaps i could say a few words about the major changes which the house has made and about some of the changes which although they are less important will be looked at as of great significance by particular people <e>", "<cs> my lords before replying to this debate may i welcome the noble lord lord kadoorie of kowloon and say that i know how much the whole house appreciated his speech <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will take the governments acceptance of the principle of the amendment moved by my noble friend lord geddes today as proof of the governments total commitment to maintaining our strong links with the british dependent territories <e> <s> so long as distinguished representatives of those territories are prepared to come to westminster and to speak their feelings in this matter as the noble lord lord kadoorie has done so effectively this afternoon so i believe our links will remain firm and unbroken <e>", "<cs> my lords let me reply in any case in this way <e> <s> i do not think there is anything between the noble earl and me on this <e> <s> the fact is that circumstances will dictate to the government to the noble earl and to any other noble lord interested in this that there is bound to be debate because when the draft of the convention is agreed and the committee of ministers has decided to open the convention for signature and the united kingdom have decided to sign it it would not be possible for the united kingdom to ratify it until we were satisfied that our legislation was in conformity with the conventions provisions <e> <s> on the basis of our present expectations ratification would require new legislation here and that would be bound to require debate in both houses during the normal parliamentary process <e> <s> meanwhile our debates on this bill have been most valuable <e> <s> the fact that the bill cannot progress further in this session does not detract from that value <e> <s> the views expressed on all sides have been carefully noted by the government and will be weighed carefully when we come to draw up our own proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord and i take into account what the noble lord has just said <e>", "<cs> my lords the question that my noble friend lord gridley has asked this evening has given those of your lordships who have spoken in this short debate the opportunity to raise matters of the utmost seriousness <e> <s> everyone who wishes to maintain and promote the values and freedoms of our democratic society must view with distaste and concern the efforts of anyone who seeks to undermine our values not least among the young people of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the expressions of sympathy and admiration from the noble lords lord boston and lord wigoder will be much appreciated by all those who are concerned <e> <s> the noble lord lord boston asked me a specific question whether everything possible was being done to keep the public informed and to take all the possible precautions <e> <s> my answer is yes i believe that everything possible is being done but let us remain vigilant and take nothing for granted <e> <s> so far as the closing words of both noble lords are concerned the government agree that the people who perpetrated this and the two previous acts are criminals and everything possible will be done to bring them to justice <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord expresses understandable concern about the scourge of terrorism and its underlying causes so far as it concerns the united kingdom <e> <s> i do not think with respect to the noble lord that this is the occasion to take up the broad and important questions which the noble lord lord shinwell has asked <e> <s> i will certainly draw to the attention of my right honourable friends who are concerned the remarks which the noble lord has made <e>", "<cs> my lords the government agree with the noble lord lord harris in his words of sympathy and admiration and also for the word of warning with which he ended his question <e> <s> the noble lord referred particularly to the fact that this was the second tragedy of this kind concerned with metropolitan police officers working in this way <e> <s> i think that it is right to remember as i think the noble lord was remembering as he spoke that mr howorth had in fact been with the metropolitan police since but before then he had been an army bomb disposal man <e> <s> among other places he had served in northern ireland <e> <s> all who do this work are owed a debt of gratitude by us <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are grateful to the noble lord lord blease for the lead which the noble lord gives in the words which he speaks <e> <s> it is that kind of constructive response which could help lead us out of these difficult days <e>", "<cs> my lords the prevention of terrorism legislation which of course is on the statute book is the answer to the noble lords question <e> <s> incidentally it may be a sad reflection that there are today some ira prisoners in english gaols <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said to the noble lord lord hankey the prevention of terrorism legislation is on the statute book <e> <s> this is a piece of legislation which allows us to keep close watch on people who come and go and that we will continue to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are now really getting so wide that we are starting a debate <e> <s> if your lordships will excuse me i think i will simply come back to the point at which we started <e> <s> the point is to capture the criminals who have perpetrated this act then the courts will deal with them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord foot said he had expected that this order would be taken formally <e> <s> all i can say is that it ill behoves any government spokesman to come to your lordships house and to expect any piece of business to be taken formally for as we have seen this afternoon this order has led to an extremely important and interesting debate with contributions being made by your lordships from various parts of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the unknown factor in the details which the noble baroness gave is how far those students obtain a place elsewhere or on another course in the same institution at present from the figures we do not know <e> <s> however it is highly relevant that this very substantial increase in funds is being made available for the future <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is habitually fair my lords and when i remind her that earlier this year the government together with the local education authorities sat down and then published a major review entitled <e>", "<cs> the noble lord calls for further training my lords <e> <s> there is nothing between the government and the noble lord in

"<cs> that is precisely why we are making additional resources available my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons amendments and reason be now considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg

<s> i have already spoken to this amendment in my earlier remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the commons decided not to oppose the principle that people from gibraltar should have an unqualified entitlement to british citizenship <e> <s> but i regret that despite the efforts of my noble friend lord bethell the amendment which left this house though probably workable was in the governments view still deficient from a drafting point of view in various respects <e> <s> it provided that an unqualified entitlement to british citizenship should be held by a person who is a united kingdom national for european community purposes by virtue of the operation of any of the pre-accession treaties listed in part i of schedule to the european communities act <e> <s> but in fact no one is a united kingdom national for european community purposes by virtue of any of those treaties <e>",

am not sure that i should be entirely happy to see his head if we go through the division lobby i should like to assure him that his presence here is very welcome and that we have missed him <e> <s>

lords there was a slow build-up of a very large number of men close to railton road <e> <s> the slowness was largely the result of other police commitments at this very difficult time from a public

interest in these matters would have noticed the last case in which the parliamentary commissioner looked precisely into a naturalisation case <e> <s> the parliamentary commissioner in that particular case made it quite clear that the reasons of the home office had been explained to him and in the light of that report and other evidence available to the home office the parliamentary commissioner

the balance of my right honourable friends statement <e> <s> the terms of reference which were given to the noble and learned lord lord scarman were an inquiry into policing as a result of the severe disturbances in brixton but deliberately the terms of reference were made wide by my right honourable friend indeed it was made clear that lord scarman would look into matters which had occurred in other parts of great britain in order that we could have the benefit of his advice on problems in inner city areas generally <e> <s> i think those terms of reference are reflected in the sort of statement which i have repeated in your lordships house today <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend asks me about consultation <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state endorses the

desirable <e> <s> he will consult a full range of national bodies as well as taking account of the reactions of local organisations <e> <s> to show that my right honourable friends intentions are absolutely genuine in this matter so far as the area for which he as the police authority is concerned he is setting up early discussions on the arrangements for consultations in lambeth <e>", "<cs>

emphasises public order community relations and supervision and management precise proposals on what is actually taught is something which must be given careful thought and the police training council is the vehicle for that <e> <s> secondly there is the need to ensure an appropriate balance in training between training in the classroom as it were and training on the job and between training centrally and training at an in-force level <e> <s> that has got to be looked at as well and it will be looked at urgently in the police training council <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to be discourteous to the noble baroness but i did reply to a debate which the noble baroness raised in your lordships house and i have nothing to add to what i said on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords

involvement of other community leaders and the community as a whole and not just locally elected representatives <e> <s> he wants consultation to take place at a local level below that of the police authority and the police area <e> <s> hence his recommendations for formal arrangements for consultation at the borough or police district level in the metropolitan police district and for local consultative or liaison committees in the provinces <e> <s> i want to make it clear without peradventure that my right honourable friend accepts this need for wider and deeper consultations <e>", "<cs> my lords in the case of the types of emergencies that the noble lord mentioned in his supplementary question the police would be responsible for initial co-ordination <e> <s> the fire service in addition to its fire-fighting and fire prevention responsibilities undertakes what is called special services and ambulancemen are an essential part of the emergency services although their work is part of the work of the national health service <e> <s> thus i agree with the noble lord that the work of these three services is interrelated on many occasions although they remain under separate organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords there is indeed initial co-ordination in civil defence in the way that the noble lord lord shinwell suggests <e> <s> but still the services remain separately organised with separate skills and separate functions <e>", "<cs> my lords with the best will in the world towards the ambulancemen it is part of the separate organisations that matters of pay and conditions of service are also separately negotiated <e>", "<cs> my lords the expenditure on civil defence has been increased by the present government <e> <s> i believe very deeply that that is the right policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that interesting suggestion from the noble baroness goes a little wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their questions and replies <e> <s> although i recognise absolutely that the noble lord lord ponsonby accurately put his finger on many of the difficulties which are attendant in fixing a licence fee which is both fair to the licence fee payer and also meets the needs of the bbc the two main factors which my right honourable friend the home secretary has to decide upon he was a little short on ideas as to how to help the old and the disabled the first two sets of people whom he identified <e> <s> the difficulty is that if those people were to be given absolute exemption or even a considerable exemption from the licence fee something which no doubt in our hearts we should all like to see it would immediately mean that for everyone else whatever their needs there would be a very much increased licence fee <e> <s> if for instance there were a completely free retirement pension licence at the moment it would immediately mean a colour licence fee so we assess and a monochrome licence fee <e> <s> the only other alternative to bring such help to the people whom the noble lord identifies is of course to raise the money <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord there would indeed be an obligation on the police because employers would approach the police <e> <s> there is absolutely no doubt at all about that if this bill were to go on the statute book in either this form or indeed a modified form <e> <s> employers would be bound to make use of the provisions of the clauses and would approach the police and would wish to know <e> <s> if the sort of assessment of the number of people who are concerned with the private security industry which the noble lord lord willis gave us in his speech is anything like accurate and as i say the assessment of the home office is somewhat lower this would be a very considerable additional burden upon the police <e>", "<cs> my lords i must look again at what the noble lord is saying but i do not entirely take on board what the noble lord lord donaldson has just said <e> <s> my point is that if this bill goes on the statute book employers will avail themselves of the need for the police to provide information <e> <s> i must say that i believe that to be what will happen in practice <e> <s> perhaps i may look at what the noble lord lord donaldson has said and i will certainly write to him if there is anything further that i should add <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord windlesham for this opportunity to debate this question <e> <s> indeed this is the first opportunity think that either house of parliament has had to debate direct broadcasting by satellite for some time and certainly since the publication of the home office report <e> <s> as he declared at the beginning of his speech my noble friend has considerable experience of television and i am convinced that he is right to advise the house this evening that we need to lift our eyes to the opportunities as well as the problems of direct broadcasting by satellite <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will agree that the home secretarys foreword to the home office report gave an indication of our positive approach to satellite broadcasting <e>", "<cs> my lords there must be many noble lords in the house this evening who would wish to jump to their feet on hearing the noble lord and say that it is precisely for the reason which the noble lord has given that they want an early decision from the government so that british technology shall be in a position to be able to perfect the receiving equipment which would be necessary for direct broadcasting by satellite <e> <s> as early a start as possible those more or less are the words used by my right honourable friend the home secretary in the foreword to the study would mean that the united kingdom would be up with the leaders in the field and would be able to take advantage of the commercial opportunities in terms of the sale of satellite and the associated electronic equipment in what could prove to be an extremely important world market <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that i wrote to the noble and learned lord lord gardiner a few weeks ago as a result of a question which was asked by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> so far as a comparison between nuclear war and conventional war is con <e>", "<cs> my lords there would be exceptional circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that to listen to the noble lords lord jenkins and lord brockway is not really quite the way to start a monday at the beginning of a week <e> <s> i think the way i should reply to the noble lord lord brockway is that it is necessary in the event of war to make provision for the administration of justice <e> <s> the sensible way to go about it seems to be the policy which was the policy of the previous government and which remains the policy of the present government which is that broadly speaking the penalties for peacetime offences would remain but decisions would have to be taken for exceptions in particular cases <e>", "<cs> mercifully my lords that question does not arise from the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend asks whether the government will alert the public to the different merits of the cartridge type extinguishers and other extinguishers on agricultural vehicles <e> <s> the home office has conveyed advice to the national farmers union and i believe that this advice has been passed on to nfu members <e> <s> in essence the advice was that dry powder extinguishers of the stored pressure type are better suited than those of the cartridge type for use out of doors and for use on farm vehicles <e> <s> that i think exactly follows the concern which is being expressed by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i would advise my noble friend use extinguishers manufactured to the appropriate british standard use extinguishers which are regularly serviced and if you are going to use out-of-doors or on a vehicle again use powder extinguishers of the stored pressure type instead of the cartridge type <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking about extinguishers and not about fire precautions generally <e> <s> i am advised that the british standards institution is to bring out a british standard indeed it has done so for small disposable aerosol extinguishers <e> <s> there will then be a british standard for all portable extinguishers except extinguishers which have plastic bodies and work on that will be started by the british standards institution very soon <e> <s> therefore if i may i repeat the advice use extinguishers with a british standards institution ratification and use extinguishers which are serviced properly <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have just said in answer to the noble lord lord winstanley a british standards institution standard has in fact just been published it is two months ago and it is bs on small disposable extinguishers of the aerosol type which the noble viscount is asking me about <e> <s> the noble viscount asked me whether the government <e>", "<cs> i agree entirely with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the standard is there <e> <s> i am saying publicly as the home office has said to the national farmers union that standards ought to be looked at carefully <e> <s> i repeat surely the advice is to use the british standards institution standards and use only extinguishers which are serviced regularly and properly <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have consulted the authorities of the church of england and the british council of churches on several occasions since may <e> <s> the opinions expressed by these authorities have not favoured the implementation of the easter act at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there is a great deal in what the noble lord says <e> <s> however the difficulty is that the easter act says that regard shall be had to any opinion officially expressed by any church or other christian body <e> <s> there is not agreement on this particular subject <e> <s> however by a happy coincidence easter in will fall on sunday th april which is also the day fixed under the provisions of the easter act <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of this <e> <s> however it does not alter the fact that on this matter we must obtain the agreement of the churches <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord boston for the support he has given for the objectives of this short bill <e> <s> the noble lord said that he found it hard to deliver any inflammatory remarks <e> <s> if the noble lord had been able to deliver any inflammatory remarks i feel sure they would have been put out later by the welsh water authority constitution variation order which we are going to take in a little while <e>", "<cs> my lords water authorities are of course large and very important bodies with substantial incomes and capital investment programmes and i think it is fair to say that since the need to ensure that water authorities are subject to the same disciplines as the nationalised industries has been increasingly recognised <e> <s> perhaps the first question i could answer is to those of your lordships who say that they question whether a mirror image of the nationalised industries is something that we would want to create in the water authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely understand the point which the noble lord lord cledwyn is putting to me but i am myself looking back at the <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not dissent from what the noble lord has said <e> <s> it is true that the consultation period ended at the end of september <e> <s> none the less that is not in fact the end of the consultation period because i have just given an assurance that in making the appointments for instance to the new authority if this order were to be approved so far as the local authorities are concerned my right honourable friend will consult with local authorities as to the specific names to be appointed <e>", "<cs> my lords that is my understanding <e> <s> i do not think it alters what i have said <e>", "<cs> my lords you do have to make a place and the place is within the total of on the new authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i covered that in the words that i delivered in reply to the noble baronesss question <e> <s> it is a statutory requirement and did not need to be included in the order <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not my understanding <e> <s> however if i have got that wrong i will write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i think that i have given way enough if the noble baroness does not think me discourteous <e> <s> the question of consultation i realise is a matter which has troubled the house very much on this order and i have tried perhaps not adequately to deal with it <e> <s> but there is also the question which has been raised and i raised it in my opening remarks about because of the system at the moment the comparative remoteness of local authority representatives <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i am not in a position to answer that question because of course the paper has not been published <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to both the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and the noble lord lord evans of claughton that i fully understand as i know the rest of the house does the deep concern which they have expressed about what the noble and learned lord referred to as one of the most disturbing statements made to parliament <e> <s> but the fact of the matter is that it seemed most forcefully to my right honourable friend the home secretary that what was needed in the present circumstances was an independent professional review of what has been an operational matter covering crimes which we know spread over a period of years running from to although of course the activities of this particular criminal may have spread over a wider period than that and this is what mr byfords report has indeed provided <e> <s> if i may say so the library summary makes it clear as both noble lords were good enough to say not only that the review was extremely thorough but that there has been no attempt to conceal shortcomings <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may reply on the two points raised by the noble lord lord harris of greenwich the resource implications which as the noble lord rightly says are present as far as improving the use of computers which i think he would agree with his experience is quite essential in the prosecution of these major series crimes as mr byfords report called them will be taken into account in considering the implementation of mr byfords recommendations in that respect <e> <s> as far as the resource implications for training are concerned there are resource implications also for training which follow the scarman report <e> <s> the report of the noble and learned lord is to be debated in this house in about a fortnights time <e> <s> i would give the undertaking that those resource implications in the light of that report and of this report will be taken urgently and seriously into account in the ambit of the police training council <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords question must affect the work of her majestys inspectorate of constabulary <e> <s> for practical reasons an annual inspection of a police force can last only a few days and covers the full range of the forces activities <e> <s> mr byfords review about which this statement is concerned was directed specifically to the yorkshire ripper investigation and involved months intensive work with the support of an expert team <e> <s> many of the weaknesses in the investigation became apparent only as a result of this special review <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not clear from the noble viscounts question what are the other aspects <e> <s> perhaps it will be possible for the noble viscount to have a word with me afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a different issue <e> <s> perhaps i might consult the noble viscount about it afterwards <e>", "<cs> i am acutely aware of the reason why concern has been expressed by the noble lord lord avebury and others of your lordships on this particular amendment because although the numbers of those in prison who should be in hospital are assessed by prison medical officers as being small in number any number is too many <e> <s> but with respect to the committee i am not sure that this is the way to go about it <e> <s> may i first of all ask your lordships to look at the way in which the amendment is framed <e>", "<cs> i should have thought that the answer to my noble friend lady macleod is surely included in clause which of course we have not yet come to <e> <s> one of the reasons which i did not mention <e>", "<cs> the first thing that i should like to say to the noble baroness lady robson is that i may have misled her in the papers which i sent her or that the noble baroness may have had a slight slip of the tongue <e> <s> let me put it on the record that the home office does not think that it is the judgment which requires the consistency which is incorporated in this amendment and which my noble friend lord renton and the noble baroness are criticising <e> <s> we believe that the consistency which we need to write into our legislation is required by the terms of the convention itself <e> <s> i just simply say that to give absolute clarification of what we believe from the home office is the position in which we find ourselves in this country at the moment <e> <s> we do not think that it is the judgment of the court which required this consistency we believe that the convention itself to which we have to direct ourselves because of the judgment of the court is requiring the consistency <e>", "<cs> i do not want to prolong this but i think and i am afraid i cannot find the relevant note in my papers that our concern with my noble friend lord rentons suggestion is not that the government are worried about this <e> <s> we want to go as far as possible towards seeing what is right and what your lordships house believes is right <e> <s> i must discuss this with my noble friend but i think that the government would have to take cognisance of what the courts would feel about having their decisions subject so immediately to a tribunal review <e> <s> however with that <e>", "<cs> i congratulate the noble lord lord avebury on the ingenuity with which he succeeded in importing his views on rastafarians into a proposal otherwise to amend section of the mental health act <e> <s> having said that i could not agree with him that the involvement of a mental health review tribunal in the process of transfer from prison to hospital is appropriate or necessary <e> <s> i do not think it is appropriate because after all tribunals exist to protect the rights of patients in hospital rather than persons serving prison sentences and because the involvement of tribunals in what would be for them wholly new work would almost certainly lengthen the process of transferring a prisoner to hospital <e> <s> i do not think it is necessary because there are already adequate safeguards to prevent patients being transferred from prison to hospital if they do not meet the strict criteria for detention in hospital for medical treatment <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i think and i am afraid i am thinking on my feet the answer to the noble lord is yes that he is on to a good point but the amendment has a very much wider application than the application which he has just put to me <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure which i gave to the noble lord lord wigoder was <e> <s> in the longer term of course the case which the noble lord lord avebury is making would not result as my original answer said in a very considerable reduction <e> <s> moreover we would lose the benefit of the parole system which we have in this country which selects those whom it is calculated ought to have a period of release on licence under supervision and in exchange we would get a system of release which would not be selective and i do not believe that that would be to our advantage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot give to the noble and learned lord the figure for which he asks <e> <s> but in comparing the two systems one would be making with respect a value judgment and i would not i think want to depart from the answer which i gave to the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> the parole system which we have here which it was felt in it was not possible to introduce into northern ireland is a system which i would be loath to desert <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the question which my noble friend lord campbell of alloway asks should be taken seriously <e> <s> as regards the solution the government believe that the best prospect for a substantial and sustained reduction in the size of the prison population lies in a reduction in average sentence lengths in suitable cases by the courts <e> <s> it is for that reason that the government have introduced into the criminal justice bill some changes in the provisions for partially suspended sentences and we very much hope that partially suspended sentences will be approved by both houses and can be brought into effect <e>", "<cs> no my lords the government believe that the road to go down is to introduce section of the criminal law act for partly suspended sentences which can be applied at the discretion of the courts and that is something to which the government attach great importance <e>", "<cs> my lords the penalties under the law are pretty stiff <e> <s> i would not advise my noble friend to try it and see <e>", "<cs> my lords if we went down that road i believe that the gap between the length of sentence given and the actual sentence served would be too great and that probably would be reflected in the length of the sentences given by the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> under section of the principal act the secretary of state may remit to prison a person who has been transferred to hospital under <e>", "<cs> i apologise to my noble friend because i had not taken the point about which he was asking <e> <s> as i understand it it puts what will now be the three sources of information on a similar basis regarding their power to make the recommendation <e> <s> i am advised that it is simply that prisoners in the category referred to may he seen by doctors in any of these categories the regional medical officer another doctor or a mental health review tribunal and that there is nothing to choose between them it is what is most convenient and most appropriate to the case <e>", "<cs> i am not aware that there is any payment at all and i am not aware that there is any problem at all about legal representation <e> <s> but i should like to take advice on that and reply to the noble baroness if i may a little later <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reply to the noble <e>", "<cs> on hearing it again i think that the noble lord may be right about this <e> <s> this is something that i should like to take away with me to make a reply to the noble lord and perhaps to write to him <e> <s> i think the noble lord has got his facts right and i was not right in my previous reply <e> <s> i will look at it and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the government are genuinely grateful to the noble lord for raising a difficult and important point <e> <s> it recurs again in the noble lords other amendment to clause which is amendment no <e> <s> a and is worded in much the same way <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will allow me to refer to that in my reply <e>", "<cs> i would respectfully suggest that there are two essential considerations to be borne in mind when considering the criteria which should be fulfilled before a person may be remanded to hospital for a medical report under the new power provided in clause <e> <s> the first is that this power is intended to be used only for diagnostic purposes and i would suggest that it is therefore reasonable to require only a <e>", "<cs> i do not think there is a great deal which divides the government from the noble lord in this amendment in that we both see this matter as being one in which we are all anxious that there should be no unnecessarily lengthy periods for either appraisal or treatment <e> <s> if there were it would be a misuse of the powers the government are seeking to put into the bill <e> <s> however your lordships will see from subsection of clause and also from clause which is affected by amendment no <e> <s> standing in the names of the noble lord lord kilmarnock and the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady robson said in moving this amendment that this was a right which the accused person should have <e> <s> may i first say that i agree with the noble baroness and i believe that that is the situation <e> <s> it is my understanding that the existing law is already sufficient for an additional report to be prepared by a doctor not connected with the hospital <e> <s> so far as i know there is nothing to prevent a person who is detained in hospital on remand from obtaining a report on his or her mental condition <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with what the noble baroness lady jeger has said <e> <s> that is the governments understanding <e>", "<cs> i must look at what my noble friend has asked me <e> <s> if i feel that we can improve the wording i will certainly do my best to respond to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i have taken on board what the noble lord said finally about legal representation and if i may i should like to look at that <e> <s> if i may say so with respect the difficulty about this amendment is that it knocks out not only the remand period of days but the total remand for weeks in all <e> <s> i must say that that surprised me and those who were advising me because we thought that that ran counter to what the noble lord was intending to do <e> <s> so if on his side the noble lord would care to look at the amendment i on my side could look at the point which he made about legal representation and i think that i ought to include some mention of this amendment in the letter which i have been asked to send to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my understanding is the same as that of the noble lord lord winstanley that this emergency clause is used sparingly <e> <s> i know furthermore that the police themselves would wish to hand over the care of persons who are found under this clause to a medically qualified person as quickly as they can <e> <s> however section was a matter which was looked at by the butler committee <e> <s> after discussing the matter the butler committee concluded that it would be difficult to justify amending the law <e> <s> among other things the butler committee had in mind that there should be a long enough period for an appropriate examination to be carried out and that the law must make allowances for exceptional difficulties <e> <s> whether in the mind of the committee were the same sort of reasons which were in the mind of the right reverend prelate the bishop of norwich i am not so sure but clearly that is also a factor in looking at the matter <e>", "<cs> on an issue involving a problem which has not been solved hitherto by parliament i think my noble friend lord renton has got a strong point that one should hesitate before trying to crack this particularly difficult nut by starting it in your lordships house in a bill which incidentally would not i think within the scope of its long title allow for this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am answering the noble baroness off-the-cuff <e> <s> what section of the representation of the people act provides for among other things is that a person who is a patient in any mental illness or mental handicap hospital shall not by reason thereof be treated for the purposes of electoral registration as being resident there <e> <s> as the noble baroness knows that creates the anomaly since it means that once you are in that type of hospital you are precluded from voting because that is not counted as being an address <e> <s> therefore that leads me to the <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a hypothetical question which does not admit of a direct reply <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord houghton has reminded the house that it is a year ago tomorrow that your lordships debated the second reading of this identical bill <e> <s> the noble lord has also reminded us that the late sir ronald russell the promotor of the act attempted also to amend his act in order to prohibit the sale of pets and animals from stalls or barrows in markets in the same way as the noble lord lord houghton seeks to do on this occasion again in this bill <e> <s> i join in recognising that it is to the credit of the noble lord lord houghton that with characteristic resolve he has not been deflected by the previous lack of progress from pursuing the welfare of pet animals <e>", "<cs> my lords i confirm in my answer to the first part of my noble friends supplementary question that the select committee was critical of the grant-giving power of the commission as it has worked out in practice <e> <s> certainly my right honourable friend will take seriously into account what my noble friend said in the second part of his supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords todays debate has responded in kind to a report of very great significance and breadth <e> <s> my noble friend lord massereene and ferrard was the last of your lordships to have spoken of both a range of issues arising from the policing of our society and the problems of society itself <e> <s> but starting with i believe the speech of the noble lord lord elystan-morgan we have in this debate reinforced the view expressed in the report that it is wrong to pretend that the maintenance of public order and a lawful society are responsibilities that can be laid at the door of the police alone <e>", "<cs> my lords i will answer the noble lord as honestly as i know <e> <s> the police training council last met on th january <e> <s> i said in opening that it had looked at how best to try to tackle the recommendations of the report <e> <s> in fact my information is that the police training council decided that it would set up working parties on certain specific subjects and surveys on other certain specific subjects and would come back in the autumn to decide then what it ought to do <e>", "<cs> my lords before commenting on behalf of the government on my noble friends bill i wish to refer to the reply to a parliamentary question which my right honourable friend the home secretary has made today in another place <e> <s> for the last months or so the home office has been conducting a review of the restrictions which are imposed by shops legislation <e> <s> the regrettable conclusion we have drawn from that review and from an analysis of conflicting views is that there is not yet a sufficient basis of agreement between the various interests concerned for the government to seek to introduce shops legislation now though we are aware of the mounting pressure for reform <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that when noble lords have had the opportunity to see the terms of my right honourable friends reply to a parliamentary question it will be seen that the reply is literally confined simply to coming to the conclusion that there is not the possibility in my right honourable friends view for the government to seek to introduce legislation on this subject at the present time though we are aware of the mounting pressure for reform <e> <s> therefore i do not think that this review which was an internal home office review would add anything even if we had a document to publish which indeed i do not think we have <e> <s> this has been a series of thoughts discussions and consultations ending up in the statement which has been made in another place and the statement which is embedded in my speech both of which were supposed to be simultaneous and for the fact that we did not succeed in achieving that i have already expressed my regret <e>", "<cs> because my lords there is a long history on this question which leads the government to believe that to introduce legislation in the way that the noble lord lord young would wish us to do at the present time would not be desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords the broadcasting act makes it clear that the commission should have discretion to consider a complaint either with or without a hearing <e> <s> parliament deliberately left the procedures for the commission fairly flexible and reasonably informal and if i may say so i believe that was right <e> <s> as i said in my original reply to the noble lord i know that the commission is determined to deal fairly with complaints and that with that object in mind it keeps its procedures under review <e>", "<cs> my lords the procedure is that if a hearing is held then the broadcasting authority and the programme maker must be given an opportunity to appear and be heard <e> <s> if there is no hearing the commission may receive written observations <e> <s> that is the procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite understand what the noble lord is saying but i believe it would be wrong if the government commented on the commissions procedures <e> <s> i would for the third time like to say that the commission with the object in mind of dealing as fairly as possible with complaints keeps its procedures under review <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a completely hypothetical question <e> <s> i do not believe it would help our deliberations at the moment if i tried to give a reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that <e> <s> the press releases of the independent broadcasting authority which were given out in september of both and had a good deal of information about <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for making that point <e> <s> i should have thought that it was common ground throughout the house that the objectives and uses of secondary rental are beneficial to the independent local radio system which of course is still making its way and expanding <e> <s> do not let us forget too that it is a condition of secondary rental grants that the programmes so funded should be offered free to the rest of the ilr networks <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point <e> <s> my reply really is in essence that think a very great deal of detail has been put in the two press reports which the iba have sent out in the last two years <e> <s> i assure the noble lord that full information will however be provided in the annual report and accounts for next year <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks whether something should be done <e> <s> the difficulty is that an amnesty of the kind envisaged by the noble lord would set aside the sentence of the court in an arbitrary way <e> <s> also it would of course do nothing to reduce the numbers of those receiving custodial sentences thereafter <e> <s> therefore although i agree with a certain amount of what the noble lord said in his supplementary question i think that his own plan would be neither desirable nor effective <e>", "<cs> my lords the further difficulty with this particular plan is that it picks out non-violent offenders as qualifying for an amnesty <e> <s> over half the prison population today are serving offences against property such as burglary and theft hardly appropriate for immediate release <e>", "<cs> not good my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord hunt <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what we are doing but we are just starting to do it and although it may be simple it is going to take some time <e>", "<cs> my lords there is of course a provision for early release clause in the criminal justice bill which is in committee in another place but only as a last resort to be decided by both houses of parliament and in order to prevent what in effect would be a breakdown in the prison system <e> <s> that includes obviously and i say obviously because that is the governments view consideration of what sort of classes of prisoner might be included in that unhappy event <e> <s> clearly the noble lord lord avebury and the government do not agree on this particular point and i suggest that we should wait to discuss this further when that bill arrives in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords of course this has been done recently in france <e> <s> i reply in the negative i am not aware that crime has decreased <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> first i must apologise to the house in that the print of the bill has been available only since thursday of last week <e> <s> it is a detailed bill and i realise that the short time available to study it has been inconvenient <e> <s> the government have also had to work overtime to update the briefing on the bill as it now appears in your lordships house <e> <s> however if the bill receives a second reading today i shall certainly undertake to make notes on the clauses of the bill available within a few days to those of your lordships who would wish to have them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord kilmarnock and the noble baroness lady robson for what they have said about the letters which i sent to them trying to put the view of the government on this matter <e> <s> i am only sorry that we still have a difference of opinion on this <e> <s> the position that the government reached at the end of the committee stage was that we proposed that all offender patients whether restricted or non-restricted should have the right to apply directly to a tribunal once in the second six months of detention and then once in every month period thereafter <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked me a specific question about transferred prisoners and wanted to know whether his interpretation was correct <e> <s> the noble lords interpretation of that particular point was absolutely correct <e>", "<cs> my lords before i reply to the noble baronesss amendment perhaps i may answer the question of the noble lord lord avebury on the previous amendment which i did not answer about prisoners who are transferred after the passage of the bill but before it comes into effect <e> <s> it is the noble lords wish i think that the benefit of an immediate tribunal entitlement by some means and the noble lord said he thought it would be difficult to find the right means should be accorded to such people <e> <s> patients of that kind will be able to request my right honourable friend the home secretary to refer their case to a tribunal <e> <s> i am sure that such a request would be considered sympathetically <e>", "<cs> my lords to turn to the amendment moved by the noble baroness amendment no <e> <s> it really has three legs <e> <s> the first leg would give a prisoner in respect of whom reports had been made recommending transfer to hospital under section a right to see those reports <e> <s> i must tread carefully here because the noble lord lord winstanley and other noble lords are medical men and i am not a doctor <e> <s> speaking however as a patient those of us who are not detained in hospital but who nevertheless are patients do not have any right to see the notes which our doctors make about us <e> <s> nor do we see what the doctor may say in any letter which he may send to a hospital consultant on our behalf <e> <s> especially in a prison where neither the prisoner nor the doctor can voluntarily end their relationship i think that we must seriously consider the possible effects on that relationship of a requirement to disclose the terms of a medical report on a prisoners mental condition in cases where the secretary of state does not order a transfer direction and where the prisoner does not move out but remains with the doctor <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment of the noble lord lord kilmarnock begins with the words <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord he is referring to article although the question which he asked me and to which i was replying referred to article <e> <s> where we do have common ground is that what actually we are talking about so far as the case of <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord winstanley as regards this amendment tabled by the noble lord lord kilmarnock that there is one simple matter to be considered that is that i should have thought that anyone would want to encourage the court to consider bail instead of remand to hospital <e> <s> certainly the government agree with the noble lord in subscribing to that intention <e> <s> but that lies behind the existing wording of sub-section <e> <s> there are tactical and strategic difficulties in this amendment <e> <s> in the first place it would be difficult for it to be clear as to how the court is to be satisfied in the words of the amendment that the accused person will not be prepared to present himself for the preparation of a report <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i ought to emphasise that we are dealing here with a maximum period of detention in hospital for a report and not the period of time which would be accepted as being the norm <e> <s> by subsection of the clause the court may not remand an accused person for more than days at a time <e> <s> it is the combined length of such remands that must not exceed weeks <e> <s> thus before an accused person is detained for more than eight weeks under the clause the period of time which my noble friend feels would be about right the court will have had at least two occasions to consider the progress of the remand in open court with the benefit of repre <e>", "<cs> my lords the first part of this amendment is as the noble lord lord kilmarnock has said the same as the amendment which he put down on this subject at committee stage <e> <s> as he recognised we had a full discussion then and it would not be right if i tried to reply to the noble lord point by point this evening on arguments which we exchanged on the previous occasion <e> <s> all i should like to say is that i think my noble friend lord mottistone has a point on this <e> <s> whether or not my noble friend is right i think he is right i am also genuinely concerned as to whether an amendment of this kind would fall within the scope of the long title of the bill <e> <s> again that is debatable <e> <s> i would just say in passing that the noble lord lord kilmarnock covered this point in committee when he said that the mental health act amended the representation of the people act <e> <s> so it did but only to replace an old reference to mental defectiveness with the term mental disorder <e> <s> it did not make a substantive amendment to the act <e> <s> anyway that is as may be <e>", "<cs> my lords i can understand the reason which prompts the noble baroness to ask the question but i think that a general fund could inhibit the normally generous public response to locally initiated appeals <e> <s> as far as the machinery for charitable appeals is concerned i think it is suitable provided <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords my original answer read in part <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is right about this but in order for the organisers of a fund to be able to do this they must have received advice beforehand <e> <s> the advice which is being prepared by my right honourable friend the attorney-general is to be based on two formul which could be used by those organising the appeal funds <e> <s> depending on which formula is used the public would be in no doubt as to the charitable or non-charitable status of a fund <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right <e> <s> there is nothing to prevent anybody from giving money to what they consider to be a worthy cause <e>", "<cs> my lords that goes very wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think if we had a national fund it would have to distinguish between those who have suffered or died through a cause serious enough to warrant the term disaster and those who suffered or died prematurely for some other reason <e> <s> the problems inherent in drawing such a distinction would be difficult to overcome and in certain cases could result in great distress to the victims and their dependants <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kilmarnock expresses his desire with which the government certainly have sympathy that our law should be changed as quickly as possibly so that we are not for any longer than is absolutely necessary in a situation in which we fail to satisfy the requirements of the european convention <e> <s> the noble lord said that the government might argue that this was administratively very difficult <e> <s> that is precisely the argument i am going to put forward both that and that it is also legislatively extremely difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for the reception that they have given to my right honourable friends statement <e> <s> as the noble lord lord bruce of donington said we had a debate before christmas on a motion of my noble friend lord windlesham and i have no doubt that if it is for the convenience of the house arrangements can be made through the usual channels for further discussion in your lordships house <e> <s> in giving a welcome to the announcement the noble lord lord bruce was good enough to say that this is an important matter generally and i should like very strongly to notch the governments agreement with that <e> <s> before making the statement we considered that it is in both the industrial and the broadcasting interests of the country that the opportunities which technological development offer should be seized <e> <s> that is why although there are difficulties and there will be further problems which must be looked at carefully and overcome we have adopted a positive approach to direct broadcasting by satellite <e>", "<cs> my lords on the noble lords last point this is of course for consideration <e> <s> we are talking about a possible supplemental licence fee which will be certainly four years away and does not fall within the scope of the present duration of the licence fee even though the present fee is lasting for three years <e> <s> this of course must be considered by those who are concerned when we get nearer to that event <e>", "<cs> my lords what the statement says is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that my noble friend has asked me this <e> <s> this statement gives a green light to the british space industry and the bbc to negotiate and develop detailed proposals for an early start with direct broadcasting by satellite now <e> <s> so far as comparison with for instance the french and the germans is concerned we are not behind them <e> <s> we have given a lot more thought than our neighbours to the new programme services that our satellite channels could provide <e> <s> they have gone ahead for industrial reasons and for the moment are planning simply to rebroadcast their existing television channels <e> <s> our satellites should be in the air at much the same time as theirs <e>", "<cs> my lords the simple answer to that is i think yes <e> <s> there is a longer answer and if i may i should like to write to the noble lord about it <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been a worry expressed and the noble lord expresses it this afternoon about subscription services but if i may say so it is not one which i think the government share in relation to a bbc subscription service of this kind <e> <s> the corporation has affirmed that its first duty is to the licence fee payer and as the direct broadcasting by satellite study pointed out in fact in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his putting his finger on a difficult second point <e> <s> on the first point that he raised about the time lag i understand that the technology for being able to have direct broadcasting by satellite is already well-known <e> <s> we must now wait to see and probably we shall read of it in the press what british industry has to say in their negotiations with the bbc about the time-scale for getting started <e> <s> it has been the governments understanding for many months that it will be about before transmissions can begin <e>", "<cs> my lords this statement gives the green light for going ahead with direct broadcasting by satellite <e> <s> as far as the important questions of super <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord kilmarnock on the persistence with which he has moved an amendment which we have in essence discussed twice before and which the noble lord put down in identical terms at the previous stage of the bill <e> <s> for that reason my congratulations have to be tinged with a note of regret because under the circumstances there is not anything very new that i can say <e> <s> it is important that i should say something because the noble lord has deployed arguments against a move which the government in some ways regret because it appears at first sight that it is a withdrawal of a right <e> <s> in fact we have injected another right alongside it <e>", "<cs> the information requested is not collected centrally <e>", "<cs> my lords we are now testing five different types of mattress to find one which is more resistant to fire than polyurethane foam mattresses and one which if ignited will give off less toxic fumes <e> <s> so far as breathing equipment is concerned we are also testing two types of smoke protection hoods in four different establishments <e> <s> these hoods would not be used for fighting fires but for rescuing a prisoner from a smoke-filled cell <e>", "<cs> my lords the number of fires has broadly speaking been increasing <e> <s> i cannot i am afraid give the noble lord figures of the numbers which have been started deliberately <e> <s> as for precautions i replied to the noble baroness about the tests being carried out now on mattresses because we believe that they are the main cause of fire in prisons or rather the main hazard of fire in prisons arises from them <e>", "<cs> my lords the mattresses which are now being tested are the products of firms which have developed them themselves <e> <s> they would i have no doubt wish to secure the contract if there is to be a contract and we should have to look at the noble baronesss suggestion in that light <e>", "<cs> my lords we consider the intention expressed by the last two governments of the republic to be enough <e>", "<cs> my lords irish citizens have been able to vote here since the republic left the commonwealth <e> <s> our citizens can already vote in local government and european parliament elections in the republic <e> <s> as i have said the last two irish governments both undertook to enable our citizens to vote at dail elections <e> <s> it is true of course that there is some difference in the right to stand for the legislative assemblies in both countries <e> <s> that would of course mean that the republic would have to forfeit the delight of having the noble lord lord shinwell in the seanad <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord blease both for what he said about the merits of the case and also for drawing attention to the fact that the anglo-irish joint study on citizenship rights which was a joint study at official level between the two governments is a command paper which was published in november of last year <e> <s> the conclusion to that study was that citizens of both countries enjoy virtually all the rights and privileges of citizens of the host country reflecting the unique relationship between the two countries <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft representation of the people variation of limits of candidates election expenses order which was laid before this house on th february be approved <e> <s> my lords the amount of money a candidate may spend on the conduct or management of an election is as i need hardly say subject to statutory limits <e> <s> the representation of the people act empowers the home secretary to vary the limits on candidates election expenses by order subject to the affirmative resolution of both houses of parliament to take account of changes in the value of money <e> <s> the purpose of this draft order is to increase the limits on candidates expenses at parliamentary elections and at certain local elections <e> <s> it follows consultations with local authorities and all the political parties represented at westminster <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord underhill and lord tordoff for their support for the order <e> <s> as for the point they both made about the desirability of rounding off the figures for the variable expenses while i sympathise with the wish to keep the sums involved as straightforward as possible my right honourable friend is permitted by the terms of the order-making power to vary the figures only to the extent justified by changes in the value of money <e> <s> i am advised that any rounding of the variable elements to keep them in whole or half pence would therefore be outside the scope of the power under the order <e> <s> the proposed figures however should not present returning officers and election agents with undue difficulties <e> <s> the calculations will he no more difficult than those which were required under the representation of the people act and those which are currently required for local government elections in northern ireland <e> <s> having said that i accept that two wrongs do not make a right and i take the point that it would be desirable to try to round them off <e> <s> moreover i have explained the situation as we find it under the present order-making power <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i certainly understand the case which has been put very clearly by the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> like her i should not wish to do anything that would detract from the vital importance of the work which magistrates do in the united kingdom <e> <s> it is vital and very important work <e> <s> however in clause of the bill there is a point which i am sure the majority of the magistracy have appreciated <e> <s> indeed as the noble baroness very fairly said the magistrates association did not raise any objection to the proposal when it was put to them before the bill was brought to parliament <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is very agile and i shall obviously have to be swift in this committee to follow her but if i may put it to the noble baroness there is a little more to this than just taking an occasional licence application which comes up on the morning that the magistrates are sitting <e> <s> the whole kernel and pith of the argument that i am trying to put across is that in modern times it really is important for the protection of the public not only on disorder grounds and on the control of noise grounds but also on protection from fire grounds that proper study should be given to the giving of both yearly licences and occasional licences <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord jenkins for recognising the desirability of universality as far as public safety is concerned in the licensing of public entertainments <e> <s> the difficulty is and perhaps i may reply here to my noble friend lord fortescue that if on public safety grounds one goes for a uniform system as do clause and schedule then as the noble baroness lady birk in her speech made clear there are many magistrates benches which would not want to have these licensing powers <e> <s> in deciding who should have the licensing powers it really seemed impossible for the government to go for the magistrates courts when many benches had made clear that they took that particular view <e> <s> on the grounds of good administration and common sense the government felt that the district councils were the people to ask to take on the licensing powers <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is not wrong but it is not changing the course of the local authorities in this matter <e> <s> the noble baroness has quite rightly drawn my attention to the repeals and i apologise to her and to the committee for not making it clear that i was taking this into account <e> <s> schedule is doing exactly the same job as schedule except with regard to pop festivals <e> <s> it is perfectly true that under schedule the isle of wight will have removed from it a power regulating pop festivals <e> <s> a few other local authorities will have some rather more peripheral powers with regard to pop festivals <e> <s> they comprise a special subject which we shall be debating later <e>", "<cs> i have been taken rather by surprise at the brevity with which the noble baroness has introduced this <e> <s> on my reading of this amendment no <e> <s> when taken in conjunction with amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords when the bill had its second reading i and my noble friend lord bellwin gave assurances to your lordships that the government were considering whether it would be possible to introduce some sort of control with regard to pop festivals <e> <s> since then we have gone into this at some length and given detailed consideration to the problems <e> <s> but i felt that we ought to hear the views expressed by your lordships on these two amendments <e>", "<cs> certainly <e>", "<cs> i understand the concern which the noble baroness expressed and i assure her that i was aware that such concern existed <e> <s> however i am rather worried by the amendment <e> <s> this is an area of social control where the issues are complex and sensitive and it is necessary to consider how far it is right to interfere with business activities which are not inherently unlawful and to consider the extent of the mischief complained of the scale of interference which might justifiable and the effectiveness with which the proposed controls might be enforced <e> <s> i do not intend to go into those matters in depth in fact i shall pick out only one of them and the noble baroness lady david talked about the extent of the mischief complained of <e>", "<cs> the first thing i should like to say is that i appreciate the concern which the noble baroness lady stedman has expressed so far as village halls are concerned in relation to schedule paragraph and indeed which every single member of the committee expressed until quite rightly the noble baroness lady birk put her finger on the fact that the debate had been perhaps couched in rather narrower terms than the effect of the amendment <e> <s> i agree with the noble baroness in that <e>", "<cs> yes i will of course write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> we are treading over familiar ground because we debated this earlier on i say in reply to the noble lord lord foot that we are not debating uniformity for its own sake we are debating the principle of uniformity because the government believe and the local authorities feel that on grounds of public safety in a modern world it really is necessary to have some standards which can be relied upon particularly with very large gatherings of people for public entertainment in a modern world if one happens to be meeting in one end of the country or the other <e>", "<cs> this amendment would give a local authority the right to impose as a matter of general principle a complete prohibition on trade in the materials covered by the schedule <e> <s> i think the speeches which have been made in this debate on this amendment have shown that there are deep feelings generated by this particular subject and also by this particular amendment <e> <s> i think the problem with the amendment is that even though the trade which would go on in those places could be entirely lawful under the general criminal law as the law stands what we should be doing in a local government regulation bill would in fact be altering the general criminal law <e> <s> having said that i do hope that the noble earl lord halsbury and indeed my noble friend lord nugent who has not yet spoken to the amendment will not be under any misapprehension that the government in taking the view which we do which i am going to explain very briefly are any less concerned to ensure that local authorities are provided with fully effective powers to control these premises <e>", "<cs> with respect i do not agree with the noble lord <e> <s> as my noble friend lord tranmire pointed out locality is defined in schedule paragraph <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> i think that my noble friend lord swinfen really answers the question by asking it <e> <s> obviously if in relation to any premises the locality is clearly going to be the whole of the local authority area that is the locality for the particular application <e> <s> but if the local authority on receiving an application decides that the locality is a particular area in a town then that is the locality <e> <s> however i repeat i do not believe when one reads schedule paragraph that it will by any stretch of the imagination be possible for an applicant for a sex shop licence in some way to slip through the licensing procedure because the applicant can find a locality which is not covered by the definition <e>", "<cs> i repeat that if one looks at schedule paragraph it says <e>", "<cs> i shall give way once more <e>", "<cs> i do not think that it is entirely easy to interpret <e> <s> what i am absolutely certain about is that the chief officer of police does not with respect to the noble lord lord ross have anything to do with it at all <e>", "<cs> obviously localities will fall within the force area of a chief constable <e> <s> as regards that point it is as simple as that <e> <s> as regards the point which we have been discussing in question and answer i would just add the following <e> <s> flexibility is needed in that almost certainly locality does not mean the whole area of the local authority district because almost certainly there will be applications for different areas <e> <s> however i repeat what i have said before first of all the local authority will presumably have to take into account the nature of the application <e> <s> that must persuade the local authority as to what the locality for that application is liable to be <e> <s> secondly the local authority presumably must consult its own officers as to what it believes the correct locality is <e> <s> thirdly i repeat i do not believe therefore that there is any possibility but i would obviously like to look at this again and will certainly do so as a result of this brief exchange of an application in some way slipping through a loophole by being able to suggest that it does not belong to any locality covered at all <e> <s> i shall certainly give way to the noble earl <e>", "<cs> may i look at the matter again <e> <s> i think that i have said as much as i can and the noble earl and indeed any other noble lord can return to the matter <e> <s> i shall return to what i believe is the <e>", "<cs> i must make it absolutely clear to my noble friend lord lauderdale that i think that it is highly important i am absolutely at one with the noble lord lord halsbury and the noble lord lord nugent that one of these amendments should go on to the face of the bill <e> <s> i think that on the grounds that i have tried to deploy the governments amendments are the more appropriate <e> <s> i know that governments are very fond of saying that they want their own amendments <e> <s> however i do think that in a local government bill which is a controlling measure to put in an amendment which in fact would change the criminal law would be less appropriate than putting into the bill if your lordships agree amendments which would tighten the control in this area on which many of your lordships feel so deeply <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would speed matters along after the long debate we have just had which has covered so much of the ground if i spoke to the next amendment in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> certainly the noble lord lord jacques has put his finger on an important drafting point <e> <s> section ought to read schedule and it ought to read schedule for a good reason because people will want to know what is the schedule which is the operative part of the bill so far as the rules about sex establishments are concerned <e> <s> but with respect to the noble lord if the requirement for a notice is confined only to paragraph that would not be satisfactory <e> <s> there would be no obligation to give the date on which the licensing controls are to come into force to give one example <e> <s> but more generally i think that without taking up a huge amount of print in the local press it would not be beyond the wit of the local authority concerned to make up a <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord would withdraw the amendment for the reasons i gave i shall certainly look at the matter again <e> <s> i admit that last night i began to write on a piece of paper the sort of headings i thought might be needed at short notice <e> <s> it came to rather a long list and i tore the piece of paper up and decided not to use it in the debate on this amendment <e> <s> i think the noble lord has a point and i will undertake to look at it again <e> <s> meanwhile perhaps he would agree so that the text of the bill makes sense to withdraw his amendment and agree to the following one <e>", "<cs> in the second reading debate on the bill concern was expressed that the inclusion of the words to which all the amendments are directed relating to the definition of premises could imply that in some way parliament condones such activity <e> <s> i think that it was implicit in the first question that my noble friend lord nugent asked that this point still very much concerns him <e> <s> i am most grateful to the right reverned prelate the bishop of norwich for referring back to the previous amendment and making plain yet again that by bringing paragraph of the schedule to the head of the schedule we shall be making clear that sex shops are subject to the law and that the schedule makes lawful nothing that is presently unlawful <e>", "<cs> it is clear from the information that i have received from the metropolitan police about these premises that they can and do serve as a front for prostitution <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lord nugent on that <e> <s> i understand that there were four such premises in operation in the soho area last year and that proceedings have been taken in each case alleging brothel keeping <e> <s> in two only of the three cases which have been decided were convictions secured on that count <e> <s> the third case resulted in an acquittal <e> <s> my understanding is that it was not disputed that prostitution had taken place but the court was not satisfied that the defendant was responsible <e> <s> the fourth case is being heard today <e>", "<cs> lord houghtons concern is that a local authority should not be able to negate the effect of issuing a licence by prescribing that the premises may trade in certain types of articles but not in others <e> <s> if we take premises which are operating wholly as a sex shop the advice which i have received is that a local authority would be acting <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boston refers to the reply as disappointing but he also of course puts his finger on the reasons why it is not possible to give an absolute assurance that is because spending priorities within the prison service and the pressure of numbers and the heavy demands upon building resources caused by years of neglect make it impossible to give the absolute assurance that the noble lord asks for <e> <s> however in the second part of his supplementary the noble lord mentions the desirability of increased expenditure <e> <s> i think i ought to say that whereas in the financial year we are just finishing the estimated expenditure will be some <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i think particularly in the spheres of remedial education where a great deal more is asked of the prison education service than is asked of the education service in the country generally and also in the area of examinations where the success rate is remarkably high that the prison education service is to be congratulated <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an interesting question but it does not really arise on the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord an absolutely straight answer to that because we are in the process of deciding exactly how the statutory rules relating to education and training are to be re-written but i assure the noble lord that they are to be re-written to take account of the new young offenders legislation in the criminal justice bill which is now before the house of commons and of course has not yet come to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords within the budget figures that i gave at the beginning we shall certainly take account of what my noble friend lady macleod has said about the importance of vocational training <e> <s> i confirm the truth of what my noble friend has said about the standards in vocational training that are achieved by prisoners <e>", "<cs> i think we should look at that in the context of the annual report of the prison service my lords and i shall draw the attention of the prison department to what the noble and learned lord said <e>", "<cs> my lords the attendance system has not yet been agreed with the prison officers association <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like if i may to say a brief word from the point of view of the government on the instruction of the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> i have no doubt the committee will wish to address itself quite properly to the question of whether the burnley dog by-laws can be confirmed under the public health act <e> <s> but whether or not it would be confirmed must remain a hypothetical question since my right honourable friend the home secretary would reach his decision on the merits of a particular case as and when it arose once he had satisfied himself that the by-law was legally valid <e> <s> i think these legal problems are a matter for the committee to discuss in depth and therefore from a rather different point of view i am saying very much the same as my noble friend lord sandford that with respect to the noble lord lord houghton the instruction would be of very little effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl lord grey for his explanation of the purpose of the amendment <e> <s> but i do not think that there are any grounds for believing that the requirement in paragraph of schedule that an application should give the private addresses of the directors of the company concerned will encourage anything untoward so far as that is concerned <e> <s> what i mean by that is the following <e> <s> i think that local authorities will act responsibly and will not make public those private addresses which have been given to them when there is no need under the schedule to do so <e> <s> i would point out also that this information will not have to be given in the public notice which an applicant is required to give under paragraph of the schedule <e> <s> i understand from the metropolitan police that it is important that private addresses should be given because the police must be able to consider properly whether they should submit observations on the grounds for refusal relating to the suitability of an applicant or those on whose behalf the business would be managed <e> <s> therefore while i understand why the noble earl has put the amendment before the committee i do not think that there is any reason to have any apprehensions that these addresses will be made unnecessarily public and i think that the provision in the bill to this effect is necessary <e>", "<cs> it is indeed the case that this amendment and the governments amendment no <e> <s> are <e>", "<cs> may i first pick up the point made by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i was grateful to the noble lord for making the criticism he did of lord jacques amendment <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord mishcon and i agree with the noble lord lord nugent that lord jacques amendment almost certainly is the more elegant of the two if one compares amendments no <e> <s> and <e> <s> there is the difficulty which it is worth repeating to get it on the record that it is arguable that the noble lords amendment puts the proposition the wrong way round <e> <s> focusing on a sex establishment in this context might mean that it would be inappropriate to have that particular establishment in the relevant locality and not necessarily as is intended that it would be inappropriate in relation to the relevant locality to have any sex establishments there at all <e> <s> as i understood it that was what the noble lord lord mishcon meant by saying that the governments amendment is the more robust <e>", "<cs> may i repeat the words that i spoke just now <e> <s> i said that although as i indicated in answer last time to my noble friend lord swinfen it would be possible in theory for a district or borough council to take the view that the whole of its area should be regarded as the relevant locality i thought it most unlikely that it could reasonably do so <e> <s> the reasons why it was most unlikely that it could reasonably do so i deployed in the statement that i have just made <e> <s> but of course this would ultimately be a matter for the courts to decide <e>", "<cs> i have not forgotten the government amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i do not speak as a lawyer but i speak having been briefed that of course these decisions by local authorities would always be subject to judicial review <e>", "<cs> i shall of course consider what my noble friend has put to me but i must consider it in the context of what i have said today <e>", "<cs> if the amendment of the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby were made it would not i think be difficult for someone wishing to open a sex shop in a particular locality to say that there was some demand for the premises <e> <s> that might be true even w here there was already an establishment of this kind in the locality but it was not in as convenient a position as it might be <e> <s> of course where a sex shop already existed on the coming into force of the licensing arrangements it could no doubt be argued that its existence was evidence of demand and that accordingly on that ground the premises ought to be licensed <e>", "<cs> i really do think that this is covered as my noble friend suggested in moving the amendment <e> <s> indeed i would go so far as to say that i do not think there is the slightest reason to think that the views of residents will not be heard loud and clear when an application is made for the establishment of a sex shop <e> <s> applications will have to be given publicity that is taken care of in paragraph of schedule <e> <s> specific provision is indeed made for the lodging of objections and of course paragraph of the schedule enjoins the licensing authority to have regard to any objections which it receives <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may say just one more word to the committee <e> <s> i will certainly look to see as a result of what my noble friend lord sandford has said whether there ought to be a reference back from paragraph <e>", "<cs> i will give thought to the words that the noble lord lord mishcon has invited the government to consider might be desirable to add to this amendment if the committee agrees it <e> <s> the only thing i think it will be helpful for me to say is that to exclude a judicial review would be questionable in principle and as far as my department knows it would be unprecedented in a matter of this sort <e> <s> that is the advice i have received and i think it only helpful for me to impart it across the floor of the committee <e>", "<cs> i am interested that one of the things that this debate on the amendment has shown up is the difference of view between the noble earl lord halsbury who earlier said he thought that i as the government spokesman for this bill was reluctant and was being dragged along in the direction which the noble earl felt we ought to go and the noble lord lord houghton who accused me of pulling the com <e>", "<cs> i am a little disappointed after giving a reply to the noble lord lord houghton at column of the <e>", "<cs> i should like to accept these amendments <e> <s> all i would say is that the intention of the noble lord lord robertson of oakridge is incorporated in four different amendments and that i am advised that his intention might be achieved more concisely by making the matter the subject of a new offence <e> <s> if the noble lord would consent to withdraw the amendments i would give an undertaking that we <e>", "<cs> it is of course already open to local authorities to make what arrangements they like for regulating their administrative processes <e> <s> they do not need a formal rule-making power for this process nor do they need such a power to enable them to publish and circulate whatever arrangements they have decided on <e> <s> if my noble friend lord nugent of guildford feels that this really would add a safeguard which would go beyond what i have just said of course i should be only too ready to consider the amendment <e> <s> as things stand though it seems to me that it would be simply writing into the bill what is already the case <e> <s> as my noble friend knows from his long experience of legislation that is something which draftsmen do not like to do <e> <s> i wonder whether i could put the matter to my noble friend like that <e> <s> he might care to have a further word with the local authorities who are concerned with the matter and i might like to have a further word with those who advise me <e> <s> and perhaps we could together have a further word about it before we reach report <e> <s> at the moment however i do not think i ought to accept the amendment as it stands <e>", "<cs> i was a little surprised when i saw this amendment on the marshalled list because i know the views held by the noble baroness lady birk regarding the undesirability of local authorities having the power to impose a ban on sex shops <e> <s> i would have thought that this amendment was somewhat draconian <e> <s> it is entirely usual in circumstances where a licence is issued subject to certain conditions to enable a licensee to apply to have a particular condition varied <e> <s> i am talking here about licensing generally for example a similar provision is contained in paragraph of schedule to this bill <e> <s> i believe that in principle it is reasonable for people to come along and ask if they may have a variation to a licence <e>", "<cs> for just one year which is a very short period <e>", "<cs> first may i say that i think there is a difficulty with this amendment in that the wording of the bill refers to reasonable fees it has this advantage in that sub-paragraph of my noble friends amendment is drafted in terms of the costs and fees for a particular year <e> <s> i think it would be reasonable and i think certainly possible under the paragraph as it exists in the bill for a local authority to seek to balance its hooks over a longer period taking into account the fluctuations in expenses that may occur <e> <s> the present provision in the schedule therefore affords a greater degree of flexibility than does the amendment <e>", "<cs> the maximum fine normally available to the magistrates courts is currently and beyond that figure it is generally the case that trial in the crown court is made available <e> <s> we have proposed an exception in the bill in schedule to that normal rule in this instance by providing a much higher fine on summary conviction than is generally available and by restricting the offences to summary proceedings only <e> <s> i would say at the outset that when my noble friend lord nugent refers to the delays that there are in the crown courts indeed there are delays also in the magistrates courts although things have been getting better as a result of the great efforts being made so far as court administration is concerned by my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor <e> <s> i would ask my noble friend lord nugent to look as i know he will very fairly at the desirability in these cases of trying to bring cases on reasonably swiftly and therefore choosing the magistrates courts <e> <s> if <e>", "<cs> the case of pollution of course which the noble baroness and my noble friend are putting to me is an offence which is triable either way <e> <s> your lordships may chorus to me why not make this offence triable either way <e> <s> we are then beginning to get into the setting of precedents and it would be possible then to start looking at other offences and saying that they should be triable either way when they are only summarily triable at the moment <e> <s> therefore at present we have provided in the bill that these offences should be triable summarily <e> <s> there is advantage in them being triable summarily in the fact that they are cases which will be brought on the more swiftly thereby <e> <s> by putting the maximum at it is very much higher than is the norm to be found in magistrates courts <e>", "<cs> i must say that i am becoming a little uneasy at the desire to increase these penalties and i say that for the following reason <e> <s> i think that it is worth my just reminding the committee that the government have taken and your lordships have been good enough to recognise it quite a firm line so far as some of the substantive provisions of schedule are concerned in order to make it possible for local authorities to take a firm line in considering the desirability or the undesirability of the establishment of sex shops <e>", "<cs> the glc bill is a bill relating only to london and of course this bill relates to the whole country <e> <s> but i shall most certainly look at this again <e> <s> i would ask your lordships for your part to look at the arguments which i have also put forward <e> <s> i do not think that these cases are always absolutely cut and dried <e> <s> if the amendment is withdrawn i shall certainly look at it and take further advice <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord swinfen for reminding us of that and i would add to what he said that the noble lord lord houghton is not correct in his assertion that this point was not looked at in the house of commons <e> <s> it was precisely pressure there to the effect that allowing an appeal to the courts in betting cases had resulted in an undesirable <e>", "<cs> i am not as conversant with order no <e> <s> as the noble lord lord wigoder <e> <s> my understanding has always been that judicial review allows a case to be brought on swiftly and leaves a considerable amount of discretion to the court <e> <s> broadly speaking i believe that what the noble lord says is the case <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that this quite gives effect to what on behalf of the government i was saying was our objective <e> <s> the effect of the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord jacques would be that a licensing authority would have to give preference to these premises in the actual process of considering applications <e> <s> i think that the amendment is misconceived because paragraph of schedule does not come into play unless the licensing authority is intending to approve some applications <e> <s> it is unnecessary therefore to provide by implication as the amendment does that it may decide to approve none <e> <s> as a result of agreeing with amendment no <e> <s> which the committee has done i think we have provided that a licensing authority may conclude that nil is the appropriate number of sex establishments in a particular locality <e> <s> but it is wholly undesirable in any case to imply that existing premises should not have to be judged by the same standards as would be applied to future premises <e> <s> it would be a result of this amendment that a licensing authority would be under an obligation to issue a licence to an existing business when on strict merits it might not do so <e> <s> i am absolutely certain that that is not the result which the noble lord lord jacques wishes to bring about <e> <s> i think that my interpretation of the words which the noble lord wants to insert into the bill is the correct one <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord would like to have a look at what i have said because if i am right in my interpretation then i think the effect of his amendment would be one which he would not want to achieve <e>", "<cs> yes i am suggesting that these words are not necessary <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for picking up these points <e> <s> i know that my explanation was long and not entirely easy to follow <e> <s> it enables me much more briefly to make two or three main points <e> <s> first the whole point of the cinematograph bill the private members bill which mr lloyd in another place is promoting would be to make these bogus cinema clubs subject to an existing well-established licensing system which gives the cinema licensing authority the district councils and in london the greater london council complete control over what may be shown <e> <s> cinema licensing enables the licensing authorities which i have just mentioned to control the films exhibited <e> <s> a sex cinema could be a sex cinema only if the cinema licensing authority allowed it to be <e> <s> the logical course therefore is to control cinemas by means of cinematograph licensing and it is with this bill coming along from the house of commons that the opportunity for that to be done presents itself <e>", "<cs> certainly <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord lord northfield this reinforces the local authorities argument that we ought not to jettison the sex cinema provisions of schedule <e> <s> this amendment does not do that it does not jettison the sex cinema provisions of schedule <e> <s> we are going to keep them on ice with an order-making power so that on the same day that the cinematograph bill passes into law these provisions relating to sex cinemas in schedule will be brought into effect at exactly the same time <e> <s> if by any chance mr lloyds bill flounders in either house then the sex cinema provisions of schedule would come into effect at the same time as the rest of this bill <e>", "<cs> i believe it is about to reach report stage in another place <e> <s> i meant if i did not say it that if all goes well the bill will become law at the end of the parliamentary session in october or november <e> <s> but as your lordships committee will know if a private members bill has a fair wind it can become law earlier than that <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that this amendment is necessary <e> <s> the purpose of paragraph <e>", "<cs> to allow a newspaper stall which is metres high instead of metre would appeal to someone like myself very much indeed <e> <s> i have great pleasure in accepting the intention of the amendment <e> <s> perhaps i can make the point that we must consult the local authority associations <e> <s> on each of the provisions in the bill we have endeavoured to do this <e> <s> i am certain that there will not be any objections <e> <s> if we are satisfied that the local authority associations have no objections i give an absolute undertaking to introduce a suitable amendment on report or to offer one to the noble baroness <e> <s> i am sure the noble baroness will not mind if we also look at the drafting <e> <s> i hope she will find that a suitable reply <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness expresses apprehension that the licensing controls may be misused indeed that a trader may use a licence to trade in a way that the licence does not allow <e> <s> i wonder whether i could remind the committee of the controls provided by the licensing system in this schedule <e> <s> the licensing authority must specify in the licence the street in which the days on which and times between which the licence holder may trade and the type of articles he may display for sale <e> <s> in addition the licensing authority may stipulate precisely where in the street his stall may be placed and how large it may be <e> <s> it has power to require an applicant for a licence to submit two photographs of himself with his application <e> <s> i really do not think under those circumstances it would be possible for a supposed assistant to set up a stall in another part of the market for instance or to trade at the wrong time or in the wrong goods without the licensing authority being able to distinguish him from the licence holder <e>", "<cs> that was a printing error and i was full of hope that it would remain because when we reached the amendment i was going to say not moved <e>", "<cs> i agree entirely that it is a technical amendment <e> <s> i disagree totally that it is an improvement <e>", "<cs> the reason why i disagreed with the noble lord about the merits of his first amendment no <e> <s> a is that in this and indeed in succeeding <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would be worth my saying this very briefly <e> <s> speaking personally and also speaking from this dispatch box i have nothing but goodwill for those who provide late night refreshments <e> <s> i personally have been the beneficiary of late night food shops on many occasions in various different ways <e> <s> the government have tried to make it clear that they have no antipathy towards these shops by relaxing the suggestions which were made in another place for the closing procedure which of course again i should like to underline is discretionary and can only be brought into effect if people living in the neighbourhood complain on the specific ground of disturbance <e>", "<cs> yes indeed <e>", "<cs> in proposing that closing orders should remain in force for a finite period we think it right that the continuing need for a closing order should be reviewed from time to time <e> <s> we consider that three years is a reasonable period for an order to lapse unless renewed given that in most cases the circumstances which give rise to the need for a closing order are unlikely to change substantially during that time <e> <s> of course if they do then as the noble lord has said it will be open to the keeper of the premises to apply for a variation order <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble lord has moved this amendment because it is important that i should have the opportunity to clarify the wording of the bill at this particular line <e> <s> i am advised that the amendment is unnecessary for these reasons <e> <s> by virtue of the interpretation act the word person in the definition of the keeper in clause already includes a body corporate <e> <s> secondly where a body corporate controls a take-away food shop through a manager it is the body corporate and not the manager who would be the keeper and therefore for example would be able to make representations and appeal to the courts <e> <s> i hope that that assurance in fact clarifies the apprehensions that the noble lord has and that maybe it will enable the noble lord to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord lord beaumont was not in his place on second reading otherwise he would be aware that this has nothing to do with taking away power from local government <e> <s> on the contrary the whole bill is produced with the support of the local authority associations to prevent the need for the associations having to produce their own local government measures when their private legislation falls as a result of the local government act <e> <s> at the same time incidentally it will mean that the parliamentary timetable in both houses will have less to deal with in the form of private legislation <e> <s> i would also point out that clause is discretionary so if a local authority does not wish to adopt the clause it has no need to do so <e>", "<cs> as i understand the noble lord this group of amendments is designed first to close what he perceives to be a loophole <e> <s> i think the noble lord considers that if clause is enacted as it stands at present a district council may seek to extend the validity of closing orders by the making of a variation order which minutely alters the hours during which the closing order was in force in favour of the keeper <e> <s> i really cannot see what councils would gain from acting in that way <e> <s> if they were to do so it would still be open to the keeper of the premises to apply for an even more favourable variation or for a complete revocation of the closing order and to appeal to the court if his application were not granted <e> <s> if the court considered that the hours specified in the order were not justified it could instruct the council to vary the hours <e>", "<cs> i accept that amendment l would bring the bill into line with the greater london council act <e> <s> while i agree that many proprietors might wish to make their representations orally others might prefer to make them in writing <e> <s> i shall have to answer the noble lord in this way <e> <s> i have had to say once before this evening that i shall take something away and consult with the local authorities <e> <s> on this occasion if i were to be able to come anywhere near meeting the noble lord i should have a word with the local authorities about it <e> <s> they might find it onerous if they were to hear before a sub-committee a large number of oral representations when those representations could have been made in writing <e> <s> the noble lord may say that that is all very well but will the government simply do exactly what the local authorities want <e> <s> my answer to that is yes almost certainly <e> <s> we would attach very great weight to what the local authorities said <e> <s> if at the end of the day i could not come any distance towards meeting the noble lord then i should have to say so and he would have to consider his position <e> <s> i am sorry i cannot go further <e>", "<cs> the noble lords lord underhill and lord evans have described how bad this problem can be <e> <s> may i say that i agree with them <e> <s> it is today a very real problem in this country and of course the difficulty is that we probably do not have a realistic fining system under the litter act for anyone guilty of strewing litter in a public place <e> <s> but i do <e>", "<cs> i ought to thank noble lords for what they have said because their intentions and the intentions of the government are the same that is to try to remove the very considerable amounts of litter which are to be found in this country <e> <s> but as the impression may have been gained despite my words earlier that the government are not as sympathetic as they should be towards take-away food shops i must seize this opportunity to say that i am concerned about picking out take-away food shops and saying that in some ways they should be dealt with because of litter <e> <s> litter is to be found near to all kinds of public buildings and it is not the fault of those buildings <e> <s> it is also not the fault of the cinemas or the shops out of which people bring things which are wrapped <e> <s> it is the fault of all of us for throwing things on the ground in the street <e>", "<cs> i have sympathy with the intention behind the clause because anything that can be done further to promote the dual use or joint use of school premises and other local authority premises is desirable <e> <s> however the amendment does not distinguish between the regulation of the premises for school use and for the general public <e> <s> as drafted the by-law making powers would apply to the use of the school premises by pupils during school hours <e> <s> i believe this would be unacceptable from an educational point of view <e> <s> in addition some provision would have to be made in an amendment such as this for voluntary schools <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord ridley has drawn attention to the serious results of false alarms and indeed the noble lord lord underhill has confirmed this point <e> <s> it is expensive and possibly dangerous when an appliance goes off on a false alarm and assistance is not available in case a genuine alarm comes <e> <s> therefore the government have a great deal of sympathy with the purpose underlying the new clause <e>", "<cs> there are two points that i should like to make in reply to the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> on burglar alarms i should be very chary if we could possibly avoid it of doing anything to prevent people installing alarms although as we know from time to time the police take a view about the number of times they will accept false alarms and then they start saying to people who have burglar alarms sorry you have had too many we shall in fact cut you off <e> <s> i find that quite understandable but it is a conclusion which is to be regretted because in the interests of crime prevention as well as in the interests of fire prevention we want to encourage people to have alarms and not if possible to cut them off <e>", "<cs> i have not got the numbers of local authorities who have taken this power but the noble lord has put his finger on the problem <e> <s> if we make this mandatory then we do away with the powers which have been taken by some local authorities i think south yorkshire was the first to take the powers and say that instead of their own local powers they must take the powers which are set out in this part of the bill <e>", "<cs> the exemption of doctors and dentists from the application of clause reflects the governments recognition that acupuncture now has an accepted place in medical practice and as a form of anaesthesia in dentistry <e> <s> but although the noble earl lord halsbury made a characteristically strong case for this amendment and has been supported by the noble lord lord airedale the fact of the matter is that the same cannot be said of the practices of members of the professions supplementary to medicine none of whose controlling bodies as yet recognise acupuncture as a part of the practices of the professions for which their state registered members are trained and that is the distinction in this particular case of acupuncture between the professions supplementary to medicine and the exemption of doctors and dentists <e>", "<cs> the argument is simple <e> <s> the exemptions are for medicine and for dentistry and for no others <e>", "<cs> i have no idea of the answer to that particular question <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness indicated in her speech the possible health hazards from exposure to ultraviolet radiation are different from acupuncture because the processes are different <e> <s> the information i have is that the health and safety executive have made an approach to the local authority organisations as to whether some form of registration would be useful so far as ultraviolet tanning is concerned and they hope to have discussions on the matter <e> <s> as ultraviolet tanning and acupuncture are different processes and the dangers from them are of different kinds i do not think that one can take acupuncture as being an example in trying to put this amendment into the bill <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble baroness will agree that the thing to do is to await the outcome of the health and safety executive approach to the local authority organisations which may lead to registration for ultraviolet tanners but this will depend on the outcome of those discussions <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot promise that <e>", "<cs> perhaps this is something on which i should write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i think we have just thought it up and that it is rather a good one <e> <s> i do not think at this hour in the evening i can be any more creative <e>", "<cs> my lords the details for approval of taxis are entirely a matter for the assistant commissioner traffic of the metropolitan police and my right honourable friend the home secretary has no power to intervene <e> <s> i confirm that i have heard the same as my noble friend about the effect of the seats in existing taxis <e> <s> i understand that an orthopaedic seat is now available for drivers and that it has proved popular with cab drivers <e>", "<cs> my lords great care is being taken over the design of the new taxi <e> <s> what we need is a specialised vehicle that is robust manoeuvrable roomy and quick to board and i understand that the new design for the cr satisfies those requirements <e>", "<cs> i take seriously what my noble friend says my lords <e> <s> i do not think my noble friend lord selkirk has been shut off from taxi drivers <e>", "<cs> my lords just because the design of the taxi is of that age it does not necessarily mean that the seats on which the drivers are sitting are of that age also <e> <s> more seriously the present design referred to in my original answer as the fx the taxi we all see round the streets must be one of the safest vehicles on the road in years only two people have been killed in taxi accidents <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall draw the attention of the assistant commissioner traffic of the metropolitan police to the question which the noble lord has asked <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall also draw the attention of the assistant commissioner traffic of the metropolitan police to the point my noble friend raises <e>", "<cs> my lords the cr has been especially designed with the needs of the disabled in mind <e> <s> i am advised that it will easily be able to accommodate wheelchair passengers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that the cr will also easily be able to accommodate courting couples <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give that positive assurance to my noble friend lord balfour of inchrye but i shall most certainly draw the attention of the assistant commissioner traffic of the metropolitan police to my noble friends supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the cr is concerned as i said the need is for a robust manoeuvrable roomy and quick-to-board vehicle and i understand that the cr fulfils those particular specifications <e> <s> with regard to the conditions of fitness with which london taxis must comply and all the details that are needed i repeat once again that that is entirely a matter for the assistant commissioner traffic of the metropolitan police and my right honourable friend the home secretary does not have power to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble baroness <e> <s> i do not know the answer to that question <e> <s> once again i shall draw attention to the question in those quarters where attention should be drawn because i repeat my right honourable friend does not have power in this particular matter <e> <s> the power for approving and licensing lies with the metropolitan police <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend about the importance of this matter <e> <s> the government are looking urgently at the role of industry in the event of war <e> <s> meanwhile a great deal is being done and i will certainly give my noble friend the undertaking he has asked for <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a question which is ingenious but irrelevant <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have hitherto succeeded in convincing local authorities to fulfil the requirements of civil defence legislation <e> <s> if my noble friend has any information to the contrary i know that my right honourable friend would be very glad to have it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord boston to the noble lord lord hampton and the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for the reception they have given to this order <e> <s> it gives no pleasure to the government as it gave no pleasure to the previous government to introduce these orders but we believe they are necessary <e> <s> i am grateful to your lordships for sharing that recognition <e> <s> the noble lord lord boston asked me a specific question about the attitude of the police to the necessity for these powers under the act and the supplemental order <e> <s> i would join with your lordships in paying my tribute also to sir david mcnee the retiring commissioner of the metropolitan police <e> <s> the metropolitan police stand in the forefront of the operations against terrorism and sir david has shown splendid leadership in this respect as in every other way during his time as commissioner <e>", "<cs> so far as the government are concerned we showed in our racial attack study which <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my thanks to my noble friend lord renton for this most timely debate today and in regard to the thoughtful and constructive contributions to the debate made on this important subject may i thank also my noble friend lord mottistone for the generous remarks he was good enough to include in his speech <e> <s> may i be the last or the second to last probably to recognise the maiden speech of the lord chief justice <e> <s> in fact i was reminded that the noble and learned lord lord lane was a member of your lordships house as a lord of appeal in ordinary for a short time before he became lord chief justice <e> <s> we very much welcome that the noble and learned lord has seized the opportunity of this debate to make a speech which it was obvious the house very much appreciated <e> <s> i very much welcomed the remarks of the noble and learned lord lord lane setting the record straight in your lordships house about the proposal which the government had certainly seriously considered for what is called early release <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot add to what i said six weeks ago in the scarman debate <e> <s> because the noble and learned lord recommended in the way he did we immediately went to the police training council and said these are the scarman recommendations and asked the council to look at the recommendations from two points of view one from that of resources and the other from that of the balance of training as to how much of it should be in the classroom as it were and how much should be on the job how much should be in initial training and how much in in-service training <e> <s> not until we have the report from the police training council which i have said on the floor of the house my right honourable friend hopes to have in the autumn shall we be able to take the matter any further forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not disagree with the noble lord lord robbins but one is still left with the difficulty of having to define accurately and particularly in this case if this bill became law of having two different definitions running in the law side by side <e>", "<cs> i think i can answer that question off the cuff but what occurs to me on hearing the noble lord lord sainsbury is that i think his speech chimes in very well with the speech made by the noble lord lord davies of leek which suggested that in businesses which are depended upon for producing vital articles and the noble lord lord davies gave the example of a chemists shop which are probably not going to be particularly large businesses it is necessary for the matter to be worked out at local level <e> <s> it is with that point of view that i think the government strongly agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am worried by the proposals put forward by the noble baroness in this amendment because schedule which this amendment seeks to amend specifically exempts from blanket controls premises used wholly or mainly for the provision of amusements by means of gaming machines <e> <s> the reason for that is that the government at the time that schedule was legislated felt that it might be possible if there was a blanket ban for the business concerned to be put wholly in jeopardy <e> <s> having said that the government are aware that some local authorities feel strongly that their existing powers to control the proliferation of amusement arcades are inadequate and the home office is in touch with the local authority associations on this matter <e>", "<cs> i regret to say that it is extremely doubtful whether it would be by report stage <e> <s> i have no briefing to that effect <e>", "<cs> of course i take this amendment very seriously moved as it is by my noble friend lord ridley and supported by my noble friend lord drumalbyn but i am advised that one-day traders are already subject to the same statutory requirements as normal traders and that their activities are monitored by trading standards officers <e> <s> successful prosecutions have been brought against dishonest traders and i think this clause would be onerous to operate <e> <s> as drafted it is open to two main objections <e> <s> in the first place we think it would place unnecessary burdens on <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for that extra advice <e> <s> certainly i or my staff will look at what has been said but i do not think that this is necessarily getting in a watertight way at the dishonest trader <e> <s> that is one of the reasons which leads to the reservations which have been expressed for the government by myself <e>", "<cs> my lords the criminal injuries compensation board has been trying hard to establish arrangements for mutual co-operation with boards in other countries <e> <s> i would add to what my noble friend lady sharples has just said that to my knowledge we also have good co-operation with canada and australia <e> <s> we hope that mutual co-operation of the kind that we wish for will be a feature of a european convention on compensation for victims of crime which is currently under discussion in the council of europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i am terribly sorry but i have not followed the noble lord <e> <s> could the noble lord put it just a little more shortly and then i shall give an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble lord necessarily on that but i should like to look at it further and if there is anything i ought to add i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords in the criminal justice bill which is at the moment before the house of commons the government are introducing a provision which will require the courts to give preference to compensation over a fine on sentencing where the offenders means are limited <e> <s> but of course cases which are taken by the criminal injuries compensation scheme are precisely designed to overcome the problem which the noble lord lord shinwell has put to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i would entirely agree with the noble and learned lord <e> <s> when the criminal justice bill comes to your lordships house i think it will be found that greater weight is being placed upon this matter <e> <s> but the figures show that in there were orders made by the criminal courts and my advice is that the number of orders being made is increasing year by year <e>", "<cs> my lords that i think is a matter for the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i confirm that what the noble lord lord winstanley said is correct <e> <s> i think that the board has in mind the need to make the existence of the scheme known to citizens generally but i should like to take away what the noble lord has said and see whether there is anything which either the board or the government indeed ought to do in response to the noble lords suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i have not got that information <e> <s> if i may i will write to the noble baroness on that point <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has made a strong case in self-operated laundries and the government agree with the case that the noble baroness has made <e> <s> but local authorities have sufficient powers i think under the health and safety at work act and the health and safety enforcing authority regulations no <e> <s> to ensure that self-operated laundries are safe and without risk to the health of members of the public who go to them and to any staff who may be visiting the premises and pursuant to the speech of the noble baroness to any children who may be on the premises <e>", "<cs> may i add one word before the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs decides what is best to do about this amendment <e> <s> i am certainly very ready to look at the cost point which the noble baroness lady david made <e> <s> i feel i have not made the case as well as i should have done on that aspect <e> <s> if the noble baroness decides that she is prepared to withdraw the amendment i certainly would be very happy to look at that <e> <s> so far as the illustration of the noble baroness lady david is concerned i remember many years ago on a foreign holiday turning on a tap in a hotel bedroom and a frog came out of the tap <e> <s> it is true that unusual things can occur when you either open doors or turn on taps <e>", "<cs> certainly i will take into account anything that the health and safety executive have to say on the subject <e>", "<cs> i said that i would take into account what they have to say <e> <s> that means i should be very ready to get in touch with them to see what their views were <e> <s> i think it is a matter for the local authorities to get in touch with the health and safety executive if on their side they want to <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord underhill is seeking to present this amendment as a choice which will enable local authorities to think again about their rules and regulations on the zoning of where taxis may operate in their local authority districts <e> <s> i know the noble lord would agree with me that we must think about the consumer in this <e> <s> if i may say so i do not think that this amendment will benefit the consumer <e> <s> this is a proposal to empower additional restrictions on the taxi trade which would limit its ability to respond to public demand and to provide the service that the public wants <e> <s> we are being asked to accept a really quite far-reaching change to the general law on the basis of difficulties that i understand from the noble lords speech have arisen in bradford and with that i agree <e> <s> the noble lord also mentioned leeds <e> <s> i have certainly heard that mentioned in preparing for this afternoons debate but i am not aware that the home office has received any direct notification that leeds takes that view as well <e>", "<cs> i take the point which the noble earl lord grey is making in this amendment but i have reservations about the precise form of the words proposed in it <e> <s> it would seem to carry an implication which does not accord with the general tenor of the discussions on schedule that local authorities are obliged to licence existing and future sex establishments <e> <s> the committee has been at very great pains to make the point that this is not so and i think the contrary would be implicit if this amendment was made in exactly the words that the noble earl has chosen <e>", "<cs> my lords first i ought to make clear the effect of this motion by the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> the regulations that we are debating this evening are not subject to parliamentary procedure and would remain in force if your lordships voted for the noble lords motion <e> <s> however the government would take very seriously an adverse vote on this matter and my noble friend lord campbell of alloway was quite right to conjecture that the government would wish to give effect to the wishes of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> that is a matter my lords which i shall come to in just a moment <e> <s> i shall not go through the increases in fees which continued to occur under the previous government and now because in the speeches which have been made your lordships have quoted them <e>", "<cs> my lords i will come to that and if i do not entirely cover the point i shall endeavour to answer the noble lords question specifically before i finish speaking <e> <s> the increase in applications for naturalisation and registration at discretion where there is the greatest disparity between costs and fees because of the additional inquiries which are involved was proportionately even higher than for other applications <e> <s> in the intake of applications for naturalisation and registration at discretion was some <e> <s> last year it reached <e> <s> may i again say to the noble baroness lady jeger that one reason why we are asking for fees with applications is that these applications for naturalisation or registration by discretion take the longest to process because of the additional inquiries which have to be made and increased delays with these applications have consequently led in the past to increased delays in recovery of the fees <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i could help the house <e> <s> my noble friend who is habitually fair and objective was making a remark which was extremely helpful to the noble lord lord pitt and was showing the government that my noble friend who is also of independent mind had his own views on this particular subject <e> <s> if the noble lord lord avebury refuses to see any merit in anything my noble friend lord campbell of alloway says i am not particularly surprised that the noble lord fails to understand what my noble friend says <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make it clear that partnerships of less than six partners generally do not come within the scope of the race relations act <e> <s> the advertising provisions however apply as far as indirect discrimination is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i will take account of what the noble lord has said about the need in some cases for a specified knowledge of a particular language <e> <s> so far as religions are concerned i think the noble lord would accept that there has been a very long history of the close relationship between christianity and the practice of medicine <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend puts his finger on a point which is more apparent than real <e> <s> my noble friend might agree that it is sensible under section of the act to except the smaller partnerships from the scope generally of the act <e> <s> but the advertising provisions of the act in section apply to all partnerships of whatever size on the ground that a partnership large or small ought not to be free to publicise feelings which would be contrary to the intentions of the act <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now answer the private notice question asked by the noble lord lord peart <e>", "<cs> my lords for the very kind words to me personally of the noble lord lord peart i am grateful <e> <s> the noble lord asked me certain questions <e> <s> the first was whether there would be a chance of armed conflict before the house meets again after the easter recess and in that case an assurance that the house will be recalled <e> <s> i think it is well known on all sides of the house what will be the steaming time of the task force to the falkland islands waters <e> <s> i think calculations can be done by your lordships as to the likelihood of the possibility of a confrontation before the house meets again <e> <s> so far as an assurance being given to the house that in the event of a confrontation occurring the house will be recalled i think that this is a matter which ought to be pursued through the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord has bowled me out on the question of belize <e> <s> if it is not unacceptable i think that this is a matter on which i shall have to communicate with the noble lord afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord gladwyn and lord kennet for their kind remarks and for the support in essence of the answer which i have given to the noble lord lord peart <e> <s> the noble lord lord kennet asked me two questions <e> <s> the first in effect was about the result of external pressure upon the situation in the falkland islands with as the noble lord put it the ultimate objective of attaining our objective of recovery without the loss of blood in action <e>", "<cs> my lords my answer to my noble friends second question is yes <e> <s> a very vigilant eye will certainly be kept so far as that is concerned upon gibraltar <e> <s> may i thank my noble friend for his characteristically kind remarks to me which i very much value <e> <s> i am sorry but i cannot add to the list of commonwealth countries which the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has already given to the house in his supplementary question as supporting us in this matter but i should like to make it quite clear that the security council mandatory resolution which of course received more than the necessary number of votes in order to make it mandatory shows the very wide condemnation of the action taken by argentina <e>", "<cs> my lords the expression of view which the noble lord has given to the house is widely welcomed on all sides <e> <s> he mentioned the united states <e> <s> i would only say in rejoinder to the noble lord that of course we are in close touch with the united states <e> <s> we are after all very close allies <e>", "<cs> my lords the assurance that i should like to give to my noble friend is that our immediate objective to which we must devote all our efforts is to obtain the removal of argentine forces from the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount for his kind words to me <e> <s> he outlines very accurately the strategic and logistical difficulties of the position of the falkland islands in the south atlantic ocean <e> <s> but these problems we have experienced in the past can be overcome if we can put into effect the mandatory resolution of the security council <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord molloy for his kind words to me <e> <s> it is because her majestys government attach the first priority to the freedom of the people of the falkland islands to live for as long as they so wish in their own islands that we attach the greatest importance to the security council resolution which it is worth repeating calls for the immediate cessation of hostilities for immediate argentine withdrawal and a diplomatic settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am i think right in saying that the diplomatic discussions which took place up till the time argentina breached those discussions by the unilateral use of force on most occasions had been attended by representatives of the falkland islands <e> <s> i therefore find very little difficulty in giving that assurance <e> <s> may i also thank my noble friend for his characteristically generous remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point which the noble viscount makes <e> <s> i think that perhaps we ought to see today what the expressions of view are in both houses of parliament <e> <s> we have had a good opportunity in your lordships house to get views from all benches <e> <s> that is of great value and will be taken into very serious account by her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will understand that at this stage i would prefer not to comment on operational matters <e> <s> but may i quickly say to my noble friend that this should not be taken to imply either a confirmation or a denial of any reports of the possibility of help from other countries or of the importance of the other matters my noble friend has drawn to my attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord brockway for his remarks and i would answer that we welcome serious moves for negotiations for a peaceful settlement but i have to add to that that our immediate objective to which we must devote all our efforts is to obtain the removal of argentine forces from the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> my lords i will readily give my noble friend lord renton the assurance for which he asked first that the desire for peace should not be used as being a desire for appeasement <e> <s> my noble friend also asked about the position of those who are on south georgia <e> <s> in addition to the at grytviken there are other personnel including two ladies at various sites <e> <s> we have asked the swiss embassy in buenos aires in conjunction with the international committee of the red cross to inform the argentines of the need to ensure their safety on humanitarian grounds <e> <s> we are awaiting a response <e>", "<cs> my lords i am particularly grateful to the noble lord lord stewart of fulham speaking as a former foreign secretary for his kind words to me and i am sure your lordships will want me to express appreciation for the noble lords general remarks during the latter part of his speech about the need for vigilance and preparedness in the free world <e> <s> i also welcome the determination of your lordships not to allow the house to rise for the recess without drawing attention again to the plight of poland <e>", "<cs> my lords while of course the illegal argentine invasion continues <e> <s> it is there that the government and the noble lord lord brockway part company <e> <s> many of your lordships who spoke in the same sense will have been particularly heartened by the plain and robust statement of the noble lord lord greenhill that the rectitude of our case is incontestable <e> <s> perhaps i may just say to my noble friend lord morris that the government are in no doubt about the united kingdoms title to the islands a matter to which the noble lord lord shackleton referred on rd april <e> <s> as early as the mid-th century there was a british settlement on the falkland islands <e> <s> from until there was it is true a period of some confusion with spain britain and the then buenos aires government at various times occupying the island <e> <s> but in the british again occupied the islands and from that date we have been in open continuous effective and peaceful possession occupation and administration of the islands <e> <s> thus <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is precisely an opportunist and cynical attempt to take advantage of the force of geography which has led us into one of the most difficult crises the world has known since <e> <s> what i have just been saying leads us to take account of another factor which the most reverend primate the archbishop of canterbury recognised as being of fundamental importance and which is indeed enshrined in the charter of the united nations namely the right of self-determination of peoples <e> <s> in this context it is highly relevant that the inhabitants of the islands for whom the falklands are home have repeatedly made clear their wish in the past that the islands should remain british <e>", "<cs> my lords the secretary of state mr haig made his services available and we then invited him to london <e> <s> the fact that he is moving between the united states london and buenos aires means that he is of course the carrier of proposals but those are proposals which are in his safe hands <e> <s> we have made it quite clear that of course we will not go into detailed negotiations until there is a withdrawal that is an absolute <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord avebury that there is probably very little doubt but that the real objective of the signatories to this treaty is to destabilise matters in the horn of africa particularly the position of somalia <e> <s> so far as libya is concerned our relations have improved somewhat since when libyans were murdered on the streets of london <e> <s> this has enabled us to enter into some cautious dialogue with the libyans <e> <s> i will go little further than that in regard to that country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the facts do not support the suggestion made by the noble baroness <e> <s> last year we provided relief for refugees in somalia amounting to million and of course we have been donors towards the european community aid for somalia amounting to some million <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the government should take seriously the question asked by my noble friend lady airey and that is why the government attach considerable importance to the united states-somalia defence access agreement which was concluded in august and which provides the united states with facilities at berbera and mogadishu <e> <s> so far as the shadowy authority of the soviet union is concerned i would go so far as to say that the government do not believe that the soviet union inspired this treaty <e> <s> the national preoccupations of the three signatories are quite sufficient to explain the treatys terms <e>", "<cs> my lords it is because the government take seriously the point which has been put to me by the noble lord that we attach importance to the substantial aid which is given by the european community to these countries a matter which is of course kept under review <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both the noble lord lord shackleton and the noble lord lord gladwyn for their response to my right honourable friends statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord shackleton referred to the efforts being made by mr haig and the stance adopted by the united states government in this matter <e> <s> her majestys government accept that while mr haig is engaged in such very delicate negotiations the united states government consider it inappropriate to align themselves with either party although of course the united states government have fully supported security council resolution <e> <s> let me in saying that immediately go on to refer to the points made by both noble lords about the united nations <e> <s> here the government take the view that the implementation of security council resolution should remain the united nations first objective <e> <s> at present mr haigs mission offers the best prospects of this <e>", "<cs> my lords the information which i had rather less than an hour and a half ago was that mr haig remains in buenos aires <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for what he has said about the stance of the government and i am sure that my noble friend would join with me in saying that it has been very important that we have received wise and calm advice from all sides in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the government i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> it is worth reminding your lordships house that we are talking in the context of security council resolution which is mandatory and it is because that mandatory resolution has been flouted and by flouted i mean that on the day following the passing of that resolution the argentines invaded south georgia that the argentine has been more or less condemned by most countries in the rest of the world and has not been effectively supported in any way by the countries of latin america <e>", "<cs> my lords like previous administrations in government her majestys government have always made clear their willingness to negotiate on all aspects of the falkland islands dispute <e> <s> the argentines have never shown any interest in referring the sovereignty question to the international court and the fact is that we have not proposed it <e> <s> that therefore is the way in which the question of reference to the international court stands at the present time <e> <s> i think i should repeat that what we very strongly feel at the present time as a matter of policy is that the first thing to do is to ensure that security council resolution is implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly take on board what the noble lord has said but as i have already said the first priority for her majestys government is implementation of security council resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords my advice is as i replied to the noble lord lord robbins a couple of minutes ago <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already said to your lordships house the house would not expect the government to give details of the very delicate negotiations in which mr haig is involved at the moment <e> <s> but i do say that it is the objective of mr haigs mission to ensure that there is a peaceful negotiated settlement to this dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord is indeed being helpful in asking that question <e> <s> i confess that i had not thought the matter through as far as that <e> <s> i should like to make it quite clear that in her majestys governments view the question of sovereignty is of course not in issue <e>", "<cs> my lords from reports which we have received from those who have returned from the falkland islands we have not heard of maltreatment of people upon the falkland islands or indeed of the cessation of normal services <e> <s> but of course it is impossible to tell what are the real views of people whose country is occupied by an alien power <e>", "<cs> my lords i have understood that from the television transmissions <e> <s> however on this point i know no more than my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that because of the present situation of the very delicate negotiations of mr haig the house would not expect me to give any forecast of steps which her majestys government now intend to take <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to my noble friend that the policy of her majestys government towards south georgia is precisely the same as the policy of her majestys government towards the rest of the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly draw what the noble lord and the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones have said to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i was advised before making the statement to your lordships this afternoon that the argentines have never shown any interest in referring the sovereignty question to the international court and we have not proposed it <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of belabouring this point too far the words which i have just spoken in answer to lord beswicks last question were precisely the same words that i used when i originally answered the noble lord lord robbins <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord merrivale for his kind remarks <e> <s> the first question which he asked me was about the timing of the closure of the dockyard <e> <s> within the framework of the decision which was announced by the government last november the government will be as flexible as possible to ensure that any ill effects arising from the closing of the dockyard for royal navy purposes are avoided where possible or at least minimised and that the transition to commercial work if that is what is decided should be as smooth as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i confirm to my noble friend that the dockyard in gibraltar has rendered very valuable service in the present crisis which is facing this country <e> <s> i think it would be right for me just to remind my noble friend that it has already been agreed if both the gibraltar government and her majestys government accept the viability of a commercial dockyard operation after the royal dockyard has closed that subject always to parliamentary approval necessary surplus dockyard lands and assets will be made available free of charge <e> <s> moreover subject to detailed negotiation with the operator some continued naval work will be made available during and <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that is a very appropriate question <e>", "<cs> my lords a firm date has been agreed between her majestys government and the spanish government for the meeting which was to have taken place today when the negotiations agreed under the lisbon agreement will be carried forward <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords <e> <s> i take the point which is being made by my noble friend <e> <s> but i do not think we ought to let my noble friends question go by concentrating solely on the dockyard <e> <s> in addition to that the overseas development administration is financing a consultancy on behalf of the gibraltar government to investigate the prospects for alternative economic activities other than the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their response to my right honourable friends statement <e> <s> i should like first of all to thank both noble lords for the good wishes to my right honourable friend the foreign secretary <e> <s> they are typical of the support given by the noble lord lord shackleton throughout this matter from the opposition front bench and by noble lords from all parts of your lordships house <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord shackleton for the context in which he set the possibility of any united nations participation <e> <s> i think in response that it is worth pointing out that when this crisis began we immediately went to the security council that was the first thing that we did <e> <s> we were indeed of course very grateful for the response of world opinion and the terms of security council resolution <e> <s> our primary objective therefore remains the full implementation of that security council resolution <e> <s> the methods of course are open for discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord aylestone to whom i am also grateful for his response asks about the welfare of the islanders <e> <s> may i add to what i have said previously that her majestys government have asked the international committee of the red cross to inquire about the welfare of the islanders <e> <s> we understand that the argentine government have now told the icrc that they do not see a need for the international committee to visit the islands at this stage <e> <s> we remain in close touch with the international committee of the red cross on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i shall reply to my noble friend in more detail by letter because i have not got the details to answer that question <e> <s> the information i have if i may repeat what i said in my right honourable friends statement is that the latest group of inhabitants of the islands who have come to montevideo are almost all in fact maybe all not permanent residents of the islands <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the noble lord he says that the parliamentary support for the government which has been shown in both houses is not reflected in the rest of the country <e> <s> i must without more ado refute that allegation <e> <s> the noble lord lord jenkins although often we disagree is i think fair in the comments that he makes and i am sure he would agree that her majestys government are acting in good faith <e> <s> through mr haigs efforts progress has been made and as the statement has explained we are building on this <e> <s> we have in the forefront of our minds the need not to jeopardise such progress and i cannot at the moment say more in detail about that <e> <s> however i think the country is very well seized of the issues which are at stake and i believe it would be the overwhelming view of the people of this country that the hands of our forces should not be tied from taking any actions which may be necessary for the safety survival and if it comes to it the ultimate success of this matter in the interests of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend lord morris that under article of the united nations charter we are acting legally in doing what we feel we have to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that the noble lord is speaking in absolute good faith and with the wish to support the best interests of this country but i have nothing to add to what i have already said in answer to that question <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly draw the attention of my right honourable friend to that suggestion my lords <e> <s> as the house is well aware we are at the moment in the process of putting proposals through mr haig and as my right honourable friend the prime minister stated in the house of commons yesterday it is better not to get the wires crossed while that particular action is going ahead <e>", "<cs> i repeat my lords that we are acting in good faith that progress is being made and that we are building as best we can on that <e> <s> this afternoon i really cannot go further than that <e>", "<cs> once again my lords the proposals which were put to mr haig from buenos aires were argentine proposals <e> <s> there were aspects of those proposals which her majestys government have felt it was not possible to accept <e> <s> we have now put or are in the process of putting proposals to mr haig and that of course is the purpose of my right honourable friends visit to washington tomorrow <e> <s> i do not think that at the moment in these difficult and delicate matters we can go further than that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for asking that my lords because it enables me to underline the third of the three points with which the government believe that any negotiations that are to be concluded satisfactorily must deal namely the framework of the negotiations on the long-term solution to the dispute for which the united nations resolution calls <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord my lords and if the house will not think me evasive or unhelpful i think there is little else i could add this afternoon to my right honourable friends statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord and agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords the sending of the british task force is fully covered by article of the united nations charter <e> <s> however in saying that to the noble lord may i add that my right honourable friend the foreign and commonwealth secretarys journey to washington and all the efforts of the british government are designed to secure a peaceful settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords at the present time i do not think that it would be for the convenience of the house to pursue these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with the noble lord that the commercial officers in posts overseas do a very good job <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords i will look particularly at this point which my noble friend draws to my attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord

government departments which fall within the general policy of the government and those targets we intend to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to draw the suggestion of the noble lord on that point to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot do so <e> <s> i admit that the figures which i gave were selective <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for those remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i assure him that there is nothing between the noble lord and the government and i think the rest of the house on this particular matter <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a figure comparing with <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the importance which the noble lord lord brockway places upon the evidence which non-governmental organisations can give in the context of this special session of the united nations general assembly <e> <s> in the preparatory committee for the special session we are supporting the

seal namely that we are operating strictly within the rules of international law and strictly within the charter of the united nations <e>", "<cs> my lords i will in a moment say a little more about the united nations and if the noble lord lord brockway will forgive me i shall wait to pick up his point about the united nations <e> <s> but may i before i come to that simply say this <e> <s> the speech of my noble friend the lord privy seal made very clear that we have been in constant touch with the united nations since this matter began to see in what way the united nations could best play a part in this matter <e> <s> meanwhile i have to repeat at the risk of being tedious that it was the belief of the government and it remains our belief that diplomacy without any force in order to back it up would have been in this case diplomacy which would come to naught <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that the noble lord is right and that we differ in the methods <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will not think that i am suffering from a long day when i say that i think the noble lords methods would not lead to the right conclusion <e> <s> i hope and believe that the methods which parliament is supporting at the moment difficult and dangerous though they are may lead us to a just solution <e> <s> meanwhile as my noble friend the lord privy seal has made clear our representative at the united nations has been in touch with the secretary-general since the crisis began to try to explore ways in which the united nations can secure the implementation of security council resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords i take that point but there are two problems about that <e> <s> one is the effect which a statement of that kind would have for the people for whom we have a responsibility on the other side of the world <e> <s> the other is the final point which i made that if we made a statement of that kind we would be making it to people who have shown within the last five years that apparently they do not care about the outcome of arbitration <e> <s> nonetheless i repeat that i know it is a serious point and a point which is very much in your lordships minds and certainly we will look again at what has been said <e> <s> the important thing is that the negotiations which must be part of security council resolution should not be preudged and that in any negotiations we must be guided by the wishes of the islanders <e>", "<cs> my lords i will write to the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i shall reply to both noble lords for whose response to my right honourable friends statement i

be important points in this respect so far as the military situation is concerned when my noble friend lord trenchard comes to make his statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i would only repeat what i said a little while ago in answer to the noble lords lord stewart and lord gladwyn that the two prime requirements for a settlement are withdrawal of the argentinian forces and then the assurance that the wishes and interests of the islanders should be taken fully into account in any final settlement because of the importance of the principle of self-determination <e> <s> i put it in a slightly different way in answer to my noble friend lord balfour of inchrye when we debated the matter last thursday when i said in effect that we must surely do everything in our power to apply the principle of self-determination here <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord home for reminding us of the basic principles upon which we are resolved to follow this matter through to a just and peaceful solution <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked me to correct a report which the noble lord said was on the bbc and in the press that my right honourable friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary had urged that united nations activity should be postponed so that this country could take military action <e> <s> i am not aware of any such urging and i am not aware that such statements which i have not in fact seen are accurate <e> <s> but i think it is right for me to repeat that bit of my right honourable friends statement which said and my right honourable friend was referring to himself and the secretary-general and also to the president of the security council <e>", "<cs> my lords i absolutely understand why the noble lord asks this question because i feel that the noble lord lord shinwell has in mind not only the interests of this country but also the conditions which our men are facing in the task force in the south atlantic <e> <s> so i absolutely take the point which the noble lord puts <e> <s> the end of my right honourable friends statement said that our readiness to talk and our will for peace should not be doubted <e> <s> bearing in mind that this is still going to lay upon us further burdens in trying to see that this matter is resolved properly the statement also said that our resolve should not be doubted <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord balfour of inchrye is right in the underlying apprehension in his question in that there is jamming of bbc broadcasts to latin america <e> <s> as i understand it the jamming is of the broadcasts in spanish to latin america and since this clearly contravenes the international telecommunications union convention we are lodging a strong protest with the argentine authorities through the brazilian embassy in london and asking the swiss government to do the same through their embassy in buenos aires <e> <s> i should add that we have no reports of interference with the bbc <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first of the noble lords questions is that i repeat that the government deeply regret the loss of life which has been incurred <e> <s> the answer to the second question of the noble lord is no <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the first question of the noble lord lord molloy we have made clear all along and i repeat it now again that we are very ready and indeed anxious to enter into interim discussions leading towards final negotiations as has been required by mandatory resolution of the security council of the united nations <e> <s> but first and in line with resolution there must be withdrawal of the argentine forces <e> <s> so far as the interests of the british people in the argentine are concerned they are being looked after by the swiss embassy in buenos aires <e>", "<cs> my lords we are bending every effort towards that end <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble lord lord brockway that this is a disastrous outcome <e> <s> we are now in the position where a text has been adopted <e> <s> the convention will be open for signature in the autumn and then for ratification afterwards <e> <s> we shall be looking very carefully at the texts to see what line the united kingdom should follow in the future <e> <s> so far as the merits of the convention are concerned although consensus could not be achieved on the deep sea mining texts the convention does contain a number of provisions which could be of benefit to us <e>", "<cs> my lords i have explained why we have abstained <e> <s> so far as the attitude of her majestys government is concerned for the future that is to say signature and ratification the attitude of the united states and indeed of other governments will be an important factor which we shall have to take into account in reaching our decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords in the meantime the convention does not come into effect until it is ratified <e>", "<cs> not entirely my lords <e> <s> among the texts adopted on th april was a resolution to protect the preliminary investments made by western and other countries in the period before the coming into force of the convention <e> <s> we shall be examining our future policy on deep sea mining in the light of that resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that there are aspects of the convention as it stands which are very much of interest to her majestys government <e> <s> in addition to provisions about the continental shelf and the right of navigation there are indeed environmental provisions relating for instance to the rights of coastal states to take action against people who pollute and provisions for the conduct of marine scientific research <e> <s> i repeat however that we must now look very carefully at the texts which are not yet in a composite form when they are they will be put in the libraries of both houses before we decide what our policy should now be <e>", "<cs> it is important my lords because of the point raised in my noble friends question that the resolution to which i referred was adopted as part of the texts on th april to protect preliminary investments made by western and other countries in the period before the coming into force of the convention <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that the countries which the noble lord mentioned have passed legislation as have we we have passed the deep sea mining temporary provisions act <e> <s> having said that we do not accept that interim national legislation or any agreements concerning interim arrangements made with other countries having similar legislation are contrary to international law <e> <s> i am advised that the legislation we have enacted and any agreement which is reached with other countries also having deep sea mining legislation would not challenge the principle that the mineral resources of the deep seabed are the common heritage of mankind <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that the information requested by my noble friend is not available <e> <s> the international sports federations are independent <e> <s> indeed we are committed to doing what we can to uphold their autonomy <e> <s> our knowledge of what <e>", "<cs> my lords i would hold no brief for russian motives in pursuing their policy <e> <s> for ourselves we adhere to the provisions of the gleneagles agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat that so far as sporting contacts are concerned which are the subject of the question of my noble friend lord orr-ewing we adhere to the provisions of the gleneagles agreement which requires us to take every practical step to discourage sporting contacts with south africa because south africa is the only country where racial discrimination is institutionalised by law <e>", "<cs> my lords the position of her majestys government is i think relevant to the supplementary question of the noble lord lord wynne-jones <e> <s> in the special circumstances of the russian invasion of afghanistan two years ago we advised sportsmen and sporting bodies not to participate in the moscow olympics <e>", "<cs> that is a question that i cannot answer my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the government i deplore both policies <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house i shall repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their response to my right honourable friends statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord stewart asked whether the government are giving full weight to the need to involve the united nations <e> <s> we told the secretary-general last night that the government are considering the ideas that came up when my right honourable friend saw senor perez de cuellar on nd may <e> <s> the united nations secretary-general has not described these ideas as being formal proposals or a united nations plan <e> <s> this is what distinguishes the secretary-generals initiative from the initiative which is also being taken by the president of peru and mr haig <e>", "<cs> my lords we can on our side only make clear what is and what is not negotiable <e> <s> we would be ready as we have said many times to enter into negotiations but on the lines of security council resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords broadcasts by the bbc to latin america in spanish have been increased but as i reported to your lordships house yesterday there is a problem with jamming by the argentines so far as that is concerned <e> <s> however broadcasts by the world service of the bbc in english are i am advised unaffected in this respect <e> <s> it is also relevant to the noble earls question that as from th april the telegraph and telex links to the falkland islands have simply been severed by the argentines <e> <s> we are making it our business to ensure that despite this the islanders still receive truthful accounts of what is happening <e> <s> we are making full use of the facilities of the bbc to this end <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made it clear in supplementaries that the united nations secretary-general has not described his ideas as being formal proposals or a united nations plan although he is clearly now very active in this matter and we are in very close touch with him <e> <s> but there really is a problem which i would ask the noble lord lord brockway to face and that is that for the secretary-general to make headway in this matter it is necessary for him to take the argentine government and the united kingdom government with him in spirit and in fact and it is extremely difficult for the united nations secretary-general to do that when the argentine government is simply flouting a mandatory resolution of the organisation of which the united nations secretary-general is the secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we must continue to take military economic and diplomatic action in this matter but that we must do one more thing and i hope that both my noble friend lord trenchard and i have made it clear this afternoon in our statements on behalf of our secretaries of state and that is that we are ready at all times to enter into proper negotiations on this matter <e> <s> we are ready to use the good offices of the president of peru and mr haig and also the united nations secretary-general but it has got to be for fair and just negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords the united nations secretary-general as i made clear is in contact with the argentine government as indeed he is in contact with us and also the peruvian proposals were put to the argentine government as they have been put to us <e> <s> the peruvian proposals of course were turned down by the argentine government <e> <s> there is a government there all right it is just that their policies are not policies at the moment which are leading towards a just and peaceful negotiation and solution of this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the statement i have made today shows excessive reliance <e> <s> it shows that the united nations secretary-general is very active in this matter and we are as i believe is proper in close touch with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand from the noble lord lord kaldor that it was thought by those watching television that there would be a transmission of the foreign minister of the argentine on television in this country and then the foreign minister of the argentine did not appear <e> <s> i should think that was a very appropriate solution <e>", "<cs> my lords we continue to believe that the turkish government will honour their commitment to restore democracy <e> <s> that is why we take the view that was contained in the answer that i gave to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that turkey occupies a most important strategic part of the world and is therefore an important member of nato <e> <s> at the same time we and other member states of the community continue to make the turkish government aware of our concern over alleged human rights violations <e>", "<cs> my lords if one looks at the nato treaty one will see that the reference in the question is not very happily phrased <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right that the reference to cento is no longer relevant <e>", "<cs> i did not hear my noble friends question my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that it is the case that the amount of violence in turkey has enormously reduced under the government of general evren <e>", "<cs> my lords if the alliance of which turkey and the united kingdom are two of the members did not exist the question of human rights would very probably become academic because russia would occupy europe <e> <s> with regard to the confidence of this country in the future of turkey general evren has announced a timetable for a constitutional referendum before the end of november this year or in spring and parliamentary elections in autumn next year or in spring at the latest <e>", "<cs> no my lords i meant that the number of violent deaths in that country has very much decreased <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to this question i do not know that i am required to say anything <e>", "<cs> my lords spain will become a member of nato when ratification of the protocol to the north atlantic treaty has been completed by all existing member countries <e> <s> her majestys government hope that this process will be completed within the next few weeks <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that the strategic importance of gibraltar to the alliance and to britain as a member of the alliance will be taken fully into account in discussions within the alliance after spains entry to nato and in the negotiations with spain on gibraltar envisaged by the lisbon agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the proposed closure of the naval dockyard is concerned i replied to a question which my noble friend put to me on this matter about a week ago <e> <s> i do not think that i really have anything to add to what i said on that occasion which was to the effect that the government felt that the decision must stand but that within that context we would be as flexible and helpful as possible so far as the interests of gibraltar are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat that the decision to close the naval dockyard will stand but of course as the noble lord lord peart will know the government with the government of gibraltar are actively pursuing what opportunities there could be for the dockyard to be run commercially <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that this had been discussed in the canadian parliament <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend that the position of gibraltar is important within the nato alliance but i do not think there is anything else i can add at the moment about the position as to the naval dockyard <e>", "<cs> my lords the botswana government has been informed that up to of additional financial assistance will be made available in the current financial year for drought relief measures <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with what my noble friend has said <e> <s> if i may add to what my noble friend has said from his experience of this country i realise that botswana is going through a difficult patch at the moment because of the fall in commodity prices apart from this tragedy of drought which has struck the country <e> <s> it is worth bearing in mind that in addition to the answer that i gave my noble friend about extra aid there is the governments bilateral aid there is bilateral aid from other countries and also multilateral aid <e> <s> the total of all this means that botswana is receiving very considerable aid compared with many other african countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly look into the very interesting piece of information that the noble lord lord oram has given to the government <e> <s> i think that it is worth adding that as to how the additional aid to help relieve the drought is to be used it is i understand to be decided by the british high commissioner acting on the advice of the british development division in southern africa based in lilongwe in consultation of course with the botswana government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot answer that specific question <e> <s> there is no doubt that what has happened in this case is that the rains when they were supposed to come at the end of last year and the beginning of this year failed <e> <s> i believe that some rain has now begun but of course very late <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to cut off the noble lord with my answer but i do not think that i can add to what i have just said about the way in which the uses to which extra aid will be put would be decided <e> <s> in essence it will be by discussion and consultation between us and the botswana government <e> <s> it is worth adding that in addition to trying to go to the root of the problem to which the supplementary questions of the noble lords lord oram and lord wells-pestell are directed there is the matter of immediate relief <e> <s> this is where aid not only from us but from other countries including the usa norway sweden and the federal republic of germany will come in very useful <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the government will bear that in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords the government agree with the noble lord that this would be the ideal way of proceeding but we feel that the parties are too far apart to make a united nations solution realistic at the present time <e> <s> however the venice declaration sets out the common ground that we believe the parties must agree upon before negotiations for a comprehensive settlement can be agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords the countries of the european community have welcomed the peace between israel and egypt and the israeli withdrawal from the sinai <e> <s> but having said that there is further work to be done <e> <s> the countries of the community believe the way forward will be by way of the venice declaration <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the information which the noble lord gave me at the beginning of his supplementary question <e> <s> our participation in the sinai peace-keeping force demonstrates our <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter of opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said the countries of the european community have welcomed the peace between israel and egypt and the israeli withdrawal from sinai which of course has flowed from camp david <e> <s> however the autonomy talks must result in a workable arrangement acceptable to the palestinians if they are to be successful <e> <s> we therefore believe that early palestinian involvement is also essential <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the concern which the noble viscount is expressing <e> <s> the united nations presence in the middle east of course the peace-keeping force in sinai is not a united nations force is an example of the united nations doing its best <e> <s> i said to the noble lord lord paget that his second supplementary question was a matter of opinion because the government disagree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will forgive me for saying so but we are getting a little far from the united nations <e> <s> the government agree with the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot answer the second question which the noble lord lord mayhew asks me <e> <s> so far as the first part of the question is concerned i agree that there is trouble concerning the status of jerusalem so far as the camp david talks are concerned <e> <s> but i think that your lordships will forgive me if i say now that this is not a united nations matter and now we really are outside the scope of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords again i agree absolutely with the noble lord lord caradon <e> <s> it is necessary for both israels right to exist in peace and the palestinians right to self-determination which are the two principles of the venice declaration to be recognised <e> <s> i repeat again that her majestys government will be only too pleased to see ideally these matters pursued through the united nations <e> <s> the political will to reach a settlement through that channel is necessary <e> <s> at the moment that will is lacking <e>", "<cs> my lords the problem regarding a security council initiative is the familiar one <e> <s> the work of the security council is valuable <e> <s> the actions of the security council are difficult to carry through into achievement <e> <s> the government have expressed our concern publicly and have taken diplomatic action with all the parties concerned to urge them to exercise maximum restraint as a result of the events in lebanon in the past few days <e> <s> we hope there will be no further resort to violent action <e>", "<cs> my lords the government agree with the noble lord lord molloy on the desirability of reaching a settlement in the middle east <e> <s> we believe with our fellow common market countries in the two venice principles <e> <s> we and our partners in the will continue to work energetically to urge the acceptance of these principles as a first step towards negotiations on a comprehensive settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords we support the right of sovereign states to act in self-defence and to acquire arms to protect their independence <e> <s> but of course i agree with my noble friend that it is most important to look at each case on its merits and indeed to keep the policy under continuous review <e> <s> so far as the particular case which my noble friend cites is concerned of course france has now banned the sale of all defence equipment to the argentine <e>", "<cs> my lords the right to self-defence and to need arms in order to defend a country is enshrined in article of the united nations charter <e> <s> it is not therefore surprising that the countries of the european community including the united kingdom sell arms to different countries <e> <s> what is important and where i do agree with the noble lord is that this has to be kept under very close review <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mayhew said that the matter should be reviewed <e> <s> i assure him that arms sales policy towards individual countries is kept under continuous review <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any review of the kind which the noble lord lord molloy asks me about <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the original question from my noble friend lord dudley was about eec policy and there are widely differing interests within the community which make it unlikely that a common policy on arms exports will evolve in the foreseeable future <e> <s> in saying that i am not trying to be unhelpful to noble lords who asked the last two questions <e> <s> i agree and the government agree that this is a very serious matter which needs to be kept always under very close review <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not for one moment dissent from my noble friend in believing that a common policy can be reached by the community on any matter on which the community may see fit to reach a common policy <e> <s> it is a matter of the greatest acceptability to the government and indeed to both houses of parliament that there is unanimity at the moment in the community on the question of the undesirability of selling arms to argentina <e> <s> but i cannot go further than that at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords if may i will come to that in just a moment <e> <s> the industries covered at exhibitions which have received assistance from the botb include marine equipment electronics plastics coal mining and construction petroleum education equipment and mechanical handling <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lords assessment of the task of the committee on disarmament at geneva and i share the noble lords disappointment that it has not been possible to put forward an agreed programme <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords as with each day this crisis has deepened the broad measure of support which the government have received from your <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i absolutely withdraw my remark as being inaccurate and unfair to the noble lord <e> <s> however perhaps the noble lord will answer the question how if nothing is done free people are to continue to live under the heel of an aggressor <e>", "<cs> that is a fair point <e> <s> as well as military operations the economic sanctions as i say are having an effect but we do not believe that in the short-term they would necessarily bring about capitulation <e> <s> the noble lord asked me direct whether we could not declare argentina in default on bank loans <e> <s> as i understood him that was a question put to me <e> <s> that would be a matter for the banks involved <e> <s> but to declare argentina in default would absolve her only from paying her debts totalling billion billion to united kingdom banks <e> <s> the immediate effect of that would probably be paradoxically to help argentina and to harm the international banking system and british interests <e>", "<cs> if i may turn to my noble friend lord morris i would say that certainly we shall bear that point very closely in mind <e> <s> this is one of the sticking points between the argentine proposals and the other proposals in that the argentine proposals would wish to treat the dependencies along with the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> my lords i confirm what the noble lord lord brockway has said namely that disagreement rests at the moment upon the electoral system and that of course swapo have not accepted the proposals which at the moment have been put forward <e> <s> but there is also a need for the five to put proposals forward on impartiality and on the united nations transitional assistance group <e> <s> the five expect soon to present these proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of the electoral system is still under active consideration by the five in the light of comments received including the comments of the front line states foreign ministers communiqu which was made in dar es salaam on th may <e> <s> i cannot at this stage forecast the outcome but i should like to reply to the noble lord lord cledwyn by saying that the five do not foresee a breakdown of negotiations on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a similarity in that there is a resolution of the security council <e> <s> i hope that in this case as in the other the security council resolution will be carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the thing to do now is to wait for the proposals which the five expect to present soon to the parties concerned and to see what is the response of the parties concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords our objective remains to end the unlawful argentine occupation and to give back to the islanders their right to determine their own future <e>", "<cs> my lords joint administration in consultation with the islands elected representatives <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been negotiating because we wish to see a solution to what is a tragedy <e>", "<cs> my lords that is our determination <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends advice is as usual sound <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords judgment is as usual not sound <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord chitnis for giving the house an opportunity to consider an event which has been the subject of much public interest and discussion not only in this country but elsewhere <e> <s> as your lordships will know the government decided to respond to an official invitation extended by the government of el salvador to send observers to the constituent assembly elections held in that country on th march <e> <s> the government sent two independent observers men whose integrity was unquestionable to view the electoral process and to report on it <e> <s> it was made clear at the time to all concerned that this decision was not to be interpreted as support for any political grouping in el savador <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot refer to the paragraph my lords <e> <s> i think the report said within hours <e> <s> what was also said by the noble lord lord chitnis was that on several occasions ink did not show up at all under polling booth infra-red lamps <e> <s> so there is extra corroboration in the direction of the argument i am using <e>", "<cs> no my lords i did not think that i had given that impression during my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i did refer to the plo covenant particularly in the context of the words spoken by the noble baroness lady gaitskell <e> <s> i think the noble baroness might have been out of the chamber just at that particular moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for the extra information which he has given because that is precisely what a debate of this kind is about <e> <s> certaintly in the foreign office we will study carefully what the noble lord has said <e> <s> as he will know the united nations experts group set up to carry out full investigation into allegations of chemical warfare use whose efforts we most certainly support has not as yet judged it necessary to visit eritrea <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not of course comparing like with like <e> <s> we believe that the difficulty about making the comparison which the palme report made and which i have no doubt the russians would wish to make is that you will not get a durable agreement <e> <s> we believe that if you included both british and french forces you would simply be going down the road of granting superiority to the russians <e> <s> therefore my answer to the noble lord is that at the moment we believe that this is not the way in which to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the first supplementary question of the noble lord i point out that the five are conducting informal consultations with the parties concerned before finalising and circulating their considered proposals <e> <s> so far as the second supplementary question is concerned yes i realise that the period of time has gone on a bit but following the visit of senior members of the contact group to lusaka luanda and dar-es-salaam last week we were encouraged by the reaction from the front-line states and swapo at their summit meeting in dar-es-salaam on th june <e> <s> i think it is fair to say that they and the south african government and indeed the internal parties have expressed a desire now to move ahead quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the concern of my noble friend <e> <s> her majestys government want to see a solution based upon security council resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not christen them <e>", "<cs> my lords all five members of the group of nations are playing their part in this matter <e> <s> we have played an extremely active part in the contact group <e> <s> it is upon the activities of the contact group that i have been reporting to the house in answer to this question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that perhaps outside the chamber i could go into detail on those two particular points <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not seen that report and i must say that i do not think it is relevant <e> <s> as regards the first question which the noble lord asked me the five have considered comments received including a further reply by swapo and the front-line states foreign ministers communiqu at dar-es-salaam on th may <e> <s> the five do not think that the mainly technical issue of the electoral system should further delay the negotiations <e> <s> it is something which has to be resolved but i think it has to be resolved a bit later <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly look up the different articles to which the noble lord lord kennet has referred but i am advised that we have no jurisdiction to try astiz in the united kingdom for any of the offences which he is alleged to have committed in argentina <e> <s> even if a crime had been committed against a british subject this would not in itself have provided our courts with jurisdiction <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for that question because i think it helps to clarify the matter <e> <s> questions which had been received from the french and the swedish governments were put to astiz on th june by a senior officer of the sussex constabulary and a detailed report will be given to the french and swedish governments as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords the apportionment of the cost involved in repatriation is a matter for discussion between her majestys government and argentina through their protecting power brazil <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have the answer to that particular question except that so far as i am aware the most sensible and rapid means of returning astiz where he ought to go were used <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot add to what i have said to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> we did what we felt we were required to do in acting properly under the geneva conventions <e> <s> astiz is now repatriated <e>", "<cs> my lords that would be a matter for the courts <e> <s> for our courts there was no jurisdiction <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i have made the position clear <e> <s> there were only two ways in which to go about this <e> <s> one was for there to be jurisdiction for the courts and for our courts there was no jurisdiction <e> <s> the other way was to question astiz as a prisoner of war <e> <s> under the third geneva convention astiz was treated fully in accordance with the provisions <e> <s> these require us not to put any pressure on him to obtain information of any kind <e> <s> all that prisoners of war are required to provide is their name rank and number <e> <s> that is what happened <e> <s> astiz was then repatriated <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is in effect and i am not unsympathetic to the concern he is showing starting to say that astiz should have been treated as a hostage <e> <s> that would have been quite inconsistent with the provisions of the third geneva convention <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no agreement between her majestys government and the guatemalan government about belize <e> <s> although belize is an independent sovereign country we accept that her majestys government may have to play some role in any future negotiations with guatemala on this issue <e> <s> we therefore continue to watch the situation carefully and are in close touch with the government of belize about it <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government and the then guatemalan government signed heads of agreement which included guatemalas undertaking to recognise belizes independence on the date which the noble lord mentioned <e> <s> subsequent talks broke down and the guatemalan government refused to recognise the independence of belize in september of last year and then guatemala broke consular relations with britain over this <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble baroness that in the end belize must have a satisfactory undertaking from guatemala <e> <s> as the original answer which i gave to the noble lord lord kennet in essence says the united kingdom stands ready to give what help it can <e>

country of belize receives development assistance on a very considerable scale from the united kingdom <e> <s> i am not aware that it is receiving development assistance or assistance of other kinds from the united states at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords we have undertaken to maintain the garrison in belize for as long as may be appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter of the appropriateness of keeping the garrison in belize which is very important will be kept under review <e>", "<cs> my lords when we were seeking peaceful implementation of security council resolution we were in touch with a number of governments which might have influence with argentina including the south african government <e> <s> it would not be right for me to reveal the content of confidential diplomatic exchanges <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first supplementary question which the noble lord has asked me the south african defence minister said in the south african parliament on th may <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords that seems to be a totally different question on which the noble lord had better put a question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a distinction which the noble lord draws <e> <s> it is not a distinction which i draw <e> <s> the end result of the military operation in the <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not have plans to initiate discussions with a view to reactivating the simonstown agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be the view of the labour party <e> <s> it is the view of the government that if we really are concerned to protect the freedom of the west it is necessary to protect that freedom wherever it may be challenged <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a hypothetical question to which the noble lord must await an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords supplementary question does not make sense in the context in which the rapid deployment force was set <e> <s> if the noble lord casts his mind back he will remember that the rapid deployment force was set up by the us government or at least the concept was explained by the us government in the general context of the soviet threat to the area of the east iran pakistan and the oil interests in that particular area <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e>", "<cs> my lords no but the united states government was concerned about the threat of the soviet union in military terms operating on comparatively short lines of communication against the western alliance who had been operating on long lines of communication in an area of the world where the oil interests were very great indeed <e> <s> it was in that context that the united states government took a decision which the government of the united kingdom believe to be prudent and which the united kingdom government support <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that supplementary question <e> <s> it was in the context of the unwarrantable aggression against afghanistan that this particular strategic concept was originally announced <e>", "<cs> my lords in these circumstances the western alliance attaches the greatest importance to the arms control talks which are in progress at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a question which by its nature was rhetorical <e> <s> in line with many other questions which the noble lord lord jenkins asks me i thought that there was really no satisfactory answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the noble lords hope that there should be a real prospect of success in the talks to which i referred <e> <s> indeed the start talks on intercontinental ballistic missiles began yesterday <e> <s> we are of course in close touch with the government of the united states <e> <s> but there is one criterion which has to be met if these talks are to succeed <e> <s> i refer of course to the talks across the whole board and whether we are talking about intercontinental intermediate range or conventional the agreements must be genuine they must be balanced and they must be verifiable <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we are starting to go wide of the question <e> <s> the noble lord is going off into first strike and second strike which i know is of enormous importance <e> <s> i would content myself with this answer <e> <s> the deterrent power of <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole of the western alliance not least of course the united states of america with its great influence and great power looks to the need to deter and that means having nuclear weapons for the foreseeable future <e> <s> but i repeat that we attach the first importance to balanced and verifiable arms control and therefore arms reductions in the talks which are taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords a durable agreement must be based on the principle of parity between the united states and the soviet union which is clearly breached if third party systems are included on one side <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat that it is precisely because of the concern which is shared throughout the western world at the level of armaments that we attach the highest importance to genuine reductions in arms in the talks which are proceeding at the present time <e> <s> but i remind the noble lord that deterrence has kept the peace for nearly years <e> <s> if the noble lord is in any doubt about the views of the western alliance may i just remind him of words which were spoken by the prime minister only a week ago to the united nations <e> <s> my right honourable friend said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am arranging for the text of the assurances sought from the israeli government to be circulated in the <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend calls for a total ban so far as arms and trade are concerned <e> <s> i should like to make it clear that her majestys government have decided that approval of licences for the export of british military equipment to israel will be withheld until further notice <e> <s> so far as trade is concerned a number of measures were discussed in brussels but it was felt that those measures subsequently announced by the european community presidency were as far as the ten wished to go in present circumstances <e> <s> thirdly my noble friend asked me whether article of the geneva convento whether the specific question which my noble friend asked me whether articles of the geneva convention applies strictly to the plo in this conflict it is our hope that the israelis will act according to the conventions principles <e>", "<cs> my lords we have made on behalf of the government our position absolutely clear <e> <s> we very much hope that mr philip habibs continuing negotiations with the lebanese government will result in a durable cease-fire and withdrawal of forces as a first step <e> <s> after that our position when i say our position i mean the position of the ten in europe is

lords question <e> <s> the venice principles are even-handed <e> <s> we hope and pray that through that even-handed approach peace may come to the middle east <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble baroness that civilian casualties in a conflict of this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not entirely sure whether the terms of my noble friends question are in a sense being imputed to the government by the noble lord lord shinwell or whether the answer which i gave to my noble friend is being described by the noble lord as unsatisfactory <e> <s> certainly i do not think that the stance of the government in this difficult and tragic matter is unsatisfactory <e> <s> we have put our name to the statement made yesterday by the ten in brussels <e> <s> i believe that statement to be right <e> <s> we stand by the principles of the venice declaration <e> <s> i believe that declaration to be even-handed and to be fair <e> <s> and we are signatories to the united nations security council resolution which calls for a complete withdrawal of israeli forces <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the second question i am afraid that i cannot because i was not present at the discussions <e> <s> however i repeat that at the discussions among the ten there certainly were countries which felt that the ten had gone far enough in the stance which had been taken in this very difficult matter <e> <s> so far as the power of exhortation and words are concerned what we hope this was the first point i made and perhaps your lordships will agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not entirely sure that the noble lord is not perhaps inadvertently being a little unfair so far as the statement is concerned <e>", "<cs> the reason i reply in that way is this <e> <s> the statement included as a first step a call for withdrawal to be simultaneous the israelis from their positions around beirut the plo from west beirut <e> <s> the statement then went on to call for the withdrawal of all foreign forces except those which would be authorised by a legitimate future government of lebanon <e> <s> i believe that is the right way to go about it <e> <s> that is what the statement said <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the noble baroness but i cannot give a direct answer to that question <e> <s> this is bound up among the assurances to which we have asked for a direct reply <e> <s> we have not received the direct reply which we had hoped for from the israelis <e> <s> i like the noble baroness have of course been reading the newspapers and hearing the news but i cannot give a better answer than the one which i have given during our short debate this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons amendments be now considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am advised that the original purpose of the inclusion of the words without lawful excuse in clause can be safeguarded should the need arise by the proper exercise of the attorney-generals or the lord advocates discretion to refuse to give consent to a prosecution in cases of a clearly non-criminal nature even though they may be technically caught by the definition of the offence <e> <s> this was a point to which my noble friend lord renton originally drew attention on third reading when this bill was before your lordships house <e> <s> although on that occasion my noble friend withdrew his amendment subsequently in another place the government have met the point by bringing forward this amendment which i now commend to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i owe an apology to my noble friend lord campbell of alloway for not attributing the origination of this amendment to him <e> <s> the fact that my noble friend originated it and my noble friend lord renton spoke to it and now the noble lord lord bishopston has commended it makes it i hope all the more attractive to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this is really a drafting amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may reply to the noble lord on that point the united nations convention as lord bishopston said will not enter into force <e>", "<cs> my lords the first priority is to restore conditions on the islands to as near as normal <e> <s> this we are most certainly doing at the present time <e> <s> whether there is any prospect of an agreement covering the falklands depends primarily on the attitude of the argentines <e> <s> i am bound to say that the reports from buenos aires suggest that at present they do not wish to pursue the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords words to that effect were spoken by my right honourable friend the prime minister in a debate some weeks ago <e> <s> the context was a little different <e> <s> i think it is reasonable and right that the answer to the question should be brought up to date <e> <s> as best i can i have now given the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give an answer as to the totality of the assets <e> <s> the trade and arms embargo which this country has against the argentine still continues <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords <e>", "<cs> yes indeed <e> <s> i know that what the noble lord lord shinwell has said is correct <e> <s> but we were wronged by the aggression of argentina and we are entitled if we wish to do so to claim compensation <e> <s> nevertheless i agree with the noble lord that this is not to say we should find it easy to obtain compensation if argentina contested our claim or simply did not pay <e>", "<cs> a very wise piece of advice my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to appear unsympathetic <e> <s> i quite understand why the noble lord asks the question but it is rather different from the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords these are all good ideas which the government will certainly take on board <e> <s> at the end of this exchange it might be right to remind your lordships that a very substantial quantity of argentine military equipment has fallen into our hands some of which is proving quite useful <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have always considered that in the appropriate circumstances economic measures can play a useful role in encouraging observance of international law <e> <s> the situation which obtained in the falklands is different from that in namibia and angola <e> <s> we do not consider that sanctions against south africa would be helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the last question and may i say that the five states and indeed all the parties to the namibia negotiations negotiating from very different points of view are all agreed that what is wanted are negotiations which as i replied to the noble lord only last week are now beginning to accelerate <e> <s> we really throw this into the melting pot if at this stage in the negotiations we start to talk about sanctions <e> <s> with regard to the first two questions asked by the noble lord lord hatch of lusby as i said in my original answer there is a clean difference between the namibia situation and the falklands situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> his experience underlines the answer i sought to give which is that i believe that sanctions in this case would be disastrous <e>", "<cs> my lords the response remains the same as that which i made to the noble lord lord hatch of lusby which is that we must negotiate ourselves through to a solution of the namibia problem <e> <s> this is what the security council resolution in essence adjures us to do <e> <s> this is what this country together with four other countries swapo the so-called front-line states and all the parties to the negotiations are seeking to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord campbell of alloway for asking this question because again it underlines the answer i sought to give on behalf of her majestys government which is that there is not a comparison between the two sets of circumstances set out in the question asked by the noble lord lord hatch of lusby <e>", "<cs> here again my lords lord bess-boroughs question underlines the need to negotiate our way through to the situation where there will be a constituent assembly and a proper constitution that is what resolution adjures us to do and when terrorism in namibia will be no more <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i would not disagree with what the noble lord lord gladwyn says on that particular point <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord molloy on the first part of his question about the falkland islands <e> <s> on the second part may i repeat to the noble lord that we are in a situation where the negotiations are we believe and hope accelerating <e> <s> it could be that the security council resolution so far as namibia is concerned may be getting somewhere <e> <s> do not let us take any action now which would almost certainly cast that into the dark <e>", "<cs> my lords i can answer both questions with the same reply <e> <s> whether we are talking about the views of the countries of southern africa or whether we are talking about a view given by the noble lord lord hatch of lusby on whether or not south africa is in breach of international law the fact of the matter is that we are in a situation in which all the parties concerned with namibia are negotiating in good faith in order to bring resolution to fruition <e> <s> in answer to the noble lords question i believe and i repeat this for the umpteenth time that if economic sanctions were to be imposed in this particular case it would be disastrous <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both the noble lords lord cledwyn and lord gladwyn for their replies to the statement of my right honourable friend the prime minister about the european council <e> <s> both noble lords have referred to the united states action as regards steel imports into the united states and the siberian gas pipe-line <e> <s> the noble lord lord cledwyn asked me specifically whether the government felt that there were serious prospects of what the noble lord called a trade war <e> <s> i think that there are three things that it is perhaps right to bear in mind <e> <s> first of course as regards the pipe-line the main contractors are the federal republic of germany france and italy <e> <s> we are in very close touch with them about this important matter <e> <s> we are urging on the united states the seriousness of reconsidering this matter both bilaterally when my right honourable friend the prime minister visited the united states last week and also as the statement says through the concerted approach from the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am sorry that i cannot be more helpful about further news from lebanon <e> <s> we have not received any satisfactory answers to the questions which were asked of the israeli government although i must make it quite clear that of course there have been bilateral exchanges on certain points between the governments and different ambassadors of the ten and the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i must make it clear that in the original answer i did not say that there was no intention to base american strategic nuclear bombers on diego garcia <e> <s> i said there is no proposal to do that <e> <s> so far as drawing a comparison between the falkland islanders and the ilios people who are on diego garcia is concerned there is no direct parallel <e> <s> the ilios were essentially transit workers employed on a contract basis <e> <s> when the plantations on diego garcia were closed the plantation managers gave them the choice of either going to other islands or having their contracts terminated and returning to mauritius <e> <s> i have given some details in the original answer of the settlement in mauritius of the ilios people <e>", "<cs> the answer to the first question which the noble lord lord brockway asked me is no for the reason which i gave in my last reply to the noble lord lord jenkins of putney <e> <s> so far as the noble lords second question is concerned the decision to provide facilities to the united states on diego garcia was taken on the grounds of broad national interest <e> <s> in this matter the united states and the united kingdom government attach the very greatest strategic importance to the use of diego garcia <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend lord duncan-sandys for that question <e> <s> her majestys government and the united states attach the very greatest importance to this <e> <s> i think everybody must realise that as a result of the soviet invasion of afghanistan the need to see diego garcia as a very important strategic part of the western alliance has been underlined <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very important for me to add to what has been said so far <e> <s> in addition to the million paid to the mauritius government this money will be administered on behalf of the ilios people by an independent board of trustees to make sure that the ilios people get the benefit of the money <e> <s> in addition the mauritius government will on their part make available to the ilios and the ilios community in mauritius land to the value of million <e>", "<cs> my lords diego garcia is an important part of the western alliance and i am grateful to my noble friend for underlying that fact <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a perfectly fair question and there is a distinction <e> <s> the ilios people whe were on diego garcia were there because they were working on plantations which now no longer exist <e>", "<cs> the noble lord shakes his head but it is a matter of fact that the ilios people on diego garcia were working as contract workers on plantations that no longer exist <e> <s> the people of the falkland islands were working on farms which thank goodness very much continue to exist <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> those are important points with which the government entirely agree <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been very concerned at newspaper and television reports that dr pinder-wilson has been put on trial in kabul <e> <s> despite repeated representations we have received no official confirmation that the trial has taken place or that sentence has been passed <e> <s> we have continued to press the regime in kabul urgently for clarification <e> <s> we are in close touch with dr pinder-wilsons family and colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords dr pinder-wilson is a scholar with an international reputation employed for many years as a keeper of the british museum <e> <s> in the course of his archaeological work in afghanistan over many years he has gained an immense reputation in his field not only in this country but throughout the world <e> <s> i would therefore reply to the first question of the noble lord that yes dr pinder-wilson is a distinguished academic and author <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for that question because indeed any information to the government is valuable at the present time <e> <s> i regret to have to say that we do not know where dr pinder-wilson is actually being held <e> <s> our acting consul was able to hand him clothing cigarettes and books during their meeting on th april <e> <s> so far as dr pinder-wilsons health is concerned which is <e>", "<cs> my lords so indeed can i but the serious difficulty is that her majestys government are cut off from consular access so far as dr pinder-wilson is concerned <e> <s> i think the answer i should give to the noble and learned lord is two-fold <e> <s> first we do not regard the karmal rgime as a government but this does not affect our ability to make consular representations in kabul <e> <s> we have indeed our representative in the embassy he is a counsellor and he is in touch with the ministry of foreign affairs of afghanistan <e> <s> secondly what has happened in detail is that our <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may confine myself to the serious subject of afghanistan so far as that is concerned i think her majestys government have consistently made clear our opposition to all that has happened since the soviet invasion of afghanistan <e> <s> i would add that we will take all the steps we properly can to secure the release of dr pinder-wilson <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty is that what we have all been reading in the newspapers are reports which come either from tass or from one of the newspapers of the kabul press <e> <s> we still do not have a reply from the afghan government which is what we have been pressing for <e> <s> when we know the facts and we will of course continue to be very active in this matter then one of the options certainly could be action through international organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the case but that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we would like to consider this and indeed i will take this point away <e> <s> but i repeat that the very great difficulty at the moment is the paucity of that information which we have been able to extract from afghanistan <e> <s> i do hope that by the time the government next report to the house the situation will be very much better <e>", "<cs> my lords no proposals for the deployment of either of these lots of weapons have <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has i think every reason to ask the supplementary question he has asked because it is quite clear that the question was asked whilst labouring under a misapprehension <e> <s> my first reply was that no proposals for deployment have been made <e> <s> that was the answer to the first supplementary question which the noble lord lord jenkins of putney asked me and to which presumably he attached importance <e> <s> under those circumstances it does mean that a question of this nature is damaging if it is inaccurate and it is inaccurate <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord peart says that he is surprised at my answer but the original answer made it quite clear that the production of weapons which are to be held on united states territory is a matter for the united states government <e> <s> the noble lord lord jenkins immediately asked a supplementary question which refuted that answer <e> <s> all i can do is to repeat what is the truth at the moment there are no proposals for deployment of these weapons outside the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords the start talks will not cover these particular weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> the reason why i take issue with the noble lord lord jenkins and with respect the noble lord lord peart is that the supplementary question to the original question simply refuted the truth of what the government said <e> <s> i assure the house that what the government said in their original answer is at the moment the case <e>", "<cs> my lords there is <e> <s> the hope of the united kingdom is that there will be a complete ban on chemical weapons which we of course discarded years ago <e> <s> we put forward proposals for a draft convention in and now we have put forward proposals for verification which is at the very heart of being able to ban at the geneva talks <e> <s> i very much hope that we shall be able to make progress in this direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend because here again i think it is important to realise what the facts are <e> <s> yes my noble friend is quite right in suggesting that we in the united kingdom discarded chemical weapons some years ago <e> <s> so far as quantities are concerned the soviet union has a huge quantity of up to tonnes of chemical agent really enough to sink europe far less to destroy it <e>", "<cs> my lords the first part of the noble lords supplementary question relates to why the united kingdom six years ago put forward proposals for a ban on the production and the holding of chemical weapons <e> <s> because verification always lies at the heart of these matters we have now put forward proposals for verification in the disarmament talks in geneva <e> <s> so far as our interest and concern in production either in the soviet union or in the united states is <e>", "<cs> my lords i will reply to that head on <e> <s> we are encouraged by the soviet proposals that there should be international verification by means of on-site inspection something which the soviet union has consistently refused to recognise over the years <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble viscount is touching on a different question <e> <s> i think that napalm does not fall into the context of chemical weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is the road we were to go down then i would agree with the noble lord that that would be the result <e>", "<cs> my lords if it follows what the noble lord lord rhodes says the attitude of the united states of america will no doubt be made evident within the context of cocom <e> <s> however as things stand it is necessary for there to be unanimous agreement among our cocom partners for china to be removed from the list of proscribed recipients <e> <s> if i may repeat what i know i have said before to the noble lord british views about chinese interests have been put forcefully to our cocom partners and in cocom we have supported a flexible approach towards china to give due weight to chinas relations with other countries <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the negotiations or at least the exchanges within cocom are confidential <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the concern of the noble baroness which she has expressed before but i would remind the house that the united states as indeed all the other cocom partners is operating within the cocom context if it is trading with those countries which are listed as the proscribed recipients of goods <e> <s> i think we should just add that in practice cocom procedures are at present probably less of a restraint to british defence sales to china than current chinese economic retrenchment or readjustment policies <e> <s> i think that it is right just to bear that in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that question is that one of the periodic reviews of the cocom strategic exports embargo lists is going to start in october <e> <s> our objectives will be to revise the embargo lists in such a way as to safeguard our and western strategic interests but with the minimum necessary disturbance to legitimate trade <e>", "<cs> my lords the essence of the noble lords question is that the existence of the lists is detrimental to our trading interests <e> <s> i should like to give the noble lord an assurance that efforts are being made to speed up the handling of case work in order to provide decisions more rapidly <e> <s> a british proposal to this end is currently under consideration in cocom <e>", "<cs> my lords the forthcoming visit of my right honourable friend the prime minister reflects the long history of friendship between the british and chinese peoples <e> <s> i should just like to add to my noble friend lord morris that of course we keep our policies including the policy we are discussing this afternoon towards china under constant review <e>", "<cs> my lords our defence exchanges with china have developed over the last few years and there has been a series of high level visits in each direction <e> <s> the sale of defence equipment forms a part of our general trading relationships <e> <s> but in considering defence sales on a case-by-case basis strategic implications are always kept in mind <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am not saying that first of all because the exchanges within cocom are of a confidential nature and secondly because what i have said is that within the context of cocom we are supporting a flexible approach towards trade with china <e>", "<cs> my lords the government believe that the opportunities for british exporters within the context of the cocom rules are very considerable <e> <s> i would repeat that in practice cocom procedures are at present probably less of a restraint to china certainly so far as defence sales are concerned than current chinese economic retrenchment or readjustment policies <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the forthcoming visit of my right honourable friend the prime minister reflects a long history of friendship between the british and chinese peoples <e> <s> i know that my right honourable friend is looking forward to the visit and so i believe are the chinese <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government were fully prepared to go ahead on th june with full implementation of the lisbon agreement <e> <s> the further postponement at the request of the spanish government is regrettable but both sides are determined to keep alive the process envisaged by the lisbon agreement <e> <s> a new date for implementation is to be fixed in due course <e> <s> on the matter of the european community the government strongly favour spains entry to the community but the spanish government are aware of our view that it is inconceivable that the frontier should remain closed when spain joins the community <e>", "<cs> my lords the lisbon agreement said that any subject could be raised but it reaffirmed the british commitment contained in the preamble to the gibraltar constitution and that is the situation in which we would be negotiating <e>", "<cs> my lords if the cintra meeting had taken place the prime minister sir joshua hassan and mr isola the leader of the opposition had both made it clear that they would have welcomed the negotiations taking place <e> <s> they would have been present at cintra and in particular they would have welcomed the opening of the frontier <e> <s> that did not come to pass <e> <s> we regret it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right that the continued closure of the border has considerable economic and social results which are harmful to people on both sides of the border <e> <s> on behalf of my right honourable friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary i am to visit gibraltar from st to rd july to discuss on the spot all the implications of the continued closure of the border <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend kindly gave me notice of this question <e> <s> the territory of gibraltar consists of the whole area i am advised up to the british frontier fence <e> <s> if i may add to that our case was set out in some detail in various command papers and i would draw the houses attention in particular to document of cmnd <e> <s> dated november which shows that the government do not agree with my noble friend on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords the re-establishment of direct communications would mean that there would be better relations which would be for the benefit of those who live on both sides of the border <e> <s> that i think is what we ought to work towards <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> while the government warmly welcome spains entry to nato which will be good for the western alliance nonetheless the existence of restrictions on gibraltar does not make the discussions within nato about the details of spains membership of the alliance any easier and of course we regret this <e>", "<cs> my lords no one is under any illusion as to the importance which the government attach to the status of gibraltar <e> <s> indeed that status is contained in the constitution <e> <s> as my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence said in another place on st july gibraltar dockyard might take some of the less complex work arising from the south atlantic operation but this does not alter the decision to close the royal dockyard next year <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have already responded to that point <e> <s> clearly if there is a closed border there will be problems about the community <e> <s> since the government strongly favour spains entry into the european community we would therefore very much regret any impediment to that move <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend on the figures of those who have acceded and also the remarks that my noble friend made about the part that we have played in our contribution to conserving the natural and cultural heritage of this country and indeed internationally <e> <s> indeed my noble friend played his part only seven years ago as chairman of the international organising committee of the european architectural heritage year having said that the fact is that although the world heritage fund is set up to provide support for projects no direct benefits are likely to come to britain even if we ratify <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord refers to the preamble <e> <s> the noble and learned lord may have also noticed that the two main aims of the convention are that each state should recognise the duty of looking after its own cultural and natural heritage and each state should take necessary steps to protect its own cultural and natural heritage <e> <s> i think we have been leading the way in the world in doing <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not closed the door on this matter <e> <s> we have decided simply to defer ratification at present <e> <s> it is not possible to say when ratification will take place but the question is being kept under review <e>", "<cs> my lords the aid programme of this country is directed primarily towards the poorest countries <e> <s> i very much doubt whether they would benefit from this convention <e>", "<cs> my lords really one has to look at the facts <e> <s> the total sum available to the fund is going to be very small indeed <e> <s> one had to look carefully to see what the future of the fund would be in view of the enormous demands which will undoubtedly be made upon it <e> <s> one has to look with some self-interest to see whether it would be of use to this country <e> <s> it is on that point particularly that we have our doubts <e>", "<cs> my lords if we are talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no mandatory united nations oil embargo against south africa <e> <s> the question of british companies evading such an embargo therefore does not arise <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a fact as the noble lord lord hatch has said that the government have made clear to companies exporting north sea crude oil that they expect them to do so to the markets only of the international energy agency and our european community partners <e> <s> the oil companies are well aware of this and that the government attach considerable importance to it and i believe that these are guidelines which are working <e> <s> so far as the report of the shipping research bureau is concerned certain countries have indeed imposed a unilateral oil embargo against south africa <e> <s> it is not for the british government however to enforce embargoes by other countries <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am afraid i am not <e>", "<cs> my lords this is because we have firm guidelines about where the oil which comes from our own oilfields should go <e> <s> these are the guidelines about the selling of crude oil from the north sea and i repeat we have no reason to believe that those guidelines are being breached <e>", "<cs> i repeat my lords in a slightly different way as the same question is being asked for the second time that the government expect british companies to observe the laws of other countries within whose jurisdiction those companies trade <e> <s> it is not however for the british government to enforce embargoes imposed by other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that we have at last come back to the original question the reply to which the noble lord seemed not to listen to when i gave it <e> <s> with respect to him there is an inherent flaw in the original question there is no mandatory embargo by the united nations on oil to south africa <e> <s> therefore there is no question of evasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i understand for instance that botswana lesotho and swaziland are dependent on south africa for their oil supplies <e>", "<cs> my lords the fundamental reason that the talks broke down was the different perceptions of security of states <e> <s> we seek a programme of balanced measures covering nuclear and conventional disarmament and that is different from the approach of some non-aligned governments which place undue emphasis on nuclear disarmament <e> <s> regarding the position of the united kingdom government we believe that initiatives for measures of arms control and disarmament are best taken where there is a possibility of negotiating specific measures <e> <s> if i may say so i do not think that we should be too disappointed with the outcome of the special session because i think that it is upon this that delegates will now focus <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason why the noble lord lord mayhew is able to say that there is progress in the talks on mutually balanced force reductions in vienna is because the west has taken an initiative in tabling in vienna on th july in the form of a draft treaty proposals for replacing the previous two-phase approach with one based on a single stage agreement <e> <s> the value of this initiative is that it shows to the east that the allies are all serious in agreeing that they wish to combine together in achieving conventional force reductions in the talks in vienna <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that the government had in any way been opposed to talks in geneva <e>", "<cs> my lords i am more than grateful to the noble lord lord molloy for asking that question because the noble lord shrewdly puts his finger <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perfectly true that for the first time the soviet union has mentioned verification <e> <s> we very much hope that they are genuine in this proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords we hope that the guidelines agreed at the special session will ensure that the campaign under the auspices of the united nations operates in all parts of the world <e> <s> we see no call at present for any extra contributions because we believe that the united nations has the resources and the outlets that are required <e> <s> we believe therefore that the campaign should be able to go ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord represents a point of view which believes in unilaterilist disarmament <e> <s> what is the point of unilaterally disarming and then expecting the russians at the conference table to make sensible concessions in negotiation <e> <s> this would not occur and unilateral disarmament would in fact undermine hopes for multilateral disarmament <e> <s> it is those arguments on which <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said at the beginning of this question the western alliance has not been instrumental in obstructing the work of the special session <e> <s> the reason why the special session as a general meeting failed was that there was from some governments undue emphasis on nuclear disarmament and nuclear disarmament alone <e> <s> the matter goes very much wider than that and as i have made clear this afternoon the west have put forward important proposals for reductions in conventional forces <e> <s> the noble lord lord brockway does not like hearing that the west is still striving in this way for peace but the west is and that is the truth of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords may i respond to the noble baroness <e> <s> the noble lord lord brockway believes in unilateral disarmament and in undue emphasis upon disarmament in nuclear weapons <e> <s> for reasons which i have given on many occasions other than this afternoon the government do not agree <e> <s> what the government do agree with the noble lord on and i think there is probably wide agreement in your lordships house is that the one success which was achieved in the united nations special session was agreement for the world disarmament campaign <e> <s> we support it and hope that it succeeds <e>", "<cs> my lords the sum of money which the noble lord lord mcnair has mentioned indeed over three-quarters of a million pounds is in fact from income from the sale of postage stamps and has become this very substantial investment which i confirm is the property of the island council <e> <s> the actual portfolio is handled by the crown agents <e> <s> as to the specific point which the noble lord puts to me about keeping a small float of the money ready for contingencies i wonder whether i might look at this and perhaps take advice and also consult the governor and take his advice <e>", "<cs> my lords the appropriate type of radio equipment has been chosen <e> <s> it is hoped to complete the tendering process by august and to place a firm order in september <e> <s> when the equipment is in place it will represent a voice-to-voice instead of a morse link between the island council and the administrator in auckland new zealand <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a perfectly fair point <e> <s> we should have liked to conclude this very much more swiftly but the type of equipment which was found to be needed cannot be bought off-the-shelf <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as british citizenship is concerned the pitcairn islanders will acquire british dependent territory citizenship on the commencement of the british nationality act <e> <s> under the act this will give them rights of residence in the united kingdom but i am bound to say to the noble baroness that the inhabitants of pitcairn island do not show the slightest desire to become residents of the united kingdom <e> <s> they appear to be contented with their life on the island <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat that when the british nationality act comes into force the pitcairn islanders will acquire british dependent territory citizenship <e> <s> it gives british dependent territory citizens rights of residence in the united kingdom <e> <s> but i repeat yet again because the message with <e>", "<cs> my lords the governor is sir richard stratton who is our high commissioner in new zealand <e> <s> he is resident in new zealand and he paid this visit which is in fact the first governors visit since from the th to the th june <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the noble lord lord brockway and indeed to the noble lord lord mcnair who asked the original question if i have inadvertently misled the house <e> <s> the situation is that the governor in paying his visit had two discussions with the island council <e> <s> as the original reply said during those discussions numerous matters of current interest and matters concerning the islands future development were discussed <e> <s> there is no secret about them but these are matters primarily between the island council and the governor because they will involve in some cases the expenditure of money <e> <s> if there is anything further that i can say on these matters i certainly wish to do so <e> <s> i would not be averse in the least to writing a letter to the noble lord lord mcnair and copying it to the noble lord lord brockway if that would help <e> <s> these are not secrets but i do not think i can add a great deal more across the floor of the house to help noble lords today <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the important first point concerning water storage major jasonsmith <e>", "<cs> my lords the bias in spanish public opinion in favour of argentina was for many reasons predictable <e> <s> i understand why the noble lord lord kilmarnock asks his supplementary question but noble lords should know that our embassy in madrid took every practical step to ensure that the spanish government were aware of the true facts <e> <s> so far as the people of spain were concerned since direct broadcasts in spanish were discontinued at the end of the bbc has introduced a recorded service for rebroadcasting by local radio stations <e> <s> during the falkland islands crisis the bbc supplied numerous current affairs reports on tape which were used on major spanish networks <e>", "<cs> my lords i read countless telegrams from embassies all round the world and honestly i cannot remember whether the answer to that question is yes or no <e> <s> the answer from her majestys government is this there are priorities which have to be looked at in allocating the available money to the bbc external services <e> <s> since the cuts were made in october last year that is to say the cuts in current expenditure because in real terms more money is being spent on the bbc world service because of the additional money being spent on increasing audibility we have increased bbc external services broadcasting to poland to latin america and to the falkland islands <e> <s> that is where we believe the priorities lie at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords we have saved by ending it but the rebroadcasting to which i referred in my first supplementary answer is costing some <e>", "<cs> on-going my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords of course this is important and here again i give the same reply as that which i gave to the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> i do not agree with the premise with which the noble lord asks his supplementary question but the house should be aware that a bbc survey of their former one hour a day service showed that of a sample of people questioned listened daily and listened weekly <e> <s> the bbc worked that out as being about people listening to the one hour service each week <e> <s> there are really other ways of getting across the message that we want to get across to the people of spain on any particular issue <e> <s> there are also other priorities and i have sought to identify them in the answer i gave to the noble lord lord strabolgi <e>", "<cs> no my lords the bbc worked it out as being listeners rather a better result than the noble lord lord strabolgi calculated <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord winstanley said that the government must surely regret this <e> <s> of course we would like to hear the bbc speaking to every single part of the world hours a day but this is not possible and this is recognised by the bbc themselves <e> <s> one has to look at the priorities <e> <s> when one considers that broadcasts to poland have been increased by hours a week since last autumn and those to latin america by l hours a week and that the special broadcasts to the falkland islands have been started then i believe we have our priorities right <e> <s> i hestitate to say that the next priority on the list will be spain <e> <s> what about afghanistan <e> <s> one has to look to see where the money is going to do the most good <e> <s> so far as that is concerned the noble lord put to me the perfectly fair point which contradicts a letter i wrote suggesting that very influential people were listening to the vernacular services <e> <s> i believe they probably listen also to the -hour-a-day world service of the bbc <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord who on this occasion brings his experience to say that he thinks that in what is a very difficult matter we are doing the best we can at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos and to the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby for their reaction to the two orders <e> <s> if i may first answer the noble lord lord cledwyn who asked me for a little more detail about the commonwealth agricultural bureaux particularly how many commonwealth countries are members i can tell him that countries are members of the bureaux <e> <s> apart from the headquarters at farnham royal there are bureaux concerned with documentary services located at research institutes or university departments in the united kingdom <e> <s> three institutes concerned with identification services and taxonomic research are also located in the united kingdom and there is the commonwealth institute of biological control with its headquarters in trinidad and outstations in various parts of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords that is almost the position but may i put it like this <e> <s> i have not said that our ratification is absolutely dependent on the united states <e> <s> what i am saying is that we have been in close touch to see what the uhited states intends to do <e> <s> the reason is that because of the very large percentage of the budget of unido which falls to the united states it is important to be assured of the intentions of the united states <e> <s> again i am not saying that unido would not be viable without that contribution but if the united states did not make that per cent <e> <s> contribution somebody else would have to <e> <s> this is an added reason as to why we are so anxious to be assured of the intentions of the united states <e> <s> in case however i have given a wrong impression i should like to repeat that i am advised that it is likely that our ratification will be able to be affected by the beginning of next year <e>", "<cs> that is so <e> <s> may i finally turn to the question asked by the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> immunity of representatives from legal process is restricted to acts done in their official capacity and does not extend to private acts <e> <s> in addition there is no immunity in respect of motor traffic accidents or offences even where it could be argued that the driving was in the exercise of functions as a representative <e> <s> the immunity in regard to official acts unlike the other privileges accorded to representatives persists even after the representative has ceased to be a representative <e> <s> this is necessary in order to enable him to carry out his duties as the representative of a foreign state without fear of harassment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second order standing in my name <e>", "<cs> my lords the first and the last of the noble lords supplementary questions deal with the matter of withdrawal of cuban troops from angola <e> <s> as a member of the five britain agrees that while <e>", "<cs> my lords in their letter to the united nations secretary-general on th july which i mentioned in my original reply to the noble lord lord hatch the five stated their belief that a decision on the method to be employed to elect the constituent assembly should be made in accordance with the provisions of security council resolution without causing delay in the implementation of the resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say that we are concerned at any increase in violence in the namibia context by either side and by that i mean both south africa and swapo <e> <s> we have always made it clear to both sides that increased violence cannot help the prospects of success for the fives continuing efforts <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the words i used were that a namibia solution provides an outstanding opportunity for a broader regional settlement <e> <s> i like to think that those words are robust they are certainly meant so to be <e> <s> i consider that this is a desirable and interrelated objective even though it cannot be a formal precondition for namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the noble lords second supplementary question is concerned i think we must see how we go along those lines but both the eventualities which the noble lord lord brockway mentions are i think wholly desirable <e> <s> so far as the details are concerned that is the nuts and bolts of the electoral process being proposed by the five i can today only reiterate that the five are doing their best to narrow the differences between the parties on the outstanding issues and the two main outstanding issues are the electoral process and the composition and deployment of the united nations transitional assistance group <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first question is concerned the presence of cuban troops in angola is a matter of concern to all who are concerned with the namibia process and i repeat that the process of trying to sort out the namibia problem provides an outstanding opportunity for a broader regional settlement in this matter <e> <s> so far as the presence of a mission of the five in windhoek is concerned that mission is there in order to bring the internal parties up to date on developments in new york and i think that is a highly desirable thing for the five to do <e>", "<cs> my lords the start talks and the briefings which the americans give to us and their other allies about them are confidential <e> <s> we have noted and welcomed the serious intentions with which the united states has entered these negotiations <e> <s> we must hope that the russians reciprocate <e>", "<cs> my lords the united states of course has proposed to concentrate in the start talks on the most destabilising elements the ballistic missiles including particularly land-based ballistic missiles but the americans have also made clear their <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i also had noted the reference to this in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord lord kennet <e> <s> the two sets of negotiations are proceeding in parallel and of course they are proceeding together in geneva <e> <s> there is close co-ordination between the delegations <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords question gives me the opportunity to record that in the three sets of talks which are taking place at the present time the start talks the intermediate-range nuclear force reduction talks and also what are known as the mbfr talks the mutual and balanced force reduction talks in vienna the west has made proposals for reductions in force levels and we await a response from the russians <e> <s> but those proposals rely as the noble lord so rightly says upon the agreement as to what everybody has in other words data and also verification to see that both sides are playing the game in undertaking their reductions and the talks will not be successful unless the questions of data and verification can be agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords as the united kingdom disposed of all its chemical weapons years ago naturally i agree with the noble lord that we welcome this move by the russians <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for her majestys government to comment on united states military supplies to israel but the united states are best placed to bring the conflict to an end and so we support mr habibs mission <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with lord stewarts final remarks <e> <s> the overall peace settlement which we all so much desire must take account not only of the palestinian right to determine their own future but also israels right to security and peace <e>", "<cs> my lords what we have to do now is await the outcome of mr habibs mission <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been the intention of all the security council resolutions which have been passed since this tragedy began <e> <s> the latest one security council resolution indeed calls for an immediate ceasefire and cessation of military activities in the lebanon <e> <s> it also requires the deployment of united nations observers to monitor the situation in and around beirut if the government of the lebanon immediately calls for this <e> <s> the united nations have now heard from the government of the lebanon and from the plo both expressing their desire for this <e> <s> a response is now awaited from israel <e>", "<cs> no my lords we have not done this <e> <s> different nations have their own rules about the selling of arms which is one of the most difficult questions of modern times <e> <s> we have our own rules and we hope by our example that we are doing as much as we can in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord refers to as he sees it the isolation of the united states in this matter but i think i must make it clear that her majestys government believe deeply that it is the united states which can bring a settlement of this tragedy <e> <s> it is for that reason i repeat that we pin our hopes on the mission of mr habib <e> <s> for the success of that mission there must be the pre-condition of a cease-fire <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first part of the noble lords question it is simply not a matter for us <e> <s> it is not appropriate that we should comment upon the arms supplies which the united states sees fit to send to other countries <e> <s> as to the second part of the noble lords question i think that is answered by resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords at every stage her majestys government have shown the very opposite impression from that which the noble lord is seeking to impart that we wash our hands of this tragedy <e> <s> we have supported the united nations at every stage with the ten we have tried to map out how the problem might be resolved we have given humanitarian aid and we support in principle the establishment of a peace-keeping force <e> <s> but it is not our business nor would it be appropriate for the government to comment on arms supplies to israel from the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords on the last two questions that have been asked one by the noble baroness lady gaitskell and the other by the noble lord lord mayhew what we must try to do instead of giving what might be said by certain parties to be gratuitous advice is to support the united nations in their resolutions to obtain a cease-fire and to pin our hopes on the success of mr habibs mission <e>", "<cs> my lords in his statement on th july the united kingdoms representative on the security council said that a strengthened peacekeeping presence would be likely to be essential in the lebanon <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the amnesty international report is concerned it acknowledges that it is difficult to give precise figures for the numbers of political detainees at present and accepts that those detained in recent years have mostly been released after a short period <e> <s> however having said that i give the noble lord an assurance that the government will continue to use appropriate ways of making it clear that we deplore violations of human rights wherever they occur <e>", "<cs> my lords i confirm that so far as we can see there will be nations sufficient to ratify the convention <e> <s> but of course that is a matter for the nations concerned when they have seen and studied the final texts when signature of the treaty and then of the convention has taken place and when finally the moment comes when states must decide whether they ratify or whether they do not <e> <s> the noble lord asked me about the attitude of the united states <e> <s> as i said in an answer which i gave to the noble lord on th july we continue to remain in close touch with all our major allies on this difficult subject and we have done our best to try to achieve a compromise <e> <s> for instance at the september session of the united nations law of the sea conference proposals for amendments were seriously discussed in the hope that they might be acceptable to both the americans and the group of <e> <s> but i am afraid to say that the latter refused to consider any substantive amendments at this stage <e> <s> therefore we are left with a difficult situation as to what our own attitude should be with regard to signature and ratification of the convention <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the main problem arises on the deep sea mining texts <e> <s> there is absolutely no question about that <e> <s> so far as the european community is concerned i am sure that the noble lord lord cledwyn would not mind my just saying that of course the majority of european community member states actually abstained in the vote on th april and that included the united kingdom <e> <s> so when the united kingdom is taken to task for its abstention where were the majority of european community states <e> <s> the reason why this abstention occurred is that states are deeply worried that there is not a consensus a consensus which many of us sought in discussion during the september meeting of unlosc to reach <e> <s> so the position which the united kingdom is in is that we are now examining the texts which have emerged from the conference in the light of all our national interests and the views oldie governments <e> <s> but no decision has yet been taken as to whether or not we will sign the convention <e>", "<cs> my lords we the united states the federal republic of germany and france are encouraging our companies to resolve any disagreement which they may have as a result of the overlapping of prospective exploration sites by means of private negotiation and arbitration procedures <e> <s> but there is nothing in this arrangement which conflicts with the convention or any resolution of the conference <e> <s> i assure the noble lord that it does not in way prejudice the decision which the united kingdom government must take about the signature of the convention <e>", "<cs> my lords that is why we are now thinking seriously about what our next step should be <e>", "<cs> my lords the government continue to seek a comprehensive test ban treaty <e> <s> one of the principal difficulties identified in earlier negotiations was the question of verification and compliance <e> <s> we therefore took an active part in bringing about the agreement to establish a working group in the committee on disarmament to examine these issues <e> <s> we play a full part in the groups activities and in the work of the related group of scientific experts <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot reveal details of the confidential negotiations which took place in the working group of the committee on disarmament but the technical problems of detecting and identifying explosions with an acceptable degree of confidence are i think well known <e> <s> in addition no satisfactory method exists for differentiation between nuclear explosions for military purposes and those for peaceful uses <e>", "<cs> my lords i absolutely agree with the noble lord but one needs to be able to verify the process <e>", "<cs> my lords because that is the basis on which the powers have entered into the discussions in the working group of the committee on disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may reply to the last part of the question asked by the noble lord lord molloy it appears that work on a comprehensive test ban treaty was not proceeding very fruitfully <e> <s> there were discussions in geneva as to what should be done <e> <s> the united kingdom undoubtedly played a very active part in the decision to set up a working group within the committee on disarmament to deal with this important and central question of verification from the point of view of a comprehensive test ban treaty <e> <s> it is that work which is proceeding now <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so with respect <e> <s> i think that that question is irrelevant <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that there is a difference of views over sovereignty <e> <s> the chinese position is well known and my right honourable friend the prime minister stated our position clearly <e> <s> but the great advantage of my right honourable friends talks with the chinese leadership is that there was agreement on a common aim to maintain the stability and prosperity of hong kong and the aim of the talks was to build on this <e> <s> this is the path we are now going down <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it was enormously important that as a result of my right honourable friends visit there was this agreement to enter into talks with the common aim of maintaining the stability and prosperity of hong kong <e> <s> it was necessary as anybody who takes an interest in hong kong knows for minds to begin to meet on the question of hong kong <e> <s> may i say to the noble lord lord gladwyn that in addition to the subject of hong kong there were extremely valuable talks on other subjects conducted by my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord shepherd for that question and for reasons which i know are obvious to the noble lord and to others of your lordships the contents of the talks must necessarily remain confidential <e> <s> but that does not rule out an agreed statement during the talks if there is anything which ought to be reported <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take the opportunity of the noble lords question to say that her majestys governments aim is to preserve the stability and the prosperity of hong kong in a way which is acceptable to parliament and to the people of hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kaldor reads into the fall in the hong kong stock exchange and the exchange rates reasons of which certainly i am not aware <e> <s> the noble lord will with his long experience know better than i do that sharp fluctuations in the index are more common on that stock exchange and indeed on other exchanges than in western stock exchanges <e> <s> in august before my right honourable friends visit the index fell because it was heavily centred on property shares <e> <s> in addition of course other far east indices notably singapore and malaysia have followed a similar pattern over the year including an august drop which again was before my right honourable friends visit <e> <s> and of course the level of the exchange rate is tied to a considerable extent to the strength at the moment of the us dollar <e> <s> incidentally as we are talking about this let us remember that the hong kong stock exchange has gone up on both of the last two days and the exchange rate seems to have settled down to a sensible and stable level <e> <s> so with respect to the noble lord whose experience i always respect and try to follow i would not read the same lessons into what occurred on the hong kong stock exchange as the noble lord has done <e>", "<cs> then my lords so that there is no misunderstanding at all and on behalf of the government may i make it quite clear that the agreement between the chinese leadership and my right honour <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord i am not sure where his information comes from but it is not the same as mine <e> <s> the only information that i have at the moment is that there was an agreement i repeat it yet again and both the chinese leadership and my right honourable friend the prime minister agreed that talks should now open on the basis of the future prosperity and stability of hong kong <e> <s> no details were given by either side as to what was to be agreed or discussed within those two paramount parameters within which the talks should take place <e> <s> i think that that was valuable and i believe that if the talks can proceed on that basis this very difficult problem can be solved <e>", "<cs> no my lords we have not yet decided that <e> <s> we are obviously considering it in the ambit of the caution we must have and which i explained <e> <s> we are obviously considering that very seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords i do apologise to the noble lord lord gladwyn who said that the interests <e>", "<cs> yes in the long run <e> <s> obviously what the noble lord says is wise and far-seeing but the matter which is upmost in the minds of the british government at the moment is that we very much hope that israel will come to see that her interests are better served by exploring every avenue possible that might lead to a lasting peace <e> <s> in doing that <e> <s> i think it is fair to say that russia has not given any pointers as to what she would like to see happen in the middle east <e> <s> it was for that reason that i was silent on the question of soviet russia <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall draw that to the attention of my noble friend the chief whip <e> <s> it is of course a matter for the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the answer to the second question <e> <s> all i do know is the answer that i gave to the noble lord that we have fully discharged our commitments to the ida <e> <s> i repeat fully <e> <s> i do not have the figures <e> <s> if the noble lord does not believe me when i say fully then the noble lord must go away unsatisfied <e>", "<cs> i shall not give way my lords <e> <s> the answer to the noble lord is absolutely straightforward <e> <s> we have fully discharged our commitment to the ida <e> <s> i am delighted that we have done so <e> <s> indeed we shall do our very best to fulfil our commitments to j what is called the special assistance programme of the ida in <e> <s> as regards the noble lords first question i was talking about the increase in cash terms million in the next financial year for our aid programme compared to the present financial year <e>", "<cs> my lords we are still examining the texts which have emerged from the conference in the light of our national interests and the views of other governments <e> <s> no decision has yet been taken as to whether or not to sign the convention <e> <s> so far as debate in your lordships house is concerned that of course would be a matter for the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords the lack of consensus within the conference is the reason why the united kingdom abstained on the vote on the adoption of the convention <e> <s> so far as our final decision as to whether or not to sign is concerned as i say we are still studying the text <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is being perhaps uncharacteristically a little harsh so far as the period of time is concerned <e> <s> the last session of the conference was held in new york on nd to th september <e> <s> it was on that occassion that the british government tried very hard indeed to get an area of agreement between the group of nations and the main mining nations particularly on the difficult questions of transfer of technology and opportunities for mining companies to get licences when the independent seabed authority is set up and indeed on the question of the review conference which is another difficult matter so far as mining under the convention is concerned <e> <s> on all those three points the united kingdom was not successful in being able to get a consensus <e> <s> with respect to the noble lord that was not so very long ago and we have only had since that moment to sit down and think what our final decision on the convention should be <e> <s> that is what we are still doing at the present time <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think the answer to that could possibly be yes <e> <s> i would go further <e> <s> there is no question of the ira being able to participate in the benefits of the convention <e> <s> they could not meet the necessary criteria <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of debate on this subject which has incidentally been the subject of more than one parliamentary question in your lordships house is entirely a matter for the usual channels in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords a matter of this kind is entirely a matter for the house and not for the government <e> <s> if any of your lordships wish to raise the matter in debate the government must stand ready to reply as indeed i have stood ready to reply on behalf of the government to questions which have already been asked <e>", "<cs> my lords let us be quite clear <e> <s> there is very little doubt that the clauses in the convention on mining the seabed could be very disadvantageous to this country although there are other clauses such as those concerning the freedom of navigation that would help us <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for pointing out what undoubtedly is a misprint in the record of your lordships house <e> <s> there should have been a negative either in the speech that i gave or else in the record which was made at the column which the noble lord has repeated in his question because there is of course no linkage between resolution of the united nations security council and the removal of cuban troops <e> <s> but having said that while the five representatives of the united nations of whom britain is one are not directly involved in the current discussions between the american angolan and south african governments we and our partners recognise the need to take account of regional security concerns in working out an overall settlement <e> <s> the five believe that such a settlement could strengthen peace and security and foster economic development in the region <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat that i think that it will be very much for regional security if we can see a removal of cuban forces from angola <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is any immediate prospect of such an arrangement and i believe that the french government have themselves made clear now that they have no intention of taking such action <e> <s> but i am sure that those directly involved in the negotiations would be ready to consider anything which might contribute to a solution <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord has heard that with alarm and regret the noble lord must have suffering from alarm and regret for about the last four years because united nations security council resolution has never had any linkage on this subject within it <e> <s> but having said that i agree with the noble lord that to use ones common sense one must realise that it will help regional security and be for the good order of southern africa if we can see cuban troops beginning to depart from angola <e>", "<cs> my lords the government would in no way quarrel with what the noble lord says but it is not part of the namibia negotiations or solution <e>", "<cs> no my lords but as one of the contact group of five who were of course the permanent members of the security council when the resolution was passed the government are loyally trying to put into effect a security council resolution which we believe will be for the good order of southern africa <e> <s> i repeat that within that security council resolution there is no linkage on this subject <e> <s> but i repeat again in case the noble lord has not taken the point on board that if the noble lord and the government use our common sense which i am sure we can we would both be at one in believing that the removal of cuban troops is desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords the angolans have made clear their willingness to consider withdrawing cuban forces once a namibia settlement is achieved and external threats to their security are ended <e> <s> it is therefore a chicken-and-egg situation <e> <s> these discussions are now going on between the united states and the angolan and the south african governments to see whether all sides can agree on this particularly difficult aspect of the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord <e> <s> lord hatch would be satisfied if resolution could be carried fully into effect <e> <s> may i remind the noble lord that a very great deal of progress has been made on that by the contact group of five of whom britain is one and that we now have only two problems left to overcome <e> <s> one is to agree on the electoral system for namibia in the future and the other on the composition deployment and practical arrangements for the united nations transition assistance group <e> <s> but in order to reach that finishing tape to be politically real about this there must undoubtedly be some agreement about the removal of cuban troops even though that removal is not linked to resolution <e> <s> it is those difficult discussions which are also going on at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that question <e>", "<cs> my lords the conclusion of resolution is one matter the removal of cuban troops is another matter <e> <s> but if the noble lord will put on his common-sense hat he will realise that the one affects the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that the report is very valuable for the reasons that the noble lord gave <e> <s> i think that i would pick out as being of particular value in its recommendations first that it specifically excludes unilateral disarmament secondly that it emphasises the importance of verification in arms control and thirdly that it recognises that the best way of making progress is through specific and balanced agreements step by step <e>", "<cs> my lords by meeting a major stated eastern requirement firm commitments by all participants from the outset the alliance in an initiative which was taken at the beginning of july has i think again demonstrated the seriousness of its commitment in mutual and balanced force reductions <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly wish to work for a comprehensive test ban and we have of course been active in supporting the setting up in the disarmament committee at geneva of a working group to look at the particularly difficult problem of verification <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so that is an interesting question and the noble lord hits the nail right on the head because the western powers have made proposals for arbitration on force levels in the mbfr talks in vienna <e> <s> this again is an initiative to which we await a response <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the noble lord if i got him wrong in his original supplementary question but i think that the answer remains no because in both cases there is a difficulty of targeting <e> <s> this is the problem and if you declare a zone to be nuclear-free it may be nuclear-free for those who are of good intention but those who are not of good intention can simply station their nuclear weapons just outside the zone and target them on the zone <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i had better look carefully at what the noble lord has said and at what i have said and if i have misled the noble lord or the house i shall of course write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so the noble lord is asking me about two things so far as the third world countries are concerned may i make it crystal clear that the government welcome anything which can be done to see that the valuable provisions of the non-proliferation treaty are really made to stick <e> <s> so far as concerns the proposal in the report for a concordat of the five permanent members of the security council the government feel that this is something which really would not work <e> <s> we feel that the falklands afghanistan and other crises suggest that the united nations would rarely have sufficient warning time to achieve the kind of conflict prevention which is advocated in the report on that particular point <e>", "<cs> my lords our attitude is for a step-by-step approach and this is why we welcome the individual negotiations on intermediate nuclear forces and on strategic forces both in geneva and on mutual and balanced force reductions in vienna <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i entirely agree with the force of his question <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and this is why we are endeavouring to proceed step-by-step not only so far as nuclear weapons are concerned but also so far as conventional forces are concerned <e>", "<cs> but my lords surely as the speech of my noble friend lord home made clear in the debate on the gracious speech only a week ago all arguments moral strategic and security arguments point towards the desirability of mutual and balanced force reductions <e> <s> if we can achieve that in both the nuclear and conventional fields that would give the security which the noble lord is speaking about not only for the western powers but for the soviet union as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully understand the concern expressed by my noble friend <e> <s> indeed during the month of september on a visit to zimbabwe my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence made it clear that while we recognise that this was essentially an internal matter for zimbabwe we were concerned about reports of ill-treatment <e> <s> my right honourable friend urged that the air force detainees should be brought to trial soon and he was given to understand that this would be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is any such assumption in the question which has been asked by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that this has been done <e> <s> i repeat and my noble friend was good enough to recognise the difficulty that we are in a position where we cannot make formal intervention on behalf of those detained although informally we have expressed our concern <e> <s> if i find that the international committee of the red cross has been approached i promise that i will write immediately to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords no decisions have yet been taken on the size and scope of our future military aid for zimbabwe <e>", "<cs> my lords in a case of this kind we operate under the haig convention on the conflict of nationality of to which we are a party <e> <s> that is the principle of international practice under which we operate <e> <s> having said that i think that i have made clear to the house that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence in particular has made energetic representations in this difficult case <e>", "<cs> my lords these are matters for the irish authorities <e> <s> but the foreign minister of the republic of ireland in a written answer in the dail on th july said that his government intended to proceed with legislation as quickly as possible <e> <s> i am unable to comment on what provisions this legislation might contain <e> <s> i am not aware of any discrimination by the irish land commission against british subjects resident in the republic <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend that the removal of the irish vote in this country would not be something to be taken lightly <e> <s> so far as the last part of my noble friends question is concerned the last three governments of the irish republic have all expressed their intention to introduce legislation as soon as their parliamentary timetable allows <e> <s> i think the last undertaking of this kind was by the irish foreign minister and of course that was before the general election was called <e> <s> i think <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am most grateful to the noble marquess for the last part of his question which i am sure is right <e> <s> i cannot answer the first part of the question as to how many british citizens there are in the irish republic who would be allowed to vote if legislation were passed but i can say that the percentage of the electorate in britain who are from ireland and who vote is lower than would be the percentage of british subjects in ireland if they had the vote there <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with that <e> <s> but i was simply responding to the noble marquess and trying to give him my figures <e> <s> so far as the matter of principle is concerned i think that the house will probably join with the government in welcoming the fact that the select committee on home affairs in another place has chosen to make this subject part of its current inquiry into the representation of the people act <e>", "<cs> my lords we should think about the point put by the right reverend prelate <e> <s> of course it was only in june as i said in my main answer that my right honourable friend mr douglas hurd made representations to the soviet ambassador and that was fairly recent <e> <s> however i should like to draw my right honourable friends attention to what the right reverend prelate said <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty with what my noble friend suggests is that all matters relating to the imprisonment of hess are subject to agreement by the four powers <e> <s> the unilateral action suggested by my noble friend to be taken by the british government or by the three western powers acting together would constitute a violation of a binding international agreement and could put in jeopardy the whole complex of four-power agreements on which the security of west berlin is based <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had no formal response to my right honourable friends approach <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord cledwyn and lord gladwyn for the questions they have asked <e> <s> as the noble lord lord cledwyn said it was quite a considerable agenda <e> <s> i will endeavour to answer the questions both as satisfactorily and as briefly as possible <e> <s> the first question from the noble lord lord cledwyn was will the budget problem be discussed in copenhagen <e> <s> the answer to that is yes <e> <s> the intention is that the presidency of the community will raise this issue in copenhagen at the european council and will report agreement by the foreign ministers in the council on which i have just read my right honourable friends statement about the handling of the recent paper by the commission on the solution for and later <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the noble lord is being quite as characteristically fair as he normally is <e> <s> i say that because agreement was recorded on a special aid programme for central america which is in fact costa rica honduras and the dominican republic <e> <s> that is new <e> <s> then there was a new management regulation designed to improve the procedures governing the communitys food aid programme about which the noble lord lord cledwyn asked me <e> <s> then there was the reference to the lom convention <e> <s> so that there shall be no misunderstanding i should say that we are of course talking about lom iii which will not come into effect until <e> <s> this really is a reference to the preliminary run-up work to see that the community is ready to get lom iii into position three years from now when lom ii comes to an end <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give an undertaking that either her majestys government or the community will agree with the point of view expressed in the report but the report of course is valuable and important and i certainly give the undertaking for which the noble lord asks <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not repeat in answer to my noble friend what i said to the noble lord lord gladwyn regarding the particularly sensitive areas which are under close discussion at the moment in which at the moment there is no solution <e> <s> but i would say to my noble friend that any meeting of this sort must ultimately reflect a balance of varied views <e> <s> we attach great importance to the success of the meeting as a contribution to the maintenance of the open trading system <e> <s> that must be our primary objective <e>", "<cs> my lords i have never given a figure of per cent <e> <s> reduction in aid for this year compared with last year <e> <s> in cash terms there is a reduction of per cent <e> <s> compared with the previous year <e> <s> nor have i ever tried on behalf of her majestys government to give an assessment of the number of jobs created by the giving of aid <e> <s> i should have thought that that was almost impossible <e>", "<cs> no my lords that is not the case <e> <s> the proportion of our aid at the moment is per cent <e> <s> of gnp <e> <s> incidentally that is well above the oecd average <e> <s> the percentage was in <e>", "<cs> my lords as a result of the anglo-french summit the british and french governments are to be in considerably closer touch and i am sure that that is something which the noble lord lord brockway will welcome <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord brockway will also welcome the fact that because the british government accept the view put forward by him in the next financial year our aid figure in cash terms will be per cent <e> <s> greater than that of this year <e>", "<cs> my lords the aid programme of this country is substantial <e> <s> it is in the region of million and that reflects the very strong basis of the economy of this country at the present time <e> <s> it is dispensed on a careful and selective basis but with particular emphasis placed on the dispensation of funds to the poorest countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lady trumpington for that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is precisely because of the advice which the noble lord lord cledwyn is giving in his supplementary question that when the foreign affairs council of the european community was held only a week ago it was finally confirmed that the community should give an additional million units of account to honduras costa rica and dominica <e> <s> precisely what the noble lord is advising is right first of all discussions then action <e> <s> that is what happened on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is for the house to judge what the figures show <e> <s> i will give the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords that is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be foolish if i crossed swords with the noble lord after many years experience the noble lord has had as a senior minister in the treasury but as someone who is perhaps like mrs malaprop in that i do not understand figures very well would i not be right in thinking that it is a little difficult to give real-term figures for a financial year which has not yet ended <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord cledwyn of penrhos and lord mackie of benshie for their comments <e> <s> clearly both noble lords are concerned on behalf of their parties about what is an important statement and i understand their reservations <e>", "<cs> if it is for the convenience of the house my lords i shall reply to one question at a time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has asked me about the position of other countries <e> <s> france has said that it will sign the convention in jamaica but it will seek changes in the deep seabed rgime and i understand that the netherlands will do likewise <e> <s> i understand that turkey venezuela argentina and israel will not sign and of course the united states will not sign <e> <s> on the other hand some community countries namely denmark ireland and greece have said that they will sign as have canada australia and new zealand <e> <s> there are other community countries which are still considering their position they include the federal republic of germany belgium and italy all of which share our misgivings about the seabed provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is fair for me to repeat what i said a little while ago in your lordships house <e> <s> we tried at the last meeting of the conference in september to be the catalyst to get agreement between those who disagreed fundamentally on the deep sea mining provisions <e> <s> the two major points were the question of the transfer of technology and also the certainty or better certainty for the awarding of licences under the convention <e> <s> we did not succeed in doing so and that is why today we are saying that we wish to see whether it is possible to explore the prospects with interested states for gaining a greater area of agreement before we come to sign the convention <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord balogh is overlooking the fact that the international seabed authority which when the conference on the convention began its deliberations was going to have been not very far off self-supporting will now cost huge sums of money in order to support <e> <s> any government must take that into account in order to try to decide whether it is in the national interest to decide on a convention which contains deep sea mining provisions at the moment <e> <s> for the reasons which i sought to deploy in your lordships house on more than one occasion and again today we have some very grave reservations about this and i underline them in answer to the noble lords question because the government would have to take into account the huge sums of money which will be necessary in order to finance the provisions of the convention <e> <s> i do not think that that answer adds up to the fact that there has been unwarrantable pressure brought to bear by mining interests <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the noble lords first question i hoped that i had made it clear that the question of technology really needs to take into account the fact that very substantial sums of money will be needed in order to finance the provisions of this convention <e> <s> it is no good talking about the transfer of technology as though this is something which is happening in a vacuum it is necessary under the convention to finance it and on any objective view at the moment there is not a fair provision under the convention for the transfer of technology <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for this opportunity to respond on behalf of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friends assessment and also i agree with my noble friend that provided we remain firm in the intentions which we have stated that is the way that we will be most likely to get an arms control agreement which is both balanced and verifiable <e>", "<cs> my lords the andropov offer is bogus <e> <s> it endeavours to equate intermediate-range land-based nuclear missiles which only the russians hold targeted at every single country in western europe with strategic weapons which both france and the united kingdom hold <e> <s> that is not equating like with like <e> <s> if for the first time the russians now accept the principle that their sss must be reduced before there can be greater security that i would agree with the noble lord is a step in the right direction <e> <s> but to demand a substantial and continuing soviet monopoly of longer-range land-based missiles in europe while insisting that nato alone should implement the zero option is not a serious negotiating position <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps for the record the way i should reply is that my understanding is that mr andropovs offer would be to remove all the old russian sss and sss and to reduce the very modern ss russian rockets to the equivalents of the british and french independent strategic missile forces while allowing no deployment at all of the american intermediate-range cruise and pershing missiles <e> <s> my understanding of that as a conclusion is it would mean that there would therefore be a monopoly and i am agreeing with my noble friend of russian intermediate-range weapons in europe still targeted upon every single country in western europe <e>", "<cs> my lords the supplementary question which the noble lord lord brockway asked me about mr andropovs offer arises from one of the disarmament negotiations which are going on at the moment between east and west which is what the original question was about <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that all your lordships would well understand the distaste indeed the dismay of many people at the thought of nuclear war but in her majestys governments view and in the view of the western alliance it is only by steadiness and determination that we shall reach the goal of an agreed balanced and verifiable disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly it is the intention of the west to see that the dialogue is kept going in the inf and at the start talks in geneva and also in the mbfr talks in vienna <e>", "<cs> my lords the offer is bogus because it deliberately mixes the two sets of negotiations which are going on in geneva at the present time <e> <s> an offer to reduce russian intermediate-range land-based missiles of which at the moment the soviet union has a monopoly by a trade-off against strategic systems held by the british and the french is a bogus offer <e> <s> it would end as pointed out by my noble friend lord nugent of guildford in the unwelcome result of maintaining a monopoly for russia in land-based <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord kennet for that timely question <e>", "<cs> my lords a bogus offer is an offer which is deliberately misleading <e> <s> perhaps it would be better if i repeated my final words when talking of mr andropovs offer when i said that the offer is not a serious negotiating position <e>", "<cs> my lords of course it is a fact that the ability to express views about the perils of nuclear warfare is open to people in the free countries of the west but not to those in the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely take the point of the noble lord lord mackie that it is essential to make it clear to people generally that the west wishes to hold out the hand of friendship <e> <s> therefore may i seize the opportunity to remind the house that in the inf talks the offer from the west is for no land-based missiles at all to threaten the people of europe both on the russian side of the european border and on the western side of the european border <e> <s> the offer from the west in the start negotiations is for deep cuts in these terrible inter-continental ballistic missiles <e> <s> the offer from the west in the mbfr talks in vienna which have been going on for eight long years is for very substantial reductions in conventional forces on the central front in europe <e> <s> the west is holding out the hand of friendship and does want to find a way to get verifiable but balanced reductions in forces <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mayhew has raised a subject of great importance the present state of the negotiations in geneva on intermediate-range nuclear weapons <e> <s> the majority of these weapons are based in europe or are targeted upon western european countries <e> <s> in his speech the noble lord lord jenkins of putney asked us to look at the problem through soviet eyes <e> <s> the noble lord claimed united states superiority in strategic systems <e> <s> such a soviet claim cannot be upheld <e> <s> the two superpowers have about the same number of warheads on the strategic ballistic missiles <e> <s> however the soviet union has some per cent <e> <s> more strategic systems <e> <s> therefore i think my noble friend lord beloff was right to make the point that during the s the soviet union caught up with the united states at the strategic nuclear level the inter-continental and sea-based ballistic missiles and the strategic bombers <e>", "<cs> my lords this is ground which the house has gone over time and time again <e> <s> the inf and start talks are talks between the two major nuclear powers <e> <s> we hope we pray we believe in and we are working for agreement in those talks by making the realistic proposal from the west of the zero option at the inf talks and by proposals for deep cuts in the strategic systems held so far as the start talks are concerned <e> <s> it is necessary to get agreement between the two super powers in those talks <e> <s> then will be the right moment to start thinking of other things <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not said from whom he sought and obtained a change in the rules but the noble lord can take it that it was sought and obtained from london <e>", "<cs> my lords i absolutely understand the noble lords point <e> <s> i think that i ought to write a rather fuller letter to the noble lord as i have promised <e> <s> if i may i should like to make two points <e> <s> first of all the fact that the government have now committed money and indeed have started to pay out money in considerable quantities to the falkland islands shows that the government are genuine and serious in supporting an improvement in the economic conditions of the islands based of course on lord shackletons enormously valuable and speedy report <e> <s> secondly we have naturally been in touch with the falklands islands company so far as investment is concerned <e> <s> we have also had discussions with various companies interested either in investment or in the prospects of obtaining contracts <e> <s> news of the establishment of a bank branch and a brewery represent the first fruits of those consultations <e>", "<cs> my lords i personally have not seen the full text but i assume that the noble lord is referring to the proposal for a non-aggression pact <e> <s> in that case we are always willing to study any serious proposal but such pacts have been proposed before and of course they flow from the charter of the united nations <e> <s> to show our good intentions in this respect so far as britain is concerned i can say that we believe in the non-use of force in international affairs <e> <s> look what this country did last year to uphold that principle <e>", "<cs> my lords such appointments are a matter for the government concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord lord cledwyn <e> <s> as i endeavoured to say in answer to the first supplementary question of the noble lord lord jenkins we are always willing to look at any serious proposal <e> <s> a proposal of the kind which the noble lord lord jenkins mentioned could undoubtedly be looked at closely in one of the arms reduction talks which are going ahead at the present time in geneva <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to cross swords with the noble lord on this matter but i made it crystal clear on behalf of the government when we debated the motion of the noble lord on arms control that her majestys government in this country were very satisfied with the way in which they had been able to keep in contact with the united states on the arms control negotiations <e> <s> i would simply remind the house that so far as intermediate nuclear force weapons are concerned in europe there is an enormous preponderance on the soviet side threatening every country in western europe and there is on the table a genuine offer from the united states on behalf of nato which would remove this threat entirely <e> <s> so far as strategic arms reduction talks are concerned there is again reckoned to be a two-to-one advantage to soviet russia in terms of throw-weight of ballistic missiles and once again there is a genuine and radical offer on the table from the united states for deep cuts in strategic weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baronesss question takes the whole house back to when we were allies at the end of a terrible war <e> <s> since then as my noble friend lord beloff made clear in his speech on a motion moved by the noble lord lord mayhew a few weeks ago in this house there has been a continual escalation in the build-up of nuclear weapons on the russian side so that there is a vast preponderance in soviet superiority <e> <s> it is that which we want to try to put right so that there can be real security on both sides of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble and learned lord refer to the offer which was mentioned by the noble lord lord jenkins as being from the warsaw pact last week <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may repeat that any serious offer is an offer which i know the nato countries would be ready to consider <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord in essence asks me if the soviet union/warsaw pact has an advantage in nuclear weapons is it not unsurprising that they would be reluctant to give that up <e> <s> my answer to that question is that we will not be threatened by anyone but we will not deploy our own inf weapons provided the russians will abandon their sss which undoubtedly threaten the whole of western europe today <e> <s> i repeat that we will of course seriously consider any proposals but we will not be deflected by threats which are uttered from time to <e>", "<cs> that is my understanding my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it really is absurd to put to her majestys government a suggestion that we should put pressure upon our greatest ally in order to study the absolutely fundamental question of verification which the western countries have been putting upon the table for the warsaw pact to consider for years and years <e> <s> if verification is a possibility as the noble lord says to the goverment then i would assure him that it will be considered seriously in the inf or the start talks taking place in geneva <e> <s> so far as the question of the british and french deterrents are concerned a durable agreement has to be based upon the principle of parity between the two major nuclear weapons states <e>", "<cs> and that my lords is precisely why the western powers on behalf of their peoples and on behalf of our future are so worried that there is a monopoly in europe of land-based intermediate-range nuclear weapons in soviet hands <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have made clear many times that we are like successive governments before us satisfied with existing arrangements <e> <s> under these the use by the united states in an emergency of bases in the united kingdom including cruise missile bases will be a matter for joint decision between the british and american governments in the light of circumstances at the time <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i would not agree with the noble lord lord gladwyn in that assumption <e> <s> the use of united states bases in the united kingdom in an emergency would be a matter for joint decision by her majestys government and the united states government in the light of the circumstances prevailing at the time <e> <s> the government are aware that concern has been expressed about the effectiveness of these arrangements and the government are satisfied that the arrangements are effective <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord lauderdale <e> <s> it goes back to a communiqu issued in after discussions between mr churchill and mr truman which confirmed arrangements reached earlier between mr attlee and mr truman <e> <s> the arrangements are precisely those which have applied for nearly years and which have been supported by successive governments <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the geneva negotiations are concerned of course it is our wish that we should achieve the zero option so that the threat of these intermediate range weapons would be removed from either side <e> <s> so far as control is concerned i repeat that the use of united states bases in the united kingdom in an emergency would be a matter for joint decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given the basis of the agreement about the use of bases in an emergency <e> <s> it is a long-standing well understood arrangement between united states presidents and british prime ministers <e> <s> i repeat that we are satisfied that these arrangements are effective <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that the noble lord lord kennet is referring to the thor missiles which were based in the united kingdom for only five years <e> <s> they were the only nuclear missile system ever <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat what i have already said that this is a very long-standing and well understood arrangement between united states presidents and british prime ministers which as my noble friend lord lauderdale reminded the house goes back over a period of about years <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not wish to comment upon anything which i have read in the press <e> <s> a dual key arrangement would entail the united kingdom purchasing the missiles and supporting equipment except the warheads and manning them in the same way as we do the lance missiles in germany <e> <s> since we are satisfied with the existing arrangements for the control of such weapons we do not think that this would be a sensible use of defence resources <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that final question is that this is a long-standing well understood arrangement between presidents and prime ministers and it works <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that the government are not believed <e> <s> after all this is a situation which has been in existence for a very long time <e> <s> it is right for me to end this exchange by repeating that the government are aware that concern has been expressed about the effectiveness of these arrangements but the government are satisfied that the arrangements are effective <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first question is concerned the answer is yes warrant officer klue was withdrawn following an approach by the foreign and commonwealth office to the south african ambassador <e> <s> we had good reason to believe he was engaged in activities incompatible with his official status in this country and he will not be allowed to return <e> <s> so far as the noble lords second question is concerned the government are still considering a report on that case <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord may have a particular case in mind <e> <s> if it is the same one that i have in mind legal proceedings connected with that affair are still pending therefore the noble and learned lord will perhaps forgive me if i do not comment further upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lords question was given in my original answer <e> <s> a single member of the south african embassy warrant officer klue was withdrawn <e> <s> therefore there was no further action that anybody needed to or could take <e>", "<cs> my lords that is precisely what her majestys government have done but i am at pains to make clear that her majestys government would take precisely that action whichever government was concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that goes a little wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am almost certain that the figures which i gave are gross figures <e> <s> if by any chance i am misleading the noble lord i will write immediately to put that right <e> <s> but i am pretty sure that they are gross figures <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty of course about the second and the third years of ida is that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i must make it clear that i am advised that the figures which the government have do not equate with the figures which the noble lord has put to me <e> <s> nonetheless i should like to say two things <e> <s> first i agree that it is good business for the government <e> <s> secondly we certainly support the concept and the workings of the ida <e>", "<cs> my lords when my right honourable friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary met the new spanish foreign minister in brussels on th december they reaffirmed their commitment to the lisbon agreement and agreed that officials should meet to discuss details with a view to implementation in the spring and that is the situation as we understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government have noted the reports of remarks made by the spanish foreign minister at a foreign correspondents lunch in madrid yesterday <e> <s> in reply to the noble lord lord gladwyn i would say that spanish aspirations towards gibraltar are well known and they are of long standing <e> <s> the lisbon agreement provides for each side to raise any subject it wishes <e> <s> there are many things which we ourselves wish to raise for example practical co-operation economic development and tourism for when the agreement is implemented in the spring <e> <s> but our commitment to honour the wishes of the people of gibraltar is totally clear and is set out in the gibraltar constitution and it is specifically referred to in the lisbon agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords there is discrimination at the frontier at the moment <e> <s> of course we have made it clear all along that although any lifting of spanish restrictions is a welcome step in the right direction it is no substitute for the full removal of restrictions as envisaged in the lisbon agreement <e> <s> it is difficult to say at the present time what effect this particular step has had so far on the gibraltar economy <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the second part of the supplementary question asked by the noble lord lord cledwyn it was agreed on th december that officials from the spanish government and from the british government should meet to discuss details with a view to implementation of the lisbon agreement in the spring and that intention goes ahead <e> <s> i would not wish to make comparisons between any undertaking made to the people of gibraltar and that made to any other people <e> <s> our commitment to honour the wishes of the people of gibraltar is clear and it stands on its own <e> <s> i repeat it is set out in the gibraltar constitution and it is specifically referred to in the bilateral agreement between spain <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i do not understand the force of the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it would be best to answer the noble lords question by giving to the house a transcript of what sr moran is reported to have said yesterday as translated by the british embassy in madrid <e> <s> i understand that the foreign minister said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord lord paget will not think me discourteous if i return to the original question <e> <s> the original question was about access to gibraltar by land sea and air respectively <e> <s> we believe that these difficulties will be resolved by implementing the lisbon agreement <e> <s> i have made clear the stance of the british government as regards sovereignty on gibraltar which is contained in the lisbon agreement <e> <s> therefore the government look forward to the implementation of that agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords if you are a spaniard or a gibraltarian living either on the rock or in the campo area or a british passport holder resident in gibraltar then so far as the spanish authorities are concerned you can cross the border <e> <s> so far as the gibraltarian authorities are concerned the border has always remained open <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord molloy mentioned belize <e> <s> the united states government are aware of our concern over the implications for the garrison in belize and her majestys government are keeping in close touch with the americans over this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government understand that united states government policy on the general question of military supplies to guatemala is still under consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords concerning such an occurrence the british government have agreed to consult with the governments of the bahamas barbados canada guyana jamaica and trinidad and tobago in order to consider what measures should be taken in the event of an attack or the threat of such an attack on belize as the noble lord mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can add to what i have already said to the noble lord lord molloy which is that her majestys government remain in close touch with the americans on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that moral questions in general and the noble lords question in particular fall well outside the scope of the present question <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can add to what i have already said in reply to the noble lords questions <e> <s> the only thing i would add on this final question is that we see the way forward as being by bilateral discussions between guatemala and belize and we have endeavoured to use our good offices to this end <e> <s> indeed we participated in the sense that we were present when such talks took place as recently as th january and we also participated in the sense that we had bilateral discussions on that occasion with guatemala <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely understand why my noble friend is concerned about all the various forms of communication to gibraltar my noble friend takes a close interest in that and i absolutely accept that it is a valid question <e> <s> i would simply draw his attention to the fact that under the lisbon agreement both governments have agreed to start negotiations aimed at overcoming all the differences between them <e> <s> as for ceuta and melilla that is not a matter for her majestys government <e>", "<cs> that matter may be discussed under the lisbon agreement my lords but i cannot forecast exactly what will be raised <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an apprehension which i do not think is borne out by the facts <e> <s> the facts are that officials are now engaged in detailed discussions with the parties directly concerned for establishing a commercially managed dockyard in place of the naval dockyard and i very much hope that those negotiations will meet with success <e>", "<cs> my lords let us concentrate simply upon the issue of gibraltar <e> <s> from the point of view of her majestys government the lisbon agreement is a method of looking at the future generally of gibraltar <e> <s> only a week ago i told your lordships house on behalf of her majestys government that there are matters that the government will wish to <e>", "<cs> my lords in my original answer to my noble friend lord merrivale i repeated our commitment to respect the freely and democratically expressed wishes of the people of gibraltar <e> <s> it is written into the constitution <e> <s> it is also written into the lisbon agreement <e> <s> that is an agreement between the governments of spain and the united kingdom and it will be between those two governments together with the government of gibraltar because they too will be present at the time that the lisbon talks will be held <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think my noble friend knows her majestys government fully support spains application to join the european community <e> <s> but it is inconceivable that spain should join the community while restrictions remain on ordinary traffic between spain and gibraltar <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no idea what is the answer to that particular question but what i do know is that we are making realistic and i consider sensible proposals from the point of view of her majestys government to see that commercialisation is a success if i repeat if the details of the matter can be worked out to the satisfaction of all concerned and it is those talks that are going on at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords there was limited progress in the first three rounds of the negotiations because the soviet union insisted on trying to justify its monopoly in intermediate range nuclear missiles and was unwilling to negotiate towards the complete elimination of this class of nuclear weapon as proposed by nato <e> <s> a new round of negotiations began in geneva on th january <e> <s> the united states negotiator ambassador nitze has our full support in his efforts to continue to examine thoroughly the soviet position including the various proposals made since the last round by mr andropov <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first part of the noble lords supplementary question is concerned the americans are making the zero offer meaning no land-based intermediate range missiles in europe in good faith and that is the objective for the negotiations agreed within the alliance <e> <s> with regard to the second part of the noble lords supplementary question no final decision has been taken on whether to conduct a campaign of the kind reported in the press <e> <s> the government are considering ways of increasing public understanding of the issues involved in their nuclear disarmament and defence policies and this is one of the possibilities being considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly take seriously into account what my noble friend has suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that what the noble lord said at the beginning of his question presents a very fruitful way forward <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that under the government at the end of the s the administration ran a campaign to promote british nato defence policies including possession of nuclear weapons <e> <s> the campaign involved full-page newspaper advertisements which invited readers to <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not in any way want to be unhelpful to the noble lord on what i of course agree with him is the key question which has been the stumbling block for very many years but i have not any news to give on this particular point because the negotiators met afresh only four days ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i must make myself clear <e> <s> i was not criticising the previous government in which of course the noble lord was a minister indeed not <e> <s> i think probably the previous government were prudent <e> <s> i say probably merely because i began to think about this point only a few hours ago <e> <s> with regard to the question of the rightness of spending money in this way at the present time if it is to be spent the intention would be to create a better awareness of the issues and facts by publicising government material about disarmament and deterrence <e>", "<cs> no my lords the answer which my noble friend lord trenchard gave on th october last year was as my original answer said accurate <e> <s> regarding the decision to undertake a health survey it is tragically the case that about one in five of the male population of the united kingdom at the present time dies of cancer so there will be some thousands of people who understandably will be able to question whether there is a link between the disease and the tests <e> <s> the problem is to determine whether or not the incidence of cancer among test veterans is significantly different from the incidence of the disease among those who did not participate in the tests <e> <s> the announced health survey will be designed to solve this problem <e> <s> but i must repeat that the measured radiation exposures of personnel in the tests clearly indicate that no significant health risks were run <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that question <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that so far as we know is no and by that i mean no in the sense that there are no deaths which can be connected with the tests <e> <s> as to whether personnel who took part in the tests have died prematurely there were some personnel and nobody could possibly answer that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the noble lord lord bishopston that in no way would the government be wishing to prejudge the outcome of a survey which they have been very ready to undertake <e> <s> in order that both houses of parliament and indeed the general public will be able to make up their minds i can certainly respond to the noble lords other question and say that the results of the survey will be published <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i most certainly confirm that my noble friend when he replied to this question on th october looked into this matter with very great care <e> <s> i repeat that so far as we can see the tests were conducted safely and there are adequate data for the survey which are available from existing records <e> <s> but of course there would have to be reconsideration if wholly unexpected results came up <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that question <e>", "<cs> my lords the conclusions which the noble lord draws from cases of which i am not aware seem wholly unjustified if i can draw a logical conclusion from those two parts of my reply <e>", "<cs> my lords the inquiry will be conducted as swiftly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords we supported security council resolution no <e> <s> which condemned the raid <e> <s> we also expressed our views directly to the south african government through their ambassador in london <e> <s> in maseru last week my right honourable friend the minister for overseas development donated to the fund set up for the relief of the victims families <e>", "<cs> my lords they support the security council of the united nations and support the united nations general assembly <e> <s> that is what we do and that is what we did on this occasion <e> <s> we supported both resolutions resolution of the security council and resolution of the united nations general assembly <e> <s> i am delighted to make that crystal clear to the noble lord <e> <s> as regards the question on the conference communiqu which the noble lord put to me we certainly condemn all external interference which has adverse effects on the economic development of the southern african development co-ordination conference region <e>", "<cs> my lords we deplore attempts from whatever quarter to achieve solutions through violence <e> <s> we have made clear that one of the essential preconditions for lasting peace in southern africa is progress within south africa towards a form of government based on the consent of the south african people as a whole <e> <s> that is the general context in which i am answering this question today <e>", "<cs> my lords we strongly believe that each country must be allowed to decide its own future and the relations between states in the area should strictly adhere to the principles of non-use of violence and non-intervention in internal affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may have noticed that article of the resolution requests the secretary-general to enter into immediate consultations with the lesotho government and the united <e>", "<cs> my lords i would put my reply in a positive form <e> <s> camden council have indicated that they may institute legal proceedings and we in the foreign office for our part stand ready to provide a certificate to the court as to whether these premises enjoy immunity from rates if camden council institutes legal proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords the argument put forward is that the soviet union claims that the services are diplomatic and enjoy all immunities <e> <s> this regrettably ignores an undertaking given by the soviet <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer as to whether the russians are hard-up or not <e> <s> the trouble in this case is that we do not see the colour of their money <e>", "<cs> my lords the case so far as negotiations between the british government and the soviet union are concerned has been made again and again and those negotiations are still proceeding <e> <s> so far as the right of camden council to take legal proceedings is concerned that is a matter for the council <e>", "<cs> my lords the commercial section of our embassy in moscow is an integral part of the embassy and therefore not analogous to the soviet trade delegation <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to this question i should first make it clear that the government are considering ways of increasing public understanding of the issues involved in their nuclear disarmament and defence policies <e> <s> it is entirely natural to consider ways of providing facts and information especially at a time of high public interest and when a good deal of misleading information abounds <e> <s> what we have in mind is not a propaganda campaign but a campaign to achieve better awareness of the issues and facts by publicising government material about disarmament and deterrence <e>", "<cs> my lords that occupied the first part of my speech <e> <s> i think both the noble lord loid bishopston and i are out of order <e>", "<cs> my lords even though both the noble lord and i are most certainly out of order what wise advice <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might at this stage just reply to the noble baroness and the noble lord who have responded from the front benches to my right honourable friends statement <e> <s> i am grateful to them for what they have said <e> <s> when the noble baroness lady david criticises the government for departing in the past from the system of support for overseas students i would just say to her that the difficulty about that particular system was that it was open-ended and that therefore there was really no financial control <e> <s> the additional awards which are announced today in this statement we believe are targeted at those areas where they are most needed and will bring the greatest benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend lord home <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kilmarnock asked me about the oda programme <e> <s> i said in reply to the question that this was a matter which i thought we ought to go into in rather more detail in days time <e> <s> but my reply to his question is that he seems to have overlooked the fact that the oda programme is being increased by some per cent <e> <s> for the next financial year <e> <s> on the noble lords reference to poorer countries these of course will benefit from the expansion of the odas technical co-operation programmes at a cost of some million over the three years in question <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble baroness <e> <s> the british overseas trade board took the view that reallocation of per cent <e> <s> of its total budget from existing support schemes could not be justified <e> <s> but the new award scheme will provide for students who we wish to encourage for commercial reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord gore-booth for his intervention <e> <s> he referred to the problems of lack of money or lack of care <e> <s> i hope that my right honourable friends statement shows that the government do care about this <e> <s> as regards money the additional awards which are announced are targeted at those areas where we believe they are most needed and where they can bring the greatest benefit <e> <s> they are of course in addition to the existing support to overseas and european community students which at the moment is running at about million a year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord lord diamond asked me that question <e> <s> if i said by million it was most certainly a slip of the tongue <e> <s> the planned forecast for next year is an increase in the aid budget of some per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady vickers first of all is good enough to mention the specific reference to malaysia and then goes on to ask about students from other countries and in the discipline of medicine <e> <s> what i ought to say ahead of the debate which your lordships house will be having is that the structure of this statement is in many parts <e> <s> and i like to think that although of course the government like your lordships house would wish to do more than we are doing nonetheless there are financial constraints <e> <s> i believe that when one looks across the different aspects of the statement it will be found that we are genuinely trying to do what we say we are doing namely bring help to where it is of most benefit to this country and of most need to the students concerned <e>", "<cs> no my lords in cash terms <e> <s> incidentally there was an implication behind the noble lords question and indeed i think a direct question asked of me by the noble lord lord kilmarnock as to whether this would have a deleterious effect on the aid programme <e> <s> the answer is no it will not <e> <s> the oda money will be taken from the unallocated reserve <e>", "<cs> my lords this i think is a matter which we could go into in more detail when we come to debate this statement in days time <e>", "<cs> my lords i always listen with great care to what the noble lord says and practically always agree with everything that he says <e> <s> but what the noble lord is saying is contrary to one of the first recommendations of the overseas students trust report and i am not sure that he would command agreement with what he has just said to the house <e> <s> again and i know that the noble lord will do it formidably perhaps we shall have a chance to debate this question in days time <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation is that we maintain contacts with the palestine liberation organisation at official level but my right honourable friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary has often said that he would be prepared to meet representatives of the plo if such a meeting would contribute to the cause of peace <e> <s> the matter upon which the noble lord touches is part of that condition <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation so far as the government are concerned is that king hassan of morocco decided to postpone the visit in november <e> <s> we much regretted this and have since worked hard with the moroccan government to find a mutually acceptable compromise on the question of palestinian representation <e> <s> welcome progress has been made but it is for the moroccans to make an announcement when they decide that the moment is right <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking about the proposed visit of the king of morocco together with representatives of the arab world <e>", "<cs> my lords i will say to the noble lord lord paget of northampton that the king of morocco knows the position of her majestys government perfectly well <e> <s> it is on the basis of the position of her majestys government which the king of morocco knows perfectly well that we are negotiating to see whether this visit can take place <e> <s> we very much hope that the visit will take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it would be right to remind your lordships that we remain committed to a distinctive european approach based on the balanced principles set out in the venice declaration <e> <s> in our contacts with all the parties concerned we shall be working to expand areas of agreement and to encourage an early start to negotiations aimed at a comprehensive settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i am not sure that that makes the whole of the second part of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble viscount that the plo is a political movement embracing different groups with wide-ranging views <e> <s> i would add to the second part of the noble viscounts question that we have vigorously condemned israels invasion of the lebanon there is no question of there being any double standards in the views which have been expressed by her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether that is so from my own information but of course i accept that if the noble lord lord wells-pestell says it is so this would almost certainly be correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the feelings which the noble lord lord mayhew has on this matter but the noble lord is not alone in your lordships house in having deep feelings about this very difficult international situation <e> <s> the answer to the noble lords question is that the government accept that the plo have come a long way since the early s but there is no room for ambiguity on an issue of this importance namely terrorism <e> <s> we were disturbed to see reports that a group within the plo had claimed responsibility for the grenade attack on a bus in tel aviv in january <e>", "<cs> my lords at present the government have no plans to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kennet says that there is overwhelming support for a dual key arrangement so far as nuclear weapons are concerned <e> <s> we have made it clear that the use of cruise missile bases in an emergency would be a matter for joint british/american decision <e> <s> the prime minister for her part has made clear that this arrangement has been examined and has been found to be effective <e> <s> it was after looking at the matter very clearly in that light that i gave the answer which i gave originally to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord shinwell would care to look at column of the <e>", "<cs> my lords the words joint decision mean exactly what they say <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely understand the noble lords question but i have to repeat my same answer <e> <s> it is the prime ministers view that current methods of control have been examined and found effective <e> <s> these methods of control incidentally have been in operation for years as my noble friend lord lauderdale reminded the house on the previous occasion when this question was raised <e> <s> perhaps i should add that the arrangements about the use of bases in an emergency are reviewed and reaffirmed every time a british prime minister or president of the united states first takes office <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lords first question is yes i do believe on behalf of the government that the arrangements are satisfactory <e> <s> this has been gone into by the prime minister and that is her view which i repeat today <e> <s> my answer to the second question is the same that i gave to the noble lord on the th januarythe difference between the thor missiles and all the other missiles that have been in this country since the war is that those missiles were owned and manned by the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the responsibility of the government of this country without looking for electoral advantage to persuade the people of this country of something which i think rises above politics namely that we have a strong defence <e> <s> that was in my partys manifesto <e> <s> that we stick by <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords expression of view runs entirely counter to all the replies i have given to questions on both th january and today <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will not stick by that expression of view because it does not reflect the true state of affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords my answer on the th january means exactly what it says <e> <s> i neither add nor subtract from the words i used then <e>", "<cs> my lords i rarely have time to listen to the radio in the evenings because i invariably find that i am involved in preparing to answer questions in your lordships house the following day <e>", "<cs> my lords the terms and the working of the agreement as the noble lord knows perfectly well remain confidential <e>", "<cs> my lords i can well understand why my noble friend attaches importance to the re-creation of the force <e> <s> members of the falkland islands defence force gave valuable assistance to the men of the task force when they were in the process of repossessing the islands in may and june last year <e> <s> we are now consulting the civil commissioner on the islanders wishes and as i said in my original answer we hope to take a decision shortly <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend that there could be a very useful role in future for men of a force of that kind in the defence of the islands <e>", "<cs> my lords my reading of the original question this afternoon was that it was a very good question but a simply splendid answer <e>", "<cs> my lords the position of the taxpayers of this country is always in the mind of her majestys government <e> <s> so far as those whom the noble lord refers to as being corporate absentee landlords in the falkland islands are concerned i think the noble lord really must accept from the government that we have made clear our view about the importance of the land holdings as they exist at the moment in the falkland islands in the reply which we have already given to the shackleton report <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all we need to find out what are the islanders wishes <e> <s> in order to do this we are consulting the civil commissioner <e> <s> then if it is decided that the force should be set up it will be necessary to decide on the size the training and the equipment <e> <s> i think that answers to those few questions will not be difficult to find <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend in the particular use on which he puts his finger in asking this supplementary question <e> <s> i should like to underline that when the government say as in my original reply that we hope to take a decision shortly we really do mean that <e>", "<cs> my lords there were three before the invasion <e> <s> possibly a small addition would be in order <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the setting up of a force of this kind if that is to be the decision would go towards allaying the sort of fears that the noble lord has just expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me it does fall outside the scope of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords broadly speaking the answer to the three questions is yes but the background to it is that during the falklands conflict the contracts for equipment were embargoed <e> <s> however before that in other words before april much of the equipment for the ships was already delivered and the fact is that her majestys government now accept that very longstanding contracts with the federal republic of germany which is building the ships and is an important trading partner really have to be kept <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that uncharacteristically the noble lord is perhaps being a little less than fair in the first part of his question <e> <s> the fact is that during the whole of the s governments of all political complexions in this country were anxious to do business as usual with the argentine particularly in view of the tensions existing between this country and the argentine <e> <s> i think that governments of all political complexions felt that if business was not carried on as usual it would put an unnatural and unwelcome barrier between the two countries <e> <s> governments of all political complexions were misled by the argentine in this respect <e> <s> none the less that was the view held across the political spectrum during the s and that is why in my answer to the first supplementary question i said that these were longstanding contracts <e>", "<cs> my lords again uncharacteristically as i am sure the whole house will agree my noble friend is perhaps being a little less than fair <e> <s> as my noble friend lord trefgarne made clear yesterday the finance which is being arranged for the argentine at the moment is an international matter in which it is true britain is playing a part the fact is as my noble friend made clear that if that finance was not made available there would be a defaulting on debts and there would be free finance for the argentine government to spend on arms whereas part of the imf package is that there are strict safeguards with the imf safeguard loans <e>", "<cs> my lords this is true <e> <s> but what i ought to add for the information of the house and i am sure that the house would wish me to say this is that the fact of the matter is that the memorandum of understanding covering the purchase of exocet for the royal navy which was arranged over years ago provides for a proportion of components to be manufactured by british firms and that is the position that we are in <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not giving guidance and we are not giving help and if the noble lord feels like that i hope that in the debate of my noble friend lord carrington tomorrow he will stand up and make a robust speech saying that he approves of all the arrangements which the government have made to see that the people of the falkland islands remain independent for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised to hear the noble lord say what he has said because again and again the government hear expressed in your lordships house the view that what is necessary is to try to reach a long-term accommodation with the argentine <e> <s> what the british government have done together with their community partners is to take a first step of relinquishing the financial barriers which divided the argentine from europe although as the house will know her majestys government are absolutely firm that the defence arrangements will remain in the falkland islands until proper arrangements can be made for the falkland islanders to decide their own future <e>", "<cs> my lords contracts of course are not between this country and the argentine they are between the federal republic of germany and france and the argentine <e> <s> i would simply say to the noble lord that i repeat therefore my original answer there is an embargo absolutely on the direct sale of defence equipment from this country to the argentine but we believed that damage would be done if we breached long-standing contracts with a friendly government and by that i mean west germany and also the government of france and important trading partners in the matter of contracts <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble lord lord molloy feels deeply on the question of the imf package but i pin my faith on the good sense and the prudence of the imf <e> <s> i believe that the type of safeguards which the imf are imposing upon argentina were very well explained by my noble friend lord trefgarne yesterday <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not <e> <s> there are many countries in the united nations together with britain who take the view that argentina needs to shift its position before any long-term planning can go <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not disagree with what the noble lord has quoted about the expertise of this centre but we are not entirely certain about future demands from the british aid programme for this expertise <e> <s> the capacity of the private sector in this area of expertise having increased in recent years i am confident that calls for services which the centre cannot provide from its own resources can be met in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is always very persuasive but perhaps i might remind him that there is no question of this centre not remaining in being <e> <s> it is very valuable <e> <s> it remains and that is quite right <e> <s> indeed a reduction in the cost of the centre does not mean that less funds are available for work in the areas which the centre covers <e> <s> any savings made on the running of the centre will certainly stay in the aid programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord bishopston that this debate this long debate has been of great interest and is timely <e> <s> many of your lordships have thanked my noble friend lord carrington and i do so too and not least for one specific reason which is that my noble friend shows clearly in his motion for this debate that our freedom depends on the existence of the north atlantic alliance <e> <s> after all nato was born from our determination to preserve the liberties which were almost extinguished in two world wars <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can say to the noble lord lord gladwyn is that if it is the noble lords case which it is that there ought to be a no-first-use declaration <e>", "<cs> yes in time and if in addition to that the noble lord is carefully underlining the fact that there is no need to build up the conventional forces of the west to more or less the same size as the conventional forces of the east then i become even more suspicious of this particular case which is being put to the government today <e> <s> it would be this consequence i believe for the democracies who as soon as the conflict was over in demobilised showed that they did not want war did not wish to build up their conventional forces and turned rather to the more admirable attitude of facing the problems of peace <e>", "<cs> my lords i am saying that the inextricable linking the indissoluble link of the atlantic alliance shows that a war which nato would wage wherever it may be would be a war which would involve all the member countries of nato and that includes the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that those words are ill-judged <e> <s> the synod never wastes its time in discussing such a serious matter and indeed the debate last week in the synod was unique as i am sure was felt <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord beswick talks about these matters being raised <e> <s> the system of trusteeship does not apply of course to independent states members of the united nations but to dependencies <e> <s> the charter provides in article c that the latter may be voluntarily placed in trusteeship and that i have no doubt is what is in the noble lords mind <e> <s> so far as i know this has never been put into effect ever since <e> <s> i have no reason particularly to believe that it should be put into effect now <e>", "<cs> my lords the first matter applies to the governments of spain and portugal and the second matter applies to the governments of spain and morocco <e> <s> neither i think is the responsibility of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords my answer to the noble lords first question is that argentina would undoubtedly have to play a significant role in the various aspects of any united nations trusteeship arrangement for the falkland islands <e> <s> it is therefore highly unlikely that such a solution would commend itself to the islanders <e> <s> the answer to the second question is that after president belaundes attempt the argentinians refused to withdraw and when britain repossessed the islands that created an entirely different situation <e> <s> my answer to the third question is that in asking that the noble lord makes an unwarrantable assertion with which i have dealt previously <e>", "<cs> my lords although i have much sympathy with the noble viscounts question it would not be a matter for her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree most certainly with the question of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is referring to the dependencies of the united kingdom i must say that we have no plans for seeking to place any of our dependent territories under united nations trusteeship <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord whose advice i often take and to whom i always listen carefully that is a most extraordinary assertion <e> <s> he puts to her majestys government that they know what territories the noble lord has in his mind <e> <s> i have no idea which territories he has in his mind <e> <s> but i have made it absolutely clear to the house today that so far as the dependencies of her majestys government are concerned we have no intention of seeking united nations trusteeship <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly i should like to draw the attention of my right honourable friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary to the suggestion that the noble lord has made about long-term resettlement <e> <s> with regard to the question of the need for yet further assistance from this country we should consider any applications sympathetically if need can be shown by the ghanaian authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the original answer mentioned which is being given by the united kingdom as part of the european communitys effort in this matter and certainly a very great deal of that contribution from this country went to the work of voluntary organisations in the field <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not contest the legality of the nigerian decision to expel illegal immigrants but what we have done and we have made the nigerian authorities aware of this concern through diplomatic channels as between friendly commonwealth countries is to show regret at the way in which the decision was carried out since it led to much unnecessary hardship <e>", "<cs> my lords i of course take seriously that suggestion from the noble lord since it is the second time that it has been made from the opposition benches during these exchanges and i assure the noble lord as i have assured the noble earl lord listowel that the point will be looked at carefully <e> <s> but i think i should add that as of course both noble lords are obviously very well aware the influx of ghanaians from nigeria will add to ghanas severe economic problems and that underlines the need for ghana to come to some arrangement with the international monetary fund <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is referring to informal discussions and an informal agreement which it was said had been reached between the united states and the soviet inf negotiators at geneva in mid- <e> <s> if i am correct that that is what the noble lord was referring to it is for the governments of the united states and the soviet union to comment about ideas which were exchanged informally between ambassadors nitze and kvitsinsky <e> <s> what we know for certain is that it was later on in the year that the soviet union simply broke off the talks <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can answer both parts of the supplementary question of the noble lord lord shinwell by referring to president reagans statement which was made on nd february two days ago in a speech in the united states <e> <s> in it the united states president made it clear that in the inf talks the proposal for the zero option is not a take-it-or-leave-it offer and that above all the united states negotiator has instructions to explore any solution consistent with the alliances principles of trying to achieve a balance <e> <s> i think that is a very fair outline of the united states position <e> <s> let us hope that we will be able to discover the real intentions of the russian position as a result of that clarification <e>", "<cs> my lords if that were to be the case my answer is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords the intention of the nato alliance is to achieve balanced and verifiable reductions in arms so that all the peoples of the whole world can live in greater security and therefore with a better prospect of peace <e> <s> it is that about which we are trying to get agreement with the russians <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that this is possible <e> <s> that is what we are trying to explore <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first supplementary question of the noble lord lord brockway is that i believe the united states presidents speech of two days ago precisely falls into the noble lords category of trying to find areas of agreement <e> <s> my answer to the noble lords second question is no <e>", "<cs> my lords these are of course confidential talks and although on behalf of the government i give your lordships house as much information as i can the talks in geneva in both inf and start are confidential <e> <s> therefore on the first point of the noble lord lord cledwyn i do not think that i can help very much <e> <s> so far as chemical weapons are concerned weapons which of course we destroyed in this country years ago and which the americans have retained only in a limited stockpile we know that the soviet union have developed a large modern chemical force which is not matched at all on the nato side <e> <s> let us see whether the intentions which we hope for on the soviet side regarding these frightful weapons are going to be matched by deeds <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord lord molloy on that question <e> <s> this is why the government were most anxious to draw the attention of the house today to president reagans statement of two days ago which we believe shows both patience and persistence <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend asks whether structures on the seabed and buildings with a continuing use come within the definition of reclaimed land <e> <s> the answer to that is yes although perhaps i might point out to my noble friend that of course the north mole which the government have said will be gifted to the gibraltar government is technically a structure on the seabed <e> <s> nonetheless i am very glad on behalf of her majestys government that this undertaking has been given for that particular structure <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree with my noble friend in that assertion and perhaps i ought to add to what i have already said that any specific requests from the gibraltar government in regard to land are always looked at very carefully but within the framework of the policy i have just explained <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the prospects for work in a commercialised dockyard are concerned the discussions are taking place at the moment between the prospective managers a and p appledore international limited her majestys government and the government of gibraltar <e> <s> these are concerned with the practical aspects of the proposed commercialisation arrangements and other parties who are directly concerned will be consulted at the appropriate time <e> <s> there will of course be normal consultations with the trade unions by the ministry of defence and i have no doubt later on by the operators <e> <s> however i really feel that we are going a little wide in talking about the subject of sovereignty <e> <s> if the noble lord will forgive me i think i will not embark upon that <e>", "<cs> my lords gifted was the word which i think has been used in correspondence by the government <e> <s> if the noble lord prefers giving i can use that word instead <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i think the noble lord is going very wide of the original question <e> <s> this is a question about the transfer of lands from her majestys government from the ministry of defence to the government of gibraltar and if we go much wider than that we shall go on for ever <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed not <e> <s> i am glad to have the opportunity to reiterate what i have already said in this exchange that the ministry of defence must retain what is necessary for the operation and support of the forces in gibraltar <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of what the noble lord lord hatch of lusby was holding in his hand <e> <s> so far as the definition of this particular weapon is concerned it is a means of laying a minefield very swiftly <e> <s> the answer to the noble lords third question about these mines being sold to the argentine before the falklands crisis is that my noble friend lord glenarthur answered a supplementary question put by the noble lord lord hatch of lusby on rd february when my noble friend made it clear that different types of mines including antipersonnel anti-vehicle and anti-tank mines had been identified as coming from five different countries <e> <s> but the five countries who supplied to the argentine weapons which were used in the falklands did not include this country <e> <s> so far as the alleged resumption of sales to the argentine by thorn emi is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given an absolute assurance to the house so far as the question asked by the noble lord lord hatch of lusby was concerned <e> <s> with regard to the question of the noble lord lord bishopston i believe it would be right to point out two aspects <e> <s> first manufacturers of defence equipment keep in close and regular touch on overseas sales prospects with ministry of defence staff and they are fully conscious of the risks of military equipment being transferred to argentina by third parties <e> <s> this is a serious point and it is important that i should make it in reply to the noble lord lord bishopston <e> <s> so far as any direct sales from this country to argentina are concerned we have a total embargo on that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bishopston knows that i try to be as helpful as i can be to him and his noble friends but this is one of the very few occasions when i believe that my answer is better than a statement in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not actually what i said on th february <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord bruce of donington will not think that i am being unhelpful but i have nothing to add to what i did say then <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not consider that the first question arises from the original question and i simply do not know the answer <e> <s> the question was is there government help with the funding of the production of this particular weapon <e> <s> so far as the second question is concerned this is where the end user certificates come into play <e>", "<cs> well my lords if each question is better than the last then they are always welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord refers to the affair of mr lankin <e> <s> i must make it clear that the israeli government have not yet proposed to us the name of the new ambassador <e> <s> a number of names have been mentioned in the press and i do not intend to speculate on any of them <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the attempt on the life of the israeli ambassador is something that is deeply deplored by her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the first question that is the noble lords idea that the original question should be extended-i think i have already answered that in saying that our policy is and will continue to be that each case is considered on its merits <e> <s> so far as the noble lords second question is concerned i have also already answered that <e> <s> the israeli government have not yet proposed to us the name of a new ambassador <e>", "<cs> my lords i take on board what the noble lord has just said <e>", "<cs> my lords we are getting a little wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lords first question is yes i have so far as the figures are concerned given cash and not cost <e> <s> as regards the noble lords second question if one takes an index setting out the real value of our aid as compared with the figure which the noble lord has given to the house is not far out although i do not have the exact figure <e> <s> but the fact of the matter is that aid has been reduced in real terms between and the current year because it could not be immune from the necessity to make public expenditure cuts <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the figure for food aid but i will certainly write to the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> the government would not go that far down the road which the noble lord presents but i think we would be very hesitant in feeling that the distribution of food aid is an answer compared with the improvement of the agricultural structure of countries <e> <s> to that extent the government would certainly agree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am giving the figures from the public expenditure white paper <e> <s> i am sorry that i must again admit to my noble friend that i am not sure whether they include the figure for voluntary organisations a figure which incidentally i remember my noble friend lady trumpington pointing out to the house a few weeks ago as one of which we should be proud <e> <s> i am sorry therefore that i do not have the exact figure with me <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may feel that that represents the case but as i have pointed out on more than one occasion to your lordships house when we get into the next financial year in less than a months time the expenditure on the aid programme will increase both in cost terms and in cash terms <e>", "<cs> yes my lords capital investment so far as it attracts aid is included in the figures that i have given <e> <s> i am not aware that we are thinking of a new economic order <e>", "<cs> my lords i have replied to that question on previous occasions in the house that is that i am not aware that what the noble lord asserts in asking that question represents the truth <e> <s> what i mean by that is that i do not think either the noble lord or i can be certain of the fact of the matter as the noble lord puts it to the house <e> <s> however i would add that the importance which the government attach to the giving of overseas aid is reflected by the fact that only the united states the federal republic of germany france and japan are bigger oecd aid givers than the united kingdom <e> <s> if i may go back to the noble lords original question our aid as a percentage of our gross national product is above the level of the oecd countries <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer remains exactly the one which i have already given to the house <e> <s> no undertaking was given about the grading of the post in the future <e> <s> the letters are in mr <e> <s> slacks possession and they are also in the possession of the department <e> <s> there is nothing secret about this <e> <s> the noble lord lord hooson by talking to mr <e> <s> slack would be able easily to see what was put in print <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is giving legal advice to the house and that is certainly something which i have no intention of doing this evening <e> <s> i have given the house the position quite openly and honestly <e> <s> i have told the noble lord lord hooson that the letters would be there for him to see if he wished to ask mr <e> <s> slack and it would be for the noble lord to make up his own mind as to whether he accepts his own legal advice or not <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an extraordinary assertion considering that i have not yet met the remaining members of the academic council of whom the noble lord lord beloff is no longer sadly one <e> <s> until i do meet them i cannot find out what their feelings are <e> <s> however i must not be disingenuous <e> <s> it is perfectly true that i have written to them and that they have replied <e> <s> but i hope that the noble lord will not <e>", "<cs> my lords they have reservations exactly along the lines which the noble lord lord beloff has put to the house <e> <s> but i would say to the noble lord lord banks that i hope that the trouble that there has been up to the time of this debate is not going to be allowed to affect a meeting at which neither the noble lord lord banks nor my noble friend lord beloff will be present <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give an answer in cost terms to the question which the noble lord asks because the noble lord asked about a system analogous to the one which the americans had when thor was in use and that was the question to which my answer was directed <e> <s> however if what the noble lord means is would the united kingdom government put a figure on the cost to the united kingdom of providing the missile while the united states retained the warhead of cruise <e> <s> then the answer has been given in another place and it is capital billion <e>", "<cs> my lords i absolutely acknowledge that there is concern on this most important subject <e> <s> there is not a difference of view between my right honourable friends the prime minister and the foreign <e>", "<cs> my lords cruise is a second-strike weapon <e> <s> that should give comfort to the people of europe <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords would the noble lord repeat the question <e>", "<cs> my lords in the house estimate made by the ministry of defence it is capital costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i most certainly do not accept that <e> <s> i answered the noble lords question originally and i thought i answered it rather well <e>", "<cs> my lords no politician would ever use never but the noble lord knows the performance of cruise <e> <s> its performance is consonant with its being a second-strike weapon <e>", "<cs> my lords the decision of the united states department of defence to seek funds for the development of a new ballistic re-entry vehicle for trident with a higher yield warhead does not change the plans of her majestys government to purchase trident missiles <e> <s> the british warhead for trident is being designed to meet the united kingdom deterrent requirements and the question whether it is superior or inferior to any future united states warhead development does not arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that that is the first time i have heard from the labour front bench in either house a case being made that we should do more in the nuclear field over the next to years than the present government are intending to do <e> <s> but i believe that the present governments plans are right <e> <s> we are intending to maintain our independent nuclear deterrent which will be effective while at the same time continuing to spend considerable sums upon our conventional forces <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that is that it is a question of time-scale that it is necessary to up-date our independent deterrent <e> <s> this is what we believe trident will do and we think it will be an effective weapon for the s <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord thinks that the case for trident has evaporated why are the russians so eager to count the british and the french independent deterrents in the bilateral arms talks which they are undertaking with the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lord trenchard for both of the points which he has made in that supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the government have on several occasions made their position clear on that point <e>", "<cs> but my lords the chiefs concerned are not the government of this country who have to look forward not only to the time of the period of office of this government but also to the periods of office of governments to come <e> <s> the government have made it clear repeatedly again and again that we believe along with the french government that it is necessary for the defence of europe and indeed of the free world that we retain our independent nuclear deterrent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and gallant lord far more grateful than i thought i was when he asked his question originally <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords information about the real reasons of the russians is ahead of mine <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the answer to that question <e> <s> the reason i do not know the answer to it is because i do not think that it would necessarily be appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords it would depend upon the circumstances but we would expect our bilateral arrangements to work in exactly the same way as if it were the president himself or the prime minister herself taking the decision <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first half of the noble lords question is yes while the answer to the second half of his question is no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble viscount <e> <s> the government could not have put it better themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made it clear on behalf of the government previously but perhaps i should do so again that the agreements between the united states and this country are reviewed and reaffirmed when a british prime minister or a president of the united states first takes office <e> <s> the arrangements were last reaffirmed by president reagan and previously by the prime minister when she was first elected to no <e> <s> <e> <s> the government have satisfied themselves that the current arrangements remain effective <e>", "<cs> because my lords although i acknowledge that there is a clearly established line of succession in the united states for the office of president the noble lord would not expect me to go into details publicly about who might take over presidential responsibilities for the release of nuclear weapons in the event of the president or his successor being absent <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> ds has not been added to ds <e> <s> so far as the second question which the noble lord asked me is concerned there is no question of this unit purveying a party political message <e> <s> it is the duty of the government as of all their predecessors to explain their defence policy to the electorate <e> <s> in no area is this more important than the part played by nuclear weapons in natos strategy of deterrence and the work of ds will be confined to departmental information work <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i shall need to write to my noble friend on these detailed questions <e> <s> the beginning of my original answer to the noble lord lord hatch set out in general terms what are the responsibilities of defence secretariat and i repeat them advice on nuclear policy arms control and disarmament to my right honourable friend <e> <s> but if i may i should like to give more detail of that in a letter to my noble friend <e> <s> the reason why i am not quite so ready to answer my noble friend lord renton on that point is that i felt and i think rightly that the question was really related to ds <e>", "<cs> my lords the numbers employed are eight and they have been transferred from other parts of the ministry of defence so that they are not extra positions except for that of an assistant secretary <e> <s> perhaps it is right just to set that against the fact that since april the ministry of defence has shed civil service posts of a non-industrial nature in london <e> <s> the costs of this unit will be confined to the salaries of those eight posts and <e>", "<cs> my lords the unit is concerned with making available information which is pro-deterrence pro-membership of nato and pro-multilateral disarmament <e> <s> i should have thought that this was something with which everybody in this country would agree <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i have twice answered questions on dual key within the last few days <e> <s> although i realise that there are differing views about dual key i do not think that they are entirely confined to inter-party views <e> <s> members of your lordships house consult their own consciences on the very difficult question of dual key <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the second question asked by the noble lord lord paget of northampton is yes if it happens to fall within the scope of the answer which i gave just now to the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos <e>", "<cs> my lords my answer to the first part of the noble lords supplementary question is no <e> <s> therefore the rest of the noble lords supplementary question falls <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that after this period of time the noble lord feels like that <e> <s> i am aware of his question <e> <s> i am also aware that my noble friend the leader of the house then sent a letter to the noble lord dated th december in which my noble friend the leader of the house acknowledged that on the occasion of the noble lords parliamentary question the noble lord and my noble friend clearly disagreed on the facts at issue but my noble friend went out of her way in her letter to say that she was in no way suggesting that the noble lord had misled the house <e>", "<cs> my lords once again if what the noble lord is asking me falls within the scope of the answer which i gave to the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos then the answer would be yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know that i can answer that question apart from saying that on this occasion as set out with great care in the letter dated <e>", "<cs> my lords that i do not know but i believe i am right in saying that the ministry of defence has <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord annan for making that information available to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords at the last commonwealth heads of government meeting the commonwealth secretary-general was commissioned to convene a group of experts who produced a very useful report <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first part of the supplementary question from the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos on the difficulty of overcoming hunger in parts of the world which are so afflicted when other parts of the world are producing too much can best be met by doing everything possible to support improvements in the agricultural systems of the countries which are afflicted <e> <s> this is certainly the general line which i know we shall be taking in harare on that particular aspect <e> <s> the noble lord asks me to be specific but may i refer to the last commonwealth heads of government meeting in melbourne in and remind him that it maintained the practical commitment to development through the commonwealth fund for technical co-operation <e> <s> there for example is a tool which is used to effect to try to overcome the problems to which the noble lord refers <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> although i am not briefed on the specific supplementary question that the noble lord asks i think i am right in saying that we are giving aid in ethiopia for that precise reason <e> <s> this is something that we feel we should do when there is a sudden need for it <e> <s> it is fair to say that britain tries to respond when problems of that kind arise <e>", "<cs> my lords it was because of what the noble lord calls the commonwealth being an appropriate forum to discuss the grave economic problems which have been affecting the world that at the last commonwealth finance ministers meeting held last year the commonwealth secretary-general established a group of experts to study the international trade and payment system including the role of the international economic institutions <e> <s> of course as the noble lord knows it is the international economic institutions which have been behind the rescue packages which have had to be mounted for certain countries in recent months <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the short answer to the noble lord is that he is asking for rather too many meetings to be fitted into any one year <e> <s> if i may say so perhaps the noble lord disregards for a moment the importance of the commonwealth secretariat which is based here in london and which fosters practical economic co-operation within the commonwealth on an ongoing basis <e> <s> so far as the great international meetings which are to take place within the next three months are concerned namely unctad six the ministerial meeting of the oecd and the williamsburg summit there has been <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i did not hear the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we are now getting a little wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked me first whether the proposals put forward at the non-aligned summit do not show the need for a new international economic order <e> <s> my answer to that is that i think that the present international economic and financial institutions have served the world well <e> <s> the international financial institutions have coped <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord i must say that i am not sure that i would entirely agree that the imf facilities have been increased only in a small way <e> <s> my understanding is that imf quotas are to be increased by per cent <e> <s> and the general arrangements fund which i think is sometimes referred to as the gab is to be made available to non-industrialised countries if there is a threat to international financial institutions <e> <s> i think that both of those things are valuable <e> <s> so far as further moves on the imf are concerned this point must wait until we get to belgrade for unctad but i give the noble lord an assurance that we are now thinking very carefully indeed about how to approach the unctad meeting and of course we shall bear in mind what he has just said to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that the state of the world economy and prospects for lasting recovery will most certainly be on the agenda for the williamsburg summit <e> <s> any question of an election taking place at that time is a matter for my right honourable friend the prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that it will be considered but we are full of meetings <e> <s> we have the oecd ministerial meeting unctad and the williamsburg summit <e> <s> that is quite a lot to be going on with <e>", "<cs>

is discussing a special action programme to speed up disbursements and through structural lending to enable developing countries to do more to improve their own economies a matter raised by the noble lord lord mackie of benshie in the house about two weeks ago <e> <s> her majestys government whatever the party in power play their part in the imf and in the affairs of the world bank <e> <s> the

ratification poses administrative legal and financial difficulties and would require legislation <e> <s> the government are still studying these difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as urgency is concerned the noble lord knows very well that he was a distinguished minister for the arts in the previous government and that nothing whatever was done about this matter at that time <e> <s> the reason why nothing was done is that the problems are formidable <e>", "<cs> my lords in our regular bilateral meetings with the united states administration and at nato consultative meetings we shall have extensive opportunities to consult the united states government about strategic defence and the suggestions made by president reagan on rd march <e> <s> these consultations began in the course of the briefings on start which general rowny and his deputy ambassador goodby gave to the north atlantic council on th march <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to underline the fact that the president has not proposed any change of strategy in the short term <e> <s> he is initiating a major review of the future of defensive systems on which he intends to assess whether alliance security and i underline those two words can be based on such an approach <e> <s> therefore for the noble lord to ask me about a period of time when some particular defensive system might be brought into effect for some countries and not for others is not a matter to which the president addressed his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord this question relates to president reagans proposal <e> <s> anything that contributes to east-west strategic stability can only be in the interests of the alliance as a whole and indeed of security as a whole <e> <s> when the noble lord asks a question making clear that what he wants is peace my reply on behalf of the government is yes peace based on security <e> <s> security can only be based upon balanced and verifiable agreements on arms reductions <e>", "<cs> my lords this is long-term research <e> <s> it does not touch on the specific proposals being put forward in the disarmament talks at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the presidents proposals were far-reaching and i think they were put forward in good faith <e> <s> it is a pity that <e>", "<cs> my lords we operate within the outer space treaty of which prohibits the placement of nuclear weapons or any other weapon of mass destruction in space <e> <s> in december last year we supported a united nations resolution calling upon the committee on disarmament to consider the creation of a working group to study possible arms control measures in space <e>", "<cs> my lords a suspicion that is unfounded <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have seen a brief reference in the british press to the alleged statement which the noble lord has mentioned <e> <s> but i understand from the embassy in peru and from the british interests section of the swiss embassy in argentina that no reports of such a statement have appeared in the press there and i therefore cannot comment on a text i have not seen <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords original question was whether the government would make representations <e> <s> we certainly could not base representations on a press report <e> <s> therefore i think i have reported to your lordships house as much as i know <e>", "<cs> my lords the franks committee were informed of all major united kingdom defence contracts with argentina during the period <e> <s> the deliveries were detailed on a yearly rather than a monthly basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not agree with that as it would seem from paragraph of the report of the franks committee that they did not consider defence sales to be a major factor in their review <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept what the noble lord has said that the future is more important to us now than the past <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will not think that i am being dismissive or discourteous when i say that that is not what the question is about <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i have not got the figure with me <e> <s> i will get it and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as the first part of the noble lords supplementary question is concerned i think that the noble lord is rather forgetting who attacked whom <e> <s> it is absurd to suggest that when in the past her majestys government have been delivering armaments to another country it should therefore be the case that that other country would not expect that her majestys government would attack it <e> <s> but that is not what happened <e> <s> britain was attacked by the argentine unexpectedly in a way which the franks report has recorded in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can go over the ground again <e> <s> it has been covered exhaustively by the franks committee <e> <s> they reached the conclusion that i have read out to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord brockway for drawing the attention of the house once again to the situation in cyprus <e> <s> it is right that we should continue to be reminded of the situation in cyprus because despite the relative stabililty of the last eight years the divisions between the two communities remain <e> <s> every single speech which has been made in our debate this evening has concentrated upon the divisions as well as in some cases the hopes for the future <e> <s> while there has been no fighting during this period and while parts of the country have become more prosperous these deep and tragic conditions are unacceptable <e> <s> indeed as the noble lord lord caradon said a generation is growing up on both sides of the green line in cyprus which has never known its opposite numbers <e> <s> as time goes on a solution will be more difficult to find <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord brockway is saying that the debate in united nations should underpin united nations work on the island then of course the government most certainly agree with him but if by any chance the noble lord is saying which i do not believe he is but i sometimes believe that other people may be saying it that there should be an initiative entirely separate from that of the united nations then i believe that that would take anybody making such an initiative back to square one <e> <s> i see from the nodding of the noble lords head that we are at one on this and that both the noble lord lord brockway and the government believe that united nations efforts can build on the basis of the efforts that have already been made and that we should rely on the work of the united nations representative in cyprus but we should also be ready and vigilant to try to underpin that work wherever possible <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be so but it is not the way in which the united states provides its allies with a dual key for particular nuclear systems <e> <s> with a dual key come the obligations and responsibilities of ownership <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can convince the noble lord lord paget <e> <s> we have a system of joint decision <e> <s> that means in effect that the weapons could not be used without the joint decision of the president and prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be so but there is not going to be a dual key system for cruise missiles <e>", "<cs> my lords let me repeat the assurance which i gave to the noble lord lord paget <e> <s> under the existing arrangements for joint political control which is what we have the weapons concerned cannot be used without a joint political <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the danger is entirely in the mind of the noble lord lord paget <e> <s> these are arrangements which have been in existence for over years running over a period which has seen successive labour and conservative governments <e> <s> i repeat the arrangements are effective and the government believe they are perfectly satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords because i repeat a full dual key control as it is called rests upon the obligations and responsibilities of ownership <e>", "<cs> my lords this is going over some very old ground now <e> <s> the question of joint political decision refers to the use of the bases that is what requires the joint political decision which is the present system that we have <e> <s> i repeat for the fourth time that joint political control means in effect that the weapons could not be used without the joint political decision of the president and the prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason why the question has not been put is because i think we know the answer <e> <s> my noble friend has put his finger on the right point <e> <s> almost certainly the answer to my noble friends question is no <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords perhaps it is because we have been going on for rather a long time but i did not hear the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords the decision has not just been taken it goes right back to not quite as old as the noble lord lord shinwell but quite a long time ago <e> <s> for the noble lord to suggest that the present government have in some way made a new arrangement is not an accurate assessment of the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not again repeat the provisions of the joint political decisions which we have with the united states <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord balogh will look at the <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not put the question in the way that the noble lord puts the question to me and the reason is contained in my original answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> we need these terrible weapons in order to pursue natos strategy of peace by deterrence which has kept the peace of europe for nearly years and the system of joint political decision i do assure <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord mentioned battlefield nuclear weapons

sense further than that <e> <s> nato has always said that it would never use any weapons except in response to attack <e>", "<cs> my lords the expressions strategic and intermediate are expressions which have been used <e> <s> i think that they derive from salt i but they are used to divide up the talks which are taking place in geneva at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords at the moment we are a very long way i am afraid from the objective which the noble lord lord brockway wants <e> <s> i wish that that were not the case <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be right but let us if we may come back to the original answer of the government to the original question the purpose of our deploying nuclear weapons is to ensure that the russians do not risk starting any form of war nuclear or conventional <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i cannot answer my noble friends point in that particular question <e> <s> it has been the policy of successive governments not to answer questions on details of nuclear stockpiles including yields <e> <s> however i am anxious to be as helpful as possible to my noble friend <e> <s> therefore perhaps i may simply say to the house that we are talking at present about the soviet union having about intermediate range nuclear missiles facing europe <e> <s> there are none in return <e>", "<cs> my lords nato must maintain a sufficient range and balance of weapons both conventional and nuclear in order to present a convincing deterrent <e> <s> the point on which the noble lord lord jenkins of putney does not agree with the government is i emphasise to the house that this policy of deterrence has kept the peace in europe for nearly years <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a question which i neither can nor should answer <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement on th april by the spanish ministry of foreign affairs was issued publicly and was not addressed specifically to her majestys government <e> <s> her majestys ambassador at madrid has however made clear to the spanish authorities that as my right honourable friend said on th april in another place a visit of warships to gibraltar during the annual springtrain exercise is quite normal <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the desire of her majestys government that our relations with spain should be as good as possible <e> <s> so far as the garrison at gibraltar is concerned i can assure my noble friend that the present defences of gibraltar are adequate for the need <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly i accept the point which the noble lord makes about the proved enormous importance of the dockyard at the time of the start of the falklands crisis but may i emphasise to him that we have outlined measures which we would be prepared to take to help to establish in its place a commercially managed dockyard <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the first part of the noble lords question may i say that he knows that the spanish foreign minister senor moran visited london in march <e> <s> it was agreed that my right honourable friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary and senor moran should keep closely in touch <e> <s> they will in any case have occasion to meet each other in the next month or so <e> <s> i say that in reply to the first part of the noble lords question about the prospects for the implementation of the lisbon agreement which her majestys government want very much indeed <e> <s> i am not entirely sure that i took the thrust of the second part of the noble lords question but may i say hoping that it answers it that as a matter of courtesy the spanish navy were informed beforehand of the visit <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> these visits take place because of operational necessity <e> <s> i cannot give the noble lord the assurance for which he asks <e>", "<cs> my lords the gibraltar regiment now has blowpipe <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it best to begin my reply to the question of the noble lord lord hatch by referring to the resolution on the education service and disarmament which was carried at the annual conference of the national union of teachers at easter <e> <s> that resolution among other things called on her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords a quick division sum will provide the answer for the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord oram for giving the house the opportunity to debate the brandt commissions memorandum <e>", "<cs> my lords on the second point i am afraid that i cannot improve on the answer that i gave to the noble lord lord hatch <e> <s> on the first point the noble lord continues to ask me the same question and i am afraid that the noble lord must accept the same answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that the noble lord lord jenkins of putney should ask this question this evening for far from being a source of anxiety the presence of united states forces in this country is a source of strength and reassurance for the defence and security of our country <e> <s> there has therefore been no attempt to conceal the facts as the noble lord suggests <e> <s> the arrangements for the control of any use to which these forces might be put are wholly satisfactory and that has been the case since united states forces returned to britain after the war <e>", "<cs> my lords i can easily answer that question <e> <s> how delightful it is to take part in a debate when it is easy to answer a question <e> <s> the answer to the noble lord is no <e> <s> turning to the second part of the noble lords question as to operational control over united states nuclear weapons based in this country this is a matter to which all post-war british governments have directed their attention <e> <s> this i accept is a matter of concern to noble lords and i shall try to give answers to the questions which have been put <e> <s> arrangements for the control of american forces based in the united kingdom were first agreed by mr attlee and president truman in <e> <s> as your lordships know that agreement was endorsed by mr churchill and president truman in further discussions in <e> <s> the understanding which these two leaders reached was summarised in a joint communiqu published at the time <e> <s> the text reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i do not think that the noble lord has perhaps quite added to the light which is being shed on this subject which is not an entirely easy subject <e> <s> the agreement is the agreement which i have read out and that in effect gives joint political decision <e> <s> the arrangement with the thor missiles with respect to the noble lord was an arrangement for full dual key because the thor launchers were owned by the united kingdom <e> <s> what i have just been saying is that that is the arrangement for full dual key and only that arrangement based on ownership has always been accepted both by the united states and those who are the allies of the united states <e> <s> for that reason unless we were prepared to purchase the cruise missiles we should not be able to claim full dual key <e> <s> we felt that this would divert substantial resources from money which we should otherwise be spending on our conventional and other nuclear capabilities <e> <s> in these circumstances the government decided that the arrangements summarised in the communiqu should apply to the cruise missile force <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer that question although i will no doubt look it up <e> <s> but i do not think this takes our debate very much further <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that thor was under a dual key there is no secret about that because the launchers were owned by britain <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that the decision had to be taken by the government at the present time as to whether they were prepared to purchase the cruise missile launchers <e> <s> that would have taken a very large sum of money and i have already given an assessment of it in previous questions in your lordships house <e> <s> and for reasons which i have already deployed in my speech the government felt that it was not right to go for a dual key decision on cruise but to rest on the effective arrangements of the joint political decision procedure which is encapsulated in the memorandum <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is not only capable of not following the argument i am trying to put forward but i think the noble lord is even capable of not listening <e> <s> the last few minutes of the speech i have been submitting to your lordships before i gave way to the noble lord lord kennet have been entirely directed to making the case that the joint political decision procedure rests upon mutual trust mutual respect and mutual confidence <e> <s> we need to be able to show the united states britain and all the allies in nato that we have this mutual trust and <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not mean to be discourteous to the noble lord <e> <s> the first question that the noble lord lord kennet addressed to me was why is it not possible to have a dual key system without needing to have ownership but by having some form of british presence in the line of command <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will forgive me i cannot keep bobbing up and down <e> <s> i am replying to the two questions which he says i have not answered <e> <s> in effect i have replied to the question by <e>", "<cs> my lords i have answered that question on more than one occasion in the past <e> <s> we have not gone into that because the question does not arise for the reasons that i have given during the debate this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords here again i apologise to the noble lord lord milford because i know that that it is a perfectly genuine question <e> <s> it is however a question that has been answered on many occasions in both houses of parliament <e> <s> the short answer is that the talks in geneva are bilateral talks between the soviet union and the united states and it does not do to change the rules in the middle of negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not party to the geneva bilateral talks but on the contrary our nato allies the united states are constantly proposing constructive suggestions for disarmament in both the start and inf talks <e> <s> as regards the noble lords question on the order paper work is going on in the committee on disarmament on an amalgamated draft but we have always made clear that we believe that the western draft which was tabled not only by britain but by australia belgium the federal republic of germany

could be a step in the right direction and is to be welcomed if it is a signal that the russians will now begin to negotiate seriously at geneva <e> <s> but as regards the assertion that british and french nuclear weapons must be counted in the negotiations that remains unacceptable to us and our allies <e> <s> we believe that is a proposal based on a transparently false premise <e>", "<cs> my

<s> we believe that it could be a step in the right direction and is to be welcomed if it is a signal that the russians will begin to negotiate seriously at geneva <e>", "<cs> my lords the british voice most certainly is heard in the committee on disarmament from which the question on the order paper springs <e> <s> it was in a speech on th march this year at the committee on disarmament which

confirmation of these reports but we have been concerned by libyan statements to the effect that they still regard violence as an option <e> <s> the government have made their views known to the libyan authorities at a high level in recent months <e> <s> my honourable friend the minister for health discussed the matter in general terms when he was in tripoli in february <e> <s> he received

responsible for this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not done what the noble lord is asking of me which is to follow up newspaper reports but i shall state what we have done <e> <s> after the incidents in in which the noble lord will remember three libyans were assassinated in this country we sought and received assurances that there would be no repetition of such behaviour <e> <s> we made it very clear that otherwise there could be no future in anglo-libyan relations <e> <s> we attach importance to those assurances but we have no illusions and we are watching libyan actions closely <e>", "<cs> my lords i must add my thanks to my noble friend lord cathcart for drawing attention to one of the most important factors in the international situation today and also and not for the first time i should like to express my thanks for the splendid speech which the noble lord lord stewart of fulham has just delivered <e> <s> i expected cubans to figure in your lordships debate today but i had not thought that the perceptions of the average cuban citizen of cuban surrogates serving in africa would be compared with fond memories of oliver cromwell during the time of restoration england <e> <s> however the noble lord was able to make the comparison and to make it in his own inimitable way <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact of the matter is that we are in a situation now when it is up to the russians <e> <s> the allies have made clear all along that what we want to do is to remove these terrible weapons from the whole european theatre altogether <e> <s> that is the zero option which remains our ultimate objective <e> <s> since then the americans have put forward an interim proposal to limit the number of warheads on these inf missiles <e> <s> the russians are therefore now being asked what level of these terrible weapons they would accept in europe <e> <s> we now await a reply from them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord mentions the <e>", "<cs> my lords if one tries to go down that track there are two immediate difficulties <e> <s> the first is that the talks between the russians and the americans in the inf negotiations in geneva have always been accepted as bilateral negotiations <e> <s> that was the wish of both sides <e> <s> it would mean changing the rules in the middle of the negotiations to breach that <e> <s> secondly if those independent deterrents were brought into the negotiations the effect would be to grant the soviet union one of the two negotiators superiority over the united states <e> <s> that is not a very good start to that particular <e>", "<cs> my lords that if i may say so is a good question <e> <s> may i give a general answer <e> <s> people often talk at the moment about a moratorium or a freeze <e> <s> if that happened we would be freezing the number of intermediate land-based nuclear missiles in europe targeted upon each of our countries in the free world at about to in favour of the soviet union <e> <s> in fact so far as land-based missiles are concerned none is held by the west at all <e> <s> meanwhile as my noble friends question brings out the russians have been continuing to deploy sss and are not applying any idea or a moratorium to the asian regions of the ussr <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baronesss question brings us hack to the original question <e> <s> it is because the west is concerned about the enormous build-up both in intermediate range weapons in the east and also strategic weapons in the east that the allies have put forward proposals that there shall he no intermediate range weapons at all in europe and that there shall be very deep cuts in the interballistic monsters that both sides hold <e> <s> i repeat that it is now up to the russians <e> <s> we want to know if they will agree to no intermediate range nuclear missiles in europe <e> <s> if they will not agree to that what number will they agree to <e>", "<cs> my lords the concern of the noble baroness about mistrust is of course well placed <e> <s> all that the allies can do is to negotiate in good faith while remaining strong and vigilant <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to all that the noble lord has just been saying is very simple indeed <e> <s> let both sides agree that there shall be no intermediate range missiles land-based targeted on any of the countries in europe namely the zero option and then the people of both western europe and the east can live in peace <e>", "<cs> my lords the security of the missiles will be the responsibility of a jointly manned united states-united kingdom force under british and united states commanders <e> <s> they will be responsible for the security of the missiles at all times whether on base or dispersed <e> <s> i think that that answers both the first two supplementary questions of the noble lord <e> <s> as regards his final supplementary question i repeat a reply which i have given on previous occasions in your lordships house a full dual key arrangement rests upon ownership of the missiles and her majestys government were certain that in this case ownership was not necessary and would involve the expenditure of money which could be put to better use elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i quoted the agreement in a short debate which took place on an unstarred question tabled by the noble lord lord jenkins of putney and that is the agreement that we have today <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> as i said in my original answer the matter was reaffirmed by the prime minister and by the president of the united states in <e> <s> therefore i do not expect it to be discussed at williamsburg <e>", "<cs> my lords if exercises have not taken place as the noble lord says it is because the policy of deterrence works and has worked for nearly years <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the case <e> <s> i have already given the reason in the questions and answers this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords that is why it is important that i should make it clear for about the umpteenth time that the use of these weapons is subject to joint decision and therefore the russians should not be tempted to make a move <e> <s> it would be disastrous for them as well as for other human beings in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to both the noble lords questions is in this way the <e>", "<cs> my lords in the event of a situation which the noble lord has described the use of nuclear weapons from british soil would still be subject to joint political decision under the agreement <e> <s> so far as the proposals put forward by mr andropov are concerned those will be i have no doubt discussed in the correct forums at geneva <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said to the noble lord lord molloy in answer to the first supplementary question the security of the missiles will be the responsibililty of a jointly manned united states-united kingdom force under british and united states commanders <e> <s> that means that we are talking of a joint force working to a common purpose <e> <s> that is one of the many contributions which this country makes to the north atlantic treaty organisation <e> <s> as the noble lord has mentioned the general election i hope that the electorate will draw their own conclusions from the proposals of the opposition that that contribution should be withdrawn from nato <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it was reasonable to infer from the noble lords question on th april and from the summary that appeared in a british newspaper on th march that the noble lords interest was being expressed in a recent statement by president belaunde rather than in a three-months-old press interview <e> <s> the noble lord says to the house that the sinking of the belgrano and the mediation efforts by president belaunde were coincidental <e> <s> may-be they were but the press report to which i now know the noble lord is referring which was published in argentina tells how the president of peru continued active negotiations for more than two more weeks says that the british agreed to listen to any proposal and records that those negotiations were finally ended by unilateral argentine action <e>", "<cs> my lords the british government had established the maritime exclusion zone on th april and had also warned on rd april that any approach by argentine warships which could amount to a threat to british forces would encounter the appropriate response <e> <s> there was therefore a possibility of action at any time against an argentine warship disregarding those warnings <e> <s> the position of my right honourable friend therefore does not come into the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords this is ground which has been gone over many times before <e> <s> the general belgrano was kept in such a position by the argentine authorities despite warnings that argentine warships which could pose a threat to british forces would be subject to attack <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no lack of enthusiasm but we are now getting on to a different question <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i will do so <e> <s> the general belgrano was sunk solely for military reasons because she posed a threat to ships of the task force <e> <s> the house should know that thorough investigation has shown that knowledge of the peruvian proposals reached london only after the attack on the general belgrano <e> <s> the record of which i think all noble lords are aware shows quite clearly how hard we tried before and after that sinking to reach a negotiated settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords not only have we shown magnanimity in this matter but we have been ready to offer proper facilities but as the noble lord knows the arrangements were not accepted by those who were organising the visit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that the noble lord ascribes such a statement to my right honourable friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary at a time when the task force was steaming towards the falkland islands <e> <s> so far as the rest of the noble lords supplementary question is concerned i am very pleased to put the record absolutely clear <e> <s> the first intimation that the government had of the existence of any proposals from the president of peru came in a series of conversations between mr pym and mr haig in washington on nd may <e> <s> the result of these conversations was telegraphed to london at gmt on nd may over three hours after the attack on the general belgrano <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to this question has been made clear by my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary for the armed forces on th march and nd may <e> <s> the answer to the noble lord is that there were signs that our ships and men were threatened by a pincer attack and that that involved the general belgrano <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not shocked by the answer i have given the noble lord <e> <s> growth of imports is evidence of increased industrial activity and of rising consumer demand both of which offer increased opportunities to british industry <e> <s> it is very heartening as was said by my noble friend lord cockfield in yesterdays debate that the cbis industrial trends inquiry showed an increase in output and improved order books for the fifth month in succession <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer that question but yes of course arms sales are included <e>", "<cs> my lords unless i say to the contrary the figures i give are in cash terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is fair to say that in the budgets of the past two years incentives have been given to both new and expanding businesses <e> <s> of course through the work of the british overseas trade board and other agencies i believe that with output continuing to rise so jobs will begin to come back <e>", "<cs> my lords in case there is any misunderstanding i must make it clear that manufacturing output in the first four months of this year the only months for which i have figures is most definitely up <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do not agree with the noble lord that it is necessary or even desirable to have a surplus in trade on every single <e>", "<cs> my lords my answer to the noble lord remains the same as it was in my answer to his original supplementary question that is that growth in imports is evidence of increased industrial activity and of rising consumer demand <e> <s> there is evidence whether or not the noble lord agrees that british industry is now beginning to take advantage of those opportunities in contradistinction to other countries in the oecd which as my noble friend lord gowrie pointed out in the debate yesterday were on a downward trend at the beginning of this year so far as manufacturing output is concerned while this country despite all our difficulties was on an upward curve <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord cledwyn is habitually fair and i am sure the noble lord would recognise the force of the information which my noble friend lord gowrie gave in the debate yesterday <e> <s> i repeat that at a time when the countries of the oecd including our leading industrial competitors were on a downward curve in manufacturing output this country was at the beginning of an upward curve <e> <s> when the noble lord asks what the government are going to do we are going to try to keep prices stable we are going to try to keep interest rates down and we are going to continue to give adequate incentives to industry <e>", "<cs> my lords like all other countries during the recession it has been difficult to increase manufacturing output <e> <s> we are now beginning to do so <e> <s> if we can continue to do so then it is possible that the jobs will follow <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason for the revision of the disposals programme was to take account of inflation and a further two years have been added to the programme <e> <s> i do not think if i may say so with respect that it leads to uncertainty and certainly not also with respect to the noble lord who has a distinguished record in respect of matters concerned with the forestry commission so far as planting is concerned <e> <s> there was a per cent increase in new planting by private owners in the year to st march compared with the previous year <e> <s> although final figures for last year are still awaited these are expected to show that this increase has been sustained <e>", "<cs> my lords it is i believe reasonable for the government to make the most efficient use of public assets in the context of constraining public expenditure generally <e> <s> with this in mind the money from the disposals programme goes into the consolidated fund and <e> <s> in its turn the commission receives adequate sums of money each year by way of grant-in-aid for its agreed programmes <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i apologise for not answering that point <e> <s> any existing public access rights will be protected <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer the question about the maturity of the timber but on st june this year the total amount of land sold amounted to hectares <e> <s> that updates slightly the original answer that i gave to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe <e> <s> of that land awaiting planting was hectares <e> <s> land now in the process of being sold totals hectares and of that the land awaiting planting is hectares <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i do not understand the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords you multiply by two and add on a bit <e>", "<cs> my lords in its selection

noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords it could lead to a loss of timber but i do not think that this will happen because of the remarkable increase in private planting in response to the change in grant structure made in <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the second point is concerned it specifically forms part of the guidelines on disposals which are given to the commission <e> <s> i respond gladly to the first point that the noble lord put to me about co-operation between the private sector and the forestry commission <e> <s> i am glad to have the opportunity to assure the noble lord that the government intend to maintain the commissions programme but with a greater place for participation by the private sector in new planting <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments interpretation of the word now is that we are expecting the replies from the chairmen of the nationalised industries shortly <e>", "<cs> i cannot add to what has been stated in the queens speech my lords <e> <s> i wish however to assure the noble baroness that we intend to maintain the momentum of consumer council reforms <e> <s> i believe that we have shown our good intentions in this matter by putting the electricity consumers council on a statutory basis in the energy bill during the last session of parliament <e> <s> the next step in the strategy is to consider the proposals of the chairmen of consumer councils for operating guidelines which i assure the noble baroness my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state for trade is looking forward to receiving shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness asked me about legislation <e> <s> i therefore cannot add to or subtract from what is contained in the queens speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand my noble friends concern <e> <s> i appreciate too from her record the concern of the noble baroness lady burton <e> <s> but my noble friend and the noble baroness opposite would be the first to complain if the department of trade and industry did not take account of the chairmen of the consumer councils own proposals in reply to the letter of the then minister dr vaughan of march so far as operating guidelines are concerned <e> <s> i repeat that these replies are expected shortly <e> <s> if i may expand on that i hope that this means either by the end of this month or some time during the following month <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as policy is concerned i think if i may say so that for the government to say that we recognise the interdependence of the economies of the world which is a great deal more than just a bland statement of the obvious it is something which is extraordinarily difficult to achieve and if only we could do so it would overcome so many problems of the world and to say that we seek a realistic and constructive outcome at belgrade is a reasonable answer to the noble lords question <e> <s> so <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i must ask house to wait <e> <s> there will be a white paper issued which will give an account of the conference <e> <s> the noble lord asked the government whether there was one resolution which would have saved one life anywhere in the world <e> <s> the noble lord knows very well indeed from his interest and his experience that many of the difficulties in the world are in countries which rely upon commodities for their trade <e> <s> i would point out to the noble lord that out of the four major resolutions on commodities which were passed at belgrade one urged countries to ratify the common fund to provide finance for buffer stocks <e> <s> we have already ratified the common fund and we were trying to persuade other countries to do likewise <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly there is no question of suggesting to the house that the success of a conference is to be judged by the number of resolutions passed <e> <s> i think the thing to do if i may say so is to wait until the white paper is issued

the negotiating process made recently in the commonwealth report entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture fisheries and food <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord bishopston and lord mackie of benshie for what they have said albeit not without criticism about that which occurred at the fisheries council on th and th july <e> <s> the first point i would make in reply to the noble lord lord bishopston is that the problem over herring on which the meeting of three days ago foundered does not mean that the common fisheries policy has foundered <e> <s> it was always recognised that the setting of the north sea herring quotas would be very difficult <e> <s> although that has proved to be the case the other major advances made on such matters as quotas other than for herring access technical conservation measures and structural assistance to the industry from the commission are still valid and very much in place <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is important for me to make the point to my noble friend that those <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly draw the attention of my right honourable friend and my honourable friend who have both been attending the council to the words of my noble friend lord glenkinglas and also to the importance which he quite rightly reminds the government attaches to this matter so far as employment is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i entirely agree with my noble friend lord chelwood that there is undoubtedly evidence of illegal catching of salmon and that it is on a substantial scale <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that the government are well aware of the need for prompt action <e> <s> we shall consult urgently with representatives of importers and wholesale and retail distributors as well as with salmon fishermen and farmers to seek their views on the salmon sales groups report <e>", "<cs> my lords all those who are members of the group with the exception of the secretary are members of water authorities <e> <s> those water authorities remain in being and so it will be perfectly possible for the government to do that which i have said to my noble friend lord chelwood will be done which is to consult with the group urgently <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for drawing that point to the attention not only of the house but also of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for putting his finger on that particular point <e> <s> it is towards that objective as i understand it that the salmon sales groups recommendations are particularly aimed <e> <s> we have to look very carefully at the recommendation for tagging because there are some problems there is no doubt about that <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i believe that the question of licensing was raised in the consultation paper in <e> <s> it would have been for the salmon sales group if it had wished to have gone for the licensing option <e> <s> in fact it went for the tagging option and that is the option we shall be looking at urgently <e>", "<cs> my lords the final point made by the noble lord lord strabolgi brings us back to the recommendation made by the salmon sales group <e> <s> it is precisely the point that will be dealt with by the recommendation of the group but i will not conceal from the house that the groups recommendation has some problems in it and these problems do need to be discussed but urgently <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to hear that but i am grateful to my noble friend for giving me that information <e>", "<cs> my lord i am grateful to the noble lords lord bruce of donington and lord rochester for their replies to my right honourable friends statement <e> <s> i must apologise to both noble lords about the statement being somewhat late <e> <s> i believe it was drafted while my right honourable friend was travelling back from the steel council in the very early hours of this morning <e> <s> although it did come very late fortunately we are taking it about one and a half hours after it came into the hands of both noble lords <e> <s> nonetheless the noble lords remarks are valid as a general matter of principle and i will of course draw what has been said by the noble lord lord bruce of donington to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord ezra for his intervention <e> <s> i think my answer to the final point the noble lord put to me is that the future of individual plants of the british steel corporation must depend on the market and on the performance of the plant <e> <s> it is in the light of those two criteria that investment decisions will be planned <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very much my hope that there will be no question of any further de-manning as a result of the present decisions made by the steel council <e> <s> but as i said to the noble lord lord rochester my understanding is that as a result of the increased quota there should be preservation of jobs but not an increase in jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords these regulations provide for the enforcement of the community requirements governing the levying of a charge equivalent to the <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as extra work is concerned i am not aware this will cause an addition to manpower although for some hardworking members of the public service it might create some extra work <e> <s> but of course it really is necessary as i sought to point out and as the noble lord was good enough to accept in his opening remarks if the community status of the sheepmeat regime in northern ireland is to work <e> <s> therefore if there is to be extra work because of this i think it has to be faced <e> <s> i trust it will not lead to extra manpower <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord john-mackie for his remarks about this order which were thoughtful remarks and to my noble friend lord stanley of alderley for his kind welcome to me even though he was not able to follow it up with support for the order i had introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter for the usual channels but i shall most certainly draw the attention of my noble friend the chief whip to what the noble baroness has said <e>", "<cs> my lords there is nothing between my noble friend and the government on this matter <e> <s> the government feel very strongly indeed that the function of the consumer councils to monitor what is going on in the nationalised industries needs to be strengthened and placed on a more formal basis <e> <s> that was one of the reasons why we got in touch with the chairmen of the councils <e> <s> having said that i shall draw to the attention of my noble friend the chief whip what my noble friend lady elliot has also said <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat that this is a matter for the usual channels but the noble baroness is very persuasive and i shall do my best <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there is no better protection for the consumer than to subject the nationalised industries to market forces <e> <s> but having said that the whole point of this question which i am being asked is that the government recognise that there are nationalised industries which will remain monopolies and it is they which need to have an eye kept on them to see that they look after consumers affairs <e> <s> it was for that reason that we got in touch with the chairmen of the consumer councils and that is why we believe there ought to be guidelines <e>", "<cs> yes precisely my lords with respect i think that that is what i have just said <e> <s> that <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps we ought to look at the <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend the lord president i beg to move the motion standing in his name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend the law with respect to agricultural holdings <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that both the cork report and the noble baroness very rightly are extremely concerned particularly about the wrongful <e>", "<cs> my lords we ought to try to be more helpful to the noble baroness <e> <s> i must admit that i am not in a position today on the floor of the house to be more helpful because the report is such an enormous one and i do not think that we yet genuinely know its exact scope <e> <s> but i should like to write to the noble baroness and try to help over that matter <e> <s> on the first point which the noble baroness raises all that i can say is that although there may be those very well versed in these matters who believe that one could pull out certain aspects of the report which i agree need to be looked at with as much urgency as possible i think that i really must rest on my answer to the first supplementary question which is that one finds that those recommendations which might be most suitable for early treatment are inter-related and their effects are interdependent <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the expertise of the noble lord and his concern in this matter but i think that even he knowing a great deal more than i know would wish to see what is in the white paper which ought to be available in the very near future before reaching any conclusions on that supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords as my original answer made clear we have recently introduced arrangements for selling packhouse buildings at a concessionary price where the co-operatives are unable to afford the market price <e> <s> it may be that those people who have been speaking to the noble lord have not done so within the past few days <e> <s> we wrote to the co-operatives about these arrangements two weeks ago <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i do not think that that is necessary <e> <s> i am very pleased to be able to say that growers on all estates i emphasise on all estates either have or will have access to co-operative organisations <e> <s> growers co-operatives exist on seven of the estates and established co-operatives are being used on the other three <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i entirely understand the concern which the noble lord is expressing <e> <s> but i think that i ought to repeat that the communication about concessionary prices was sent to the co-operatives two weeks ago and i hope that this will put the matter on an acceptable basis <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord whose experience of this matter of course goes back very much further than mine so far as his earlier supplementary questions are concerned i believe that there is here a good deal for those who are tenants <e> <s> they are being offered their holdings if they wish to buy at tenanted value which can mean up to a per cent <e> <s> reduction in price which is more than some council house tenants for instance are being offered under different arrangements <e> <s> if a tenant does not wish to buy his holding he does not need to do so he is under no pressure to do so <e> <s> he can continue as a tenant <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we are at all times advised by our professional advisers and when we feel that we need to do so we turn also to the district valuer <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i should never decline on behalf of my right honourable friend to see anybody who wishes to come and speak at the ministry of agriculture provided that matters are arranged in the proper way <e> <s> however at the risk of wearying the house <e> <s> perhaps it would be for the convenience of the noble lords lord beswick lord collison and lord cledwyn of penrhos if i were to say that following what was called the eden report arrangements have recently been agreed to sell <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first question i think i should write to the noble lord <e> <s> lord collison <e> <s> it was a little difficult for me to assimilate it <e> <s> on the second point that the noble lord put i can only repeat that i believe the discounts offered which have been on a sliding scale up to have been realistic and generous <e> <s> in answer to the noble lord lord beswick growers charges over the years have included an element covering the costs of the buildings and machinery provided by the government <e> <s> the charges made are therefore similar to rent and have been looked at in that light <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would be to the convenience of your lordships if i intervened briefly now <e> <s> the government find themselves in a difficulty in answering the amendment of my noble friend lord kinnoull and the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe <e> <s> there are several different formulae for rent that have been placed before the committee on the marshalled list <e> <s> the noble lord lord middleton who i normally believe implicitly in all that he says says that there are three different formulae but for once i take issue with him i believe there are five <e> <s> first there is the formula currently in force <e> <s> there is the formula which we have in clause of the bill <e> <s> there is the formula of my noble friend lord kinnoull together with the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe <e> <s> there is also the amendment of my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> that is four <e> <s> then there is the amendment of the noble viscount lord dilhorne <e> <s> indeed there is also a sixth namely the scottish rent formula which with admirable insularity your lordships have not turned towards in these debates <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can add to the expertise and experience which have been voiced in the last to hours on these two amendments <e> <s> however i can perhaps add one further word and first stake out what i believe to be the common ground <e> <s> this is that a new rent formula should provide a sound and comprehensible statutory basis for the current practice of arbitrators <e> <s> one may ask why if this is the objective we need to do anything at all <e> <s> of course the answer is as my noble friend lord middleton put it so clearly during second reading that current arbitration practice would be in danger of breaking down if an arbitrator were to be challenged in the courts <e> <s> my noble friend lord waldegrave has underlined that danger in the speech that he made on the amendments today while the noble earl lord de la warr said very much the same thing <e>", "<cs> yes certainly we would do that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord mackie of benshie because the proposed amendment of the noble lord lord john-mackie would leave the arbitrator to determine what factors were relevant from among the statements of case <e> <s> this would sweep away any basis for assessing rents <e> <s> the noble lord lord john-mackie said on the previous amendment that he would be against the open market formula and it would omit those factors which have been laid down ever since as not to be taken into account in rent assessment <e> <s> those would be swept away by the amendment as well <e> <s> there would be no guidance for the arbitrator and there would be no guarantee of any consistency between one arbitration and another for landlord and tenant <e> <s> for those reasons this is most unacceptable to the government <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend lord renton for putting down this amendment because it has led to an extremely interesting debate <e> <s> as one would expect from an amendment put down by my noble friend it is drafted with great skill and is most attractive in that way <e> <s> it represents a fundamental revision of the rent formula which is put forward in the bill although reproducing some of the existing features in a different order and in a different form <e> <s> as my noble friend said it is identical to a formula which i believe was proposed by the agricultural law association in <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to introduce a controversial note because i believe that the committee is very ready to accept the advice of the noble lord lord northfield on many aspects of the bill which is now before the committee <e> <s> but i really do think that this amendment would be an invitation to inconsistency in the basis of rent arbitration <e>", "<cs> that is precisely where i disagree with the noble lord lord northfield <e> <s> if this is to become permissive for one arbitrator to take into account but not another where on earth is the landlord or the tenant to find himself <e> <s> the noble lord reminded us as he had every right to do that it is important to encourage voluntary agreements <e> <s> but if landlords and tenants are not to be sure in one part of the country what is to be the basis of an arbitrators assessment compared with another part of the country it is very unlikely that landlords and tenants will continue to reach voluntary agreements in the very high numbers that they have in the past <e> <s> they will be uncertain and they will tend perhaps paradoxically to go to arbitration because of the uncertainty of the whole basis of the matter <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has answered his own question on this point <e>", "<cs> while it is intended that the productive capacity of the holding should be assessed objectively and that is a thought which we hope is conveyed by talking about a competent tenant rather than the tenant it would be unfair we believe to base the assessment of productivity at the extreme of the holdings potential since this might assume the use of highly capital intensive methods which may not be available to the sitting tenant <e> <s> subsection <e>", "<cs> if i may say so the productive capacity of the holding as it is set out in subsection <e>", "<cs> if i understand your lordships there is not disagreement on the desirability of having in the <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord swinton is replying to this amendment but i think i ought to say that i did not say either of those things <e>", "<cs> the reference in the bill to take into account all relevant factors ought to cover this matter but i should like to say immediately that i think my noble friend lord caithness and the noble lord lord gibson are on to an important point <e> <s> i agree with other noble lords that in the case of such a matter affecting the productive capacity of the holding it should be taken into account <e> <s> but there are many elements that go into the assessment of productive capacity the quality of the land the availability of equipment the structure of the holding the availability of marketing facilities the availability of services climatic conditions and so on <e> <s> where there is a management agreement or a scheme for conservation as provided for in the wildlife and countryside act or other legislation which affects the capacity of the holding to produce then this i agree should be taken into account <e> <s> but i really do not believe that it is a particular factor of general application in assessing the rent <e>", "<cs> is that not a matter of whether it is written into the tenancy agreement or not <e>", "<cs> i will certainly look at what has been said because this is an important matter for many of the reasons which my noble friend lord sandford produced <e> <s> i do not agree with my noble friend unusually because generally i have agreed with his remarks over a long period in this house about his assessment of the type of bill this is <e> <s> the bill has made it possible for the government to bring forward government legislation <e> <s> if it had not been for that agreement we would not have got that far <e> <s> it is a government bill none the less and i am becoming even more aware of that as we go through what is quite a long committee stage with the help of your lordships <e>", "<cs> i think that what my noble friend lord stanley says may well he the case <e> <s> also i wonder whether the case which the noble lord lord northfield is making is not in fact already covered by the wording in subsection <e> <s> i think those are the only two things which i ought to say for the moment about an amendment which i confess i found difficult to follow until the noble lord explained its intention <e> <s> i do not want to appear obstructive but the government will want to think more carefully about those two points whether the case is not already covered by the wording of subsection and whether we shall in any case cover it when we reach amendment no <e> <s> <e>",

attention is correct <e> <s> i know that we will be looking at the appreciable scarcity element of the bill between now and report <e> <s> i said as much when i was replying earlier to amendments <e>

noble lord will be prepared to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> if it is not covered i shall gladly look at it further <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend who has just spoken because as much as i should like to assist my noble friend lord caithness this amendment is attempting the impossible <e> <s> if there is an appreciable scarcity of lettings it is possible to prevent that being reflected in appreciably very much higher rents by saying that the appreciable scarcity element ought to be discounted <e> <s> there may well be disagreement about the desirability of doing this and we have heard some of that expressed in your lordships house today <e> <s> but it is an exercise which can be accomplished <e>", "<cs> i do not want to appear unhelpful and i do not disagree with the noble lord lord mackie when he says that there may be a point here <e> <s> but there needs to he a very radical rethink as to the way in which my noble friend drafts the amendment <e> <s> i am in a position where i cannot help my noble friend lord caithness regarding that matter because i feel that the concept of the amendment is so foreign to what we are attempting to do in subsection that my noble friend must deal with the matter himself <e> <s> if my noble friend would like to talk to me or me to him between the two stages of the bill i should be very ready to do so <e> <s> but i repeat if the concept which the noble lord lord mackie has put forward in a helpful way were to be achieved it would need to be tackled in a very different way from the way in which it has been tackled in the present amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene again <e> <s> once again my noble friend has answered his own question <e> <s> he says that when there is a surplus it is hard luck on the landlord <e> <s> but with respect to my noble friend i think he has overlooked the fact that we have paragraphs <e>", "<cs> i shall consider what the noble lord <e> <s> lord mackie of benshie has said afterwards but for the moment i am attracted to this amendment <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lord stanley of alderley that it would be better to discount proximity in relation to the rents of comparable holdings than to do so in relation to the subject holding <e> <s> where the subject holding itself is concerned it occurs to me it is quite correct that a rent should reflect the fact that

principle the same as in section of the act <e> <s> the point is that in a rent arbitration landlords improvements must be dealt with differently from tenants improvements <e> <s> tenants improvements

alterations to the governments policy on the repeal of the act and in this amendment is endeavouring to do so moderately and reasonably <e> <s> indeed the amendment has on the face of it the merit of impeccable logic <e> <s> but in this country we are not all that strong on logic and tend to prefer the pragmatic approach or in plain english to ask the question will it work <e>", "<cs> i repeat if

of your lordships <e>", "<cs> if i may pick up the point made by my noble friend lord waldegrave at the very end of his remarks may i express the hope that we will not find ourselves voting on these amendments because i agree with the noble lord lord prys-davies that there is a good deal of common ground and i should like to make it crystal clear to the committee that the government very much welcome each of these amendments as being a step towards an objective which seems to be shared on all sides <e> <s> if we can provide in this bill in your lordships house for a really fair provision

indeed a fact that ill health is not mentioned which makes the amendment in the name of the noble lord and his noble friend that much more attractive <e>", "<cs> i was interested in the remarks of the noble lord lord bishopston because not only has the noble lord very great experience of the ministry in which i am fortunate enough to work but he was a minister in another place when the legislation was going through <e> <s> i and my noble friends on this side of the house well understand why the noble lord felt that he should intervene at this moment in the bill <e> <s> indeed we listened to what the noble lord said with great interest <e>", "<cs> what i meant was that this year we built upon the finance act by extending capital transfer tax relief from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e>

conservative partys concessions on capital transfer tax <e> <s> that is what i meant <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord northfield for taking so many amendments together in the interests

amendments nos <e> <s> a b and a are undoubtedly important <e> <s> i should like to say straight away that there are elements in these amendments which i am advised are certainly capable of adoption <e> <s> but we should like to reflect on the matter further particularly in the light of the short debate that we have had <e>", "<cs> i believe that almost everything that ought to be said about this matter has been said <e> <s> it is a highly difficult and contentious matter <e> <s> it is looked upon by many people as a matter of principle going back over years to the act <e> <s> it is not a political matter <e> <s> it is not a factual matter <e> <s> it is a practical matter as to whether an amendment of this kind could harm long term planning and investment in tenanted land <e> <s> i say

noble friend is a past master at getting his foot in the door and then levering it open <e> <s> of course there is nothing to stop my right honourable friend extending his concept of the use of the section powers to a greater period than a maximum of five years <e> <s> but i would draw my noble friends attention to the fact that my right honourable friend has gone out of his way to see that of all the grounds on which section discretions of the minister can be used those grounds extend to about seven different grounds on which you can give short-term lettings he has chosen only two <e> <s> those are trial tenancies and tenancies where you want a bit of time because a son or daughter of the owner of the land is coming along a little later <e> <s> on those occasions my right honourable

a dividing line between someone who wishes to conserve and someone who wishes to farm <e> <s> those who have been farming best over many years have been some of the best conservationists <e>", "<cs>

northfield and i am not unsympathetic to them <e> <s> but i think the government still feel that the considerations which tribunals already have to bear in mind in considering applications for bad husbandry certificates are in fact already covered in the purposes of this amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has made a good point and it is more than a debating point <e> <s> but if the government are to go down this road we shall need to consult the industry with some care as to whether there is agreement that the requirements of good husbandry from which the penalties for bad husbandry are derived should be considerably tightened up <e> <s> i must not be two-faced about this <e> <s> i said at the beginning that i had become familiar with the sort of remarks that the noble lord has made and i agree that we have some responsibility in the government to look at this <e> <s> but if both the noble lord and my noble friend feel that they want to pursue this themselves i should like to repeat that we should need to know more specifically what additional factors the tribunals should be expected to take into account <e> <s> we for our part would have to bear in mind that we should have to be very careful not only that we carried the industry with us in changing these requirements of good husbandry but also that we did not provide scope for further argument and contention in tribunal hearings <e>", "<cs> i ask my noble friend not to make his speech although i enjoy listening to him <e> <s> i am prepared to consider the possibility at a later stage of bringing forward a suitable amendment in consultation with my noble friend to achieve the objectives outlined in this amendment <e> <s> it is rather sad that i have not enabled my noble friend to make his speech so that i could say what i have just said as a result of his speech but my noble friend knows that the persuasiveness of his drafting would have been exceeded only by the persuasiveness of his speech <e>", "<cs> this is another amendment dealing with retirement and from that point of view i welcome it because as i made clear earlier on behalf of the government this is an objective to which we must find the right answer <e> <s> on the other hand i hope that the noble lord lord mackie of benshie will not mind my saying that arguably it would be wrong to allow mandatory retirement provision because that is what we are talking about here to be enforced by notice to quit even in the limited circumstances provided for in this proposal <e> <s> i also think that arguably it would be wrong to link retirement to the nature of the repairing conditions of the tenancy agreement <e>", "<cs> this amendment suffers from the same defect as the noble lords amendment no <e> <s> namely we require a definition of viable unit before we are through and i think that the noble lord accepts that <e> <s> having said that <e> <s> i should like to look at what the noble lord has said as regards this amendment <e> <s> at this hour i do not want to go through a lot of reasons as to why we do not like the amendment <e> <s> however i am advised that there are certain technical defects <e>", "<cs>

institution of chartered surveyors professionally qualified for this matter but as i sought to lay before the committee the rics is actually designated by statute to appoint arbitrators in

rather than three figures each year <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not like the noble baroness to feel that she has not made progress <e> <s> i think it is not least due to the persistence of the noble baroness that we now have the electricity consumer council on a statutory basis we have new arrangements for liaison between the national councils under <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly accept on behalf of the government the responsibility so far as the consumer councils are concerned <e> <s> it is because the guidelines will define the operations of the consumer councils for some time to come

denationalisation continuing for aslong as it is needed for a long time to come <e> <s> on the noble lords second point it is important for me to make the point that one of the things that the consumer councils have done of their own volition as a result of turning their minds to the guidelinesis to look closely at dealing with complaints from the industries that they monitor <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we need to discuss these things when the bill comes before us <e> <s> the assurance i can give my noble friend is that the office of telecommunications will protect the interests of

part of the noble baronesss supplementary question any further <e> <s> but concerning the first part it is precisely because discussions need to take place with the national consumer councils that it

us in clause but i should just like to remind the committee that the formula is not designed to alter the level of rents <e> <s> it is precisely because it has been asserted by some noble lords that

apprehensions with which the government do not agree but nonetheless i am very ready to do that <e>", "<cs> the statutory code for agricultural arbitrations has endured substantially unamended since

some years ago i used to hear on the bbc and who started one of his talks with <e>", "<cs> that is a good question and the answer fortunately is readily available <e> <s> it is available and there are many noble lords in the committee this evening who could answer it so much better than i within the agricultural holdings legislation which has been built up over the years and which is particularly tailored to the needs of agriculture <e> <s> the success of farming after all depends on the land and the way it is looked after <e> <s> that is why we have separate legislation for agricultural holdings <e>", "<cs> i am a little worried that the opposition front bench is becoming fuller <e> <s> i hope that that does not mean that this is the preparation for a division on this important amendment which has given rise to lively debate but rather that the opposition front bench finds that this is a moment for a pre-prandial period of reflection and mental improvement <e>", "<cs> it is indeed i agree with that <e> <s> but it is not very much good putting forward the argument that there is a long ladder up which tenants of smallholdings are climbing at the present time because the ladder is short and they are not climbing in very large numbers <e> <s> i wish those numbers were greater <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord northfield is being absolutely consistent <e> <s> i know that he has raised this line of argument earlier in the progress of the bill and the points of which he has reminded the committee were set out in his very valuable report <e> <s> but i would be misleading the committee if i did not say that the implications of the guidance which the government gave to local authorities when we came into office in may are that we intend local authorities to have freedom of discretion in these matters <e>", "<cs> i was encouraged to hear the words of the noble lord lord northfield on the subject of land nationalisation but of course there is a lack of credibility between the wise words of the noble lord and the policies which are pursued by his party <e> <s> i hope that he and indeed his noble friends on the other side of the chamber who i think consistently give good advice to your lordships on agricultural matters will <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord lord northfield the noble lord lord mackie and my noble friend lord caithness have really answered this amendment for me <e> <s> all i would add is that i am advised that the figures are that the financial institutions own only per cent <e> <s> of all agricultural land and that per cent <e> <s> of their holding is let <e> <s> i think therefore that this would be a rather poor return for that record <e> <s> having said that the noble lord lord prys-davies was very fair in making it clear when he moved the amendment that the wording would not do and that it obviously would catch in its present form many institutions which it was not intended to catch <e> <s> perhaps on those grounds although i must say there are other grounds as well this is an amendment which ought to be withdrawn <e>", "<cs> we come to the government spokesman and i am afraid that he does not have an answer at all on this particular point <e> <s> but secure in the knowledge that in a moment my noble friend will have an answer to the point which the noble lord lord john-mackie has put forward i should like to say two main things <e> <s> first if we were to decide in favour of the amendment this evening there really would be a problem in that a management agreement between a public body be it the nature conservancy council the countryside commission or any other body with one of the parties to the tenancy either the landlord or the tenant could as i understand the amendment become a term of the tenancy without the other partys consent <e> <s> therefore there is in the proposal an element of compulsion which one would have to think about extremely carefully before agreeing to <e>", "<cs> i agree with noble lords who have spoken and indeed with the noble lord lord hylton who specifically made the point that the numbers of allotments which are in occupation seem to increase and decrease in a sort of cyclical way <e> <s> i have observed that myself <e> <s> but the problem with this amendment is that by taking allotment land out of the scope of agricultural holdings legislation as my noble friend lord mottistone proposes allotment organisations could find it much more difficult to regain possession of their land <e> <s> this is because the arrangements between the organisations and farmers would then be covered by the provisions of the landlord and tenant acts of and <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord dilhorne has explained at least i think he has explained that this amendment is designed to introduce much greater certainty where a landlord grants a short-term licence which has been subject to the ministers prior approval under section of the act <e> <s> the ministers approval is only given in fairly closely-defined circumstances in which it would be unreasonable to grant a full agricultural tenancy where the land is shortly to go out of agriculture <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> with respect to him i am not entirely sure that amendment no <e> <s> really goes with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however as i have the chief whip sitting only a few yards away i think it is almost as much as my life is worth not to take two amendments together if we can possibly kill two birds with one stone <e>", "<cs> as the notes on the schedule make clear we have replaced the word game in section of the agricultural holdings act with the words <e>", "<cs> these are matters of administrative detail which it would be unusual to enshrine in legislation <e> <s> indeed matters have worked perfectly well for many years as my noble friend very fairly implied in his remarks <e> <s> but i owe it to my noble friend to give an assurance which will go into <e>", "<cs> i must disagree with my noble friend that the bill is in any way giving further preferential treatment to tenants <e> <s> at present a succession tenant is treated in exactly the same way as any other sitting tenant when he succeeds to a tenancy <e> <s> the open market rent formula in section of the act is the basis on which the rent is established in both cases and we are proposing that exactly the same principle should apply when the present bill is brought into effect <e> <s> if that is agreed succession tenants would therefore continue to be treated as sitting tenants <e>", "<cs> the short answer to my noble friend is that it is because this is the way that it has been done <e> <s> at present a succession tenant is treated as a sitting tenant for the purposes of rent but if the arbitrator was to apply the provisions of the existing law with full vigour this would make no difference <e> <s> the rent would be the open market rent key money and all <e> <s> in practice however as we know because we have said it so many times arbitrators do not do this <e> <s> instead they have regard to other factors <e> <s> but if i may come hack to the real answer to my noble friends question it is so because it has been so for many years <e> <s> we do not intend to change this retrospectively <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord john-mackie and to the noble lord lord kilmarnock for indicating their support for these orders and for allowing me to speak to both of them together <e> <s> my brief answers will be confined entirely to the second of the orders

for fishing at this time of year <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend underlines the importance of seeing that if this cargo was being carried in an illegal way the matter should be taken up at the

animal welfare being the governments adviser on these matters the council is not a statutory body <e> <s> for that reason i think that the government would find difficulty in picking out special mention in this way in this particular place in this statute for the farm animal welfare council and not mentioning bodies representing the poultry industry the farmers unions other welfare bodies the veterinary profession and religious organisations just to list some organisations <e> <s> indeed one specific one in which the noble lord has an interest as president was mentioned by the noble lord lord somers <e>", "<cs> i think we shall go over it all again because i think i shall give the same reply to the noble lord as i have given now <e>", "<cs> these exemptions are being put on the face of the statute for the first time but they relate as the noble lord has explained to the committee to provisions which already exist under or by virtue of the provisions of the animal health act that is to say slaughter for the purposes of disease control which takes place under the supervision of a ministry of agriculture veterinary officer <e> <s> that is the first of the exemptions which the noble lord read <e> <s> this type of slaughter generally takes place on farms where the birds are protected by part i of the agriculture miscellaneous provisions act which prohibits the cause of unnecessary pain or distress to livestock on agricultural land <e> <s> for that reason it seemed right to us to put in the first of these exemptions <e>", "<cs> my first reaction to the noble earl was that it was the plural of minister but that gives me the opportunity to look at page of the bill <e> <s> if my <e>", "<cs> i was rather afraid that the noble earl might ask that question <e> <s> i must be absolutely honest i do not know whether the act relates to scotland <e> <s> that question i should like to answer for my noble friend after we have broken for the statement <e> <s> will my noble friend forgive me <e>", "<cs> first of all in his absence i apologise to my noble friend lord selkirk for not having been able to say earlier that the word ministers in this bill does indeed relate to the secretary of state for scotland and also the secretary of state for wales <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord one would not have guessed from most of his speech on this amendment that the clause is extending the powers in the slaughter of poultry act in order for regulations to be made to require the licensing of people engaged in the commercial slaughter of poultry <e> <s> indeed this clause causes those who are selling birds live to the intending consumer and then slaughtering them to be subject to the provisions of the clause <e>", "<cs> i ought just to say in reply that as the noble lord knows very much better than i do licensing is highly technical and detailed <e> <s> consultation is necessary but the consultation is not about whether that is in the bill but about how we should introduce licensing <e> <s> if we put in the word shall those who are consulted will say you do not mean to consult us <e> <s> you have made up your minds already <e> <s> if i may say so to the noble lord i do not think that that <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby does not feel that he is making much progress this afternoon <e> <s> i am even more sorry that he feels that more generally he does not make very much progress in your lordships house <e> <s> i cannot believe that it is anything that i have done <e> <s> i remember very well the three successive sessions in which the noble lord put forward his bill to regulate the sale of live pet animals in markets <e> <s> if my memory serves me right on each occasion through long hours we dealt with that important concept and it was an important concept <e> <s> as the noble lord rightly said it ended up on the statute book <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord john-mackie raised this matter in his speech on second reading <e> <s> in the amendment he is asking for a power to exempt the smaller producer who is slaughtering on the farm and my noble friend lord gisborough and i think by implication the noble lord lord somers would support the noble lord in the amendment <e> <s> i believe that the power that is sought is already available <e> <s> by that i mean that i think that in the clause there is wording which means that when the regulations are made it will be perfectly possible for the smaller farmer to be exempted <e> <s> of course it would be necessary to face the problem of how exactly to define the smaller producer and the noble lord lord somers has made a suggestion in that regard that we should like to look at <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble lord lord houghton says this because it is important to take that point on board <e> <s> in saying that one of the things to be taken into account in making the regulations was the number of birds being dealt with i was in no way seeking to cast any reflection upon the standards of the very large-scale slaughterers <e> <s> i was addressing myself entirely to the point that the noble lord lord john-mackie made to which the noble lord lord houghton has also drawn attention <e> <s> it was that which i was saying on behalf of the government would need to be considered along with a whole lot of other matters when the regulations are made <e> <s> i believe that there is power in the clause to be able to do so <e> <s> i feel rather shamefaced in having to put it like that and not being absolutely certain <e> <s> but shortly before the bill came on to the floor of the house i and those advising me felt that we were not absolutely certain in giving a complete undertaking to the noble lord <e> <s> that is why i have spoken in this way <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord lord somers i think that the noble lord lord houghton <e>", "<cs> the effect of amendment no <e> <s> to which the noble lord lord houghton was speaking as well as moving amendment no <e> <s> is to put into this bill different items which would form part of the code of practice for which the bill is providing in general terms a code of practice for the practical application of the legislative provisions for the welfare of poultry both before and up to the moment of slaughter <e> <s> i think i can allay lord houghtons apprehensions when i say straight away that all the points the noble lord has listed in his schedule in amendment no <e> <s> are so we intend to be covered in a code of practice <e> <s> all of those points in amendment no <e> <s> are listed in the governments response to the farm animal welfare councils report as being suitable for inclusion in the code <e>", "<cs> i fully appreciate why the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby wishes to make this amendment <e> <s> i think all of us in the committee this evening feel that he is rightly concerned about the condition of birds which may spend long periods in a lorry outside the slaughterhouse before they are unloaded for slaughter <e>", "<cs> this may be one of the options which is being considered at present <e> <s> the difficulty one has to contend with is in trying to make absolutely certain that what is not done is to find that when a lorry arrives at its destination the time limit has run out and the operator may say to the driver i am going to break the law if you are allowed to be unloaded and therefore turn the vehicle away <e> <s> that is one of the greatest difficulties <e> <s> but i repeat my assurance to the noble lord lord houghton <e> <s> we have received some alternative revised suggestions from the farm animal welfare council and i assure the committee that those and other considerations are under active deliberation at present <e>", "<cs> first i should like to make it perfectly clear to the noble lord lord airedale that the government most certainly will make arrangements for the distribution of codes of practice issued under this clause <e> <s> however the noble lords amendment would appear also to oblige the government to put copies on sale and we would not wish to be contrained to do so since in the interests of <e>", "<cs> i admit that what the noble lord has said is not particularly complicated and i do not know that i need to go away to think about it for too long <e> <s> but it is the noble lords amendment and not the governments and if i think about it a little perhaps the noble lord would think about it a little too and perhaps we shall come to an arrangement at the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> the effect of the noble lords amendment would be to provide that the price which would be charged when a price is to be charged for the distribution of codes of practice must be reasonable <e> <s> the noble lord lord houghton in the final words he addressed to the committee a little earlier this afternoon they were characteristically generous and i was most grateful to him came close to saying i think that ministers at any rate sometimes are not unreasonable <e> <s> i would say that those of us who serve in governments are always reasonable not because i have an inflated idea of what those of us who work in governments are like but because the advice i have received is that it is the case that all ministers decisions are subject to judicial review and a test of reasonableness <e>", "<cs> the noble lord on second reading made the point that he was a little concerned about the level of fees and the effect of this amendment would be to require an estimate of these fees to be provided to an applicant <e> <s> i think that i can give the noble lord the assurance which he wants although i do not think it is necessary if i may say so to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> here again the noble lord lord john-mackie raised this matter on second reading and if the committee will forgive me i shall spend a moment or two in replying because it is important and i should like to get on the record what the situation is as people are concerned <e> <s> the noble lord is quite right people want to know exactly where they stand and the noble lord himself will wish to hear the explanation <e>", "<cs> may i make the point that in the sort of case which the noble lord lord john-mackie is speaking about and he knows about such cases from personal experience the answer is surely for the farmer who is doing on-farm mixing to become registered <e> <s> that is open to him as i endeavoured to make clear in my remarks <e>", "<cs> i ought to take away this point and have a look at it <e> <s> my noble friend has made what seems to be a formidable case that the drafting could be clarified an objective which we all want to achieve <e> <s> on a manuscript amendment i do not believe that i ought to say anything from the governments point of view which might change the drafting <e> <s> if my noble friend feels that it is reasonable for me to take the amendment away in a constructive spirit i shall be very happy to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords for the reception that they have given to this statement <e> <s> it is i think important if i may follow what the noble lord lord john-mackie said about agreement being reached early in which was perhaps not so difficult having reached the previous agreement so late in <e> <s> it is nonetheless important that we have got agreement early in the year to which the agreement relates so far as marketing arrangements are concerned <e> <s> it is incidentally the second council in a row that can be called successful <e> <s> this is to the credit i believe of my right honourable friend the previous minister to whom the noble lord referred as well as my right honourable friend on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first question of the noble lord lord ross of marnock is that in respect of cod west of scotland the united kingdom quota is to be tonnes <e> <s> that is about half way between the commisssions proposals as they were first put forward and the figures <e> <s> for cod west of greenland which is of interest as the noble lord knows better than i to distant water vessels only the quota is tonnes <e> <s> that is the same figure as <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first answer my noble friends criticisms or doubts about the adequacy of the policing arrangements <e> <s> i really think that we shall have to see how they go <e> <s> the government will very much bear in mind the remarks which my noble friend has made <e> <s> so far as concerns policing arrangements as they relate particularly to the south-west i would only add that i am glad to have noticed from the activities in the council that the fishermen in the south-west and indeed it is fair to say the welsh fishermen too should benefit from the improvements to the commissions proposals which have been made as regards the total allowable catches for sole and plaice <e>", "<cs> my lords the exchange on st december is indelibly etched upon my mind <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords the letter was from my honourable friend to the deputy chairman of the national consumer council <e> <s> it would be a matter for him to decide whether he could make it public <e> <s> i will most certainly ask him if this is possible <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i might just reply to that point which is the one point i have not replied to <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord lord walston uncharacteristically is being wholly fair in this matter <e> <s> what i am saying is that on the one hand there are not many cases where the arbitrator has to look a long way forward <e> <s> therefore in the context of the three-year period for every rent review i do not think the problem is a very great one <e> <s> but on the other hand if i accepted my noble friends amendment we would be requiring the arbitrator in every case always to have to look some period of time ahead in order to conjecture what the rent ought to be instead of being able to say what it ought to be at the time the arbitrator is doing his work <e>", "<cs> my lords i have discussed with the noble lord lord john-mackie and through the noble lord lord mackie of benshie the noble lords lord hooson and lord walston the desirability of doing just that <e> <s> i understand that all noble lords are agreed except that amendment no <e> <s> falls outside in the sense that it is not an amendment to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> but for the governments part i should be only too pleased to discuss amendment no <e> <s> at the same time also <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take it then that we are agreed that i am moving on behalf of the government amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i ought now to move amendment no <e> <s> and speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and with it <e> <s> it seems to be generally agreed by noble lords that they will be speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> to which are of course amendments to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i think i must leave it to my noble friend lord renton to allude to amendment no <e> <s> if he and my other noble friend wish to do so and i shall not stop them <e>", "<cs> my lords i was once told that in religious matters we do well to follow the same sort of precautions that we would if we had a box of fireworks in our hands which we were about to let off look carefully at the label which says that you are strongly advised to follow the makers instructions <e> <s> i wish that i could affix to amendment no <e> <s> just such a label which reads there are the instructions <e> <s> i ask you to follow them <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i must apologise to the noble lord that i did not reply to his point on amendment no <e> <s> b which was put down on the list at a late stage <e> <s> i do not cavil at that of course but i do apologise <e> <s> my understanding is that my amendment no <e> <s> would cover the point which the noble lord is making <e> <s> if he feels on reconsideration that this is not so i most certainly say that we could and should return to the point but for the moment i believe that amendment no <e> <s> covers the point <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of this amendment is to require that any discount for appreciable scarcity under subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is more or less yes <e> <s> i have been advised that we need to look at the wording of this amendment <e> <s> i agree with what my noble friend is trying to do <e> <s> if my noble friend will accept from me that i undertake to bring forward an appropriate amendment to cover the point on third reading or at least to discuss it with him so that perhaps he can bring forward such an amendment perhaps he would agree to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise if i have misled the noble lord <e> <s> i have also taken advice since i said that and to be absolutely frank i have been told that i was wrong <e> <s> i have a short speaking note here but if the noble lord would prefer to discuss this matter outside the chamber with a view to returning to the point possibly on third reading that would be the way to go ahead <e> <s> of course i agree to the noble lords suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has explained that due to a slip between my noble friends pen and the marshalled list the reference to line ought to be to line <e> <s> this is a pity i agree because my noble friend and indeed those whose advice he has been taking in the agricultural law association are on to a series of detailed but important points <e> <s> before we take any further amendments which have come from the advice of the agricultural law association through my noble friend i should like to say that the government are indebted to them for the detailed work they have done on the bill and to my noble friend for the detailed interest he has taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for proposing this change <e> <s> as i promised during committee stage we have considered the proposal put forward then by my noble friend and it is really a single proposal of course although it needs two amendments <e> <s> this amendment is a modification of what my noble friend was saying at that time <e> <s> it has however been necessary to iron out certain difficulties which were raised by some organisations who were looking at the amendment and who were i think entirely sympathetic to it but i am glad to say that this has now been done although only in the past few days <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with interest to the argument put forward by my noble friend but i feel that i must resist his amendment for the following reasons <e> <s> after succession to new tenancies is excluded by clause a situation could arise in which the grant of a new tenancy is voluntarily offered by a landlord in circumstances similar to those discribed in section <e> <s> your lordships will remember that section of the act is the provision for retirement counting for succession <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can say very much more than has been said on this point in the last quarter of an hour <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend lord renton characteristically had what should have been the last word when he said that clause stands by itself and standing by itself it does not look too good and it ought to fall <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that this proposal would have the effect of continuing the three-generation succession about which the noble lord lord northbourne has just spoken in a very personal way and it would have that effect for all tenancies including new ones <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord let me get to my next full stop <e> <s> it must go to the hearts of both noble lords because their hearts are so much in the right place <e> <s> but my goodness me seven months ago what did the labour party do <e> <s> they said as part of their election manifesto that they would remove all those ctt reliefs <e> <s> i do not think you will find if that sort of manifesto undertaking were carried through and certainly if the move to leave out clause were carried through that there would be such a rosy picture painted of the number of lettings in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords both the points which the noble lord has raised show that i was being relevant and i will now immediately explain why <e> <s> both noble lords talked about statistics but i ventured to put to the committee of your lordships house that there had if one was talking about the total area of the tenanted sector been an accelerated decline in tenancies following the enactment of the legislation <e> <s> that led to a certain amount of debate across the floor as to whether those statistics were valid because one ought to talk not about area but about individual tenancies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to noble lords <e> <s> if i may reply to my noble friend lord sandys about applications when we get to amendment no <e> <s> i would prefer to do that if i may and i shall not say any more about these amendments <e> <s> i wish that we could have brought forward the full battery of eligibility amendments <e> <s> i think however that when we come as we shall soon to amendment no <e> <s> which is linked to amendment no <e> <s> on retirement an amendment that extends to nine pages of the marshalled list it will be clear that that is the reason as the noble lord lord northfield saw and so generously said why those who have been involved on the bill have been up to their eyes in work <e> <s> we shall continue to press ahead on this difficult area of eligibility <e> <s> we believe that we can find our way through it <e> <s> if we do then as i understand the sense of your lordships replies this evening we shall have a new commercial unit test which is acceptable which i <e>", "<cs> my lords the suggestion which came from my noble friend lord dilhorne worried the noble lord lord john-mackie <e> <s> i think it would also worry the government because it would come very near to compulsory retirement <e> <s> that is also what the noble lord lord walston was saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the point made by my noble friend lord renton and once again i welcome the search for clarity in this legislation <e> <s> but with respect to my noble friend and those who advised him on this i think that this is unnnecessary for these reasons <e> <s> where bad husbandry is established the new subsection specifically provides for a period of notice of not less than two months to terminate the tenancy <e> <s> this means any period of two months and if i may say so it entirely displaces the provisions previously applicable in section of the act which talks about months from the end of the then current year of tenancy <e> <s> it is not just the case of substituting two months for months in the words just quoted <e>", "<cs> my lords while i recognise from the speech of the noble lord lord northfield that my noble friend lord ridley in whose name this amendment is down has moved nearer to the recommendations in the northfield report i remain to be convinced that the amendment will achieve my <e>", "<cs> my lords this matter was raised in committee by my noble friends lord sandford and lord ridley and the noble lord lord gibson and it is because it was proposed and spoken to by those noble lords that i very much welcomed the <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord monk bretton has moved an amendment the effect of which would be to provide for compulsory retirement at <e> <s> we discussed about an hour ago amendment no <e> <s> which was moved because it was a paving amendment for amendment no <e> <s> which is the new schedule which runs to nine pages on the marshalled list and provides for voluntary retirement in the case of existing tenancies by making it easier for an eligible and suitable successor to take over earlier than on death <e> <s> i believe particularly because it has got the voluntary agreement of the organisations concerned the nfu and the cla for this to be done this may prove to be a really effective provision <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has worked extremely hard on not only this amendment but a great many other aspects of the bill and i am sorry that i am not helpful more frequently although i have had the pleasure on the government front bench of accepting some of my noble friends amendments <e> <s> i say this because in this case again there is a sticking point and the problem is this <e>", "<cs> my lords i do have sympathy genuinely with the noble lord lord northfield in his moving of this amendment not only with the noble lord having to do so at this hour again two months after he did so before but also with the objective <e> <s> this amendment is in line with the basic objective of the government in bringing this bill before parliament which is to try to create more tenancies <e>", "<cs> the answer to my noble friends final question and indeed the general thrust of his argument is that as presently worded section of the act does not specifically prohibit the tenant during the proceedings before the tribunal ranging over the whole matter of the work he has been required to do even though he will already have had the opportunity to raise questions as to the justification for the notice to do work at the earlier stage of arbitration on the notice to do work itself <e> <s> it was not the intention of the original provision that the tenant should have a second chance to raise matters of this kind <e> <s> i really do not think it reasonable that it should be possible to go over the ground all over again <e> <s> clause therefore makes it clear that for the purposes of section the tribunal is only concerned with the tenants failure to comply with the notice to do work and whether in the light of such a failure a fair and reasonable landlord would insist on possession <e>", "<cs> my lords i really think that the appointment of arbitrators is a matter which ought to fall to the agricultural and land-owning industry to carry out itself <e> <s> i feel that even more strongly after listening to the very telling points put by my noble friend lord caithness <e> <s> i immediately concede that there is a function for government here and that is to ensure that those who are appointed to such very important work are entirely suitable as arbitrators <e> <s> as my noble friend said this safeguard is provided by my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor who maintains the standing panel of arbitrators from which individual appointments are made <e> <s> i give the assurance that the lord chancellors standing panel will continue to be maintained in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords it is right to consider with the very greatest care the implications of this proposal and how in practice it would work out <e> <s> i realise that my noble friend did just that before bringing the amendment before your lordships house <e> <s> i therefore hope that my noble friend will forgive me if i say that a practical objection is that the new clause would require the minister to satisfy himself possibly for years ahead that the land which is to be let under this sort of fixed-term tenancy will or may be required by the owner to farm on his own account or by a member of his family <e>", "<cs> my lords both the noble lord lord john-mackie and the noble lord lord gladwyn are correct in saying that it is the governments prime objective or one of their prime objectives that the growth in agricultural guarantee spending should be markedly less than that of own resources <e> <s> it is on that vital point that agreement was not reached at this last agricultural ministers meeting <e> <s> when the noble lord lord gladwyn asks what are the next steps <e> <s> the answer is that negotiations on cap reform are now proceeding in the context of the commissions proposal for agricultural prices for <e> <s> we shall have to come to these matters again in the agricultural council and see if we can make better progress <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> all i would add is that as i understand it the procedures for applications will be exactly the same as they have been previously <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the fishing vessels financial assistance scheme be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his reception of this order <e> <s> i am also grateful to him for giving me notice of the questions he intended to ask <e> <s> the noble lord first asked me about whether any provision was made for redundancy payments for the crews of boats which are decommissioned or laid up <e> <s> there is no provision for community finance under the common fisheries policy package for payments to men who are laid off <e> <s> therefore if this was to be provided for it would have to be a purely national measure <e> <s> i am aware that this is a point which concerned honourable and right honourable members of another place when the order was debated recently <e> <s> i should like to draw to the attention of my right honourable friend the fact that the noble lord lord john-mackie has repeated the point this evening <e> <s> i ought to add to that that i am really talking here about decommissioning <e> <s> i think that so far as laying up is concerned that is a slightly different matter and ought to be a matter i should have thought which would be a subject of the contract between the owner and the crews because laying up could be for a comparatively temporary time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that here again i ought to draw it to the attention of my right honourable friend that the noble lord has said that <e> <s> that is supposed to be of course the feoga reimbursement for these grants and would not be supposed to be for that particular purpose <e> <s> i do not think i can go any further on this point this evening except to acknowledge that it is a point which has troubled members of another place and that clearly is of concern to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i recognise the point made by the noble lord lord northfield <e> <s> i have <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for what noble lords have said <e> <s> i should like to look at what my noble friend lord sandys said and if necessary write to him <e> <s> i think that the wording at the top of page of the marshalled list making clear that we are talking about separate applications which shall then be dealt with in the way set out in the rest of the schedule answers my noble friend <e> <s> i must admit however that i am not sure <e> <s> it is certainly the intention that the applications shall be dealt with separately <e> <s> it is certainly the procedure that they shall be dealt with in the way that i have explained <e> <s> if i feel that i should add to that i do not think that my explanation has been quite as satisfactory as it ought to be may i write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is on to an important point which is that surplus allotment land should be able to be let temporarily and easily <e> <s> all members of the house will know of the value of allotments and the difficulties which occasionally can be encountered if one has problems in letting allotment land <e> <s> there is nothing more depressing than to see allotments falling into disuse which ought to be used productively and giving pleasure to those who should be tilling them <e> <s> therefore my noble friend has plenty of sympathy coming from both me and from the ministry at which i work <e> <s> from looking at what my noble friend has written to me and also said in the house we have brought in new procedures for section approvals which i hope my noble friend will feel will make his amendment unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the second question first we are of course talking about section tenancies under the act which exist now <e> <s> i would make two brief points to my noble friend <e> <s> first when we originally introduced this bill i made the point on behalf of the government that we intended to lengthen the period of time of section tenancies to five years particularly for two cases which we thought specially deserving <e> <s> one is where there are trial tenancies for prospective tenants and the other is where the son or daughter of a landowner will come back and wants to take the tenancy up at a later stage <e> <s> but i have also gone out of my way on the previous amendment to say to my noble friend lord mottistone that i believe that section tenancies will be suitable so far as his case for smallholdings is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to have to disagree with my noble friend on this because on so many aspects of this bill we are in agreement <e> <s> basically rent arbitrations on succession under the act have always been treated the same as rent arbitrations for sitting tenants <e> <s> my noble friend of course is quite right in saying that basis was the open market rent but now that we are changing the rent formula from open market to the prudent and willing landlord and tenant formula together with all relevant factors the four particularly relevant factors and the consideration of comparables which are all in the rent formula now in clause we really do have in order to be consistent to deal with rent arbitrations for sitting tenants in the same way as the rent arbitrations now to be set out in clause <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords <e> <s> but i find it a little difficult to follow my noble friend on this amendment because the statutory instrument which my noble friend talks about giving the lord chancellor the enabling power to make certain provisions has so far as i know been acted upon by my noble and learned friend and by my noble and learned friends predecessors with one exception and one only that is the power relating to sub-tenants <e> <s> therefore unless my noble friend has a particular point which is worrying him about sub-tenants i think that the lord chancellor has all the power that he needs and has in fact used it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can answer all my noble friends questions and i must apologise to him for the fact that he may have bowled me out <e> <s> however as to his question concerning whether the second brother can apply on death the <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the government i would simply respond to my noble friend on these three amendments by saying that as he knows the government very much welcome these amendments which complete the package of amendments which he started together with his noble friends by moving amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords schedule of the agriculture act gives power to the agricultural land tribunal to direct a landlord to provide or repair fixed equipment needed by a tenant to carry out an agricultural activity so that he can comply with relevant statutory requirements <e> <s> the proviso to section restricts this power when the activity in question has not been carried out on the holding <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am afraid that i do not have those statistics but the point i am trying to underline is that the local authority bye-laws are the law of the land <e> <s> they can be and indeed are and should be <e>", "<cs> no my lords not at the moment <e> <s> i have listened for a very long period of time and i am now going to make my speech <e> <s> in answer to my noble friend the point which i am trying to underline is that the local authority bye-laws are the law of the land <e> <s> they are enforceable of course in the magistrates courts <e> <s> i know that my noble friend will accept from me that with the possibility indeed the probability of a maximum fine which would be for each offence is i believe a realistic penalty <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right and i am glad he is underlining that it is highly desirable for district councils to adopt these very sensible proposals <e> <s> may i move on and say that the bye-laws are complemented by the code of practice which the nfu believes should also be strengthened in terms of both its content and tone <e> <s> we support the nfu in this <e> <s> i may say that it has taken a highly responsible and very firm attitude throughout this whole business <e> <s> the ministry and other bodies on the nfus working party are assisting in a revision of the code which is already in hand <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great care to the case put forward by my noble friend lord stanley and indeed by the noble lord lord bishopston for this amendment <e> <s> i really am worried about the effects that this amendment might have <e> <s> i certainly understand that it is only equitable that changes in profitability ought to be reflected in rents which are decided and i am most anxious to show my noble friend and the noble lord opposite that there is nothing between the government and noble lords as regards the intention of the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may add one last thing <e> <s> of course we shall continue to look carefully at this <e> <s> i give my noble friend that assurance <e> <s> i have tried to be open with the house during the various stages of this fairly short but quite complicated bill and i say quite openly to your lordships that when christmas was over we took the bill away and one of the things we looked at was whether it was possible to have in the text profitability on the one hand and earning capacity which was the way that my noble friend lord caithness had raised it in the month of december on the other <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the great pleasures of dealing with this bill has been the kindness of your lordships and how nice to receive the enthusiastic support at this late stage of my noble friend lord thorneycroft <e> <s> the noble lord lord northfield has explained the objective of this amendment and the noble lord has discussed it with me outside your lordships house <e> <s> i would say in passing if i may that i think it could be that it is defective in drafting <e> <s> i do not say that to be difficult but i say it because i think that when one looks at the amendment it is not entirely clear which holding is being referred to so far as the drafting is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords we have laboured hard and long over this rent formula and i thought that on report your lordships decided we had got it about as good as we could with the very great help of an original amendment put down in committee by noble lords who included my noble friend lord kinnoull <e> <s> if an amendment were put forward on which your lordships house was substantially agreed and i think that the area of disagreement on this very interesting amendment is more evident than the area of agreement then the house would need to look very closely at it again <e> <s> if an amendment were put down which could he said to represent some great advance i know that the house would immediately look at it again very closely <e>", "<cs> my lords i have very great pleasure in accepting this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank both noble lords for what they have said <e> <s> may i also thank my noble friend lord caithness who handled the amendment we have just taken i think from my noble friend lord renton at the previous stage <e> <s> all i would add is yes i have detected one or two criticisms of the rent formula in clause <e> <s> that is why i am particularly grateful to my noble friend lord middleton for putting the matter in context <e> <s> i believe as my noble friend has been good enough to say that it represents a real step forward <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendments which the noble lord lord northfield is moving are in the name of my noble friend lord ridley <e> <s> i have great pleasure in accepting the amendment and shall accept also those to which the noble lord lord northfield has spoken when we come to them <e>", "<cs> my lords first i would just say that the age of was agreed after a lot of discussion within the industry and with an eye to the recommendations of the committee of the noble lord lord northfield which in paragraph chose as the appropriate age at which a transfer of this kind should take place <e> <s> we are of course talking about voluntary retirement <e> <s> no element of compulsion is involved <e> <s> so far as the existing machinery is concerned a tenant may approach his landlord with a proposal to retire at any time under section of the act <e> <s> that existing machinery remains unaffected <e>", "<cs> my lords i honestly do not know the answer to the question which the noble lord lord northfield has just asked about assignment <e> <s> i rather think that the answer is no <e> <s> one wants to rest upon the amendments which we have put forward in the enormously long amendment dealing with voluntary retirement to which of course this particular amendment is aimed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly i should like to thank your lordships for your words on the conclusion of this bill <e> <s> i acknowledge the value of the experience which your lordships house has to give to a bill of this kind <e> <s> perhaps it is best exemplified by the fact that at one moment during the lengthy debates of the house on this bill i counted no fewer than eight former ministers of agriculture in the house <e> <s> of course throughout the whole of the proceedings we have had the benefit of the advice of the noble lord lord northfield whose report has been so important to this matter over the past few years but in particular to the proceedings in your lordships house <e> <s> the government front bench count themselves fortunate to have the noble lords lord john-mackie lord bishopston and lord prys-davies opposing because the opposition is always tough but it is always self-evidently fair <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand entirely the concern of the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> the noble lord raised the matter at second reading <e> <s> however i understood that on that occasion his remarks were directed to the concern which he felt about fires in intensive poultry units <e> <s> that is i believe what the noble lord was mainly concerned about on second reading and i share his concern <e> <s> there is indeed a distinction between premises where poultry are reared and premises where poultry are slaughtered <e> <s> so far as intensive units where poultry are being reared are concerned the present welfare code for poultry makes recommendations designed to reduce the risk of injury to birds in fires and the farm animal welfare council has put forward proposals for amending the code in order considerably to strengthen it <e> <s> the government are currently considering the amendments which the farm animal welfare council has proposed <e> <s> we fully share the view of the farm animal welfare council about the need to strengthen the code in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord houghton criticises the wording in this part of the bill because the effect is to give a power of withdrawal of a code <e> <s> but of course withdrawal may sometimes be necessary when a code is to he revised and we should not normally withdraw a code without putting anything in its place <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what the noble lord lord houghton said and also to the remarks of the noble lord lord john-mackie <e> <s> i can perhaps steer a course down the middle which i seem to have spent most of this afternoon doing with some success <e> <s> i shall try to do it again <e> <s> may i first give an assurance to the noble lord that we are indeed considering very carefully how best we might respond to the farm animal welfare council recommendation no <e> <s> <e> <s> i can go further and say that we most certainly intend to table an amendment <e> <s> the drafting of the amendment is not really a simple matter <e> <s> as has become evident already from the discussion there are different points of view <e> <s> we feel that we must take account of the situation in the large number of poultry slaughterhouses that are not required to be licensed under the poultry meat hygiene regulations and do not therefore have supervision at the moment by an official veterinary surgeon <e>", "<cs> my lords as a matter of principle the government believe that powers of entry should be granted only to officers acting on behalf of central or local government <e> <s> naturally we welcome the cooperation and advice of the voluntary bodies which are active in the field of animal welfare including of course the royal society for the prevention of cruelty <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather think that that is precisely the procedure <e> <s> the noble lord is right <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to the brief argument which the noble lord lord houghton has put forward <e> <s> i am convinced by his argument and i have much pleasure in accepting the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that if we are to have a debate it should be on the motion that the bill do now pass <e> <s> will that be suitable to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords who have responded to the motion that this bill do now pass and who have contributed to the debates we have had on the bill <e> <s> when the bill was introduced it was a good bill but due to the very hard work which the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby the noble lord lord john-mackie and other noble lords have done on it we have made it even better <e> <s> i am always full of admiration for the way in which the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby is able to talk about enormously interesting subjects which do not necessarily always fall within the scope of the legislation which is being discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture fisheries and food <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank both noble lords for their response to my right honourable friends statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord john-mackie expressed the very strong hope that it would be possible to get agreement on the price fixing from the point of view of farmers knowing where they stand for the forthcoming year <e> <s> the government most certainly agree with the noble lord in that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that my noble friend lord de la warr has underlined the enormous importance of the agricultural industry to this country <e> <s> in the last decade it has saved this country literally millions of pounds in foreign exchange and it will be a bad day when this country ceases to recognise the importance of british agriculture <e> <s> i say that because my right honourable friend the prime minister was very ready to recognise the importance of the agricultural industry in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will repeat the answer which is being given to a private notice question in another place on the recent outbreaks of fowl pest <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for responding to the answer to the <e>", "<cs> my lords paramyxo virus has been found in pigeons <e> <s> the noble baroness will remember the cases reported involving racing pigeons <e> <s> but it was a different strain of the disease <e> <s> it was not the same as the strain which has now broken out among poultry <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i must write to my noble friend lord glenkinglas on that particular point <e> <s> but as he will very well know we have been extremely anxious about the importation of the disease from europe <e> <s> it was as a result of that that we imposed controls <e> <s> there was a case and our import controls were established in november following a judgment in the european court <e> <s> so the answer to my noble friend is yes indeed the disease is to be found <e> <s> with regard to exactly how prevalent it is i think that i must write to my noble friend to let him know <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the noble lords point on vaccination i think that i can only repeat what i said <e> <s> obviously vaccination is an option it is an option which is followed in other countries <e> <s> but we have now been free of the disease for six years and we shall maintain the slaughter policy if it is at all possible <e> <s> with regard to the possibility of extending the scheme to cover consequential loss the noble lord lord cledwyn made clear that he is of course aware of the way in which the present scheme works <e> <s> it is a government scheme to begin with but then there is repayment to the government through the british poultry health improvement scheme which is an insurance scheme <e> <s> certainly i shall draw my right honourable friends attention to the suggestion which the noble lord has made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed aware of what my noble friend has said and i am grateful to him for his intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the numbers of birds affected there are about layers and growers in the shropshire area and broilers in the thirsk outbreak <e>", "<cs> my lords it is basically a respiratory disease <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for her very friendly supplementary question <e> <s> i hope it will be good news to my noble friend that the vat leaflets have won plain english awards so i am advised in two of the last three years and that as i am also advised the new inland revenue income tax return has become simpler and less forbidding as a result of the reviews which have been going on <e> <s> yes i can reply to my noble friends other point <e> <s> i do not know about the trend being accelerated but we shall certainly press on <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord that does not mean -odd too many <e> <s> this <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer the noble lords question in the way that he put it <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that more small businesses started up than went out of business between and <e>", "<cs> my lords if we are going to talk about the legacy of the previous government i will admit to the house quite openly and frankly that there were very great difficulties in this country in <e> <s> but i have to repeat to the house that between and there was a net increase in the number of small businesses <e>", "<cs> my lords there are currently no major aspects of the common fisheries policy awaiting agreement in the council of ministers <e> <s> the operation of the policy is however a continuing process and there will no doubt be further matters for decision at future meetings <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> in her supplementary question my noble friend mentioned a percentage <e> <s> i think that the percentage is taken from the agreement that was struck when my right honourable friend the previous minister of agriculture was in office <e> <s> my right honourable friend the minister was of course negotiating on behalf of the united kingdom at the recent meeting <e> <s> i think it is fair to say that the effects of my noble friends words have been continued in that latest agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as enforcement is concerned the united kingdom was instrumental in the setting up of the inspectorate <e> <s> it is fair to make that claim <e> <s> my right honourable friend the minister has been pressing for the early introduction of log books <e> <s> once these two key areas are fully operational and i have to say to the noble lord quite openly that they are not we expect the standards of enforcement within the community to be very greatly improved <e> <s> may i say that the government and the opposition agree on this <e> <s> let us get on with it as quickly as possible <e> <s> we shall continue to press for it <e> <s> the closing of the south-west box is a conservation and management matter which we believe is desirable <e> <s> the south-west box was closed at midnight on th march <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that this is the latest date at which it has been closed during the last five years <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not in any way disagree with what the noble lord said in the second part of his supplementary question <e> <s> as to the first part i know that scottish ministers my right honourable friend and previous ministers will be extremely grateful to the noble lord with his enormous experience of this subject for the words he has spoken <e> <s> but the point is not what redounds to political parties and politicians but what is beneficial for peoples livelihoods <e> <s> there is no question but that the agreement of last year and the new agreement which was hammered out only five or six weeks ago are for the future good of the fishing industry in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords most of the inspectors are now in post <e> <s> it is hoped that log books and landing returns will come into force this summer <e> <s> when pressed by my right honourable friend at the last council of fisheries ministers on st january the european commission could not give an exact date for this but i can say to the noble lord lord cledwyn that the text and format for log books and landing returns have been completed and are now going out to tender for printing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord john-mackie and lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> the noble lord lord john-mackie asked whether plus per cent <e> <s> as the basis for deciding how the quota was to be shared out between member states was not unfair <e> <s> may i say in reply that there are obviously other ways of dividing up the quantity but i think i ought to say that it has been worked out by us that all would have given the united kingdom a proportion which would have come to approximately per cent <e> <s> which is in fact what we are going to get from the formula of plus per cent <e> <s> the noble lord lord mackie of benshie answered the question put by the noble lord lord john-mackie which is what is the meaning of the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my answer to that must be that i think it is irritating <e> <s> but it is important in this particular case for very large numbers of our farming community and it is necessary for the procedure of your lordships house <e> <s> with apologies for having taken up rather a lot of time may i suggest that perhaps we move on to the next business and some very important speeches <e>", "<cs> my lords i will draw the suggestion of the noble lord lord jacques to the attention of my right honourable friend the chief whip <e>", "<cs> my lords i well understand the concern of the noble lord <e> <s> lord hunt <e> <s> but if i may say so i do not think that the noble lord sufficiently recognises all that is being done and <e> <s> i agree needs to be done and has to be done <e> <s> for example the notification arrangements for grant applications in national parks and sssis anticipated the wildlife and countryside act then the act built safeguards upon that and i believe that those safeguards are having an effect <e> <s> the noble lord in his second and third questions asked me about the structures proposals in the european community <e> <s> those proposals are still under consideration <e> <s> i should like to make crystal clear my attitude on behalf of the ministry of agriculture to these proposals in answer to the noble lords last question <e> <s> the proposals certainly contain more references to conservation than in the past and i am absolutely delighted that that is so <e> <s> we shall certainly continue to work to this end in the negotiations which are still taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords on st december last year we increased grants to per cent in the less favoured areas for wall hedges fences and tree shelter belts we ended the very last vestiges of grant-aid for hedge removal and we also ended grants for land reclamation in the lowlands and that was at a time when we were having to cut million off capital grants <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the last question asked by the noble baroness the position is as i gave it just now in answer to the noble lord lord hunt <e> <s> so far as the report of the chief scientist of the nature conservancy council is concerned of course i take very seriously what the ncc says because it is the governments adviser on conservation matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the best answer to my noble friend lord gisborough is that i am happy to be able to report to the house today that i understand that there are now branches of the farming and wildlife advisory groups in every single county in england and wales and <e> <s> i believe in scotland also <e> <s> i am not making a slighting reference to matters north of the border it is just that that part of the country is not my right honourable friends responsibility and i am not quite so sure of my ground on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lord is that nobody knows how much money will be spent under the structures proposals because the negotiations are still continuing <e> <s> but in case we forget what i endeavoured to say to the house earlier let me point out again that there are more references to conservation in the structures proposals as they are presently being negotiated then there have been in the past <e> <s> on behalf of the government i am delighted about that and we are certainly going to work to that end <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think that it is happening <e> <s> there are indeed many cases where management agreements have been accepted by the farmers concerned at lower levels of compensation than the full loss of profit and it is right that i ought <e>", "<cs> my lords harmonious integration is possible provided it is clear what the structures proposals are supposed to do <e> <s> it is accepted by all the member states of the community that those proposals are supposed to give help where it is needed to agriculture <e> <s> i repeat there are stronger references this time round to conservation than there have ever been previously <e> <s> i give an assurance to the noble lord lord hunt that this is most acceptable to the government and we will try our very hardest to ensure that those references firmly remain in the proposals <e>", "<cs> that is in precise contradiction to what i said so i do not agree with the noble lord lord hooson <e>", "<cs> the home office is sending out a circular letter at the same time as the publication of the by-laws explaining in great detail the effect of the by-laws which have been discussed with the local authority associations <e> <s> the remarks and observations of the local authority associations and indeed the environmental and farming interests have all been taken into account and now the final draft of the bylaws is being sent out <e> <s> a circular letter is being sent out by the home office drawing to the attention of the local authorities all the details and expressing the firm hope that they will incorporate these new model bylaws into their own by-laws <e>", "<cs> i do because the one area of agreement which i have with my noble friend lord alport in producing this bill is that the government believe something needs to be done <e>", "<cs> and it is for that reason that as my noble friend lord caithness was good enough to say the new model by-laws are very strict <e> <s> we have <e>", "<cs> i hope that noble lords will forgive me and i promise i will not intervene again on this first amendment <e> <s> i hope the noble earl lord erroll will forgive me <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord houghton does not think i have been discourteous <e> <s> we have been involved in many debates in the past and he always treats me with great courtesy and i try to do so in return <e>", "<cs> no i do not agree with my noble friend on that point <e>", "<cs> rather paradoxically though it is not my bill and i am replying to amendments which are not my amendments perhaps with the leave of my noble friend i may say a word in reply to the noble lord lord henderson and my noble friend lord ironside and confine my remarks entirely to the two subsequent amendments <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord alport has referred to my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture <e> <s> i think that i should make the point that in announcing the issue of the new by-laws yesterday my right honourable friend said that he believed that the new rules would work and would prevent a recurrence of the problems experienced last summer <e> <s> but my right honourable friend said <e>", "<cs> i hope that noble lords will now decide <e> <s> may i make it clear and i speak with respect to the noble lord lord houghton that the government do not find the suggestion he has made helpful <e> <s> i repeat that we do not believe that we have found all the answers <e> <s> we have a proper humility in these matters <e> <s> my right honourable friend has recognised that we have to look to see how we go and perhaps have to take even stronger measures <e> <s> for the moment with some very strong measures being laid before the farming community and the public generally in the by-laws i think that this particular part of the bill is extremely unhelpful <e> <s> it would not be made any more helpful by the suggestion that has been put forward by the noble lord lord houghton <e> <s> therefore the government are against amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i would agree with the noble earl that it is ironic that bl are getting a quota <e> <s> would say to the noble earl however that bl i am glad to say are doing well out of their quota because this country increased its exports to spain by per cent <e> <s> last year as compared with the year before <e> <s> nonetheless if i may take up the rest of the noble earls question we agree that there is room for spain to make improvements in next years quotas and we shall certainly be making spain aware of our views <e> <s> i did not read the newspaper article but i think that the noble earl has very usefully underlined the need for spain to come into the common market when the tariffs will be harmonised <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the attempt was made in the tokyo round of gatt <e> <s> my advice is that an attempt was made in to do something about the situation but it failed since the other member states of the community were not prepared to make the concessions in the agricultural field which spain demanded as the price for making concessions on industrial tariffs <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords we have a good exchange rate because we have a good government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships are grateful to the noble lord lord plowden for introducing these three reports and to the select committee for their admirable work on the complex problems associated with the operation of the common agricultural policy <e> <s> your lordships will be aware that this years negotiations within the community to agree farm prices have been particularly difficult in view of the fact that spending in the community has now reached the budgetary ceiling <e> <s> indeed at the beginning of his speech the noble lord referred to the need to remove the climate of crisis in which the common agricultural policy is operating at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness lady seear said these reports from the committee chaired by the noble lord lord plowden are timely because they bring the reader face to face with reality although whether some readers will find them any more palatable than the advice which has been given by the political leaders of this country that lasting solutions need to be found to the problems of europe remains still to be seen <e>", "<cs> they are active enough my lords <e> <s> the early warning on dangerous consumer products has been agreed and there is now only one reserve which incidentally is not our reserve on doorstep selling <e> <s> progress is being made in two ways and certainly much work is being done in respect of misleading advertising and product liability <e>", "<cs> my lords the next consumer affairs council will take place in the month of june <e> <s> i am not aware of the exact date but i know that the presidency intends that there will be another council in june <e> <s> that means that there will have been three meetings taking the period from december to june which i think is very desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords the government entirely agree with what the noble lord <e> <s> lord sainsbury has said and we are working towards that end <e>", "<cs> my lords there are exceptions in the draft directive at the moment and i believe that they will set the noble lords mind at rest <e>", "<cs> my lords i am genuinely sorry not to be more helpful to my noble friend because i agree with him that this really is a tragedy <e> <s> but the fact of the matter is that if there were to be import controls they would indeed have to be accompanied by movement controls and that is made clear by my noble friends supplementaries and these would be enormously <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> it is true that there can be per cent <e> <s> mortality <e> <s> on the other hand this is not necessarily the case <e> <s> but where i do agree with my noble friend is that this is very serious and very much to be regretted <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is indeed right section of the wildlife and countryside act makes it an offence to release signal crayfish among other crustaceans or fish and allow them to escape into the wild and no licences for these releases have been issued <e> <s> my understanding is very similar to that of the noble lord about the effects of moving the disease through water <e> <s> however i am not advised that it would come within the scope of the pollution act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested to hear what my noble friend says on this particular matter <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall repeat a statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture <e> <s> fisheries and food <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their reception of this long statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord john-mackie and the noble lord lord walston asked me in their different ways about how the milk situation is going to work out <e> <s> the noble lord on the front bench opposite in particular asked whether there are any plans indeed both noble lords did for reducing the admitted surplus of ten million tonnes which is with us indeed until as both noble lords have interpreted correctly the scheme is looked at after three years and that will be the first moment when the community can make a check on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the right reverend prelate put that question to me even though it is a perennially very difficult one <e> <s> if i may say so the answer is twofold <e> <s> on the one hand there are real reasons to believe that if european food in whatever form and of course as the right reverend prelate so rightly says skimmed milk powder is one of the obvious ways is simply pumped into developing nations eventually so i have always been advised that undermines the agricultural structure or infrastructure of those countries and indeed the will to improve that infrastructure <e> <s> that is why i think the european community nations are hesitant about doing that <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the second of my noble friends questions is that there is a cut in cereal prices in the price fixing <e> <s> i think that it is the first such cut that the community has made <e> <s> with regard to my noble friends first question the statement which i repeated makes it plain that though it is early on in the year and the situation could change my right honourable friend the minister made it clear to the council that in the united kingdoms view the community will need to take the necessary steps to limit expenditure if budgetary problems arise <e> <s> that is a direct warning to the community that we had a reserve on the package the reserve is no longer there because the package has been voted through and her majestys government will be looking with very great care to see whether we feel that what has been agreed in the agriculture council will fit into the final package which of course has to be agreed in another council at a future date <e>", "<cs> my lords i referred to this matter during a debate that we had the other evening and the noble lord lord gladwyn is quite right there is certainly apprehension that even with this package we might be heading for a billion overspend <e> <s> but there are factors which if the noble lord will forgive me i shall not go into now which could well reduce that figure very considerably <e> <s> it is those factors that we are to look at very carefully in the coming months and it is the result of those factors to which we shall draw the attention of our community partners when finally the community has to agree at another council on another occasion whether it is going in the right direction financially <e>", "<cs> my lords no decision was taken to introduce the tax <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can go further than that <e> <s> there was no decision taken to introduce the tax <e> <s> along with the noble baroness i rejoice that that is the case <e>", "<cs> no my lords i think we have already made it clear though i admit to my noble friend that the details are still to be worked out that although the national quotas have been arranged on a basis of the quotas to the individual producers can be arranged on the basis of a year later than in other words or which would suit many producers very much better and which was a time when production in this country was increasing very considerably <e> <s> i hope that that makes the situation clear to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will know the wholesale price is going up by a very small amount <e> <s> i think that that is happening literally now and the retail price is due to go up again by a very small amount in two months time and so far as i know those retail prices will stick <e> <s> incidentally they are the first price rises since <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the beef mountain is concerned the great effect of the variable premium negotiated by the noble lord lord peart which has never been forgotten within the ministry where i work is that this country does not accumulate vast quantities of beef in store <e> <s> that is thanks to the noble lord <e> <s> it is sold and we consume it in this country <e> <s> one of the matters in this difficult package about which i am delighted is that my right honourable friend the minister was able to carry on that good work and preserve the variable premium scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this should be the last question <e> <s> the house has i believe waited long enough for the next debate as i understand it the answer to the noble lord lord john-mackie is this <e> <s> the national quota that we have got is based on what we were producing as a country in <e> <s> that means that it is knocking on for per cent <e> <s> of the total community quota <e> <s> but may i suppose for the moment that my noble friend was producing per cent <e> <s> of that total quota in on his own farm <e> <s> if his allocation was going to be based in that is what my noble friend would be allocated in his quota <e> <s> but let us suppose that in my noble friend enormously increased his production as many farmers in this country did and was producing instead of per cent <e> <s> that is the percentage of the total national quota that my noble friend lord ferrers will <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the general thrust of the noble lords question but the rules are very tight <e> <s> depending on the reason for felling a licence must be issued for trees of a diameter of more than to centimetres <e> <s> the rules are drawn very tightly indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords the forestry commission undertook a census a little while ago and i am glad to say that that showed that the area of broad-leafed woods has not declined since the war although there may have been changes in species <e> <s> so far as replanting for broad leaves is concerned some higher rates of grant are available <e> <s> the noble lord may be interested <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not said that and i do not say it now <e> <s> the noble lord may be interested in the fact that the nature conservancy council is drawing up a list of ancient woodland sites and is to discuss their management with local forestry commission conservancy officers <e> <s> i join in the sentiments of the noble lord by saying that i am very glad that that is being done <e> <s> i think that he has every right to express his concern but i do not go as far as he has asked me to go <e>", "<cs> my lords i know of the noble lords interest <e> <s> i respect it and i agree with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have confidence in the work of the forestry commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their reception of this statutory instrument though i must say that the noble lord lord tryon has asked me some rather searching questions <e> <s> i wonder whether i may first answer the two questions that the noble lord lord john-mackie asked of me <e> <s> the first question the noble lord asked was does the fact that there is a back-up grant as well as the feoga per cent <e> <s> grant mean that there will have to be two approvals <e> <s> the answer to that question is no it is not necessary <e> <s> grant will be paid only in respect of projects that have been approved in advance by the community <e> <s> but when the fish farmer has completed the work he will apply to the appropriate fisheries department for his grants <e> <s> if his application is satisfactory it will be forwarded to the commission for approval of the feoga grant payment and that payment will be made through the fisheries department <e> <s> further as i think i said in my opening remarks the back-up grant will be paid simulta-neously and automatically through the united kingdom authorities <e> <s> therefore there is in fact only one approval involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for being unable to reply to several of the questions which were asked by the noble lord lord tryon <e> <s> but it does so happen that the noble lord lord mackie of benshie who is always very fair in all that he says on this particular occasion has been uncharacteristically rather unfair by picking the particular question to which i had in fact given an answer <e> <s> i had made it quite clear to the house that a joint working group on the avoidance of pollution from fish farms was recently established by the national farmers union and the water industry and both the ministry of agriculture and the department of the environment were represented <e> <s> the group considered guidelines on good husbandry practices for and the safe use of chemicals by fish farmers and standard discharge consent conditions for water authorities <e> <s> if i may say so i think that that does answer the question the importance of which the noble lord lord mackie is underlining <e>", "<cs> my lords that is true <e> <s> however those i am afraid are circumstances over which i have no control <e>", "<cs> my lords this has still to be decided <e> <s> what i was venturing to say in my remarks was that in putting clause into effect i do not believe it will be good enough simply to add a question or two extra to the june census <e> <s> to put the real intention of clause into effect and i have not discussed this with my noble friend lord renton i believe that we shall need to have rather more detailed studies and questions put to owners to occupiers and to their agents where necessary <e> <s> i repeat that the government do not foresee that that will in any way need the power of entry and i repeat that i am glad that it is being done away with <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord henderson <e> <s> the third aspect on which the government were asked to provide an answer was really a set of questions from my noble friend lord ironside who has been entirely consistent throughout these proceedings on the bill in pointing to the general problems which he feels derive from straw and stubble burning and pointing in a very helpful way to specific matters which he believes are of public concern <e> <s> this evening my noble friend lord ironside pointed to the question of public health from pollution from burning and also to the danger amongst other things to people who use public footpaths and to public services which are carried on telegraph poles of various kinds <e>", "<cs> my lords as grid supply lines are invariably put at the edges of fields where there are hedges they will again benefit from exactly the same subsection of the model by-laws as i have mentioned already <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that question <e> <s> i think my answer indeed reflects well on the agricultural industry of this country <e> <s> over the period to not quite the period my noble friend had asked for in his question self-sufficiency in all foods has increased in this country from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> and in indigenous type foods the increase has been from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords the wages of agricultural workers are decided by the agricultural wages board <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is profitable to start trying to weigh the costs of the common agricultural policy and they are considerable with the benefits <e> <s> but the benefits are there and i have enumerated just a few of them <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord collison who from his experience knows far better than i that in terms of productivity and of industrial relations british agriculture has a very fine record over the years <e> <s> of course those who are to be thanked are all who work in the industry and not least those who are employed upon our farms and in our horticultural enterprises around the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer to my noble friends question is that from february to may if that is the information that my noble friend is after retail food prices rose by per cent <e> <s> per annum <e> <s> since then the increase has been per cent <e> <s> per annum <e> <s> i must be fair in giving those figures <e> <s> there obviously was a very considerable readjustment in food prices when we entered the community <e> <s> on the other hand as i am sure my noble friends on this side of the house will agree we have a splendid government at the moment which of course is keeping food prices down <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know because that is a hypothesis which is never likely to be realised <e>", "<cs> my lords it would very likely mean a return to deficiency payments and guaranteed prices and probably the end result would be all the worse <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have figures which relate specifically to pensioners <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend refers of course to dairying <e> <s> i think that we are getting on to another question however deeply felt may be ones views on the issues <e> <s> so far as this question is concerned the effect of the price fixing of the common agricultural policy should i think exert some downward pressure on food prices <e> <s> that is something that the whole house would welcome i would have thought <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not wish my noble friend the duke of norfolk to think that the replies which i felt i needed to give to the noble lord lord beswick showed any unfriendliness towards new zealand <e> <s> it is the policy of her majestys government to see that the th protocol is faithfully carried out by the community and that the dublin declaration of is adhered to <e> <s> it is of course we in this country who take the new zealand produce <e> <s> we are ready and we are proud to do so <e> <s> having said that i do not think if i may say so to the noble lord lord beswick arising from my noble friends question that we can unwind the clock and go back to the old system of deficiency payments and guaranteed prices even if we wished from a national point of view to take more food from new zealand <e> <s> we have to live with the world as it is <e> <s> the world as it is means that we are taking what we feel we can from new zealand with the agreement of our community partners which is not always easy to come by <e>", "<cs> my lords that is correct <e> <s> we are taking what we can get agreement to take <e> <s> that is the way that the community works <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the noble baronesss interest in this matter but with respect to her there has been a good deal of progress <e> <s> the fact is that the responses of the nationalised industries consumers councils on these guidelines varied a good deal in content and structure between the five main councils and the aim of the department of trade and industry has been to produce concise drafts with a recognisable common framework <e> <s> if i can be a little more forthcoming than i was in my original answer may i say that i hope the guidelines for the gas and the electricity consumers councils to discuss with their industries are going to be sent to those councils literally within the next few days <e>", "<cs> my lords what is much more to the point is that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry is anxious to get on with this and on his behalf i will give an undertaking that i will let the noble baroness know when the communication is sent to those two nationalised industries <e> <s> so far as the exact content of the papers is concerned they are still drafts for discussion by the consumers councils concerned with the two industries and i think i must ask the department and mr alex fletcher in particular whether he would feel that it was right to show these particular documents in public at the present time <e> <s> i feel sure that mr fletcher will be as helpful as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords it took a little time to get the replies back from the nationalised industries consumers councils <e> <s> the last ones were received in october of last year <e> <s> i repeat that what was found then was that the responses varied a good deal both in their content and in their structure <e> <s> in order to try to achieve the objective of getting for the five main nationalised industries consumers councils guidelines which in the interests of consumers would be more or less in similar form for people to recognise a good deal of redrafting has had to be done <e> <s> the purpose of my answers today to the noble baroness opposite is to give the assurance which i have done that in the next few days those guidelines will be going to the electricity and gas consumers councils <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can give an assurance that there will be a government statement on this matter <e> <s> noble lords have had their fill of government statements in the past few weeks but i feel sure that in the near future the noble baroness lady burton will be putting down some form of further probing question <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to prove how reasonable and understanding i am on behalf of the government perhaps i may repeat the assurance that very shortly the basis for that discussion will be in the hands of those consumers councils <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for the welcome which he has given to my honourable friends words on the position of company directors in the speech which he made earlier this month <e> <s> i hope that the answer which i have given to the original question may also be acceptable to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their replies to my right honourable friends statement <e> <s> there was perhaps a warmer welcome from the noble lord lord diamond than from the noble lord lord bruce <e> <s> nonetheless i thank them both <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce asked me about that part of the statement which referred to the question of the move being acceptable to shareholders <e> <s> i ought to make it clear to the house that at the moment we are in a situation where there is no definite proposal <e> <s> there is certainly no offer to any shareholders <e> <s> as the press notice put out by thorn-emi and the statement both make clear we are in a situation where there have been discussions initiated and so we understand detailed studies and negotiations will be proceeding between the two companies <e> <s> when we reach the stage when there is a proposal if there is one then the government will study it very carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i follow the logic of my noble friends question but as the statement makes quite clear if a merger is proposed it would fall to be considered by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry under the provisions of the fair trading act <e> <s> i think it is proper for me to repeat that in answer to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i recognise the interest of the noble lord lord beswick and his record in this field but for the moment i suggest to your lordships that this is a matter for the companies concerned <e> <s> it is right to remind your lordships that the per cent <e> <s> shareholding was taken by the government in because the government said that it provided a basis for partnership between the public and the private sectors within british aerospace <e> <s> however in the intervening three years british aerospace in its present form has established itself as an internationally competitive profitable and successful company <e> <s> this does not necessarily require the government to own nearly half the shares <e> <s> it certainly does not require the government to meddle in the affairs of two very great companies <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to my noble friend with whom i practically always entirely agree there are important issues in this very brief statement <e> <s> one is the national interest on which noble lords have put their fingers in the work of these great companies namely the question of british control of british aerospace which is of course written into the articles of association and is preserved by the governments shareholding <e> <s> that undertaking remains exactly the same although if proposals are put forward we shall have to see how best the government will continue to fulfil that undertaking which remains absolute <e> <s> that was one reason for making the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i should follow the noble lord lord mulley down all those paths <e> <s> this is a preliminary statement by two highly successful and very important firms that they are embarking on exploratory discussions <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state felt that it was right to keep parliament informed from the point of view of the government and that is what we have done today <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i detect a former treasury minister behind that question <e>", "<cs> my lords before answering that question may i make it clear that in my reply to my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne i was not seeking to be unfriendly <e> <s> indeed i think there may very well be something of merit in what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords this is hypothesis and with all friendliness to the noble lord lord bruce i think i must rest on what the statement has already said which is in essence that we must see how we go <e> <s> if we are talking about a merger that would first of all fall to be considered by my right honourable friend the secretary of state under the provisions of the fair trading act <e> <s> we still have quite a long way down the road to go before anything certain is settled <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the other plant breeding institutes are concerned the governments present policy is to maintain the existing arrangements for financing the production of state-bred finished varieties <e> <s> i say to the noble lord that the ministry of agriculture will continue to fund those <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord who i know has a great deal of experience in these matters there are difficulties with the present set-up of the national seed development organisation <e> <s> it is not in any way the fault of the people who are in the organisation who have of course discharged all their functions most commendably over the years <e> <s> but the fact of the matter is that it is very difficult at the moment objectively to assess the financial performance of the nsdo <e> <s> as the noble lord will know the nsdo does not purchase the varieties it obtains for marketing from state-financed plant breeding stations but instead we have a situation where the nsdo in cambridge pays to the government an arbitrary per cent <e> <s> of the royalties it receives <e> <s> that means that the real costs of government research and development on material passed to the nsdo are not paid for directly <e> <s> what i am saying to the noble lord is that privatisation could result in a more realistic return for government investment in research and development <e> <s> i believe that that could be a very real advance <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with the noble lord lord cledwyn <e> <s> that this is doctrinaire <e> <s> i have explained at some length in answer to the noble lord lord john-mackie the financial reasons which lie behind our belief that it is right to have an exploration of whether it would be desirable to privatise the nsdo <e> <s> we have of course kept the nsdo governing body informed and <e> <s> indeed the staff of the organisation <e> <s> i should like to go out of my way in replying to the noble lord to say that of course parliament will be informed before any decision is taken <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the staff of the national seed development organisation have been told of the possibility of privatisation <e> <s> there has been no question of proceeding behind their backs <e> <s> i think that i should perhaps underline what i said earlier to the noble lord <e> <s> i think that if the government can foster sound management commercial efficiency and value for money for the taxpayer then it will be found that our great organisations on which we depend and i have made it clear that i believe that the responsibilities of the nsdo have been most commendably discharged are on a firmer basis for the future <e> <s> this is one of the points which we shall certainly be keeping in mind in our exploration of this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords if the house agrees to the statutory instrument that is on the order paper for consideration later this afternoon the new rates of capital allowances will come into effect and they will be deemed to have done so as from th february <e> <s> so far as the hill livestock compensatory allowances are concerned having had consultations with the farmers unions on the rates we believe that it is right to try to introduce these as from st january of the new year <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the concern of the noble lord lord hunt <e> <s> since the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> although i was not able to give an exact figure in reply to my friends original question about the number of farmers who would qualify we know that as a result of making this successful application to the european commission some million hectares of land representing about per cent <e> <s> of the united kingdoms total agricultural land will now have lfa status <e>", "<cs> it is not easy my lords but by giving publicity locally the ministry has now been in touch with all the farmers who we believe are in the less-favoured areas <e> <s> we have asked the farmers in the parishes concerned to write to their ministry divisional offices giving plans of their farms with grid references and field numbers <e> <s> as the noble lord lord john-mackie quite rightly said it is at that moment that it will not be entirely easy to be absolutely certain as to <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i understand the importance of the noble lords question <e> <s> i cannot answer as to how many dairy farmers will benefit by now falling within the new less-favoured areas <e> <s> but those who do will benefit from higher capital grants if they are eligible for them <e> <s> so far as the co-responsibility levy is concerned again dairy farmers in the new less-favoured areas will benefit from a reduction in the payments which they have to make to that particular levy <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend the leader of the house i beg to move the motion standing in his name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft agriculture and horticulture grant variation scheme be approved by your lordships <e> <s> this instrument relates to just one of the three schemes under which farmers in the united kingdom can obtain capital grants on improvements to their businesses both in agriculture and in horticulture <e> <s> within these schemes grant may be obtained on improvements including buildings for livestock horticultural production and storage and land works such as drainage grassland regeneration and shelter belts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> i too missed the noble lord lord john <e>", "<cs> my lords both of the points which the noble baroness has raised namely the extension of codes of practice to traders other than those who are members of associations and also the question of enforcement are we understand both specifically matters into which the director general of fair trading is looking and we must now wait to see what he says when he produces his discussion paper a little later on in the year <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend can ask that question but i am not entirely sure that i can give the answer mainly because we must await the discussion paper from the director general of fair trading but also because as a matter of fact i do not know what the answer is <e>", "<cs> my lords the first question which the noble lord asked me was whether this will put on a statutory basis the existing voluntary pesticides safety precautions scheme <e> <s> i should like to make it clear that the governments intention is that the new legislation will require anyone who wishes to import sell or supply a pesticide in the united kingdom to submit the product for clearance and that it will be an offence to use a product not so cleared <e> <s> we intend to ensure that cleared pesticides are used only in accordance with the conditions of use <e> <s> again it would be an offence to breach those conditions <e> <s> that goes a little wider than the existing scheme <e> <s> so far as any further ideas are concerned an undertaking has already been given by the ministry of agriculture that there will be consultation with all interested parties <e> <s> as to the use of antibiotics my advice is that they are subject to the medicines act <e>", "<cs> my lords we must wait for the consultation which is going to take place in the very near future <e> <s> i apologise for appearing to be evasive on this point <e> <s> all i can say at the moment is that the scope of the legislation will be of the kind which i attempted to outline in my original answer to the noble lord lord hunter of newington <e> <s> nevertheless i acknowledge that the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos is on to an important point <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly look at the answers which have been given to the noble lord <e> <s> lord hale <e> <s> however may i take this opportunity to make the point that under the voluntary procedures which we already have which broadly are called the pesticides safety precautions scheme but it depends on other schemes as well our record in this country is a good record <e> <s> however we believe that the pesticides regulations should now be put on a statutory basis <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will feel that that is right i believe he does <e> <s> we have also as i have repeated today promised that there will be consultation with all interested parties <e> <s> i hope the house will believe that this is the right way to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall take into account what the noble lord has just said <e>", "<cs> my lords research is indeed taking place <e> <s> there are advisory committees on veterinary medicine <e> <s> there is the veterinary products committee <e>", "<cs> my lords draft guidelines for discussion with the councils were sent to the secretariats concerned on th june <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly owe the noble baroness an apology and i give her an unqualified one <e> <s> it was not good enough so far as i was concerned <e> <s> to say that i thought the papers would be sent out <e>", "<cs> as a matter of fact my lords the papers were sent out on th june <e> <s> if i may pick up almost the last point put to me by the noble baroness on th may she said then and i fully understood why that the recipients of the papers would need some discussion some meeting of minds <e> <s> i hope the noble baroness will feel that the department has been active in this matter in that it was approached by both the electricity and the gas consumers councils the recipients of the papers and a meeting has already been arranged for <e> <s> i understand th june <e>", "<cs> my lords that will make the meeting all the better <e>", "<cs> my lords i have also listened to the noble baroness opposite on this subject and to my noble friend and i am perfectly clear that they both have very distinguished records and a close interest in this particular area <e> <s> all i can say is that i will draw the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state to this afternoons exchange in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords my experience is that that would not help <e>", "<cs> my lords i must make it clear on behalf of the department and this is partly an answer to my noble friend that the reason why a considerable period of time elapsed during was because the offerings from the niccs themselves had to be received and they differed quite considerably in content and in structure <e> <s> the aim has been to produce concise drafts which share a recognisable common framework so that the consumer councils themselves and the consumers shall know where they are <e> <s> we have reached the position now where at least drafts have been sent to both the electricity and the gas consumers councils the two biggest <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot help the noble baroness with the first of her questions because the ball is in the court of the consumer councils <e> <s> as i have said they will first be talking again because they wish to do so with the department of trade and industry and will then be talking with the industries concerned <e> <s> so far as concerns the government making another statement i have a feeling that the noble baroness may be raising this matter again in the foreseeable future <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> shortly means as soon as possible <e> <s> we really will try to see that that assurance is fulfilled <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble baroness is being perhaps a little less than fair in saying that progress has not been made <e> <s> the noble baroness will remember that at the last council meeting on which i reported in response to a question of the noble baroness agreement was reached and a council directive was adopted on the early warning system on dangerous consumer products <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to draw the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state to what the noble lord lord bruce says <e> <s> it is important and probably wise advice <e> <s> there are two things that i should say <e> <s> one of the advantages that <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no final agreement

i stated <e> <s> this would fall within the term of the presidency of the republic of ireland <e> <s> the reason that it is still only provisional is that until i think tomorrow we do not have the republic of ireland in the presidency <e> <s> it will be for the republic of ireland to decide whether the next council meeting will be held then <e> <s> the noble baroness asks me whether it would be helpful all round for a question to be put down for written answer <e> <s> far be it from me to suggest that i would prefer a question for written answer rather than for oral answer <e> <s> if the noble baroness feels that it would be a good thing to put down a question i suggest that she should do so after we know when the next council meeting is to be held <e> <s> i can perhaps keep in touch with the noble baroness on this point and let her know when there is a definite date for the next council meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords i have it in command from her majesty the queen and his royal highness the prince of wales that their royal highnesses <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i beg to move that the house doth agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> my lords this part of clause which gave rise to many hours of debate by all of us who are taking part in this final stage of the bill once again brings us back to a short but important exchange of views <e> <s> with respect to the noble lord lord northfield whose expertise on these matters has been of the very greatest help in getting this bill into shape and with whom i usually agree if he would look back over the previous proceedings in this house he will see that the alteration which he ascribes to the changes which the bill has undergone in another place really has not quite had the effect that the noble lord said it would <e> <s> in other words i am saying that when the bill left this house it was perfectly possible for the productive capacity of the holding to be taken into account <e> <s> the change which was made and the amendments with which we are now dealing include earning capacity as well <e> <s> in another place right honourable and honourable members felt that that change clarified the position relating to the rent formula <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord looks back at those very long debates i think he will find that at that time my noble friend lord caithness was trying to include earning capacity in all its various facets <e> <s> that brings me to the point which has been made by my noble friend lord middleton because my noble friend is concerned that in putting as another place has done earning capacity into the bill and tying it to the productive capacity of the farm that may throw some doubt upon the position of earning capacity when it is related to non-farming activities <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>

great britain matter <e> <s> i am happy to be able to report to the house that whereas after i replied to my noble friend lord ridley on st march working groups of interested parties were set up

noble lord has said to the attention of my right honourable friend and of the secretary of state for trade and industry <e> <s> i think that today in the context of this debate that is as far as i wish to go but i assure the noble lord lord graham that that is what i shall do <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to look closely as indeed i always do at the remarks of the noble lord lord john-mackie <e> <s> i mean that quite genuinely <e> <s> but there is one misunderstanding here and again i am speaking off the cuff without looking back at my notes <e> <s> what i thought i said and

these matters to a satisfactory conclusion <e> <s> but at the moment the ball is firmly in the court of the nationalised industries consumer council <e>", "<cs> my lords the timetable must depend in part upon the councils and the industries concerned <e> <s> but as i say we intend to maintain the momentum and bring the initiative to a satisfactory conclusion <e> <s> the noble baroness is not being unreasonable to ask the question which she has just asked <e> <s> of course it will be a very great pleasure when the time comes as the noble baroness suspects it will be right for more questions to be answered on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter of course for the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that the noble lord refers to the governments present financial policies <e> <s> i think the noble lord and the government would agree that the last unemployment figures were very disappointing but in regard to our policies it is no mean achievement to have got inflation down and investment and productivity up nor is abolition of the national insurance surcharge and the raising of tax thresholds <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed the noble lord has fastened on to the point that by concentrating more and more on the training aspect of these schemes we are endeavouring to provide people who will be in permanent jobs for the future <e> <s> at the risk of repeating myself i would remind the noble lord that inflation in the last two years was the lowest for years and is now well below the european community average <e> <s> investment in manufacturing rose by per cent <e> <s> in the first half of this year <e> <s> manufacturing output which fell during the time between and is now up and the result of all that is that there are new jobs being created in new technology <e> <s> what we have got to see is that we try to avoid the loss of jobs which i know at the moment is outbalancing the new ones <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend i agree <e> <s> surely the crucial point is how competitive we are in selling our goods and services around the world and it is to that end that we are bending all our efforts <e>",

a <e>", "<cs> my lords the press notice issued by the department of employment on th october shows that the unadjusted figures give the total number unemployed as <e> <s> i am afraid that i do not have with me the answer to the other question which the noble lord has asked but i shall write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have that figure with me <e> <s> i am rather more interested in the total number of people who are in employment compared with the total number of people who were in employment a year ago i gave the noble lord that figure <e>", "<cs> my lords the european community already has a framework agreement on fisheries with spain as a non-member country <e> <s> under this agreement consultations take place annually on the detailed arrangements to apply <e> <s> the framework agreement will cease to apply once spain becomes a <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed i can answer my noble friend by saying that is not the intention of her majestys government to reopen discussion on the common fisheries policy agreement on which was reached after such very long negotiations <e> <s> my noble friend says that it is to run for years but i think that it can also run for a further years after that <e> <s> the communitys agreed position is that spain ought in principle to get no more access to species of fish subject to total allowable catches and quotas than she already has and that she should continue to be tightly controlled by a licensing system for a long transitional period <e>", "<cs> my lords the government recognise the truth of what the noble lord has said namely the concern among those who realise that of course there is greater capacity in the spanish fishing fleet <e> <s> it may perhaps be helpful if i make the point that we very strongly believe that the spanish fishing fleet needs to be significantly reduced both before accession to the community and after accession in order to ensure that the size of the fleet in european community waters matches the opportunities <e> <s> that is a major point in the negotiations <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can certainly give an assurance that the views of the shetland fishermen will be taken into account in the same way as we are determined to protect the interests of all united kingdom fishermen <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord cledwyn will know the european commission has recently made certain suggestions for a limited system of licensing to control fishing by member states outside their main fishing areas <e> <s> i am bound to say that her majestys government feel that that is a proposal that could be useful <e> <s> but having said that it is true to say that the commissions ideas on this matter have not yet received enough support among member states to form the basis of an approach to spain and portugal in the negotiations <e> <s> however this licensing proposal remains on the table within the community and may yet come into play at a later stage <e> <s> i am not aware that it will necessarily come into play next week <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that question is yes most certainly <e> <s> of course the proposal from the commission is not for a generalised scheme of licensing it is of the limited kind that i sought to explain in my previous reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely understand what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i do not think that i can give any more information in my reply now because the negotiations are taking place at present and i do not think that it would be helpful to do so <e> <s> however <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not draw the conclusion that the noble lord has drawn from my answer <e> <s> the government want to see an efficient and competitive manufacturing sector and i believe that we are going a long way towards achieving that end <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that manufacturing output is now rising whereas it fell between and <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned investment <e> <s> investment in manufacturing rose by per cent <e> <s> in the first half of this year and was up per cent <e> <s> on the previous year <e> <s> the difficulty about the figures is that there is of course a long-term trend towards services which is to be found in many countries and that trend we have also made use of in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords all i would say is that investment in manufacturing is increasing <e> <s> i believe that if we stick to our guns it will continue to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer productivity has risen very considerably <e> <s> i am glad that my noble friend has asked me about vacancies because it really does not seem very much <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to look at those figures i do not know that i agree with the noble lord but i do not have figures today to rebut them <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the government would disagree in the very least with what the noble lord lord rochester has said speaking as i know he does from long experience of these matters <e> <s> however let me add two other points <e> <s> first as the noble lord will well know there are certain sectors of manufacturing which are successful at the present time and which are showing encouraging increases in employment <e> <s> secondly surely we also need to train for the future and of course that is what the manpower services commission is all about and that is what the debate in your lordships house two nights ago was all about <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble viscount that the trend in the reduction in employment in manufacturing is something which has been going on since the s <e> <s> if i may just refer to what the noble lord lord kaldor said just now the fact of the matter is that despite that long-term trend in employment we have today a situation where productivity is up investment is up employment in services is up vacancies are up and the total numbers in employment compared with last year are up <e> <s> i think that that is a reasonable outlook for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that that is true <e> <s> i should like to confirm that that is so and if in any way it is wrong i shall write immediately to the noble baroness but i believe that what she says is indeed true <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is absolutely right i invariably find myself in agreement with the noble lord lord beswick <e> <s> it is indeed the case that we start off from a low base in so many things because when the present government came into office we had just passed through one of the most ghastly winters that this country can ever remember which was presided over in the dying months of the labour government of that time <e> <s> therefore the noble lord is absolutely right on that point <e> <s> so far as the increase in employment in certain sections of manufacturing is concerned if the noble lord would care to glance some time at the electrical and electrical engineering industries metal goods of various kinds instrument engineering industrial plant and steel work and processing of plastics he will find that there has been an increase in employment in those various occupations bordering on <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is being less than fair <e> <s> it is clear from the exchange that we have had that the reduction in employment in manufacturing has probably been taking place for about years <e> <s> it is also the case that employment in services in this country has gone up by million people in the past years <e> <s> surely we need to recognise what is needed for the future we need to put our investment where it will do most good <e> <s> i am very glad to have been able to confirm at this question time that investment in this country is going up <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i am astonished that the noble lord with all his experience starts to talk to me about overseas trade from this country <e> <s> i am no expert but one thing i do know if we go into the sort of siege economy that the labour party would want if they were in power we would find that the figures for overseas trade from this county would be disastrous <e> <s> i do not think that there is any more to be said on that particular subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for pointing out both those points with which i agree <e> <s> perhaps i could end this exchange by commenting on something of which i have personal knowledge <e> <s> today the exports of food and drink from this county for which many people work very hard and for which the ministry for which i work is ultimately responsible are worth some million a year which represents an increase of some per cent <e> <s> a year in those exports over the past five years <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps we had better not go down this road too far <e> <s> however as the noble lord will know we have surpluses in oil and in invisibles and it is neither necessary nor desirable to balance our trade in every commodity <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have that information for the noble baroness <e> <s> however as the vacancies are now very numerous as i say they are now the highest that they have ever been for the past years it can reasonably be taken that they have a good spread across different sorts of jobs and also a wide spread across geographical areas <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord i said that investment in manufacturing at the present time is increasing but there is nonetheless in this country as there is in other countries a long-term trend towards services <e> <s> when we looked at the services we found that in the past years the increase in employment has been of the order of million people <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have firmly set themselves against all unlawful discrimination and are resolutely committed to promoting good race relations in employment by securing equal treatment and opportunity <e> <s> the commission for racial equality has a statutory duty to work towards these ends and has produced a code of practice which came into operation on st april <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his welcome to the reply which i gave <e> <s> in the difficult employment climate that we are in there are two hopeful signs so far as this question is concerned <e> <s> black people have undoubtedly made some advances in employment in the public health and transport services and there has been a significant growth in self-employment and private businesses among asian people <e>", "<cs> my lords there are no recent government statistics available of unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord mentions education <e> <s> i think that the house will be glad to hear that the manpower services commission language training for linemployed young people under the training opportunities scheme last year reached out to people in the ethnic minorities who needed language training <e> <s> the industrial training service which is funded by the manpower services commission and is administered by local education authorities in areas of high ethnic population reached out to over people last year <e> <s> the third point which is interesting is that this year we are spending some million on section of the local government act which of course is money precisely for trying to reduce racial disadvantage including support for salaries of training and career officers <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is undoubtedly true <e> <s> the remedy of course must lie in the success of the governments policies to promote an economic climate conducive to competitiveness and growth but at the same time we must not underestimate the importance of the employment and training special measures of the manpower services commission on which billion are being spent this year <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my <e> <s> original answer a policy was worked out with the council of <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that there is no question that the figures are of great concern though i am advised that they show some lessening in the rate of increase compared to a year ago <e> <s> there are i think some encouraging signs in particular the latest figures that i have been given show some additional people in work compared to a year ago <e> <s> the noble lord also asked me about increased resources <e> <s> we are putting massive <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be some <e>", "<cs> my lords i gave to your lordships house two days ago a figure which shows that vacancies in this country at the moment are the highest that they have been for the last four-and-a-half years <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of those occasions on which both the noble lord and i are correct <e> <s> the noble lord is absolutely right that taking the two particular quarters which he has selected there is some slowing down in the rate of increase of the creation of new jobs <e> <s> at the same time i repeat the figure which i have been given and which i believe to be correct which is that the latest figures available show that there are some more people in employment than there were the year before <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment will be looking at certain of the special employment and training measures which are due to come to an end in march of next year unless anything is done and therefore i think that we can expect some further information from my right honourable friend <e> <s> indeed i shall draw his attention to what the noble lord lord grimond has said in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we are moving on to a slightly different question <e> <s> as the noble lord will know aid from the government to the regions since the present administration came into office in has been absolutely massive <e> <s> i believe i am right in saying that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry is looking at the question of regional policy but that is a matter for my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will of course be aware that on th july my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment announced that there would be a doubling of numbers for adult training <e> <s> this should go some way towards trying to cope with the very difficult problem which the noble lord has outlined <e>", "<cs> my lords last year my department consulted interested organisations on the need to retain specific legislation for the control of weeds <e> <s> our conclusion which was announced in another place on th february this year was that the weeds act continues to play a useful role in specific areas <e> <s> we have no plans to conduct a further review <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right <e> <s> i believe that the act has been used only twice in the last five years and i would entirely agree with my noble friends view about the necessity to keep the act on the statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord makes a complaint it will be taken very seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to hear the noble lord say that and i believe i am right in saying that the take-up of allotments in the country at the present time is very good <e>", "<cs> my lords in fact this act applies only to five different sorts of weed <e> <s> so far as i am <e>", "<cs> my lords if because of a management agreement there was such a stipulation of course that would come within the purview of the nature conservancy council <e> <s> however if one of those five weeds was causing a threat to agriculture because it was liable to spread it would be possible to bring the act into effect <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i have listened with great interest to what has been said today on this bill and not least to the speech of the noble baroness lady nicol at the end of the debate which if i may say so i think made a most interesting balance and mixture from the oppostion front bench in the comments made on the bill today <e> <s> i do assure your lordships that the government will reflect very carefully on all that has been said before we reach the next stage <e>", "<cs> my lords patience <e> <s> i am coming to that point <e> <s> if the noble lord will forgive me the answer to that question is embedded beneath one or two pieces of paper <e> <s> to deal first with another point concern has been expressed in agricultural quarters that the regulations might impede low-priced imports from the continent <e> <s> this point was raised by the noble lord <e> <s> lord walston my noble friend lord stodart of leaston and by other noble lords <e> <s> it is very important that i should place on record that we would not wish to deny access to cheap safe and efficient pesticides <e> <s> nor indeed would the european commission allow us to do so <e> <s> as an earnest of our good intentions we propose to introduce administratively on st january of next year a rapid clearance system free of any fees for imported pesticides provided that they are identical to products already cleared for use here <e> <s> i am confident that a system introduced under regulations could because of its simplicity be charged at a very low level in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords they do not all apply to older people and it is not possible for me to give a forecast to the noble lord as to how that split would come <e>", "<cs> before giving way my lords i will suggest that if public expenditure were in itself a solution there would have been almost no unemployment problem for many years now <e> <s> indeed if one takes the specific example of liverpool that is an area which has received a higher level of government assistance than any other area in the country <e> <s> of course to be realistic there will continue to be massive government help to the merseyside area i am certain of that <e> <s> there will continue to be the large <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is always very fair in debate and i hope that i am not being unfair when i say that his last few words nonetheless came awfully close to saying that public expenditure in itself will and should simply support jobs <e> <s> it is no use saying that the public sector should go on being supported because there happen to be jobs in the public sector and regardless of the fact that some real jobs for the future can be created elsewhere <e> <s> but perhaps i ought to study more closely what the noble lord said i know that the noble lord will look at what i said <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that we can go any further down this particular road <e> <s> it is interesting that the words public sector did not i think pass my lips <e> <s> noble lords have perhaps got them slightly on the brain <e> <s> what i said was that while the amount of public expenditure in this country has claimed a greater and greater part of the national income so nonetheless unemployment inexorably has risen <e> <s> if it was the case that public expenditure was a panacea for all ills we would not have had a problem with public expenditure for many years now but we have had a problem because public expenditure of itself is not a cure and i do not think it is going to be for the future <e>", "<cs> i entirely understand the reasons which prompt the noble baroness lady birk and the noble lord lord stallard to put their finger on the importance of local authorities in matters affecting a particular locality <e> <s> of course the government understand that <e> <s> but i think there are certain features which we come to immediately in part i which would make it difficult for the government to accept this particular amendment <e> <s> i wonder if i may set them out very briefly <e>", "<cs> i wonder if i may say the briefest word in reply <e> <s> it is simply this <e> <s> it is on two main grounds that i am not as sympathetic as the noble baroness would wish me to be to the first amendment <e> <s> those two main grounds are that we are talking about emergencies where time would be of the essence and <e>", "<cs> all your lordships have been persuasive and all have spoken in favour of the amendment and that puts me in a somewhat difficult position because i was going to rise to my feet to say that i was not sure that i liked the amendment <e> <s> might i explain one or two grounds to your lordships why i am worried about this <e> <s> first there is a matter of principle which many of your lordships who are legally trained will know better that i do and that is that there is a rule that the polluter pays <e> <s> indeed the polluter can be and should be taken to court <e>", "<cs> i said that i shall take this matter away and look at it <e> <s> there are difficulties and this is why i feel that i cannot give an undertaking but i shall look at it seriously <e> <s> if your lordships will allow me to <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should say that this will be looked at along with the previous amendment <e> <s> but in making that offer may i repeat a point i have made before <e> <s> really we are not changing any principle in part i of the bill <e> <s> we are trying to put into statutory form what has happened in this country where natural disasters have struck communities and the statutory authorities and the voluntary organisations have in the way that is familiar in this country stepped in and cleared up the mess <e> <s> everybody believes that that has been the right thing to do <e> <s> people have not turned to those local authorities or to the voluntary organisations and said having cleared up the mess you must pay us compensation <e>", "<cs> there is nothing between the government and my noble friend in what he wants to do <e> <s> i can give a categorical assurance that the government would never authorise unqualified persons to undertake the duties of investigating and enforcement officers <e> <s> but if i may say so i think there is a difficulty about putting in the words suitably qualified <e> <s> when the moment comes we do have powers of entry in the bill regretfully but they are sometimes necessary <e> <s> in the schedules i think i am right in saying that there are provisions for the enforcement or investigatory officers to prove to a person who may be concerned that that is what they are <e>", "<cs> this clause provides for the authorisation of investigating and enforcement officers and the difference between the noble baroness and the government is whether the appointments should be by local authorities or by central government <e> <s> i endeavoured about an hour ago to deploy reasons why i thought it was necessary in the very special circumstances and they are very special circumstances drawn very narrowly indeed to have this as a central government responsibility partly because of the emergency nature of part i and partly because undoubtedly emergencies will occur although i wish they did not in areas that are offshore and outside the jurisdiction of local authorities <e> <s> that is the first point <e>", "<cs> this subsection is included in the bill to ensure that if an emergency arises at sea the powers of investigation and enforcement would be immediately available if that was necessary <e> <s> sea-fishery officers can be on duty on board ship for long periods of time and it might not be practicable for them to be recalled at short notice in order to receive their certificates of authorisation <e> <s> that is why this subsection is in the bill <e> <s> incidentally i think it is a good example of why if we are going to act quickly at sea it would be difficult to rely on the local authorities <e> <s> i will not speak further about this because it is a point i know i have made several times already <e>", "<cs> i think that it is all of it <e> <s> it has to be a british sea a british fishery and a british officer <e> <s> whether or not i am entirely right what is certain is that if my noble friend cares to look at page of the bill which is the interpretation clause he will see that british sea-fishery officer is there defined as <e>", "<cs> think there is a serious point here and if i am wrong i will try to repair my mistake either by writing to the noble lord or by saying something in a moment or two <e> <s> my understanding is that the noble lord lord hunt is quite correct in what he said <e> <s> that is my interpretation because the sea-fishery officer may need to find that he is exercising his enforcement powers on land as well as on sea <e>", "<cs> as no cry for help has come from the box i am full of hope that i have given the correct answer to the noble lord lord hunt on this occasion and that i shall not be writing a letter <e> <s> but if i do write a letter i will of course send a copy to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with my noble friend lord radnor and indeed with the noble lords lord john-mackie and lord walston that fish farming needs to be covered in the bill when we are referring to powers of entry <e> <s> however i think that it is covered <e> <s> i do so for this reason <e> <s> clause refers to land <e> <s> i am advised that under the interpretation act land includes water <e> <s> that really is true <e> <s> i thought that my noble friend was right to table this amendment and i was very much looking forward to accepting it but because of the act i cannot say that <e>", "<cs> i understand that land means water because of the interpretation act <e>", "<cs> then they would be on land <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his explanation of his amendment but i hope i can convince him that it is not necessary <e> <s> the clause refers to <e>", "<cs> as always the noble baroness makes this sound extremely reasonable but i think there is a difficulty here <e> <s> the licensing authority i think would be involved in a very great deal of additional work of notifying not only county but also district councils of all licences as they are issued and of each operation carried out <e> <s> i would just add that a lot of dumping is not only very routine but is also very frequent in some cases <e> <s> sewage sludge dumping for instance is fairly frequent and we would be talking about almost constant notifications <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to be too unforthcoming <e> <s> i think normally i would say that i would look at it but i think if i may say so that there is some responsibility on the noble baroness perhaps just to have a look at her own amendment <e> <s> i entirely take to heart the fact that a local authority representing a coastal holiday town is going to want to have every care taken so far as offshore dumping is concerned <e> <s> but in order for the local authority to know what are the factors which the licensing authority has taken into account in agreeing to deposits being made in a particular area and as the noble baroness will know areas for depositing in the sea are chosen in no way at random but with great care it would be necessary for it to have discussions and consultations with the licensing authority <e>", "<cs> as i think i said on second reading the depositing of radioactive waste will be covered by this bill in the same way that it was covered by the dumping at sea act <e> <s> a licence would be required as in the past and the stringent conditions agreed internationally would apply to the operation <e> <s> of course the bill is completely without prejudice to the reviews of ocean dumping of radioactive waste being conducted internationally under the london dumping convention and at home between the government and the trades union congress <e> <s> but the current suspension of radioactive dumping for those reasons will not be affected by the bill in any way <e>", "<cs> in clause we are talking about a particular kind of incineration at sea <e> <s> the definition of this kind of incineration follows closely that laid down in the oslo protocol <e> <s> a definition is necessary to ensure that combustion for purposes other than destruction for instance combustion of fuel oil in a ships engine is not caught <e> <s> the effectiveness of thermal destruction is assured by the application of strict operational conditions <e>", "<cs> the answer to my noble friends question is no but i was too polite to put it that way <e>", "<cs> my noble friend asked me whether if he wanted to indulge in shredding at sea it would be covered by clause <e> <s> the answer to that question is no but i did not quite like to put it that way <e>", "<cs> i apologise to my noble friend <e> <s> i think that i can be forgiven because we are still not talking about an exemption to clause <e> <s> that kind of destruction of documents or anything else at sea would not come into the clause kind of incineration but it would none the less be depositing <e> <s> this is where i have to apologise to my noble friend for avoiding the question that he is putting to me which is could that sort of depositing go on <e> <s> that answer is that there may be a case for what he is saying as an exemption under clause <e>", "<cs> in clause we have picked out in paragraph <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord craigton for raising this question of automatic data recorders known as black boxes <e> <s> may i first of all explain that black boxes are mandatory on incinerator vessels under the oslo protocol and we shall certainly ensure that incineration licences require their use <e>", "<cs> think there is a difficulty here in that secretary of state is undoubtedly supposed to refer to the secretary of state for scotland because we are talking about fisheries matters <e> <s> on the other hand when one looks at part i of the bill there the intention was that the secretaries of state concerned would of course extend to the secretary of state for wales as well and indeed when emergency orders are being made the secretary of state for northern ireland <e> <s> i am advised that when one talks about the secretary of state one does indeed mean the whole range of all government ministers who are secretaries of state from the prime minister onwards <e>", "<cs> i have to confess that i cannot answer that question <e> <s> the point that i would pick up is that of my noble friend lord ferrers <e> <s> i understand that from a drafting point of view in other words it is the advice of parliamentary counsel the correct way to talk about a secretary of state in legislation is to talk about the secretary of state and to leave the government to sort out which secretary of state it is <e>", "<cs> i think i shall have to take advice <e> <s> i have not done too badly we have been going for about three hours and i have not been wholly stumped <e> <s> i think however that i am now <e> <s> may i take advice and come back to it at a favourable opportunity perhaps on the question whether the clause shall stand part <e>", "<cs> if i may take this opportunity to answer the noble lord lord mackie of benshie as to whether any of the ministers meant either of the ministers the answer is yes <e>", "<cs> i feel sure that the answer to that question is also yes <e>", "<cs> i am a little perplexed about the noble baronesss references to secrecy because the results of the toxicity tests are already included in the public register and would continue to be disclosed under the bill <e> <s> i must confess that we envisage that item description of the waste will include this information although it is not specified because we were trying to keep the list as simple as possible <e> <s> however i think we do need to clarify this point <e> <s> it is perfectly reasonable that the noble baroness should put it forward <e>", "<cs> if i may say so i think it goes a fair bit wider maybe for good reasons <e> <s> i should have preferred not to take that amendment with this one but i shall not stand in the noble lords way if he wishes to do so <e>", "<cs> we are starting on part iii of the bill <e> <s> i wonder if i might say one thing of general application before i reply on this amendment <e> <s> from various parts of the house on second reading the criticism came to the government that we had put clause which is the enabling provision for the making of regulations into the bill without really giving any indication as to how those regulations were to be drafted <e> <s> in reply on second reading i said that we would endeavour to go point by point through the governments intentions so far as the regulations were concerned <e> <s> i used the word intentions advisedly because i believed and still believe that it is going to be very difficult for parliament and much more difficult for all those who are interested in the regulations if we tie the thing up so tightly before we make the regulations that there is no room for genuine consultation between the time that this enabling part of the bill is enacted and the time that the regulations are made <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could answer the last question first <e> <s> we intend that the system of getting a unanimous decision from the nine departments mentioned in the notes which have been circulated to your lordships will continue to be necessary when talking about clearances for pesticides <e> <s> we believe that this is right from the point of view of human health animal safety and protection of the environment <e> <s> but that is a headache for us and not so much for my noble friend <e>", "<cs> may i first say that the relationship between the two departments the ministry of agriculture and the department of the environment is close and evidence to that effect has been given by both departments to the select committee in another place looking into the working of the wildlife and countryside act <e> <s> indeed i think it is fair to say that both departments have pointed out that there is a good basis for making that assertion in the sense that the minister of agriculture has recently set up what is known as an environmental co-ordination unit <e> <s> that unit is able to have a close working relationship not only with the department of the environment but also with some of the agencies which look to the department of the environment for their funding if they are statutory agencies or voluntary agencies which receive grant aid from the department of the environment <e> <s> in these ways the setting up of a special unit in the ministry of agriculture to try to co-ordinate environmental matters within the ministry of agriculture has improved the closeness of the relationship between the two departments <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord onslow for moving the amendment briefly but very much to the point and i thank my noble friend lord peel for speaking likewise <e> <s> first i think i am right in saying that if one looks at enabling legislation one sees that the power of the government through the legislation to make regulations is almost invariably a permissive power and not mandatory <e> <s> therefore turning to the first point on this amendment which seeks to supplant the word may by the word shall i ask my noble friends to focus on the fact that there is a problem from the point of view of precedence with putting in here a mandatory provision <e>", "<cs> there will not be a loophole in that way <e> <s> i am glad the noble lord has asked me that and <e>", "<cs> if i may reply to the noble lord lord melchett yes it is the case that we would envisage not a series of regulations but regulations which i very much hope will come in next year <e> <s> there may be indeed there will be exceptions to that however and the exceptions that the noble lord has put his finger on as a result of the examples which i endeavoured to give are for instance maximum residue limits and arrangements so far as exports are concerned because we are restrained by international agreements <e>", "<cs> if i may once again intervene i am grateful to my noble friend with his experience of drafting for saying that and i should just like to make the point that i think this is the first time in public and on the record that the government have laid it on the line that it is their absolute intention to get on with these regulations next year <e> <s> i like to think that this is the impression which has been given to everybody interested in this particular field of operations namely pesticide legislation <e> <s> i think it is the first time that we have said on the record that it is our intention to do this <e> <s> although there will be exceptions and i do not hide that from your lordships i hope at the same time that your lordships will accept the good intentions of the government in what i have said this evening <e>", "<cs> i should like to take away what my noble friend has said and think about it <e> <s> the last point he has made is an important one <e> <s> it is easier to do in this house than in another place <e> <s> may i think about it <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may ask the noble lord lord melchett a question <e> <s> i have been listening to the debate and i cannot find anything in subsection which leads me to believe that prior informed consent by the importing country is prevented in some way by this bill <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble lord i think he is shadow boxing <e> <s> my noble friend has read <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may answer the question for my noble friend who has been on his feet many times <e> <s> if i may say so i do not think that we are drafting this bill at the behest of the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> if the noble lord cares to look at what in fact is the governments bill he will see that clause contains an absolutely clear statement that the provisions of the bill require that we shall be able to fulfil our international obligations <e> <s> the question of what those international obligations will be is for the international fora in which we are negotiating to decide <e> <s> it is a matter for the international fora it is a matter for her majestys government it is not a matter for the noble lord lord melchett <e>", "<cs> it is because we believe that we have taken all the powers that are necessary under clause to fulfil the international obligations which we are likely to have to fulfil <e>", "<cs> forgive me for being rather boring since we are all getting to our feet so many times <e> <s> but i said advisedly that the noble lord lord melchett was not making the policy of the government because as i understand it the noble lord lord melchett would like to go to a position which the <e>", "<cs> if i may say so i do not think that there is any question of losing face <e> <s> my noble friend and i on the front bench are surprised that when the government set out explicitly that we intend to fulfil our international obligations we should then be told that we are not going far enough <e> <s> i should have thought that that was a reasonable straightforward and honest statement of policy and that is what we intend to stand by <e>", "<cs> i and my noble friend who is dealing with the amendment listened very carefully to what my noble friend lord renton said <e> <s> may we have a look at this amendment and see what we think of it <e> <s> i have a feeling that some of the arguments which have been put not by my noble friend but from the other side of the committee go a good deal further and may be arguments with which we do not agree <e> <s> at the moment i feel that what it is right that we should do is to stick by subsection <e>", "<cs> the message i have received from listening to this short debate is that everybody agrees that it is necessary to ensure that pesticides are applied only through machinery which is appropriate and fit for the purpose but we do not all agree on exactly how that ought to be done <e>", "<cs> may i just answer that question which has come from the noble lord lord melchett on what the government will be doing to regulate application machinery <e> <s> we shall look at each chemical either as a new product or on review and consider the likely machinery by which it will be applied and in this we will not be bound only by the requests of the manufacturers <e> <s> thus each chemical will be approved as we indicate in paragraph of the statement of intent in relation to appropriate application methods and of course other application methods for those particular chemicals will be outlawed <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reply so that there is no misunderstanding on this point we shall look at each chemical <e> <s> it is our intention that the government look under the statutory scheme at each chemical either as a new product or on review and consider the likely machinery by which the product will be applied <e>", "<cs> just before the noble lord lord northbourne ends this debate let me say that i will indeed look at the british crop protection council scheme <e> <s> what i think that the noble lord lord melchett was asking me to do was to write to him and that i will do <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would help if i said a word <e> <s> my noble friend lord craigton said that he could not find the powers in the bill to regulate aerial spraying <e> <s> i realise the difficulties so far as looking at this bill is concerned <e> <s> if one looks at clause <e>", "<cs> the answer to my noble friend is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for her response to my reply <e> <s> it is indeed a considerable additional assistance to farmers in the difficult less favoured areas of this country <e> <s> it will represent about million to million for some <e>", "<cs> my lords in the united kingdom the headage payments for animals are not given for milk cows in the less favoured areas <e> <s> they are for sheep and beef cattle <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that we have in mind to issue a white paper <e> <s> the next step i think is that my right honourable friend the minister will shortly be announcing new grant rates as a result of the public expenditure statement which was made nearly a month ago <e> <s> when my right honourable friend does that we shall again be having very much in mind the need to encourage conservation in our grant policy just as we did a year ago when we made some small but significant changes to the grants which we gave to the less favoured areas for conservationally sympathetic investments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i have the figures only on an area basis but as a result of this operation the noble lord said that the matter had been under consideration for a great many years and i am delighted that it was my right honourable friend the present minister who managed to carry it to a successful conclusion the total area in wales for both the old and the new lfa will be hectares in scotland hectares in england hectares and in northern ireland hectares <e> <s> i cannot give the noble lord lord cledwyn an answer as to exactly what it means to a farmer to qualify in this way but what i think i ought to say is that farmers who are now finding themselves in the new less favoured areas in wales out of the figure that i gave the new less favoured areas amount to extra hectares will have been able to claim the higher rates of capital allowances as from the th february last so there will happily be some retrospective payments of capital allowances <e> <s> so far as the headage payments are concerned as from st january next the farmers in the new less favoured areas will be finding that they are able to claim for cattle as headage payments and headage payments for sheep <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not telling my noble friend that there is to be one <e>", "<cs> my lords the communitys agreed position is that spain ought in principle to have no more access to species of fish subject to total allowable catches and quotas than she already has <e> <s> i hope that answers my noble friends question <e>", "<cs> my lord the noble lord is quite right when he says that the european council adopted an agreed negotiating position on fisheries in the light of the concern felt by member states over safeguarding the balance of the common fisheries policy following <e>", "<cs> my lords i wholly agree <e> <s> the noble lord lord boothby has long experience of these matters and it can hardly be a matter of surprise that i entirely agree with what he has said <e> <s> this is inevitably going to mean a restructuring of the spanish fishing fleet <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i do not think that that matter was explicitly discussed in dublin i think it is implicitly agreed <e> <s> the question discussed at dublin was whether the european council should in the middle of these difficult negotiations and in taking stock decide that they were all saying the same things so far as their attitudes to the enlargement negotiations were concerned <e> <s> they did so decide and i repeat that the agreement at dublin so far as fishing was concerned within the community fully safeguards united kingdom fishing interests <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has made two points in moving this amendment <e> <s> i wonder whether i might take the second one first which is the seizure point which is in fact the effect of this amendment and just say this in reply to my noble friend <e> <s> i do not believe that it would be effective in this bill if one was only to look at the delivery device <e> <s> as i sought to say to the committee last week there is a whole variety of other reasons why spraying may not be up to standard <e> <s> a machine may be eminently suitable for use with one product and may be totally unsuitable for use with another a point which my noble friend made himself when speaking a moment ago <e> <s> a machine which when correctly adjusted maintained and used is eminently suitable as an applicator of a range of pesticides may be totally unsuitable and potentially dangerous if incorrectly adjusted and poorly maintained or misused <e>", "<cs> the answer to the question of the noble lord lord melchett is that yes indeed there is power in the bill to do what he has suggested and indeed to do what my noble friend lord onslow suggests <e> <s> i do not think that on this amendment i should go much further <e> <s> i wonder however in courtesy to the noble lord lord melchett whether i may answer a question that he raised on the previous amendment <e> <s> i was rather slow to my feet and failed to reply to it <e> <s> the answer again is very short <e> <s> if there is misuse of machinery on the farm the answer is that those who are responsible for enforcement and who have powers to sanction enforcement under clause in part iii of the bill namely the health and safety inspectors would be those responsible for checking up <e>", "<cs> first it would be churlish if i did not say to the noble baroness who on the extremely difficult amendment no <e> <s> said that she would be <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord lord john-mackie my noble friend lord stanley and the noble lord lord northbourne have put their finger on perhaps the main problem with this amendment which is that it calls for conditions without stating what the conditions should be <e> <s> that i think was perhaps more implicit in what the noble lord lord northbourne was saying but it was explicit in what the noble lord lord john-mackie and my noble friend lord stanley said <e> <s> indeed the noble lord on the front bench opposite was quite explicit when he said that with the best will in the world with the enormous number of footpaths running across his own farm if there were really stringent conditions this could have a very serious effect on his farming operations and that he would regret this because he felt that he had taken sufficient care and his relations with the local people who are walking on his land were of such a nature that it would not be necessary <e> <s> so if i may say so i think that is the difficulty <e>", "<cs> i have said that the government will look at the suggestion which the noble lord lord walston made particularly in view of the probability that legislation if it reaches the statute book will almost certainly be the subject of some forms of codes of practice <e> <s> but that is in the future <e> <s> i hope that that undertaking is acceptable to my noble friend lord maude <e>", "<cs> for reasons which i have already sought to put before the committee i do not take the same view as my noble friend that it would be practicable to introduce an inspection system for spraying machines <e> <s> that does not mean that the overall objective of my noble friend and the government is not the same <e> <s> we agree that the need is to ensure that pesticides are only applied through machinery which is appropriate and safe for the purpose <e> <s> we are agreed on the ends we are only at a difference on the means <e>", "<cs> i shall give the noble lord a reply which i often find myself giving to those who write to government departments and i know that the noble lord has probably done the same in his time in the past consult a really good solicitor and then await the decision of the court <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene the noble lord was perfectly reasonable to put this point to me again <e> <s> it gives me the opportunity to say that the government feel very strongly that the responsibility for the safe use of pesticides has to rest with the user <e> <s> i have deployed the reasons why we feel that but we do feel deeply <e> <s> so far as the hypothetical case which the noble lord has put to me is concerned i was not meaning to be flippant <e> <s> after all if the noble lord or i were to have the misfortune to go out in a car to be driving and to have a very bad accident it would be a matter for the courts to decide where the responsibility lay if we then started to argue that either our steering had gone wrong or the brakes had failed <e> <s> i really could not from this box conceivably give a different answer from the one i gave the noble lord to the issue which was put to me <e> <s> having said that i take the point that the noble lord is concerned about where the control should lie <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will not mind my saying that even having listened to this debate i feel that the government are right in saying that the point of control ought to be with the user <e>", "<cs> if i may say so i think this is an interesting amendment <e> <s> i was interested in particular in what seemed to he an amendment which proposed what your lordships wished namely to write into the bill a power to set limits for residues and more importantly this is what the noble baroness and the noble lord were chiefly speaking about to specify when pesticides may be used on food crops or on feeding stuffs <e> <s> then when the noble baroness lady robson started talking about minimum amounts i felt that there was an uneasy stirring around me and the feeling came again at any rate to some of my noble friends along the lines of are we not beginning to tie the farming community up so tightly by what we are suggesting that we ought to take care <e> <s> whether or not that is the case it leads me to the conclusion that if we can i think it is better to try to leave the statements in this bill in broad terms before coming down to making the detailed regulations later which the government have promised over and over again will be done only after consultations with all the various interested parties <e>", "<cs> i can understand why my noble friend lord mottistone has suggested this amendment <e> <s> on the face of it it would simplify the wording of this bill but i foresee a difficulty <e> <s> it would restrict the powers to set maximum residue limits in processed foods but also in for instance fish or game if that was felt to be necessary <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend will allow me to look at what he said <e> <s> i give no commitment for the reasons which i have sought to explain <e> <s> perhaps <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount lord monckton the noble lord lord john-mackie and my noble friend lord stodart feel that this is going into <e>", "<cs> could the noble lord repeat the last question <e> <s> i did not hear it <e>", "<cs> i am interested in the debate which has taken place on aerial spraying for the second time <e> <s> we are grateful to the noble lord lord mackie of benshie for flying in in time to enable us to have this debate <e> <s> i think we want to be a little careful about some of the assertions which have been made <e> <s> my noble friend lord stanley made some very helpful remarks but i am not entirely certain that he is accurate in saying that when the caa is awarding an aerial application certificate it does not take into account the experience of the pilot <e> <s> my information is that the agricultural experience of the pilot is a factor but i should like to look into that and maybe my noble friend will as well <e>", "<cs> i thought that it would be implicit that the ministry of agriculture is in touch as i know indeed we are in touch with the department of transport <e> <s> so of course we are in touch with the caa and indeed with the health and safety executive <e> <s> i think that goes without saying <e> <s> the point is that when it comes to the moment when the regulations are made i think that the noble lord can be assured that the hse the caa and the department of transport will have had plenty of opportunity to say what they feel <e> <s> indeed my right honourable friend the minister of transport who is responsible for transport could well be a party to the making of the regulations because regulations always have to be made by two members of the government <e>", "<cs> i must say that i find that a most extraordinary intervention <e> <s> what the noble lord is saying to the government is that because he wants to have a ban and the government do not want to have a ban the government must be wrong and the noble lord must be right <e> <s> i do not find that particularly self-evident <e> <s> i should like to remind your lordships that what the government have been saying on this very important and deeply-felt area of aerial spraying is this our intention is that the regulations to be made under clause if this bill becomes law would be to complement the controls exercised by the civil aviation authority who in their turn are very considerably tightening up on the air navigation order <e> <s> and we will do this by imposing controls on the environmental safety of aerial spraying <e>", "<cs> well i am sorry but the noble lord made it sound as if that is what he wished to do <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will be putting down an amendment to show us what it is that he wishes to do <e> <s> i hope that i have made clear that although that is not what we wish to do we are as concerned as the noble lord and we are prepared to do something about it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord peel for moving very succinctly this important amendment <e> <s> just for the record may i say something that i know your lordships are aware of <e> <s> paragraph of the statement of intent which we circulated makes it clear and i now put it on the record in this committee that we would only consider granting full approval to products which have commercial clearance under the psps and have passed an efficacy criterion such as that provided by the agricultural chemicals approval scheme <e> <s> products which have only provisional or full commercial clearance under the psps would only be provisionally approved under the statutory scheme pending review of their efficacy <e>", "<cs> that is true <e> <s> when i first read the amendment i thought for one moment that it was as though we would be required to agree to clear all applications within a period of two years <e> <s> the noble lord lord walston is quite right as far as that is concerned <e>", "<cs> there will be consultation with others in order to make the regulations <e> <s> therefore i do not think it is appropriate just to put in that consultation should be with the secretary of state for the environment <e>", "<cs> i have a great deal of sympathy with the aim of this amendment <e> <s> i hope what i can say in reply comes very near to it although it does not fully meet it <e> <s> our intentions are to have a rapid clearance system for imports <e> <s> i hope that it is going to be truly rapid <e> <s> the important point is that there should be genuine competition between identical products and we most certainly intend to provide for that <e> <s> i should like to take the opportunity in replying to my noble friends amendment to assure the committee that the envisaged arrangements for the quick clearance of imported products identical to those already available in the united kingdom will be as straightforward as is possible within the confines of our responsibility to ensure that all products are safe for use <e>", "<cs> yes we are <e> <s> it is true that it will be a paper exercise but it is a paper exercise which will be based on some details which i outlined when i was speaking <e> <s> certainly the community for their part believe that this will work properly that this is a proper basis for saying that one product is identical to another <e> <s> as i understand it the british agrochemicals association believe that this is a sensible way forward and my advice is that the national farmers union are at the moment feeling the same way from their point of view and that this would be a sensible and a safe way to proceed <e>", "<cs> let me reassure my noble friend that the government are conscious of the need of users to have as much flexibility as possible in their application of pesticides and our intention is that they should retain that flexibility <e> <s> we are taking powers to control the use of pesticides and we shall impose conditions on use which are essential for the safety of users other people creatures and the environment <e> <s> our statement of intention at paragraph gives an indication of our ideas on this <e>", "<cs> i do take that point on board <e> <s> this is a most important aspect of the bill and one which in the interests of horticulture we must take with the very greatest seriousness <e> <s> i should like to look carefully at what the noble lord has said as well as at what my noble friend has been saying on this particular amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may answer the specific question which my noble friend has put to me <e> <s> it is a fact that we have been assuring the industry that we are conscious of the need to make allowances for the continued development of pesticides which are to be used by farmers and growers on minor crops and we are considering various ways of implementing that assurance <e> <s> the noble lord lord melchett in an amendment amendment no <e> <s> a which he has very helpfully taken with this one has put forward one option which is compulsion <e> <s> another would be in some way to provide farmers and growers with direct access to the approval process in other words so that growers could make direct representations to those who are responsible for giving approval perhaps through the good offices of adas <e> <s> those are two suggestions as to how one might go about this <e>", "<cs> it may be i think that we must see how we go <e> <s> there are certainly two options and the noble lord has put them very clearly <e> <s> my answer off-the-cuff to the noble lord lord mackie of benshie is that he has put his finger on the problem in the sense that as my noble friend lord stanley said there are products where there is a restriction where perhaps there does not need to be a restriction <e> <s> the obvious example is that a particular product may be said to be suitable only for use by controlled droplet application but it could also be suitable for use by <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord ferrers and to the noble lords lord stanley and lord northbourne for their words of caution about making training and licensing mandatory <e> <s> although the answer to lord melchetts question is that the power is in the bill for licensing in their reply to the royal commission on environmental pollution the seventh report the government said that we did not propose to introduce official licensing arrangements <e>", "<cs> the certificate is of course for the craftsmans certificate <e> <s> the noble lord lord collison is correct <e> <s> in addition to that there are the atb courses <e> <s> when i said that a number in excess of had been trained last year that is in one year <e> <s> the training goes on year by year <e>", "<cs> i do not think that there is any mystery about subsection so far as the question asked by my noble friend lord onslow that is that if you are dealing with as lord melchett says products which are toxic then under subsection it will very frequently be the case that the health and safety executive will need to be consulted <e> <s> as that subsection is drafted in the way it is there will be a duty therefore to consult the health and safety commission <e> <s> that would not prevent the commission from itself consulting its own subcommittees or indeed anyone else <e>", "<cs> i make no secret of the fact that the government take the point that both noble lords have made so far as safety is concerned <e> <s> this amendment clearly touches very closely upon the possible dangers of breaking down large packs of agricultural pesticides and putting them into containers or bags so that sometimes users have little idea as to how strong the pesticides are or even sometimes what they are and how they should be used <e> <s> there is a difficulty and i think that in a way the noble lord lord john-mackie in moving the amendment indicated it in that sometimes there are genuine reasons why one wants to include the non-agricultural use of pesticide preparations <e> <s> perhaps i may go on from the noble lords particular situation to say that there are the institutional but non-domestic users of pesticides like local authorities transport undertakings and indeed forestry concerns and so on <e> <s> they would be affected by this amendment <e> <s> so with respect i do not think that the amendment as drafted at the moment really will do <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to give further thought to the very important aspect of safety perhaps we can return to it at another stage <e>", "<cs> if i may say so if we have in any way slipped up with the manufacturers of spray equipment in particular the noble lord lord john-mackie has certainly made sure that we put that right by ensuring that the consultations which i keep saying we are going to hold i thought it was for the second time round will most certainly be held <e> <s> i think with respect there is a difficulty about this amendment because it is not just the manufacturers of spray equipment who are involved <e> <s> there are many other people who we are genuinely consulting and if we were to include them we would need an enormously long list <e> <s> i except from that of course the health and safety commission which we have already been talking about <e> <s> they are in an important position with regard to this bill both on grounds of safety and because the commission officers are going to be responsible for the enforcement powers in part iii <e> <s> but with that exception if we then start to pick out particular private interests we get into difficulties <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord northbourne for expanding this amendment and i assure him that in drafting the bill we bore in mind the position of research workers <e> <s> i believe that clause <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord walston for those words of caution <e> <s> i am also grateful to your lordships for agreeing to take together these amendments which all have one common theme namely disclosure of information that is received in the process of scrutinising applications for the clearance or approval of pesticides for safety <e> <s> although the amendments have that common theme they are all a bit different <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> in the names of the noble lord lord mackie of benshie and the noble baroness lady robson appears simply to require publication despite the fact that the noble lord lord mackie wisely said that we had of course to be very careful about commercial confidentiality <e>", "<cs> our intention would be to publish under the regulations a document which would set out the type and standard of tests and experiments to be carried out <e> <s> the document would be continually updated so that we might take advantage of any scientific developments in the fields of toxicology and environmental biology risk assessment and other areas without delay <e> <s> to enshrine the tests in regulations could impede that progress <e> <s> i do not think it is possible to establish a definitive list of tests which all pesticides must go through <e> <s> some tests would be appropriate only to one type of pesticide and not to another <e> <s> in some cases the need for a particular test may come to light only after we have seen the results of other experiments <e> <s> so that is why i would not want to see them enshrined in the regulations <e> <s> but i have seized the opportunity to try to indicate our intention and i think that it is very similar to the intention of the noble lord lord northbourne <e>", "<cs> i think that the status would be that which those who were responsible for the clearance procedure would be expecting <e> <s> if those who were submitting the applications had not complied with that guidance then the chances of getting a clearance would be that much less <e>", "<cs> i think there may be some misunderstanding on the part of the noble lord and the noble baroness a misunderstanding which i shared before i had advice on this <e> <s> a high proportion of pesticides are exported either as concentrates or in bulk for formulation in the country where they are to be used <e> <s> scrutiny of the labels with which they are to be shipped would do little to influence the labels on the packs finally getting to the people who will use them <e> <s> i think that one has to take that into account in formulating an amendment <e>", "<cs> a rather different argument applies here <e> <s> the effect of the noble baronesss amendment is that packaging standards for sending pesticides overseas shall be the same as packaging standards within the united kingdom <e> <s> i am advised that the international maritime dangerous goods code of the international maritime organisation which would deal with sea transport and the international civil aviation organisations technical instructions which deal with air travel impose broadly speaking packaging requirements in accordance with the class of substance in other words toxic substances and the degree of risk which would be more stringent than those which would be expected for the home trade <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord lord john-mackie that this is an important amendment <e> <s> as i understand it it is one on which there is quite a lot of pressure of public and indeed of professional opinion <e> <s> no doubt that is what has prompted the noble lord lord walston to put down this amendment <e> <s> however i am worried as to whether this is the right way to proceed on this bill <e> <s> what is needed on the whole issue of animal medicines is a comprehensive approach dealing with all veterinary medicines and addressing itself to the issue in full knowledge of the powers already available under the medicines act and with a clear view of the remedies which are needed <e> <s> i think there are difficulties with these amendments which in a sense are saying me too for certain veterinary products to provisions specifically designed for pesticides <e> <s> i wonder quite what the effect would be <e>", "<cs> the advisory committee on pesticides is indeed a body of exceptional importance which has given expert and independent advice to successive governments for many years <e> <s> the present government have full confidence in that committee <e> <s> we will most certainly consult the committee in preparing the regulations <e> <s> my noble friend lord stanley is right in saying that i feel therefore that his amendment is not wholly necessary <e>", "<cs> the noble lord raises points about research on clause stand part which is the clause which has occupied us for the whole of today <e> <s> the noble lord asks particularly about the priority we are giving to the development of integrated pest control systems <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord for letting me know in advance the questions he intended to ask <e> <s> here we are following a programme of research and development <e> <s> we hope that it will contribute to reducing pesticide use to the minimum level consistent with efficient food production as recommended by the seventh report of the royal commission on environmental pollution <e>", "<cs> as i am sure the noble lord will be aware there are various controls on advertising in this country all of which apply to the advertising of pesticides <e> <s> there is the british code of advertising practice which is administered by the advertising standards authority <e> <s> there are a number of provisions also in common law and in statutes which can determine the formal content of an advertisement and possibly of most general application there is the trade descriptions act which prohibits among other things misleading statements about goods and services made in advertisements <e>", "<cs> this is a little more than just a matter of style but our preference is for a brief and pointed statement if we are to have a statement of objectives <e> <s> we also have to consider whether any benefit derives from the addition of a very long statement of the kind that we have here <e> <s> it is of course one thing for my right honourable friend to aim to achieve the elimination of over-use pest resistance and so forth but quite another for him to ensure such an effect by regulations <e> <s> that is one absolutely concrete reason why i find difficulty with this amendment <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord is absolutely right in the first part of his amendment and if he will forgive me for saying so not right in the second part <e> <s> i think there is an unarguable need in the first part of his amendment to provide this type of information on product labels and i can assure the noble lord that these powers are already available under clause <e>", "<cs> if i may say so i think those are wise words of caution <e> <s> apart from a rather strange situation where as a nation of shopkeepers we are deterring our salesmen i think if i may say so to the noble lord lord melchett that the amendment would have a rather odd effect because whereas it would have the purpose of requiring pesticide salesmen to have to ask permission before coming and selling on the doorstep it would mean that in order to ask that permission the pesticide salesmen must come on to the doorstep anyway <e> <s> it does not seem to me therefore that one would get very far <e> <s> the householder who would prefer as i understand the noble lord lord melchett would prefer not to have a whole series of salesmen coming to see him would still find that a whole series of salesmen would come to see him to ask permission to come to see him if i am making myself clear <e> <s> if i am making myself clear i am not in favour of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i must say that i would be very reluctant to go along with this amendment in the sense that it refers not only to misuse but to the potential for misuse <e> <s> secondly i am mystified that the noble lord in talking about persistent misuse does not mention the existing law the wildlife and countryside act and the protection of animals act which are both relevant in this particular respect <e> <s> i do not think that this is necessary <e>", "<cs> i have referred to other legislation first and foremost because the noble lord persistently will not refer to it <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that there is other legislation <e> <s> i have mentioned the act and the act <e> <s> if the noble lord would look at those two pieces of legislation that would help us <e>", "<cs> the difficulty this amendment places me in is that the regulations which the amendment mentions namely the packaging and labelling of dangerous substances regulations have been replaced by the classification packaging and labelling of dangerous substances regulations <e> <s> the regulations the amendment mentions do not exist any longer <e> <s> the new ones implement a series of european community directives which are intended to apply identical safety rules in each member state <e> <s> the purpose of this is to eliminate barriers to trade which would arise if each country went its own way <e> <s> pesticides are excluded precisely because we and other member states preferred to take our own decisions on labelling requirements so far as pesticides are concerned <e>", "<cs> with respect it is not impossible and it is not necessarily inappropriate <e> <s> where it is appropriate it is possible for local authority officers to be those who are authorised by ministers to act under the act <e>", "<cs> exactly <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has explained the amendment but perhaps i may be permitted to say that it is not necessary <e> <s> i agree that an advisory body giving expert advice to the government on pesticide matters is essential <e> <s> as the noble baroness knows such a body the advisory committee on pesticides already exists and has done so in various guises since <e> <s> this independent and expert committee consists of members from a range of medical and scientific backgrounds <e> <s> like the noble baroness i shall not run through them except to say that of the various members the department of the environment is most certainly one <e>", "<cs> that is the effect of the amendment of my noble friend lord stanley <e>", "<cs> it has worked extremely well since the s in its present guise <e> <s> i think that it makes it a more flexible body <e> <s> if it is made a statutory body presumably in statute the next step will be to start saying exactly who should be members and who should not <e> <s> i think that we should do best to continue in the way that we are <e> <s> so far as putting consultation with it on a statutory basis we have already discussed that <e> <s> it is something to which i think i am attracted although i do not think that it is absolutely necessary <e> <s> i am committed to discussing that with my noble friend lord stanley <e>", "<cs> we will consider it <e> <s> i cannot honestly see what the advantage would be <e> <s> i will consider it but i have not yet discerned an advantage <e>", "<cs> i give the reassurance that the first report of the acp covering will be published next year and copies will be available in the libraries of both houses of parliament <e> <s> information on all applications considered by the advisory committee and all reviews carried out by it during the year will be included in the report <e>", "<cs> it is certainly not our intention to do anything under part iii which would prejudice the provisions of the health and safety at work act <e> <s> as safeguards to that assurance the committee should note that the health and safety executive is jointly responsible with the nine other departments for the operation of the psps and will continue to fulfil that role in the new arrangements <e>", "<cs> it is normal under the law in england and wales for any person to be free to prosecute any crime <e> <s> obviously the crown takes the large majority of prosecutions but the right of anyone to take prosecutions is normal <e> <s> i have to say that despite what has been said to the contrary by my noble friend lord stanley i do not believe that it is necessary to place a restriction on the right in this area <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> my noble friend is correct <e> <s> for the reasons which i gave in introducing the amendment we are cutting out the due diligence offence because these particular offences have their own mental element as a defence <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> i owe my noble friend a little more of an explanation <e> <s> the reason is that we only want the defence of due diligence to apply to those offences where there is strict liability and by moving this amendment i would achieve that objective <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord dean of beswick for the reception he gave to this order <e> <s> i am grateful also to the noble lords lord rochester and lord stallard who put their fingers on the really important points <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i am sorry that this order followed quickly on the order in another place <e> <s> i understand his desire to see the exchanges there <e> <s> it is a point that i will take on board and ask my right honourable friend to bear in mind in the future although i cannot give any undertaking <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for the way in which he spoke <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord john-mackie and my noble friend lord sandford for speaking on this important order <e> <s> it is an important order for the reasons which were given in the very last words of my noble friend lord sandford because it represents a very considerable amount of the income of farmers in the high hills <e> <s> nobody would know this better than the noble lord lord john-mackie from his ministerial experience and indeed from his knowledge of the hills and uplands north of the border <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord found the explanation of these headage payments complicated <e> <s> this is where the importance of having a good advisory service in this country comes into play <e> <s> of course as the noble lord will remember we do have the area offices as well as the divisional offices and the regional offices <e>", "<cs> my lords i have one final word <e> <s> my noble friend will have noticed in his travels i am sure that there are really only two forms of farming that you can go in for in the high hills either sheep or beef <e> <s> it is no good my noble friend chiding me for trying to produce some other kind of farming that he has not specified <e> <s> the fact is that this order deals with headage payments for sheep and for beef but the headage payments are very closely hedged around with safeguards so far as overstocking is concerned <e> <s> it is particularly because my noble friend is in the chamber today that i have gone into some detail about it and that is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will certainly make special arrangements for employees <e> <s> the question of special arrangements for small shareholders would arise in the context of allocating the shares if the issue were to be over-subscribed <e> <s> in that situation the government would bear the interests of small shareholders sympathetically in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords the trend since this concept started under the labour government of employees owning shares in their companies has gone up and up <e> <s> the government claim that this is because we have given encouragement in successive finance acts <e> <s> we believe that that is good for productivity and it is also good for industrial relations <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that the noble baroness is against privatisation but i point out to the noble baroness that the firms which have been privatised have almost invariably so far as i know increased their turnover which again has been good for jobs and also good for the economy of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i ought to speculate on the contents of the budget but i am confident that my right honourable friend the chancellor will be carefully considering any options for further changes which would give a boost to employee financial participation <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i think i am also aware that the noble lord lord rochester was instrumental in inserting a provision into that bill to make sure that there was monitoring of this whole concept and system <e> <s> perhaps ahead of any debate as the noble lord has his name down for a motion on a day to come i should say on behalf of the government that we reckon that monitoring yearly has shown that both employers and employees regard share ownership as a valuable means of employee involvement <e> <s> the government have made a positive contribution to something which is of value to this country <e>", "<cs> but some are more ordinary than others my lords <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am afraid i cannot <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as exercising influence on policy is concerned the government believe strongly that these things should be done in a voluntary way whether we are talking about employee participation or about the influence of those who have a financial stake in a company <e> <s> the noble lord suggests that the purchase of shares by individuals immediately passes on to other and perhaps larger hands <e> <s> the recent example of british telecom shows that the noble lord is not necessarily correct in that concept <e> <s> my advice is that twice as many applicants for bt shares applied for bonus shares as for telephone bill vouchers indicating an intention to hang on to their shares <e>", "<cs> my lords once those who get shares by these means hold those shares in full they will have the full rights of shareholders <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed i cannot but in answering the noble lord lord oram i was seeking to indicate that those who applied for british telecom shares do not appear to want immediately to dispose of them <e>", "<cs> my lords flotations of shares are made always on the best advice <e> <s> in every single case they have achieved their primary objective which is to see that the undertakings concerned are transferred to the private sector because we believe that that is the way forward <e>", "<cs> my lords the agricultural holdings act as amended provides a statutory framework within which arbitrators should operate <e> <s> it is not for the government to advise arbitrators on how to interpret the legislation <e> <s> however under the community rules milk quota merely attaches to the holding for the use of the occupier <e> <s> milk quota does not belong to tenant or landlord <e>", "<cs> my lords the unsatisfactory nature of this of course derives from the fact that the commission rules are inflexible at the moment on this particular matter <e> <s> the situation is that it is up to the parties to bring out the effects of quotas in their statements of case when an arbitration takes place <e> <s> undoubtedly milk quotas have had an effect on dairy production but there may be alternative farm enterprises open to the tenant to take up the slack capacity on his holding in a particular case <e> <s> it is up to the tenant and to the landlord to make their statements of case and then to wait for the arbitrators decision <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as transferring quota is concerned provided the transfer is not more than litres of milk per hectare then the transfer can he allowed without the ministry of agriculture asking any further questions about it and registering the transfer <e> <s> that is the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures i have are in litres <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding who owns the quota perhaps i am guilty of not having made myself clear <e> <s> the quota is attached to the land <e> <s> it is not owned by either the landlord or the tenant <e> <s> with regard to trying to make the milk quota more mobile in other words being able to move it more easily the <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is almost right <e> <s> there are two forms of quota one is the form for which we opted which is payments through dairies and the other is payments by individual producers <e> <s> where my noble friend is absolutely right is that the payments must not be made by the national governments <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been no collection of levy in the united kingdom because we were not prepared to see our producers disadvantaged compared with others <e> <s> it is true that we now face a dilemma <e> <s> it is possible that we can get out of it through further discussion within the agriculture council <e> <s> what is absolutely certain is that unless other member states change their attitude to the proper collection of the levy the british governments attitude will remain the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend <e> <s> i am glad to say that the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite fair of the noble lord to ask me that question because it is the first question in all farmers minds <e> <s> the primary levy was notified to producers a long time ago but we are still in the final stages of appeals being examined by the tribunal which now numbers members who are trying to finish their work as swiftly as possible <e> <s> what all farmers in great britain know is that there is a considerable undershoot for the present marketing year of some per cent <e> <s> and therefore there should be a good deal of flexibility for production for the rest of the marketing year up to april <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of those reports but the fact is that the commission have put forward two proposals one to prevent movement between direct sale and wholesale quotas which was an aspect raised by my noble friend in a previous question and the other to provide for re-allocation of unused quota between producers or between regions within countries which would benefit producers who are above quota <e> <s> both those proposals if they were to be agreed would be of very great assistance to the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right about the difficulty that exists here <e> <s> my right honourable friend the minister has been pressing for more flexibility again and again at agriculture councils <e> <s> i will certainly draw the attention of my right honourable friend to my noble friends remarks and i give my noble friend an assurance that we will continue to press this important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i must respond to the question which the noble baroness has just put to me concerning the ability of those who attend the meeting at the end of this week to discuss the particular issue of putting something in the bill <e> <s> the official from the ministry of agriculture who will be chairing that meeting gave an undertaking to the noble baroness and i endorsed it that the meeting will be reasonably flexible <e> <s> that means that we shall be interested to hear what the local authorities have to say <e>", "<cs> my lords important points have been made by your lordships and each one requires an answer <e> <s> if i may i will as briefly as possible attempt to answer them <e> <s> if i may intervene now the first thing i want to say is that i understand and sympathise with both my noble friends lord stanley and lord radnor in the sense of fair play that lies behind both this amendment and indeed their next one on the marshalled list <e> <s> that is why i undertook at committee stage to look very carefully at the arguments which your lordships put forward in committee <e> <s> but i hope that the reasons which prompted the government to be unwilling to accept amendments on this subject at the previous stage will become more evident if just for a moment we consider what i believe to be the three underlying purposes of these two amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may go on for just a moment i think i can answer the noble lord <e> <s> this point although at first sight it appears to be one which should give us the greatest concern in fact should not give us concern <e> <s> once the act comes into force the courts will assume that all those who may be directly affected by it will know of its provisions and since these provisions enable emergency orders to be made the government believe that the courts would be ready to hold that polluters if they exist appreciate that emergency orders may cause loss to people who would not otherwise have suffered <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly there are a number of difficulties with the amendment which the noble lord lord mackie of benshie has put forward <e> <s> i would wish to put a couple of points to the noble lord in addition to those which have been made by other noble lords <e> <s> part i of this bill does not affect liability for damage resulting from the escape of dangerous substances <e> <s> that liability already exists and rests upon the polluter and the noble lord lord mackie said quite clearly in his opening remarks that that liability was in the right place <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord radnor has explained in speaking to his amendment that this would deal with a problem of major concern to oyster growers <e> <s> in our personal capacities i think that my noble friend lord swinton and i heard my noble friend lord radnor from rather different points of view <e> <s> i am a non-oyster eating sailor and my noble friend lord swinton is a non-sailing oyster eater <e> <s> but having said that on behalf of the government i would be reluctant to accept this amendment for two reasons <e> <s> the first is that when the problem first came to the governments notice as indeed it has it was agreed that the only suitable powers available to ministers lay in the control of pollution act <e> <s> i should like to say to my noble friend lord radnor that the government have been considering drafting regulations under that act and i understand that an announcement may be made soon <e> <s> in those circumstances i would ask my noble friend to consider that it would be inappropriate to duplicate any possible action by the government by taking powers in this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord northbourne spoke in this sense in committee when this amendment was originally moved by the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> as short a time ago as yesterday the noble lord lord northbourne spoke to me about this point <e> <s> i attached the governments view to the concept that the environment covered the word soil even though i understood the reasons which prompted the noble lord to inject the word soil into this amendment <e> <s> i would go a little further and say that the word environment includes not only soil but also air and water <e> <s> therefore i think we must hesitate before we start off down the road of putting more and more things into what at the moment is both a succinct and a broad statement of objectives for part iii <e>", "<cs> my lords i can reply to the concluding words of my noble friend by saying that i accept the principle of what he is saying and that i should like to be free to say that we will table government amendments to clauses <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i recognise the concern which has prompted this amendment <e> <s> but i should repeat that the power which the noble lord lord melchett seeks with this amendment to provide for the government is already provided by the general powers to impose conditions on the use of pesticides <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord onslow for pointing that out although my noble friend went on to reach the conclusion that it would do no harm in this particular case to indulge in a bit of double legislation <e> <s> but for the record because the noble lord lord melchett has asked me this question may i make it absolutely clear that it would be perfectly possible using the power in clause to say that certain or all pesticides may not be sprayed from the air or that certain or all pesticides may not be applied from the air in certain cases and that would be temporary or indeed it could be permanent <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am sure with great respect that the noble lord will recall from his experience in the ministry and throughout his career that great care is i understand taken in giving clearance under the psps about the toxicity and the type of the pesticide being cleared for aerial spraying <e> <s> i think that i am on record as making that very important point <e> <s> all that falls into the ministry of agricultures side of aerial spraying <e>", "<cs> my lords i have mentioned many of your lordships who took part in the debate on this subject in committee and once again we have had a considerable debate at the report stage <e> <s> first let me say thank you to your lordships for the welcome sometimes a qualified welcome that all of your lordships have been good enough to give to the fact that the government have responded to what your lordships have said on this difficult subject by coming forward with an amendment which if agreed to will put on the face of the bill a provision as regards divulging information so far as data on pesticides are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i had better take advice on that particular point <e> <s> my noble friend lord renton is a very wise adviser <e> <s> just at the moment his advice has put me in a certain difficulty <e> <s> as this is a somewhat generic question which my noble friend lord onslow has asked about the laying of regulations perhaps i may have a moment or two and try to reply to it when i speak to a succeeding amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may have the leave of the house to reply to the noble lord lord mackie and simply say that this is a matter for the noble baronesses to decide <e> <s> as help has arrived from another quarter perhaps i may reply to my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> the answer to the reference to regulations being laid in draft in the bill is that regulations are draft regulations until they receive the approval of parliament <e> <s> the reference to draft regulations is standard and not a special provision of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords in correspondence my noble friend lord mottistone told me and he has repeated it in his speech on this amendment that the cocoa chocolate and confectionary alliance who have the task of ensuring the quality of cocoa imported <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful both to the noble baroness and to the noble lord lord melchett for raising this issue again <e> <s> it gives me the opportunity to tell the house what i thought i had written to the noble lord lord melchett about after the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> but if i did not put pen to paper or if the letter has gone astray i offer my apologies to the noble lord i will look into that <e> <s> i am extremely sorry <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the concern of my noble friends lord stanley lord radnor and lord monk bretton that pesticide users should have access in a free market to all the safe and effective products that they need <e> <s> it was to try to help to fulfil that need so far as farmers are concerned that we introduced a procedure for the rapid clearance of identical imports only a few weeks ago <e> <s> the noble lord lord melchett is right <e> <s> the whole argument here turns on the use of the word similar in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i absolutely take the point which has just been made by my noble friend lord radnor that it is of advantage to a farmer to combine two or more spraying operations into one <e> <s> that is a right and sensible thing to do in the right circumstances <e> <s> i am very glad that pesticide manufacturers are increasingly indicating on their product labels when this is possible even for products manufactured by different companies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord radnor for changing the amendment which my noble friend proposed in committee <e> <s> we can see the real issue much more clearly in this <e>", "<cs> my lords it is necessary for me to spell out what your lordships have so far been good enough to agree to this afternoon on this particular subject <e> <s> first we have agreed as a result of amendment no <e> <s> a that the regulation-making powers shall include the power to make information available <e> <s> secondly it is to be made available in the public interest in the sense that the wording of government amendment no <e> <s> a says that it will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness and to noble lords for their reaction to this amendment <e> <s> no <e> <s> and with it to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the noble baroness said that she assumed that the annual report would be published as we have already decided is very desirable <e> <s> that assumption is absolutely right <e> <s> broadly speaking the committees functions carry on with the additional statutory responsibilities laid on the committee about being consulted regarding regulations under the bill <e> <s> the noble baroness asked whether the committee would be able to initiate advice <e> <s> the answer is yes <e> <s> i realise that this is a point that is often asked <e> <s> it is important so far as committees are concerned <e> <s> i am glad to put that on the record <e>", "<cs> my lords the government certainly share the concern expressed by your lordships that the development of improved pest control techniques needs to be encouraged <e> <s> from the point of view both of the environment and of the economic situation of pesticide users whether they are farmers food processors wood preservers or public health operators it is self-evidently beneficial to encourage the development of the most efficient pest control methods possible <e> <s> the effect of my noble friends amendment is to require the government to appoint a <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an important amendment and the government attach considerable importance to growers of minor crops having access to the full range of pesticides necessary to them <e> <s> for that reason we have been studying this issue with great care since the last stage of the bill <e> <s> officials of the ministry of agriculture have discussed one or two ideas it would be going rather far to call them proposals at this stage with various sectors of the industry concerned <e> <s> i believe it is fair to say that those on whom we have tried out our ideas have been reassured as to the governments intentions in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords at committee stage i acknowledged the importance of training and mentioned the considerable contribution made by the agricultural training boards supported by government funds <e> <s> a large proportion of pest control operators both in agriculture and in the industrial and public health sectors have received training and i go along with all that your lordships have been saying about the desirability of that <e> <s> users of pesticides must have an interest in ensuring that they and their employees know how to use those pesticides effectively and safely <e> <s> the responsibilities put upon them by our legislation is going to make this all the more necessary <e> <s> but if the government need to do more in legislation the authority is there in the bill in our power to impose conditions on use <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not venture into the exchange between the noble lord lord john-mackie and my noble friend lord peel on that point <e> <s> i shall content myself with ending by saying that we shall be continuing our consultations once this legislation is on the statute book <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord john-mackie will not mind me resisting this amendment on the grounds that i have given <e> <s> i think that we all of us are trying to pull in the same direction <e> <s> it is a question however of exactly how far one can go <e> <s> with respect i think that this amendment really goes too far <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to your lordships for the general welcome that has been given to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am not being as helpful as i perhaps might be to the noble baroness who asked me <e>", "<cs> my lords i think from what has been said on this amendment that we ought clearly to be wary of it <e> <s> i think that there are three main reasons for that <e> <s> the first as the noble lord himself said is that misuse is already an offence under other legislation <e> <s> it would also be an offence under regulations to be made under this bill <e> <s> that leads me to the second reason <e> <s> surely what is really needed is good enforcement <e> <s> i very much hope that the efforts of the new enforcement officers authorised by ministers and the continuing action by other organisations will make a major contribution in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords we agree i think that the noble lord lord melchett is on to an important point <e> <s> i should like to give a more friendly reply than i gave last time because there is no doubt that this is a serious issue <e> <s> all pesticides cleared for use in the united kingdom have restrictions placed on their use at the present time <e> <s> their use is restricted to specified crops and restrictions are placed on the timing of application <e> <s> some may only be used in agriculture while others are available to gardeners <e> <s> some may not be sprayed from the air some may only be used under licence by trained operators <e> <s> and so one could go on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to be able to assure the noble lord lord gallacher that clause gives the government sufficient powers to authorise local authority officers to undertake an enforcement role <e> <s> i know from my talk the other day with the noble baroness lady birk and the representatives of the <e>", "<cs> my lords the health and safety executives inspectors are an experienced and responsible body of men not given to the reckless distribution of unnecessary notices as i am sure the farming community would agree <e> <s> i simply say to my noble friend in answer to this amendment that really the amendment would mean that these officers would be forced to seek a conviction when the public interest might be better served if they did not do so <e> <s> it would also mean that it would be impossible to serve notices under subsection because that relates to the risk of the commission of an offence and therefore is a preventative measure <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the first part of my noble friends supplementary question the law already provides of course that all dogs on a highway or in a public place shall wear a collar with the name and address of the owner on it <e> <s> in answer to the second part of his supplementary question the answer is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords for the purposes of this particular law no <e>", "<cs> my lords last november the government put out a consultation paper which included precisely that proposal and that the system should be shifted on to a more local basis <e> <s> comments are still coming in and the time for comments to finish coming in has been set as the end of february <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with the noble lord that this is a problem <e> <s> the consultation paper which was given out by the government last november made the point that if we could have a licensing system on a more local basis then that would give the local authorities among other matters the responsibility for stray dogs <e> <s> if we can do that we will have gone a considerable distance towards solving this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that in a civil action the farmer has a defence for killing or injuring a dog provided he can prove that he was acting to protect his livestock and provided he had notified the police within hours <e>", "<cs> my lords that might be one of the proposals to come out of the consultations which are now proceeding <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the scheme laid before the house on rd december be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the scheme laid before the house on th december be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord john-mackie for responding to this order <e> <s> i entirely take the point from the noble lords experience that the institution of capital grants had a rejuvenating effect upon british agriculture after the appalling years between the two world wars and particularly following the terrible recession of the s and early s <e> <s> both the noble lord and i from my generation are familiar with that because we both of us live in the area which today in the east of the country is thought of as having achieved considerable prosperity and made great contributions to the national economy through arable farming but which was probably hit as hard as any part of the country during those terrible years to which the noble lord refers <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may add one last thing before i give way to the noble lord there is the other side of the coin <e> <s> by taking land reclamation out of grant eligibility we are doing what conservationists have been asking for again and again for the last few years that is to give government support to enable woodland for instance having been felled to be cleared with grant aid so that it can be ploughed up for agriculture <e> <s> that is something which conservationists say they felt that the government could not stand by any longer <e> <s> constantly eating into the high heathlands and moorlands higher and ever higher with grant aid meant eventually that somebody had to say this has gone far enough <e> <s> for those reasons i will not conceal from the noble lord that the land reclamation removal of grants will have those effects <e> <s> but if any farmer wants to re-seed existing grassland then as the noble lord has probably noticed from the schedule that will still be eligible for grant aid <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree that that is entirely the picture <e> <s> because of where we live the noble lord and i are very much aware of the criticisms directed at those of us who farm in the eastern counties but as the noble lord will remember well from the important countryside commission report on the uplands remarks are made about the need to improve the uplands <e> <s> we believed that by bringing in these comparatively high rates of grant for positive conservation operations in both the lfas and the lowlands we were doing the right thing <e> <s> i must beg to differ from the noble lord in that we are also doing the right thing by keeping the differentiation that exists between the upland and the lowlands <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for her intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much welcome this opportunity to set out the governments views on employee involvement and on the role of section of the employment act <e> <s> perhaps i may say first of all that the government are firmly committed to the principle of management informing and consulting employees about matters which affect them <e> <s> we believe however that successful and genuine employee involvement depends as much on a spirit of co-operation as on the existence of formal machinery and that it is therefore best introduced on a voluntary basis <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no secret about what the government have discovered from their monitoring <e> <s> i should have thought that i had been very forthcoming at considerable length this evening <e> <s> therefore i should have thought that the noble lord would have been satisfied not only with my reply but also with the information which the government are giving as we proceed with this particular matter <e>", "<cs> my lords survey information at greater detail may well be required by a wide range of organisations and this should offer potential for future funding through commissioned opportunities <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with the noble lord lord collison that a number of organisations both private and public make use of survey information for instance the water industry civil engineering and indeed nature conservation <e> <s> this suggests that scope exists for generating income to cover future operations <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make it clear that we feel this is an area which ought to be commissioned by those who use the work of the survey <e> <s> i in no way disagree on behalf of the government with the fact that there are many organisations which are closely interested in the work of the survey <e> <s> after obviously the ministry of agriculture could be a future customer but no mass funding has actually been committed from that date onwards <e>", "<cs> my lords i see no reason why there should be that jeopardy <e> <s> i have visited the soil survey and i was shown work which is done for environmental organisations <e> <s> if that work is of value as i believe it is i would envisage that it will be funded in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter for the agricultural and food research council <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for the kind welcome that she has given to the figures that i have announced a welcome of course for what the industry has been doing as regards actually getting the dipping done <e> <s> my noble friend spoke of the future <e> <s> the dipping arrangements for this year will need to be decided after consultations but it is important that my noble friend has given her view that the policy needs to be persisted with <e> <s> i think that the likelihood is that we shall have two dipping periods this year with dates similar to those in <e>", "<cs> my lords i have it in command from her majesty the queen and his royal highness the prince of wales that they having been informed of the purport of the food and environment protection bill hl <e> <s> have consented to place their prerogative and interest so far as they are concerned on behalf of the crown the duchy of lancaster and the duchy of cornwall at the disposal of parliament for the purposes of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords although the effect of the amendment is to enable local authorities to make representations about the making of emergency orders i notice that the main case which the noble baroness has been putting forward in the past few minutes is that it is important simply that local authorities should be mentioned on the face of the bill <e> <s> i think there is an underlying reason which the noble baroness and those who were with her and as the noble baroness very generously said came to talk to me have mentioned <e> <s> i should first of all like to deal with this reason <e> <s> it arises from a worry that powers already provided under another act of parliament might in some way be diminished by the bill which is before us <e> <s> on that issue i can be brief <e> <s> powers which exist under one act are not affected by another unless another act specifically amends those powers <e> <s> the first part of this amendment is therefore unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i understand the concern of my noble friends that innocent people should be protected from financial loss in the event of an emergency order being made <e> <s> they have the absolute right to raise what is a very important point which indeed concerns noble lords in different parts of the house at this stage of the bill <e> <s> they chide me with not giving a clear answer and so i think that what i must now do is try to give an answer which is absolutely clear <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i did not say automatically <e> <s> i said that my advice was very clear on this that the courts will assume that a polluter will have known of the existence of the act and will appreciate that emergency orders may cause loss to people who would not otherwise have suffered <e> <s> therefore the polluter could be responsible not only for pollution caused but also for the cost of safety measures under an emergency order <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can add to what i have already said <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand my noble friends concern <e> <s> it is wholly reasonable to ask the government what one does if one cannot trace the origin of a particular emergency <e> <s> however i would say to my noble friend that in a comparatively small country as ours is it is very unlikely <e> <s> it is conceivable and therefore this is a serious amendment but again i urge the house not to put the cart before the horse <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i thank the noble lord lord parry for giving that example <e> <s> in all seriousness it is an interesting and important one <e> <s> i should like to take away and consider what the noble lord has said <e> <s> but the noble lord will be the first to recognise i am sure that the specific responsibilities of the milford haven authority working within its own statutory area are not the same as the responsibilities over an enormously wide geographical area that this amendment tries to place upon the government <e> <s> i say that as a precautionary note <e> <s> nevertheless i should like to study what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to reply to one point which my noble friend has put to me because it is important <e> <s> it is not just a question of cost it is also a question of seeing that the responsibility should lie with the polluter and that if the polluter cannot be found there should also be a responsibility on people to see that they take proper precautions so far as insurance is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that your lordships have given me something of a hard time on the last two amendments <e> <s> the arguments have been penetrating though i like to think that the governments replies have been convincing <e> <s> as both the noble lord lord john-mackie and the noble lord lord mackie of benshie have indicated i do not think that this amendment is going to deal with a situation which before i go any further may i say we shall continue to look at carefully as has been the case while this bill has been going through the house <e> <s> all your lordships have been at pains to see that this will be a good bill when it leaves the house <e> <s> therefore as the bill goes to another place as i hope it will at the end of today i owe it to your lordships to say that this important point will continue to be looked at from the point of view of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be <e> <s> i think that that underpins the case i have been endeavouring to make <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house in the original schedule we wanted to indicate the person responsible for the substances or articles to be dumped or the vessel to be scuttled <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house so far as residues are concerned that comes in another part of clause but if the noble lord is anxious that we should have the power to specify quantities which is something that i know many noble lords would like the government to do yes there is the power but we do not want to take it for the reasons which i went into at the last stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall reply to amendment no <e> <s> first <e> <s> i certainly agree that there is a good case for specifying in the bill that the advisory committee should be consulted and may offer advice on all matters connected with the objectives of this <e>", "<cs> my lords may i in a way repeat what i have said <e> <s> if the committee is advising the government on all matters connected with objectives in this part of the bill there is really then no need to pick out for particular mention one specific facet of the general objectives <e> <s> the advance that my noble friend lord stanley who has done so much work on this bill has achieved by persuading the government to accept in principle the effect of amendments nos <e> <s> and is that on all matters connected with the objectives in this part of the bill there will be a free exchange of information <e> <s> therefore my answer to my noble friend is that there is no need for amendment no <e> <s> indeed on the thesis of my noble friend lord renton it could jeopardise that free exchange of information <e>", "<cs> my lords during our last debate on this issue i sought to make clear that the power which this amendment seeks is indeed already available to the government under the import export and customs powers defence act <e> <s> therefore my noble friend lord onslow is right about that particular point <e> <s> indeed on the previous occasion the noble baroness said that she was now satisfied that that power exists albeit under the act <e> <s> your lordships may well ask why not therefore accept the amendment <e> <s> the reason is that the effect of this amendment would be explicitly to give the government power to adopt the principle of prior informed consent ahead of other exporting countries for as your lordships know the principle has not been agreed internationally <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i say that the noble lord from his side of the house is putting his finger on the absolute breakpoint in regard to this amendment <e> <s> what i am suggesting is that in the international debate the countries which are debating these matters are concentrating upon the idea of preventing the export of banned or severely restricted pesticides until the consent of the intended recipient is received <e> <s> the effect of this amendment would be to give a power simply to ban the export of a pesticide without prior informed consent whether or not the pesticide happened to be not cleared in this country <e> <s> that is going very much further than the way in which the international debate is centring <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords the new regulations have extended a specific statutory requirement of competence to personnel working on all types of gas fitting work <e> <s> previously a statutory requirement of competence existed only for work with the installation of pipes and appliances <e> <s> i think that we need to see how the regulations now work out in practice <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said i think that the regulations are a step forward <e> <s> they extend far more widely than the previous regulations and notwith <e>", "<cs> my lords i think nonetheless that the noble lord would agree with probably all other noble lords in the house that qualifications are desirable <e> <s> so far as the bill which reached the noble lord is concerned i wish him the best of luck with that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that falls a little wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords they will be given wide publicity through the department of employment and the health and safety commission and executive <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall draw that interesting suggestion to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> yes my lords as i stated in my original answer the setting up of this unit has been helpful in this matter <e> <s> it will not have escaped the noble lords attention that it was set up after the report of the select committee which was under his chairmanship <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the forestry commission those policies are a matter for that commission <e> <s> with regard to the relationship between the ministry of agriculture and the department of the environment i think that this has been made more effective by the setting up of this unit <e> <s> it is a matter of particular satisfaction that the experimental scheme for the norfolk broads which was announced at the end of january by the parliamentary secretary to the department of the environment is in fact to be funded on a basis by the two departments <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are getting very wide of the original question <e> <s> it is a matter which i should like to look into but i do not think it is a matter for the co-ordination unit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their support of the bill but there is one point i should like to take up from the remarks made by the noble lord lord walston because i think it is important <e> <s> i know that the noble lord the government the opposition front bench the noble lord lord john-mackie and other noble lords in the house realise and that we all accept that something needed to be done about the milk situation <e> <s> i gave a really astounding figure at the beginning of my second reading speech saying that support for the milk market in europe last march was costing million a day <e> <s> the total support for the year for the milk market in europe was over billion rising towards billion <e> <s> the whole thing had become unsustainable <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i should be foolish if i did not listen to what the noble lord says and indeed i do <e> <s> the noble lord has long experience <e> <s> but i would make two points by way of rejoinder <e> <s> one is that i cannot help but reflect on the outvoting of the then minister of agriculture some two years ago when my right honourable friend mr walker tried to use the luxembourg compromise <e> <s> it came to that and it was a question of being outvoted <e> <s> then to try to be more constructive in reply to the noble lord lord walston in thinking of the future the present government have used not only their best endeavours but their negotiating skills to get the ministers in the community to map out a firm financial plan for the future <e> <s> we must now try to see that we stick to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer to that question is that it is part of his estate but if i have that answer wrong i hope that i will receive some more advice before we finish which may not be many minutes hence so that i may be able to put it right <e> <s> but i think that is the correct answer <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords i thought that the noble lord was labouring under a slight misapprehension <e> <s> i went out of my way to say that although the bill takes legislative power to say that there can be another scheme of this kind in the future we are not making any provision for another outgoers scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says in his first question that the efficiency of the agricultural industry is all important <e> <s> that of course is why the total expenditure on agriculture fisheries and food in the united kingdom is over million a year a figure which compares very favourably with other major oecd countries <e> <s> the government have said that we believe that the industry ought to take a share in that funding and in the decisions on r d we are consulting the priorities board on those issues <e> <s> the noble lord asked me specifically about the afrc institutes and about the timing of decisions <e> <s> i give the noble lord an assurance that we shall aim to give guidance on our future recommendations from the ministry of agriculture as soon as we can <e> <s> but of course the management of the institutes is a matter for the afrc <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes an important point <e> <s> it will undoubtedly be taken into account by the priorities board in giving its advice to my right honourable friend on the priorities that it foresees in the future for r d i shall also draw my right honourable friends attention to what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> my lords it is because the research work in this country as the noble lord knows very well is of such importance that the expenditure amounts to over million <e> <s> the decision has been taken by the government that they will not make any change to that rate of funding for another year but after that there will be a reduction in commissioned research of million in and another million in <e> <s> i do not agree with the last question that the noble lord put <e>", "<cs> my lords we are putting more emphasis on food research in the future <e> <s> this of course is a response to the report made about two years ago of the select committee of another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can go further than simply to say that within the total budget which the afrc has which of course comes from both my right honourable friends department and the department of education and science it will be for the afrc to decide how it runs its institutes <e>", "<cs> my lords this is perhaps one of the most important points which need to be looked at and i have no doubt at all that it is a point which at this moment is being looked at by the priorities board <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to clarify this because like the noble lord i think one could draw the wrong conclusion from statements that have been made <e> <s> the correct figures are that there will be no change in funding in the next financial year which is there will be a million reduction in the following year and a million reduction in the year after that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for welcoming the fact that we have gone for the continuation of a limited managed market <e> <s> i am glad that the noble lord feels with his experience of the industry that the industry now is content that this is the right way to go forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords very possibly but leave for family reasons for reasons which were deployed effectively not only in the report but also by the chairman of the committee is a proposal which has not found favour either with the committee or with the government <e>", "<cs> my lords as my original reply indicated we think there is time <e> <s> however we have asked for the advice of the priorities board on research and development and we are awaiting that advice on the prospects of industry funding <e>", "<cs> my lords government spending on the entire agricultural fisheries and food research is around the million mark <e> <s> this compares very well internationally <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for northern ireland has not made any statement about research and development <e>", "<cs> my lords as i made clear to the noble lord lord mackie we are consulting the priorities board on research and development which was set up within the last year on both the scope for industry funding in the future and the priorities there ought to be in government spending on research and development <e> <s> the agricultural and food research council is represented on that board in the person of the director and general secretary sir ralph riley <e> <s> i cannot give an answer to the noble lord about the welsh plant breeding station because we must wait for advice from the priorities board before deciding on our plans <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said we must wait for advice from the priorities board <e> <s> what is certain is that the money which my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture has said will be saved on research and development in the next two years and totalling million and then million in the following year has to be found <e> <s> but exactly how it is to be found will depend in large measure upon the advice of the priorities board <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already given a figure for total research and development spending in this country <e> <s> even after reductions we will compare very well internationally <e>", "<cs> my lords the board was set up by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science sir kenneth durham chairman of unilever is its chairman <e> <s> it is giving advice in the ways i have indicated in my previous answers and its members include the director and general secretary of the afrc itself sir ralph riley <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that perhaps <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that perhaps question time has gone long enough and that we might move on to the next business <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is held in great affection in the house <e> <s> i think however that we have had long enough on questions <e> <s> i think that it would be the sense of the house that we move on to the next business <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with that <e> <s> the government do not agree with that <e> <s> people need to price themselves into jobs and wages councils almost certainly are not helping with that process at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a lot of different surveys and views on this <e> <s> surveys by the institute of directors and industrial relations review report indicate that employment is jeopardised by wages council pay rates particularly for young people <e> <s> indeed the consultation paper which my right honourable friend the secretary of state issued on st march referred to a growing body of evidence on this <e> <s> what is certain is that youth rates in wages councils are higher in relation to adult rates than outside wages councils settlements <e> <s> this has an adverse effect on jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make it clear that what the government are saying is that they intend after consultation or subject to consultation to deratify the convention <e> <s> the consultation paper which my right honourable friend has put out has made clear that there are two main options after that <e> <s> there could be abolition of the wages councils or there could be fairly fundamental reform <e> <s> either way i would guess that we would be going along a road which my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter would approve and the government most certainly agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> no my lords we do not mean that but we do mean that the rigidity and inflexibility of the wages councils system is something which needs to be looked at fundamentally <e> <s> that is why my right honourable friend has put out his consultation paper and now awaits reactions to that by st may <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly see whether i can do that for the noble viscount <e> <s> i must apologise in that i do not have those figures with me <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not accept for one moment the last assertion which the noble lord has made <e> <s> on the first part of his question the government believe that either the route of reform or possibly the route of abolition and we genuinely are waiting to see what interested parties think about these in the consultation period provides benefits in the creation of employment <e>", "<cs> my lords that is precisely the sort of matter which the government would wish to take into account during the consultation period <e>", "<cs> my lords we are getting a little wide of the original question but i agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords a statement was made that the agricultural wages council which falls under a different convention will be continuing for the next years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say to the noble lord that as the consultative paper makes clear the opposite appears to be happening at present <e> <s> a great number of workers who fall within the scope of the wages board are apparently content with the minimum being offered statutorily <e> <s> in other words there is no competition either from those who are employed or from those who are employers to try to offer better wages in some cases than those that are being set down statutorily <e> <s> this is yet another reason why the government believe that the present situation is unsatisfactory <e> <s> it needs to be looked at <e> <s> we have not said definitely what we wish or think we ought to do <e> <s> my right honourable friend has put out this consultative document <e> <s> it came out on st march and i know that he genuinely wants views to be given on the paper <e>", "<cs> my lords this is precisely the kind of point on which we wish to hear views during the period that i have mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the noble lords first question is concerned as he very well knows there are strong arguments in favour of postal voting in union ballots but there are also dangers of disfranchising large numbers of trade union members unintentionally <e> <s> that is why in respect of the subject of the noble lords question namely the political fund review ballots in we went for the two options of having to vote either at the workplace or by post but not saying which it had to be <e> <s> on the noble lords second supplementary question corporate funding at the end of the day depends upon the wishes of the shareholders and i think that that is fair and reasonable <e>", "<cs> that is at the annual general meeting my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the compilation of registers is proceeding and we have no cause for anxiety on this particular count <e>", "<cs> my lords the underlying principle of the legislation was that there should be a convenient opportunity for trade union members to cast a vote in ballots <e> <s> this is what the legislation achieved <e> <s> in exactly the same way if the noble lord is a shareholder in a company he can have a convenient opportunity to cast his vote <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may reply to the noble lord lord shinwell i am as much in the dark as is the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a perfectly fair intervention <e> <s> indeed i accept it and i am grateful to the noble lord for casting light on a confused matter <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i think that the underlying principle of the legislation which is that there should be a proper opportunity for trade union members to vote and that it should be done in secret has been achieved <e> <s> now let us see how we go with the legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords ever since this question started i have been in breach i think of what i was told to do a week or so ago by the procedure committee <e> <s> i have been answering a string of questions which have nothing to do with the original question <e> <s> i think that now the time has come to stop <e>", "<cs> my lords i will agree with the noble lord that the rules are now going to be very strict <e> <s> this i think is fair and reasonable and i am sure that it will work <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that having to travel more miles has not so it was found when the study was done deterred farmers from travelling to the veterinary investigation centres <e> <s> nonetheless my noble friend has raised an important point and for that reason i can certainly give her an assurance that there will now be consultations before any final decisions are reached <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with the noble lord <e> <s> the veterinary investigation service is highly regarded and valued by those who use it <e> <s> the efficiency study is aimed at maintaining the service while providing better value for money for the taxpayer <e>", "<cs> my lords these are two separate points <e> <s> may i first answer my noble friend lord sandford <e> <s> the reason why the ministry of agriculture did not make use of the article in the european structures directive over the last five to ten years <e>", "<cs> ten years so far as farm tourism and craft industries are concerned is that it had to be part of an improvement plan and it was not as easy as it is going to be now to get an improvement plan if you were a farmer <e> <s> the other important point is that the maximum investment which could be aided was and the maximum investment which can be aided now is <e> <s> a third point which is persuasive and to which i think i am right in remembering the house of commons select committee on the environment drew attention is that the english tourist authority having given grants for this form of diversification so far as farms are concerned have withdrawn that particular form of grant aid and we therefore think that this is the right moment to embark on giving those forms of grant <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is any clash there but we must wait to see what the consultation period on the document brings forward by way of views which are given <e> <s> my noble friend has given his views <e> <s> perhaps i may have a look at the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but on that particular subject i have no news for my noble friend today <e> <s> i know it is an important subject but i have no statement that i can make today on behalf of the government on that particular issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot quite give the assurance for which the noble baroness asks <e> <s> water can come into the containers they can feed on plankton and the larvae can go out <e> <s> i am advised however that it would require exceptionally high water temperatures for manila clams to breed successfully in our waters <e> <s> for that reason we do not believe that there is a breach of section of the wildlife and countryside act <e>", "<cs> my lords let us keep off yachts for today <e> <s> all that i can say is that if the clams off the queen mary bred they were very remarkable <e> <s> it really needs a succession of highly unlikely events one following another <e> <s> i am advised that it would take exceptionally high water temperatures for manila clams to breed successfully <e> <s> if they did breed development would be exceptionally slow <e> <s> they <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not asked the ncc for its advice <e> <s> we have told it what our view is <e> <s> the council has not informed us that it disagrees with our view <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to admit to the noble lord that i did not really listen to the second question because i am only listening to one question at a time <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest of respect to the noble lord this exchange of information about manila clams has been very useful <e> <s> if the noble lord has other species of fish in mind and cares to put down a question i shall endeavour to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are looking into the question of the slaughter of deer as part of their consideration of the farm animal welfare councils report on the welfare of farmed deer <e> <s> the council recommended that subject to specified safeguards the slaughter of farmed deer should be permitted in slaughterhouses licensed for that purpose <e> <s> the report also contains a note by four members of the council who disagreed with this recommendation <e> <s> the report is currently the subject of consultation with interested parties <e> <s> when this is completed the government will decide what action should be taken in response to the recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords i give my noble friend an assurance that the government will take very serious note of what my noble friend has said in his supplementary question as indeed we shall take serious note of what is said in answer to the very extensive consultations which are taking place at present <e> <s> i also give my noble friend an assurance that in forming their own view the government will carefully consider how the welfare of deer can be satisfactorily protected <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess that i am surprised that the noble lord lord wedderburn is affronted that in order to find out the effect on employers attitudes to taking on people in their businesses both the department of trade and industry together with other departments and the cbi should have approached employers in order to get some answers <e> <s> if i may say so i can see nothing wrong in that <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understood it the noble lord was at pains and went to some length to tell your lordships house that only the pieces of research which the noble lord read out and with which i am familiar were worthy of any notice because they were truly independent and all the other pieces of research were worthy of no notice because they simply asked employers for their answers <e> <s> i repeat i am surprised that the noble lord lord wedderburn should be affronted that in trying to find out what employers think people should think it right to go to employers <e>", "<cs> my lords the last words of the noble lord give the game away <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that when looking at research it is desirable that there is a balance <e> <s> but it is no good saying across the floor of the house that research or attitudinal surveys are not worthy of being received because those who have been doing them have been selective in the people they have gone to see <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i would prefer to be spared that explanation <e> <s> if one wants to find out what it is that employers really believe in relation to this particular matter and the vital point is what employers do believe because it is they who are taking on the employees then it is desirable to ask the employers for their views <e> <s> if i may say so in the academic approach which the noble lord has taken to this matter there are two basic facts which the noble lord has wholly neglected <e> <s> the first is that although i went out of my way at the beginning to say that the government most certainly believe that the employment protection legislation should exist it does not in fact create jobs <e> <s> if anyone has an ounce of human compassion at the present time it is necessary to try to see how jobs can be created <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not come to what i was going to say <e> <s> if the noble lord would care to look at the dti <e>", "<cs> my lords again i concede that the noble lord has enormous experience in this matter and took great care before he came into the house to look matters up <e> <s> but what the noble lord is saying does not honestly chime in with the anecdotal evidence which the noble lord lord wedderburn mentioned and for reasons which i understand dismissed <e> <s> there really is considerable anecdotal evidence coming in to my honourable and right honourable friends in the department of employment from employers who say that they are deterred from recruiting because of the legislation <e> <s> once again with respect i say a lot <e> <s> i have not got the figures but there is a great deal coming in <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord went into a government department and started signing the <e>", "<cs> my lords the evidence is to be found the noble lord lord wedderburn will dismiss it as being partial and i can understand that this is approaching employers and not taking a view across the board in the dti survey and also in the cbi survey which was conducted in and i repeat a very great deal of anecdotal evidence which comes into the department of employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i would certainly be prepared to put in the library an estimate of the number of letters which are received on this particular subject <e>", "<cs> and the number of jobs which would be created <e> <s> that might be more difficult <e> <s> i must confess to the house that i am thinking of the time and <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may reply to the questions put by both noble lords in respect of my right honourable friends statement <e> <s> the noble lords lord john-mackie and lord walston asked about the meaning of the statement where it says that we believe there should be a meaningful reduction in cereals <e> <s> both noble lords know the situation that there should have been a per cent <e> <s> reduction if the guaranteed threshold had worked <e> <s> in fact the commission produced a proposal for a per cent <e> <s> reduction in cereal prices and the federal republic of germany felt that it could not wear even anything like that <e> <s> this is the one area an enormously important area which was left to be decided upon <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to my noble friends first question is that in the event of the situation which he explained there will be considerable strain on the communitys export refunds so far as cereals are concerned <e> <s> this underlines as my noble friend very shrewdly implied in his question the enormous importance of seeing to it that there is a realistic final agreement reached on th and th june in respect of the cereals part of the negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give the assurance the noble lord asked for <e> <s> there will be no supplementary budget so i am advised <e> <s> i think i have already answered the noble lords second question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord stodart <e> <s> i always bear in mind that the beef variable premium was first secured by the noble lord lord peart when he was minister of agriculture <e> <s> although he was a minister in the government of a party of which i am not a member that agreement was none the worse for that <e> <s> it was a fine move by if i may say so a minister of the past whom many of us admired <e> <s> i am very glad that the point has been brought out by my noble friend lord stodart <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have made clear to your lordships house if it is put to the vote under those circumstances we would not participate in any such vote because we take a certain view of the luxembourg compromise and that view has not changed and will not do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely understand why the noble lord with his skill and experience in these negotiating matters puts that point to me but i have to make it clear on behalf of the government that we believe in the concept of the luxembourg compromise and if put to the vote we would not participate <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it would be right for me with little experience compared to my noble friend to start talking about the principle of the luxembourg compromise <e> <s> my noble friend and indeed other noble lords are enormously experienced in this matter and on this specific agricultural statement i would be well advised not to start giving any offerings on a matter of principle <e> <s> however i say to my noble friend that i have clearly heard what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords let us be clear that the extension of the less favoured area scheme in the united kingdom was million hectares last year within a total of million hectares <e> <s> it was a very considerable extension <e> <s> but my noble friend is asking me about appeals from those who wish to be included and who have not been included <e> <s> it is the case that if the european commission at that level is to decide any extra representations those have to be within per cent <e> <s> of a member states territory otherwise we have to make our representations to the council of agriculture ministers <e> <s> finally let me make it clear to my noble friend that we are considering all representations <e>", "<cs> my lords farmers who are unhappy about the exclusion of their area may write to their divisional office giving appropriate details and asking for reassessment <e> <s> with the exception of northern <e>", "<cs> my lords it is precisely because of the reason which my noble friend has outlined that we have set up the representations procedure to enable these problems to be resolved <e> <s> let me repeat that that procedure includes the absolute right of a farmer who is unhappy with a decision to go to the regional panel if he has been rejected on land quality grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the noble lord but i do not know the answer to his first question and if i may i shall write to the noble lord and put my reply in the library because i think that it is of importance to the house to know the answer to the question and i apologise for not knowing it <e>", "<cs> my lords the exercise was undertaken with very great care <e> <s> the case which we put to the council to extend the less favoured areas in this country which as i have said was a very successful operation was the result of what was called the marginal land survey which began in <e> <s> that involved looking at poor quality land near to or contiguous with the original lfas <e> <s> it included desk work relying on maps and local knowledge but it also involved physical inspection on the ground <e> <s> therefore i hope that i have made it clear to my noble friend that the map work was only a part of what was a very closely done exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords it is getting towards per cent <e> <s> some hectares were originally designated in scotland as less favoured and another were added as an extension of less favoured areas last year <e> <s> i have to admit to the noble lord lord ross that i do not have the exact percentage but it is very near the percentage that i hazarded <e> <s> it is very high indeed and i am very glad that that is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords the number of plant health inspectors in england has gone up and there is a good deal of work going on in scotland and in northern ireland on plant health inspection but it is the fact that we still find that diseases come in from time to time <e> <s> i think the one word that one must remember is vigilance <e>", "<cs> my <e> <s> lords if the particular grain seeds in which the grass seeds are lodged are among those mentioned in the european community plant health directive then of course they will need to have accompanying them a certificate from the country of origin otherwise if later my noble friend would like to give me details of the particular grain seeds that he has in mind i shall be able to give him an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree very much with the noble lord who has put his finger on the problems created by the swiftness of travel today compared with a hundred years ago when people used to bring interesting material back from abroad <e> <s> at that time it was very likely the pests which accompanied that material would die in transit <e> <s> this is not the case today <e> <s> it is for this reason that on th april we launched a special campaign for a new set of posters to be put up in all public places and also to be slipped into material being used by travel agents which we hope will be a warning to private travellers about this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we are on a rather different point there <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do indeed bear in mind the interests of inshore fishing as well as of yachting <e> <s> however i think it is fair to make the point that tests have been undertaken for well over two years and have shown conclusively that tbt paint affects not only oysters but other marine species including those important to the marine food chain <e>", "<cs> my lords new types of paint have recently become available which rely on a totally different strategy <e> <s> instead of releasing a toxic substance they present a slippery surface on which organisms cannot settle <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my noble friend lady platt is referring to co-polymer paints which are designed to release tbt at a more steady rate than traditional paints <e> <s> i understand these are available at the present time <e> <s> i am told that the difficulty is that such paints do not stop harmful concentrations of tbt building up in nearby waters <e> <s> this again is a matter which obviously must be examined among the many replies which have been sent in for the consultation paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes an interesting point <e> <s> our primary concern is with small craft continuously moored in estuaries and harbours <e> <s> we believe that is where the danger lies <e> <s> i believe the house would wish to be aware that research has shown that less than one teaspoonful of tin-based paint in million gallons of water is harmful to a wide range of marine organisms <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be clear in my answer to my noble friend <e> <s> at the moment we are at the stage of a consultation paper sent out by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment which nonetheless makes definite proposals which have been the subject of questions and answers for the past few minutes <e> <s> i repeat to my noble friend the undertaking which i have already given in this exchange i know that all the views including that of my noble friend lord harvington will be taken seriously into account in considering the replies to the consultation paper <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question in the governments mind but that the final point my noble friend made is right and that oysters are only part of the problem <e> <s> a large number of other marine species are threatened including those which are important to the marine food chain <e>", "<cs> my lords about three years ago the french introduced controls on tbt paint used on boats <e> <s> my advice is that there has been a marked recovery in oyster production in france <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to those of others of your lordships to my noble friend lord zouche on his excellent maiden speech in todays debate <e> <s> my noble friend spoke from the standpoint of a close interest in disabled people and i am sure it is the hope of all your lordships that he will be taking part in the committee stage of this bill and also in many other debates in your lordships house in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a skilful argument hut if i may say so both the noble lord and the rest of the house are proceeding into the unknown as has been made very clear by the exeter experiment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for making that point <e> <s> that shows that the noble lord lord mcintosh who i suspect has a great deal more expertise than i have in this matter though how we shall all be in a few months time when we have been working on this bill is another matter has overlooked a point which has been made by my noble friend <e> <s> he is possibly overlooking the fact that we none of us can be sure about the future <e> <s> the noble lord smiles but the experiment in exeter produced which from the noble lords speech i do not think he would have predicted a per cent <e> <s> increase which was achieved by great enterprise using a different form of service in a well-known provincial cathedral city <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i shall not give way again <e> <s> i am simply saying that the act which was passed five years ago and which was greeted by a whole list of condemnations which the noble lord lord harris of high cross read out to the house has proved an overwhelming success and has brought a splendid increase in business to the national bus company and to private operators as well <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may reply to that long intervention from my noble friend he and i have worked together on transport matters for a very long time as he reminded the house although perhaps i stopped in the intervening period <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that the act let us be absolutely clear about it has on the overwhelming balance of advantages been a great success not necessarily for the operators but for the travelling public <e> <s> those are the people whom the government want to serve and i know that the bus industry wants to serve them as well <e>", "<cs> my lords let us come to the disappearance of services in just a moment or two <e> <s> i realise that i have much to learn from the noble lord and of course i should be delighted to sit down with him and discuss this aspect <e>", "<cs> my lord i will see what i can find and i cannot give my noble friend a better answer than that this evening <e> <s> however if i may say so my noble friend has gone down precisely the route which two minutes ago i begged him not to go down <e> <s> my noble friend simply says that a local authority a great local authority plymouth has simply said that under a new system it will need more money <e> <s> so far as i know it has not gone deeply into the saving of costs <e> <s> that does not reflect on plymouth because nobody knows about the saving of costs until one turns to the operators themselves to find out what they can save <e>", "<cs> yes but i think that your lordships would need to think about scotland with a little more care <e> <s> for those reasons i really do not think that this clause would be capable of consistent implementation throughout the country <e> <s> that is the answer to my noble friends first question <e>", "<cs> there are two points in reply to that <e> <s> first i believe i am right in saying that the water authority concerned in this case makes a habit of circulating proposals for forthcoming schemes to interested bodies <e> <s> i should have thought that attempts in this particular case have most certainly been made to see that conservation interests and agricultural interests see eye to eye <e> <s> perhaps the best thing to do is leave it there because informal discussions are still going on <e>", "<cs> my lords yes the government take the noble baronesss first point <e> <s> indeed part of the ministry of agricultures commissioned research and in-house research is into breeding crop varieties resistant to pests and diseases in order to reduce the use of agro-chemicals <e> <s> so far as forthcoming advice from the priorities board is concerned i know that it is giving careful consideration to all aspects of the r and d programme including environmental implications <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very interesting question <e> <s> but it is i believe another question <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter for the priorities board <e> <s> in addition to having independent-minded and very distinguished people on it may i remind the noble lord that sir hans kornberg who is a member of the priorities board was chairman of the royal commission on environmental pollution <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would like to get in touch with me and tell me more about that concern i shall of course consult my right honourable friend on it because it would be a serious matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord shepherd for moving this amendment to begin with because it is reasonable that the noble lord should ask for clarification on the transitional arrangements and i shall try to say something to the noble lord on that <e> <s> it is also perfectly reasonable that at the beginning of this long bill the noble lord should ask for the government to underline the wish which has been expressed again and again by the government that we believe that there must be fair competition if deregulation is to succeed <e>", "<cs> and others as the noble lord has said <e> <s> i would expect the noble lord to make this point in view of the close and very successful association that he had with the nbc <e> <s> again i assure the noble lord lord shepherd that this is our intention <e> <s> the directions referred to in paragraph <e>", "<cs> the tendering period i believe will remain as we have outlined it previously <e> <s> it will run i should think almost certainly from the time that registration has taken place which we intend should be by about the end of february up to deregulation day <e> <s> i would say to the noble lord i am sure he will be familiar with this point that my right honourable friend and my honourable friend the parliamentary secretary in another place have consistently made it clear that once deregulation actually takes place we envisage subject to the agreement of parliament that during the autumn of there will be a period of calm and reflection when there will not be any new applications for registration <e> <s> that will give everybody <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord shepherd i think will decide how he wishes to proceed with this particular amendment <e> <s> but perhaps i may briefly say a word in reply to my noble friend lord sandford <e> <s> i understand the points which my noble friend is raising which relate to part iv of the bill <e> <s> that is still quite a long way off even though the noble lord lord shepherd was very encouraging in saying that the government could look forward to getting the bill in the month of october <e> <s> at this stage on the first amendment in committee i would only say to my noble friend that if the municipal companies are to have the encouragement of local authority financial backing it is hardly unreasonable that it should be within the context of the rules of local authority finance <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reply to the noble lord lord shepherd and the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove <e> <s> the noble lord lord shepherd was making the point that whatever i have been saying on behalf of the government there is no assurance that what he is after in the amendment will in fact come to pass namely the introduction of fair competition ahead of deregulation by the setting up of arms length companies <e> <s> i think i would simply say this <e> <s> earlier in my remarks i made the point that my right honourable friend will be in a position where if necessary he can issue directions to passenger transport executives and make orders in relation to local authorities to ensure that what is sought comes to pass <e> <s> there are of course sanctions to both of those order-making powers <e>", "<cs> unhesitatingly i give that undertaking to the noble lord and i go further <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to discuss with me this particular point and there may be some other points later on in the bill either alone or with others whom he may wish to accompany him i shall be very ready to meet him <e>", "<cs> before we go on we did as i think is usual send to the whips offices of the other parties the suggestions of my noble friend lord brabazon and myself on behalf of the government for groupings of amendments but of course it is entirely for my noble friend lady vickers to do as she thinks right <e> <s> we felt that it might be possible to take amendment no <e> <s> with amendments nos <e> <s> and but i leave it to my noble friend to decide how she wishes to take the amendments <e>", "<cs> may i just remind the committee that the effect of the amendment would be to exempt from the bill local authority areas in which the level of revenue support paid by the local authority is less than per head of the population <e> <s> my noble friend has in mind prudent low-spending authorities and i have great sympathy with her point of view but not if i may say so with respect with the effects of the amendment which would drive a coach and horses through the bill if i may use that expression <e>", "<cs> after tendering <e> <s> so far as i know that was the case <e>", "<cs> i repeat to the noble lord that so far as i know that was the case <e>", "<cs> i think we all share with the noble lord lord carmichael a desire to make the interim period before deregulation workable for all concerned including operators local authorities and traffic commissioners <e> <s> indeed on the first amendment of the noble lord lord shepherd i spelled out with apologies to your lordships for the amendments not yet being on the marshalled list our intention to bring forward amendments to schedule in order to produce a more helpful framework for local authorities which have a major job of tendering to carry out before deregulation day <e> <s> i very much hope that when the committee has been able to consider those amendments your lordships will agree that the changes will make a considerable improvement so far as local authorities county councils are concerned <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord carmichael speaks at the end of this amendment i should reply to the noble baroness lady fisher who asked me how i could possibly assert that the government are being helpful to local authorities on this bill <e> <s> the claim that i made if i have made it derives from the small but i think significant changes which i sought to outline which will be put to your lordships committee when we reach schedule which deals with the transitional provisions of the bill <e> <s> although i was interested in the opening speech of the noble lord lord carmichael in moving this amendment as he spoke i could not help but reflect that the thrust of the noble lords amendments is to allow any local authority which wishes to be exempt from the bill to seek to persuade my right honourable friend that it should be exempt on the grounds that for it exemption would mean a more effective transition to meet the transport requirements of its particular area <e> <s> i think this is a little hard considering what i endeavoured to say about the care which the government are taking with schedule <e> <s> this was one of the reasons my noble friends lord peyton and lord nugent of guildford expressed suspicions about the effects which the amendment would have if it were made <e>", "<cs> i will give way to the noble lord in a moment <e> <s> i ask the noble lord lord carmichael when replying to the amendment to say whether he knows of any other major statute with the national scope of this bill which starts this amendment is directed to the first two lines of the bill by saying to those who would be affected by it that if they wish they can be exempted <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend lord sandford will not feel that i am being unduly unhelpful when i say that i really cannot respond to that particular plea <e> <s> i think that this is a fundamental amendment and if we disagree on it i think that we ought to go through the division lobby <e> <s> i must say that i am surprised that the noble lords who have moved these amendments feel that the present state of the bus industry is such that it is desirable to postpone any attempt to put right the inbuilt problems of local services <e> <s> if i may say so i think that my noble friend lady carnegy of lour was absolutely justified when she said to the committee that it was not as my noble friend earl de la warr said a question of worrying about not being able to catch the next bus which came along <e> <s> it was a question of worrying about the bus service in ones area anyway <e>", "<cs> may i come to that in a second <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord shepherd and i agree therefore that any decline in the norfolk services in the <e>", "<cs> of course this is a matter which we shall debate on subsequent amendments <e> <s> i must say that i simply do not agree with the noble lord in this particular case <e> <s> if as the noble lord believes he is right we are in a free country and he has every right to stick to his case then how is it that it was possible to have a broadly comparable spread of services with a very considerable reduction in the money which had to come from the ratepayers pockets <e>", "<cs> i should like to say merely a word or two more in answering the noble lords point <e> <s> the additional observations that i should like to make are these <e> <s> perhaps i may say to the noble lord lord shepherd that although i realise this amendment is first and foremost to extract an answer from me as to how the discussions referred to in paragraph of the governments response to the house of commons transport select committees report are going in addition to that the thinking of the noble lord lord shepherd in this amendment is that the very real advantages that the citizens of tyne and wear and indeed glasgow have derived from the metro and the strathclyde underground can be preserved only if the ptes and the ptas for those areas continue to exercise direct control over all forms of public transport within their areas <e>", "<cs> this amendment has been taken by the noble lord lord shepherd from the act <e> <s> it would continue the shadow of express service licensing that was left in because of a fear that without some formal commitment pirate operators might run or not run at their whim <e> <s> i would repeat the view expressed by my honourable friend the parliamentary secretary in another place that experience has shown that it was unnecessary <e> <s> competition on long-distance routes was fierce for a time and it has remained active with great benefit to the passengers but there has been no sign of pirates <e> <s> commitment there has been but because of the need to notify passengers and run as notified if one is going to make a success of the business not because of any statutory requirement <e> <s> no one ought to know more about that story of success than the noble lord lord shepherd under whose chairmanship nbc express services have operated in the past <e>", "<cs> i said that i would be happy to look at it and of course if i look at it i shall be happy to consult the noble lord and noble lords opposite <e> <s> but i gave warning that i had not discerned from the debate any evidence to the contrary that the assertion of my honourable friend the parliamentary secretary in another place was not correct namely that notification was necessary <e> <s> i should be looking for that kind of evidence <e>", "<cs> it is not unusual i think for noble lords speaking on amendments to ask the government to give replies but i think i shall turn the tables and ask your lordships if i may whether noble lords would give me their advice to a question which i have to ask on this amendment <e> <s> it is indeed the fact as my noble friend lord teviot so shrewdly said that the effect of designation as local services is the reception of fuel duty rebate <e> <s> there is therefore a potent incentive for operators to ensure that their services are eligible for the rebate <e> <s> there is nothing wrong with that and i entirely understand it <e> <s> but it means that those services must have the right number of stopping places in order to qualify because if i may answer the question put to me by the noble lord lord carmichael it is the distance individual passengers may travel which is in most cases the distance between stops <e>", "<cs> the noble lord makes his points with great attraction but for once the noble lord is being a little less than fair <e> <s> on this bill my right honourable friend has never said that this is a bill which relies wholly upon the market <e> <s> it relies on the market in the first instance <e> <s> when the local authority finds what the market will produce my right honourable friend has always been at great pains to say that it is then that subsidy must continue to come into play <e> <s> my right honourable friend in another place has always said that there was no intention in this bill to cut away at subsidy <e> <s> what he wanted to see was better value for money <e>", "<cs> if the committee will allow me we are not necessarily talking about a subsidised service <e> <s> again the whole point is to find what the market will bear <e> <s> we shall be aided in finding what the market will bear if we do not drive operators away from looking at stops which they might otherwise put in by making the picking up of fuel duty rebate too easy by giving a -mile limit <e>", "<cs> i am very ready to do that <e> <s> i should like to look at the scottish point which my noble friend lady elliot of harwood has put forward <e> <s> my noble friend does not need to worry about miles if that is what stays in the bill <e> <s> that will in no way prevent anyone being picked up in an area where the villages are rather further apart <e>", "<cs> i very much agree with the thinking behind these two amendments <e> <s> obviously the safety of vehicles is a prime consideration <e> <s> indeed we are strengthening the powers of the traffic commissioners and providing more vehicle examiners as my noble friend lord brabazon said in answer to the noble lord lord shepherd on a previous amendment <e> <s> but it is also important that bus and coach operators should be financially sound and that fly-by-nights should be deterred <e> <s> it is going to do no one any good at all if bus services come and go and do so because of unsound vehicles and unsound operations <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely surprised that the noble lord lord carmichael raises that point but we are in fact comparing like with like <e> <s> we are comparing the pass rate by the vehicle examiners for those three different sets of operators <e> <s> if i can find out anything more for the noble lord about what those passing and failing figures represent in regard to the reasons for passing and failing i shall of course endeavour to do so but i am not confident that i shall be able to go much further <e>", "<cs> my lords although we are not yet at schedule would that we were <e> <s> i quite understand why the noble lord wants to hear just a word from me about the transitional arrangements because it is they that all the operators and local authorities are concentrating upon for putting this bill into effect <e> <s> i hope that this is an indication that the noble lord is looking forward to the day when the bill comes into effect <e>", "<cs> on my noble friends first amendment amendment no <e> <s> looking at the wording i doubt whether a service is provided in any real sense of that word in an area in which the bus does not stop <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend really thinks that a bus is providing a service to a place if it does not actually stop there to put down or to take up people <e> <s> the provision in this clause as my noble friend said follows one in the previous act under which licences are not required from traffic commissioners in whose areas passengers will neither be taken up nor set down <e>", "<cs> i have a lot of sympathy with what my noble friend has said in moving this amendment <e> <s> i agree it is important that county councils should have very early warning of an operators intentions to start vary or discontinue services <e> <s> county councils and regional and island councils in scotland have very important functions under the bill for the subsidising of non-commercial services for seeking traffic regulation conditions where necessary and for promoting the availability of bus services other than subsidised services and the convenience of the public in using them <e>", "<cs> i think that will be a matter for consultation <e> <s> i would not be at all surprised if some of your lordships will be asking in the normal way in your lordships house as to what the government think at the same time <e>", "<cs> there will be notification to the district councils <e> <s> indeed we shall be touching on this in a subsequent amendment of my noble friend lady vickers <e> <s> but the thrust of the amendment of my noble friend lord monk bretton is that the county councils and the islands and regional councils in scotland should have simultaneous notification by having copies sent to them at the same time as they are sent by the operator to the traffic commissioner because it is those councils which are the highway authorities <e> <s> it is on that point that i am replying on this amendment <e>", "<cs> it might help if i said a few words on the amendment at this stage <e> <s> i thank the noble lord lord ennals for moving it <e> <s> it is an important amendment <e> <s> i am glad that it coincides with the birthday of the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth and i hope that both the noble baroness and i and others in your lordships committee will be able to celebrate at the end of it <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may answer that because it is a very shrewd point such as i would expect from the noble lord <e> <s> i think there are three things which i should say <e> <s> one which i think is of importance is that we have said that there will be a code of practice <e> <s> very well we shall have to see what effect the code of practice will have <e> <s> in some cases codes can have effect so far as courts of law are concerned <e> <s> we have not got as far as that yet but i think that is one leg of the three-legged answer i shall give to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> more than that yes then it is really almost inconceivable that an operator who has any ambition to serve the public and indeed his own interests as well will not be led along to improving his fleet of vehicles whenever he can <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> before the noble viscount lord ingleby speaks to this amendment finally i think i owe the noble lord lord henderson a reply to what he said <e> <s> i must apologise that the amendments which i said that the government were proposing to bring forward are not yet down on the marshalled list <e> <s> of course we shall be having an eye on this particular debate as well but nonetheless the amendments we are proposing to bring forward are not yet down on the marshalled list <e> <s> if it is possible to bring them forward during this committee stage and not for report i certainly shall do my very best to do that <e> <s> if we have to wait until report stage i today give an undertaking to do my best to keep members of the committee who are taking part in this debate fully informed as to what are the governments intentions <e>", "<cs> i am glad of the opportunity to clarify the point <e> <s> when i said to the noble lord henderson that he was correct i should have added a little extra information and i can now do so <e> <s> i am making two points on behalf of the government to the noble baroness and to the committee <e> <s> it is our intention and our difficulty has been that we have been consulting to include the requirements of disabled people and the elderly among the requirements which authorities have a duty to meet under the provisions for securing subsidised services designed to meet the transport needs of their areas <e> <s> therefore authorities would be under a clear obligation to consider what steps they could take to provide additional assistance and support for disabled people when drawing up their policies for support for public transport services <e> <s> it means in effect that an authority under this limb would be able to say to those who are tendering for its subsidised services we are going to stipulate certain things for those particular services <e> <s> therefore the noble viscount lord ingleby is absolutely justified in saying that that only applies to subsidised services <e>", "<cs> i take an amendment of this kind moved by the noble lord with all his experience very seriously indeed <e> <s> but i also take very seriously the intervention from my noble friend lord nugent of guildford who has occupied a very distinguished place in goverment so far as transport is concerned and who if i may put not too fine a point on it knows what he is talking about <e> <s> the noble lords are not agreeing on this <e> <s> one has to see where the truth lies <e> <s> perhaps the more modest and prudent thing for me to say is that almost certainly these things are a matter of judgment and that quite likely the truth is going to lie somewhere in between <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord shepherd ends the debate on this amendment perhaps i may say this <e> <s> many noble lords have talked about the basis of this amendment being the danger of having a sudden changeover <e> <s> i am sure your lordships will not mind if i remind the committee that no noble lord has mentioned the fact that the government are making available million in additional revenue grant through the fuel duty rebate to bus undertakings over the next four years <e> <s> that is additional to what is already being made available by the local authorities <e> <s> in addition to that we are making million available to the development commission in order to start <e>", "<cs> i do not think i have anything to add to my noble friend it is over a period of four years <e>", "<cs> two important issues are raised by the amendment tabled by my noble friend lady vickers <e> <s> it raises two further issues which are rather more technical <e> <s> i shall first say a few brief words about the two technical matters <e>", "<cs> if i may respond to the noble lord he puts his finger upon the difficulty and i acknowledge that it has been put to me in private meetings and discussions off the floor of the committee that there is a problem so far as the bill is concerned with the concept of creaming-off a particular part of a route <e> <s> i shall reply briefly now if the noble lord will allow me with the answers which i wish to deploy later this evening <e>", "<cs> i am a little surprised at this amendment <e> <s> there is in the bill a broad power to make exceptions and as i understand it the intention in the amendment is to replace it with a narrow one <e> <s> i think that that would create difficulties for operators and for the travelling public <e>", "<cs> i can give the noble lord that assurance <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lady vickers for moving this amendment because she is in more detail going into a point which captured the attention of members earlier on namely in what were amendments nos <e> <s> and a in the names of my noble friends lord peyton and lord de la wan <e> <s> on that occasion i gave an assurance to the committee that the vigilance of the commissioners will be maintained and stepped up <e> <s> to require a financial examination before anyone can start a new service would be a massive discouragement to innovation and competition and so would be detrimental to the bus passenger <e> <s> we went over that ground fairly throughly <e>", "<cs> not-content <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the noble lord with interest and i recognise the strong feelings which the noble lord has expressed that the overall impact of bus operations on the environment of an area is something that the traffic commissioners ought to be able to address if the county councils apply to them to determine traffic regulation conditions on such a ground <e> <s> if i may say so i think that the words which the noble lord and the noble lord lord strabolgi have chosen to use in amendments nos <e> <s> and are helpful here <e> <s> i should like to give an undertaking to the noble lord lord ezra to consider this amendment further and if the noble lord will agree to come back after consultation with the noble lord and the noble lord lord strabolgi with an appropriate amendment on that aspect of this set of amendments for the report stage <e> <s> the government feel that the noble lord is on to an important point <e>", "<cs> so far as the other points are concerned to determine conditions on all of these matters would begin to take us into the danger of getting back to route licensing <e> <s> even under road service licensing minor problems on bus stops and choice of routes are sorted out by negotiations and agreement between the operator the local authorities and the police <e> <s> i am sure that common sense will prevail in the future <e>", "<cs> i understand the concern that has prompted the amendment of my noble friend lord monk bretton <e> <s> my noble friend accepts reluctantly that the responsibility for traffic regulation conditions has to be with the traffic commissioner and that the commissioner should have discretion but my noble friend and indeed the noble lord lord mcintosh wants county councils to be able to get conditions imposed immediately when they are convinced that they are necessary and for the commissioners discretion to confirm vary or revoke them afterwards <e>", "<cs> i referred earlier today to the fact that we have said openly in the notes on clauses which noble lords have that we envisage that the regulations for registration will provide that <e>", "<cs> i have great pleasure in saying that i have been persuaded by the speech of the noble lord lord mcintosh in moving this amendment and the <e>", "<cs> i shall look at that point <e> <s> of course we are talking about traffic regulation conditions which the operators need to take on board because it is they who will have to make sure that they do not contravene the traffic regulation conditions <e> <s> i shall look into the point which my noble friend lady macleod has made <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lady vickers is very appealing and i know that she has a very close connection with a great district council and city in the west country <e> <s> i shall reveal to my noble friend that we have indeed considered carefully whether the districts should be the relevant traffic authority in this clause and should have the right to seek traffic regulation conditions <e> <s> so far as the government are concerned we decided against doing so when drafting the bill not because of the county councils paying subsidies indeed district councils can pay subsidies but because the road traffic regulations act functions remain the responsibility of the county council and not the district council <e> <s> even when those functions are exercised through the districts it is the county council which is the road traffic act authority <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend lord monk bretton said in moving this amendment he has made an earnest attempt in bringing forward this amendment to give protection to subsidised services in rural areas <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend that we must have workable arrangements in the future to secure those services because in too many parts of the country we have seen our rural buses disappearing <e> <s> i believe that the bill gives hope for reversing that trend <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i used the word monstrous or evil but i did indeed use the word hidden <e> <s> i used the word hidden because as i said earlier a former very distinguished minister of transport the noble lord lord marsh who was in his place earlier exposed in a few sentences the difficulties of hidden cross-subsidy <e>", "<cs> the one point on which i was perhaps right is that we can argue cross-subsidy until we are blue in the face <e> <s> however i must say to both noble lords opposite and to the noble lord lord shepherd in particular that if the argument now on this amendment is that we need the amendment in order to preserve cross-subsidy that is an argument which strikes at the very principles of the bill <e> <s> my understanding of my noble friends amendment which i still find unacceptable is that it is an amendment which is needed to prevent a certain element of creaming-off <e> <s> i do not accept that argument but that was my understanding of the effect of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i agree with almost all that my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble baroness is referring to a licence to release into the wild <e> <s> indeed if fish of non-native species are to be released into the wild a licence is needed <e> <s> the noble baroness asked me for an example of this <e> <s> the rainbow trout pacific and japanese oysters and portuguese oysters were released or allowed to escape into the wild under a general licence in <e> <s> i am advised that this was with the agreement of the nature conservancy council <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i have no information on that <e> <s> i shall write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords we had a question on this <e> <s> we are of course talking about shellfish because as i said at the beginning of my reply to the noble baroness no non-native marine fin-fish species have been introduced for fish farming purposes into the united kingdom <e> <s> we are therefore talking about shellfish <e> <s> we had a question from the noble baroness on this about the manila clam and in answering for the government i made the point that these are kept under mesh or in containers <e> <s> we believe contrary to the belief of the noble baroness that in those circumstances they cannot escape to establish themselves in the wild <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i cannot give the assurance for which the noble lord asks without <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not agree with the noble lord on that point <e> <s> it is right that we should not have a blanket ban on original importation <e> <s> indeed i was surprised at the question which my noble friend lord kinnoull asked because we do not have a blanket ban on any fish coming in <e> <s> however once the fish species is in there is the mechanism of deposit orders which ensure that when shellfish or any other fish of a non-native species are being moved from one part of the coast of the british isles to another part it is possible to control that <e> <s> i think those are the mechanisms we need except that we also need the mechanism under the wildlife and countryside act to prevent escape into the wild <e> <s> we have that mechanism <e> <s> as i understand it we consult the nature conservancy council when such a licence is issued <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do agree with the commons in

"<cs> during our earlier debate on the subject of the steps that could be taken to improve the accessibility of public transport to disabled people i think i made it clear that the government had been looking with some interest at this amendment <e> <s> as my noble friend lady elliot of harwood has just said it is a fact that the subject of a statutory advisory committee on the lines of this amendment was discussed when a few weeks ago members of your lordships house met my right honourable friend in order to discuss provision for disabled travellers <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that neither the frontal attack of the noble lord lord mcintosh nor the bedside manner of the noble lord lord pitt can persuade me to accept the amendment <e> <s> i am sad about that because it is down in the names of two of my noble friends neither of whom is able to be here lady gardner and lady vickers and it has been moved by my noble friend lord sandford but even those aspects do not make the amendment particularly acceptable to the government <e> <s> indeed i think that it is a bit of a dogs dinner <e>", "<cs> i should perhaps have pointed out that the amendment if accepted does not add so far as the powers of parliament are concerned to clause <e> <s> clause lays down that deregulation for london cannot take place unless an order has been approved by both houses of parliament <e> <s> this amendment of course says that deregulation cannot take place presumably by order until a report on the effects of deregulation has been presented to both houses of parliament <e> <s> the truth of the matter is that this does not take us very much further forward <e> <s> i find it almost inconceivable particularly in this chamber that there will not be probably several debates on how deregulation is working <e> <s> therefore the presentation of reports is not going to carry us much further forward <e>", "<cs> if noble lords would allow me i wonder whether it would be of some help if i intervene briefly on behalf of the government at this stage and then listen to the rest of the debate before making some brief remarks in reply at the end <e> <s> i do so on the understanding which i think i have right that my noble friend lord gridley has moved amendment no <e> <s> b with which go amendments nos <e> <s> c and d and the noble lord lord banks has now spoken to amendment no <e> <s> to which three other noble lords names are added <e> <s> that means that we are having a debate about the national bus company accrued pensions and we are not touching at all on the local authority pension scene which will be the subject of more than one debate a little later on this afternoon <e>", "<cs> i was not wishing to go into detail because i was waiting to see what other noble lords were going to say <e> <s> perhaps i ought to say that there are in a most important position the existing pensioners under the schemes and no doubt something will be said about them <e> <s> as i understand it the existing pensioners under the two schemes have their pensions kept in line with prices <e> <s> as my right honourable friend has said on more than one occasion in another place it would be our intention to try to see that they were in no worse but at the same time in no better position than they would otherwise be because of privatisation <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reply briefly to what your lordships have said <e> <s> that is not an entirely easy thing to do as practically every noble lord who has spoken has a first-hand knowledge of pensions or a very close knowledge of the bus industry or of the national bus company or has a knowledge of both areas <e> <s> nonetheless i shall do my best <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord and he was quite right to intervene <e> <s> my answer is that the government will be prepared to pay what is necessary to achieve adequate insurance cover as we would be to top up the funds adequately in the way that we have given an assurance that we would do <e>", "<cs> a covenant has been referred to in todays debate <e> <s> i certainly accept anything that has been said about it and about an undertaking by the national bus company about the payment of contributions <e> <s> but that is part of the rules <e> <s> the rules are as i understand them and i have the rules with me subject to the overriding stipulation that they can be terminated suspended or reduced by the national bus company if it wishes to do so by way of the employers liability if that is necessary <e> <s> that is an overriding stipulation <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reply specifically to the noble earl lord perth and to the noble lord lord shepherd <e> <s> i give without hesitation the undertaking for which the noble lord lord shepherd has asked <e> <s> the government give an absolute undertaking that in the week before we reach the report stage of this bill there will be a meeting with any noble lord who has spoken on this particular amendment this afternoon <e> <s> i shall make sure that we are in touch with noble lords to that effect <e> <s> i will go further <e> <s> when that meeting takes place if it is to take place in good faith there clearly must be an understanding that if the governments report is not to the liking of your lordships the government will agree to recommittal of this particular clause <e> <s> i give that undertaking <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just say to the noble lord lord banks who is an expert in this field that the question of accrued benefits for those who are moving off to the subsidiaries is of course all part of the calculations and negotiations one must go into when considering the position of those people for the future <e> <s> this is a matter to which we must return on report <e>", "<cs> there is really nothing between the government and the noble lord lord grimond on the objective <e> <s> as the noble lord recorded in his remarks the government have made it clear that they believe in employee acquisition <e> <s> in the white paper of last july we made it clear that we would welcome bids from employees for the units in which they work <e> <s> this is now reflected in clause of the bill which places on the company a duty in carrying out their disposal programme to take such steps as may be practicable to secure that employees are afforded a reasonable opportunity for acquiring a controlling interest in the part of nbc in which they work <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has presented what i think can be described as an alternative configuration for the ownership of bus companies and the administration of tendering in the passenger transport areas in a selection of some amendments to which he has spoken <e> <s> my noble friends plan would involve the passenger transport executives who are as my noble friend said the transport professionals retaining <e>", "<cs> i think we should be dealing with local government finance with the question raised by the noble baroness lady fisher <e> <s> however i should reply to the noble lord lord henderson <e> <s> yes the government amendments apply both to subsidised and to commercially-provided services but they apply in different ways in the sense that they impose a duty with regard to the needs of the elderly and disabled people when authorities are carrying out their duties in exercising their powers to secure the provision of subsidised services and their power to co-ordinate all services both commercial and subsidised <e> <s> there is a duty <e> <s> however although the power to co-ordinate covers all services both commercial or subsidised this leaves us in the position which i endeavoured to explain a week ago which is that local authorities be they ptes or non-metropolitan county councils only have power under these amendments to stipulate that an operator shall provide certain facilities on subsidised services <e> <s> the power to stipulate that an operator shall provide certain facilities does not under the amendments to which i have spoken extend to commercial services <e>", "<cs> i think the answer is no because we still have to debate amendment no <e> <s> za tabled by the noble viscount lord ingleby <e> <s> but this lays a duty on the local authority to have regard to various things connected with elderly and disabled people in providing services and then lays a duty on each operator of local services in the area to co-operate be those services subsidised or commercial <e> <s> therein lies the difference <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord teviot presented this amendment to your lordships as being <e>", "<cs> the restriction on the scope of the duties imposed by clause does not in any case apply to the powers contained in subsection and for that reason the first of the noble lords amendments really is not necessary <e> <s> if lord carmichaels concern is that councils should formulate policies about the use of the power in subsection then i can assure him that nothing in the bill prevents them from doing so <e> <s> since subsection is a discretionary power it would not be appropriate to require authorities to formulate policies about its use <e> <s> the sum total of that rather convoluted reply of mine is that this amendment so far as the first of the noble lords amendments is concerned really is not necessary because the duties imposed by subsection do not apply to subsection <e>", "<cs> i recognise and indeed the bill recognises that district councils in england and wales notably the fifty or so with their own bus undertakings have a special role in public transport matters <e> <s> the bill gives district councils in england and wales the power to subsidise services and i trust that my noble friend will note that attempts in another place to amend the bill to bring the exercise of that power under the control of county councils has in fact been resisted by the government <e> <s> we think it right that district councils which have experience of public transport in their areas should be able to subsidise services and should not have to seek the countys permission before doing so but i have to say that the present amendments which my noble friend lord sandford is dealing with go a good deal further <e> <s> indeed they go against the established allocation of functions in public transport which was brought into existence under the local government act an act which i seem to remember passed into law at a time when my noble friend was working as parliamentary under-secretary in the department of the environment in the government of that day <e>", "<cs> the government fully sympathise with the feeling which has been put forward by the noble viscount lord ingleby in this amendment that the powers of authorities to co-ordinate the provision of all services commercial and subsidised which as i explained earlier this evening is now established by the government amendments should be backed up by a duty for all operators to co-operate with the authorities in the use of those powers <e>", "<cs> may i just say to the noble viscount lord ingleby that i do not think the code of practice can possibly be in operation before the beginning of the new year which of course is when the transitional period begins when the plans of the local authorities require to be made by my right honourable friend <e> <s> as to whether the code of practice could be in effect by the beginning of october which is the moment of deregulation i should be more hopeful about that <e> <s> but i should perhaps like to have a word about that with the noble viscount a little later on <e>", "<cs> i understand why the noble lord lord tordoff has moved this amendment and i do not object at all that we should have a debate on the concept of comprehensive competitive tendering <e> <s> in some respects it would be an advantage over the present arrangements under which local authorities often make bilateral arrangements with one public sector operator often resulting in a pattern of services which makes neither commercial sense nor reflects the social needs of the area and that sometimes happens <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the clause which my noble friend is proposing should not stand part of the bill is to ensure that district councils and in scotland regional councils will not in future have powers to provide bus services directly <e> <s> the clause preserves the powers of councils who are now running such undertakings until a date specified by my right honourable friend giving them a period in which to transfer their undertaking to companies but once that transfer has been completed the powers to provide services directly in other words by operating public service vehicles themselves would be removed under this clause on a date specified by order <e> <s> we propose that date should be th september when as your lordships will know we propose that deregulation should come into force <e>", "<cs> just for once the noble lord has not quite hit the target <e> <s> i was not suggesting in my speech that there will not continue to be some financial relationship between the new companies and their authorities <e> <s> this is a matter to which we shall be coming at a subsequent sitting of the committee and in subsequent clauses when we deal with the financing of the new companies <e>", "<cs> i think we ought to remember in looking at this amendment which has been very persuasively moved by the noble lord lord carmichael that this is a bill which seeks to give passenger transport executives and local authorities very important functions <e> <s> but the role of the local authorities is to supplement the market by using public money to secure only services which would not otherwise be available without public support <e> <s> authorities will also have powers to co-ordinate both commercial and non-commercial services but this will be on the basis of free co-operation with operators rather than on the basis of compulsion <e>", "<cs> no not for a moment not until i have gone through my second hoop <e>", "<cs> i have already spoken to this on clause stand part <e> <s> i also spoke to the subsequent amendments nos <e> <s> oc od and oe <e>", "<cs> associated facilities is i know meant to be a catch-all phrase and helpful to that extent <e> <s> however before i offer to write to the noble lord because that is what i think i must do i am not quite sure whether the noble lord is aware that this particular amendment on which he is querying subsection <e>", "<cs> as i said this expression was used in order to try to be helpful <e> <s> it refers back to subsection of amendment no <e> <s> c <e> <s> that subsection makes it clear that <e>", "<cs> i should perhaps say first in reply to the amendment that the consultative document put out by the department of transport on tendering did indeed speak of a rather longer period for tendering than is provided for now <e> <s> however it was in response to what people said during the consultation process that the government were persuaded that tendering should be carried out fully before deregulation <e> <s> i have to say that although i absolutely understand why the arguments have been put forward on the new clause and i respect the motives for the putting forward of the amendment i am really dismayed at what would be the effect of the amendment compared to the arrangements that are being made particularly in schedule to the bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reply to my noble friend on that particular point <e> <s> as i understand it my right honourable friend would be required to make an order regardless of the merits of the case <e> <s> the only discretion which would be allowed to my right honourable friend would be to agree with the authority the period over which the tendering is to be phased <e> <s> a refusal by my right honourable friend to agree to the authoritys proposals would not necessarily lead to my right honourable friend prevailing it would simply lead to disagreement and in the background there would be the requirement for my right honourable friend to make an order regardless of the merits of the case <e>", "<cs> my noble friend and i must not keep on having exchanges onthis matter even though this is the committee stage because both of us can read what is in subsection of the amendment <e> <s> whereas it is for debate as to how disagreement between the authority and my right honourable friend would turn out what is for sure is that <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord sandford has moved three different sets of amendments on behalf of the noble baroness lady vickers <e> <s> but i think that my noble friend made it clear in his remarks that what he is after is to find the government response to the main thrust of these amendments which is to endeavour to give for instance in amendments nos <e> <s> and which go together more protection to subsidised services <e> <s> i hear my noble friend say thats right <e> <s> i feel that amendments nos <e> <s> and go a little wider than that but if that is what my noble friend is really after may i simply say this <e>", "<cs> i fully appreciate the intention behind the amendment of the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> i must say that i am less certain as to the effect that it would have <e> <s> it gives me the opportunity to make quite clear how the tendering system will apply to the needs of elderly and disabled people <e> <s> the point to stress in reply to the noble lord is that local authorities will under the tendering provisions have full discretion to specify the sort of services they require to meet the needs of elderly and disabled people <e> <s> under clauses and as amended authorities will have a duty to have regard to the needs of elderly and disabled people in securing the services that they consider appropriate <e> <s> in inviting tenders for subsidised services authorities will therefore be able to specify particular vehicle features or to specify specialised services designed for the disabled <e>", "<cs> of course if the noble lord asks me to do so i shall be only too ready to look at this amendment and no doubt there will be an opportunity for the noble lord and myself to consult together between the two stages of the bill <e> <s> but i would simply repeat that in drawing up their invitations to tender under clause the needs of the elderly and disabled will be taken into account <e> <s> if that is the case and it is the case because we have amended the bill in that way then when one gets to the point at which this amendment is directed when the tenders come back in the needs of the elderly and disabled have already been taken into account in going out to the tenderers <e> <s> it is at that moment i am suggesting to the noble lord that the authority needs to look at the results of those tenders without having it said again that the authority must have regard to the needs of elderly and disabled people <e>", "<cs> i am a little worried that i shall not be replying very effectively to my noble friend <e> <s> he is dealing with amendments nos <e> <s> and together <e>", "<cs> that is right but leaving aside amendment no <e> <s> for the moment amendments nos <e> <s> and bring us to a pair of amendments which with great respect to my noble friend do not make sense <e> <s> there is one negative too many in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i think that all i wish to say to my noble friend and i hope he will not think that i am being discourteous in replying briefly is that it is our intention in the bill that local authorities should if they wish have the power to compel operators of registered local services to take part in concessionary fare schemes <e> <s> this for the first time is where we put our toes into concessionary fare schemes with amendments nos <e> <s> and and i do not think that these two amendments get it quite right <e> <s> we shall be coming back to this in a moment <e>", "<cs> broadly speaking my noble friend is absolutely right in both his questions <e> <s> looking at amendment no <e> <s> i am not quite sure about paragraph <e>", "<cs> i hope i shall not appear to be ungracious when i say that your lordships are asking and the noble baroness in moving the amendment is asking for something which is not in the law at the present time <e> <s> at the moment we have the situation where the passenger transport authorities have the power covering all bus services and also commuter rail services to give concessionary fares <e> <s> in the metropolitan areas the ptas have and will continue to have specific responsibilities for the provision of local commuter rail services under section of the act <e> <s> it is therefore necessary that they should have the power to provide concessions on those services and the bill gives them that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been over this ground already <e> <s> the difficulty here is that the shire authorities do not have the specific powers to provide concessions under the act <e> <s> maybe i missed what the noble baroness lady stedman was saying but i did not hear her saying that what she had in mind which is what i assume she had in mind is that we would be talking about the use of the twopenny rate power in providing concessions on rail services within the area of a shire authority <e> <s> if that is what the noble baroness had in mind that is what my noble friend lord mottistone would have to have in mind in talking about giving concessions from shire authorities for ferry services which are not actually run by the shire authority itself <e> <s> it is a different matter when you are talking about the pta or indeed the authorities in scotland where they are responsible <e>", "<cs> with all friendliness to the noble baroness when she talks about british rail services to peterborough the noble baroness is stretching the principle of this amendment like a piece of elastic <e>", "<cs> i think that the problem with this pair of amendments is one which we have debated before that is that the kind of standard which authorities should be expected to adopt under the amendments is left open and given no criteria <e>", "<cs> yes certainly <e>", "<cs> perhaps that is a point that we can discuss when we talk about this matter <e> <s> the discussion that we have may be quite soon <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to noble lords for receiving this string of long amendments with comparative equanimity <e> <s> the noble lord lord henderson of brompton put to me a question about looking at the drafting again <e> <s> i know that the parliamentary draftsmen will of course always be ready to look at the drafting although it has been a major labour to get these amendments into their present form <e>", "<cs> the first of the new clauses amendment no <e> <s> b would introduce a novel concept and that is per cent <e> <s> automatic direct grant from my right honourable friend towards the cost of any concessionary fare scheme which any local authority wishes to bring into operation under clause of the bill <e> <s> the government fully share the importance which your lordships attach to concessionary fare schemes for elderly and disabled people and indeed for children who are also covered <e>", "<cs> in speaking to the question whether clause shall stand part of the bill i shall if i may speak to amendment no <e> <s> h alone <e> <s> i shall then speak to amendment no <e> <s> j which has some consequential amendments <e>", "<cs> in reply to my noble friend i should like to look at the point <e> <s> if i feel that it is right from a drafting point of view i shall be only too ready to let my noble friend know so that we can have an amendment brought forward at report stage <e> <s> but i should like to look at the point <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful if i reply at this moment to the amendment moved by my noble friend lord monk bretton <e> <s> before i do so i will say to the noble lord lord grimond in respect of the first point he raised that the powers of local authorities in scotland to assist with transport by road and sea will not be affected by this bill <e> <s> indeed specifically written into the bill is the power of scottish local authorities to give subsidies to transport of that kind <e> <s> i will subsume my answer to the noble lords second point in my rather more general response <e>", "<cs> i certainly accept that from my noble friend <e> <s> if i may flesh out what he said he had in mind services which came out from an urban area and went to another urban area and were probably profitable for that reason <e> <s> i think that my noble friend lord de la warr is being very hard in two ways <e> <s> first as i have tried to show just because a bus service starts in an urban area surely we are not going to say to that bus operator you cannot have any encouragement to go running in rural areas and extend your rural mileage <e> <s> but that is what my noble friend is saying <e>", "<cs> i disagree fundamentally <e> <s> the noble lord has returned to his first principles but not the governments <e> <s> the noble lord asserts that over a period of time the benefits of competition will not have beneficial effects upon costs nor indeed upon the services themselves <e> <s> i am sorry if the noble lord lord shepherd thinks that <e> <s> it is not something that the government believe <e>", "<cs> perhaps i ought just to say if i may that of course i shall look carefully at the debate but i should not want the committee to be under any misapprehension <e> <s> i think that there are very great difficulties with my noble friends amendments <e> <s> i attempted to deploy them perhaps at rather great length but nevertheless they are very real difficulties particularly in the three areas where he said that services should be favoured for grants <e>", "<cs> this is an important amendment <e> <s> i have listened carefully to what has been said in the last minutes or so particularly by my noble friend lord teviot who moved the amendment <e> <s> i hope that i can go some way towards reassuring my noble friend the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth and the noble lord lord henderson and also show that i believe that the government need to do some rethinking in regard to the school services <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend finally decides what to do with this amendment i should like to reply to him <e> <s> he undoubtedly has a good point as regards school transport <e> <s> i have admitted it and have recognised it and i have promised my noble friend and the noble lord lord henderson that over the recess i shall take the matter away and consider it as sympathetically and indeed as seriously as possible <e> <s> i think that that goes as far as possible towards being an undertaking <e>", "<cs> i hoped that i had given an assurance that we would look further at the difficulties which may arise for operators of school services should they be deterred from carrying members of the general public by the loss of entitlement to fuel duty rebate <e> <s> the noble lord is helpfully underlining the need for me to look at that as sympathetically as possible and that i undertake to do <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first of all address myself to the main thrust of the amendment of my noble friend lord teviot which as it is printed although the debate has gone wider is an amendment to change the sanction for running a service not as registered to change the sanction which is in the bill at the moment in clause which would be a clawback of per cent <e> <s> of fuel duty rebate for the previous three months to a maximum fine at level currently <e>", "<cs> i do not think i said anything like that at all indeed i do not think i was referring to fuel duty at all <e>", "<cs> i am sorry what i was saying to the noble lord was that it would be a very serious matter i thought if an operator failed to operate according to the particulars he had registered <e> <s> i cited the example of the operator who might jump the gun on the periods of notice for introducing services or variations simply because he thought he might be able to make a very quick profit and would disregard the requirements of registration <e> <s> that is what i was saying i think therefore we all agree that the whole issue of registration although it is supposed to be a very simple and straightforward system under the bill is none the less important <e>", "<cs> i said that i would look with care at what had been said in this debate because i would be very foolish if i did not when both my noble friend lord teviot who has experience at first hand of the bus industry and the noble lord lord shepherd who in a different way has unrivalled firsthand experience have both been giving their advice <e> <s> but i have to say to my noble friend lord teviot that he has picked on the one point where i am sorry there is no give from the governments point of view <e> <s> it is precisely the large bus operator who may not care very much about having a condition attached to his licence by the traffic commissioner for running unreliably <e> <s> that is because the large operator will say it really does not matter to me if a condition is attached that i may not run a particular local service because i have a hundred other local services <e> <s> it was precisely with that in mind that we looked around for what would be the right sanction in the cause of good order in running registered services and decided that the thing to do was to require forfeiture of fuel duty rebate <e>", "<cs> all i can say is that i am worried about this amendment <e> <s> the subject to which the noble lord lord tordoff is referring is very important indeed <e> <s> there is nothing between the government and the noble lord and his noble friends but we need to make sure that we have got it right <e> <s> if the noble lord will forgive my saying so i do not think that the amendment achieves that in fact the wording is a little obscure <e> <s> what really worries me is that clause is intended to further the process of encouraging authorities to see that general public transport and school transport together are not compartmentalised but can get together for the benefit of not only school transport but the public in general <e>", "<cs> i may not be on to a good point here but so far as school transport is concerned i think the noble lord may be disregarding what is written specifically into clause <e> <s> if the noble lord would like to look at that aspect of it i shall be very glad to look at the aspects which the noble lord has put forward in moving the amendment and in speaking again just now <e>", "<cs> i find it entirely understandable that the noble viscount should seek to ensure that facilities and arrangements for any road service which british rail substitutes either temporarily or permanently for a rail service should make provision for the needs of passengers who are elderly or disabled <e> <s> but this amendment which seeks to ensure that any bus substitution service must make provision for any needs of passengers who are elderly or disabled goes well beyond what is required of british railways for the rail passenger network and indeed beyond what the bill requires for bus operators generally <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly reply to what has been said in this debate <e> <s> first i ought to say that if in looking at a rail closure proposal my right honourable friend finds that the hardship which disabled and elderly people would face as a result of substitution by a bus service suggests that the substituted service should make special provision for the disabled and the elderly in that particular case it would be open to him to make it a condition of his consent to closure that the bus service should make provision for elderly and disabled people <e>", "<cs> i think that i must reply to the noble lord lord winstanley on the liberal benches <e> <s> it must be said that it is simply not practicable to ensure that temporary bus subsitution is always suitable for elderly and disabled people which would be one of the effects of this amendment <e> <s> the arrangements for crewe were planned well in advance <e> <s> some temporary substitutions may have to take place at very short notice <e>", "<cs> before i deal with the procedural points which the noble lords lord shepherd and lord mcintosh and now my noble friend lord sandford have put to me perhaps i may say a few words about the merits of the case because although the noble lord lord mcintosh was good enough to say that he would not move what i imagine is amendment no <e> <s> za the noble lord naturally and helpfully if i may say so briefly referred to the case for amendment no <e> <s> za <e> <s> equally briefly if your lordships will forgive me i should like to say a few words about the merits of the case <e>", "<cs> i think that now i have been invited by the noble lord lord shepherd for the second time to turn from the merits of the case to the procedure and i will do so and that does not mean that i have not listened to what my noble friend lord sandford has said <e> <s> i would say to my noble friend in passing that i said that the message from the counties was that the process will be unachievable i did not say it was the message from the districts although my knowledge of and admiration for district councils in this country leads me to believe that they will be able to meet their deadlines if and when this bill passes into law <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord mottistone for what he has said <e> <s> if we are concerned about the notes on clauses i have already given a personal apology that the revised note on clauses was notified to noble lords only very recently <e> <s> but of course the revised amendments have been on the marshalled list for some days <e> <s> my noble friend lord mottistone is quite justified in saying that it is only in fairly recent years that we started having notes on clauses <e> <s> they are very necessary and no one is more glad than i am that we have them <e> <s> but for it to be thrown back in my teeth that the revised notes on <e>", "<cs> all i would say to my noble friend lord sandford is that he may care to glance at clause and he will see that there is some flexibility included in that clause <e>", "<cs> in all friendliness to my noble friend that really will not do <e> <s> whether or not we agree with the governments steps in amendment a and associated amendments and your lordships have agreed to those amendments they set out what i believe is a series of sensible transitional steps to take bus operations through from the beginning of to deregulation day in <e>", "<cs> my lords some of your lordships notably the noble lords lord middleton and lord mackie of benshie earlier questioned fundamentally the thinking which has gone into the presentation of this new package of grants <e> <s> i listened carefully to all your lordships and not least to those two noble lords because all your lordships speak with experience and those two particular noble lords with great experience of the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not a question that i am going to answer <e> <s> i think i should be very wise not to do so <e> <s> i think i must say to my noble friend that i was as forthcoming as i could be in saying that if both parties to a contract are in no doubt on what was agreed and this can be satisfactorily shown then grant will be paid <e> <s> my noble friend will forgive me if i go no further than that this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords we were precisely hoping that the craft industry grants would help so far as this was concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords that is our hope and the rate of grant is per cent <e> <s> on this particular line of thought my noble friend lord radnor said that we <e>", "<cs> my lords i do apologise to my noble friend <e> <s> i entirely take his point now <e> <s> the trouble is that i do not know the answer <e> <s> i should be rather surprised i must say if it was impossible to go down the road my noble friend has suggested but i would just say that very great care always has to be taken by the claimant for a grant that the purpose for which the grant is given is fulfilled <e> <s> i think that both my noble friend and i ought to look carefully at the point he has made and perhaps i might write to my noble friend and give him a definitive answer afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on recommitment upon the bill in respect of clause <e>", "<cs> may i express my regret that the noble lord lord banks cannot be here today but may i thank the noble lord lord tordoff for moving this amendment <e> <s> it fulfils the promise to recommit the nbc pensions clause at this further stage and i am grateful to the noble lord lord banks for setting the matter up by tabling this amendment <e> <s> it reflects the importance which the house attaches to this issue <e> <s> i thought that it might be for the convenience of the committee if early on in this discussion i said just a few words in reply to the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps the committee would like me to say a word in reply to the noble lord lord shepherd <e> <s> i am grateful for the support of my noble friend lord hood on the proposal which has been put forward <e> <s> in reply to this brief debate perhaps i ought to say that the position at last wednesdays meeting was that i put forward on behalf of the government the difficulties of recommitment now because i thought noble lords would assume that the recommitment would be taken at the moment in the bill when this particular clause was due to be debated <e> <s> however it was the specific request of the noble lord lord shepherd that we should consider holding this debate as first business today or as the noble lord added first business on wednesday <e> <s> i undertook to write to noble lords and this i did the following day <e> <s> i am sorry if the noble lord suffered a delay in receiving his letter <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord tordoff speaks finally may i reply to the noble lord lord shepherd <e> <s> the governments offer for loan finance <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a serious debate on an undoubtedly difficult issue <e> <s> the nub of the matter brought up by this group of amendments is that there has to be a trade-off between on the one hand giving local authorities and passenger transport executives enough time for tendering and setting up their companies and on the other hand minimising the delays and uncertainties for operators their staff and passengers <e> <s> every day that we put off deregulation we stretch out the waiting time for the operator <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord somers was justified in putting his finger on an unconscionable period of time which the amendments would represent in putting off the coming into effect of the bill <e> <s> these amendments represent a year and a half from now before the bill would fully come into effect april <e> <s> the noble lord from his independent position on the cross-benches was perfectly fair in putting his finger on that <e>", "<cs> third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords the thinking behind the amendment of the noble lord lord shepherd is that the advantages which have been obtained from the tyne and wear metro can be preserved only if the tyne and wear pta and their passenger transport executive continue to use direct control over every form of public transport in their area <e>", "<cs> my lords i recollect that the noble lord lord carmichael promised to return on report to his concern as to the effects of the abolition of road service licensing on the use of bus stations <e> <s> i have listened with interest to what he has said but i must confess that i am unconvinced that the powers of compulsion which are in these amendments ought to be put into the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords may i answer the question <e> <s> i do not think that the rules of the house allow me to speak again which is why i did not reply to the noble lord but may i ask a question of him <e> <s> am i correct in assuming that there is compulsion in these amendments in the sense that if the traffic commissioner agrees with the representations of the local authority compulsion will then be on the operator <e> <s> will the noble lord agree with my interpretation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to welcome my noble friend lady vickers back to the house and i should like to say that i admire the ingenuity of my noble friend in amassing these lengthy amendments <e> <s> they represent an interesting concept a sort of trial area in reverse although instead of trying out something new and challenging it would i am afraid be trying out something which is old and threadbare <e> <s> there is a fundamental misconception if i may say so that anything which goes wrong with bus services from now on will be the fault of this bill and that unless services improve dramatically which we hope they will we should be better off with the devil we know <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble lord this question <e> <s> how is it that when per cent <e> <s> of the households of this country as i understand it still do not own a car nonetheless the use of buses has fallen dramatically while fares and subsidies have escalated <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may finish replying to my noble friend lord teviot we are not talking about london but about areas which will have passenger transport authorities under the new bill and passenger transport executives still in other words the metropolitan areas <e> <s> we are not talking about london <e> <s> in distinction from my noble friend i am afraid i am not delighted to see these amendments although this is an interesting debate because i think it would be clear folly for the passenger transport authorities representing the ratepayers not to hold the shares <e> <s> i do not believe they would do other than make the companys success their objective in all they do <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord a genuine question <e> <s> we have amendments in front of us and i want to be absolutely certain what the effect of them will be <e> <s> i understood the noble lord at the beginning of his wind-up speech to say that the ownership of the new companies is not in dispute <e> <s> i said on behalf of the government that we felt it should lie with representatives of the ratepayers <e> <s> that is the basic point who should be the holding company <e> <s> there is no difference <e> <s> my understanding of the amendments is that the pte would be responsible for both owning the bus company and indeed <e> <s> for tendering which is a point the noble lord was moving on to but which i will not take up with him <e> <s> this is my <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is anything between the noble lord and the government on this except that i do not think that the amendment is necessary <e> <s> under the bills provisions new section a to be inserted in the act gives to each pta a duty from time to time to formulate general policies about the description of services which the executive is to secure to meet the public transport requirements within its area <e> <s> it is therefore quite clear in the bill that wherever there is such a policy it is the duty of the executive to follow it <e> <s> any powers of the ptes to secure services within their areas are therefore subject to the general policy to control of the pta <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that it is outside the rules of order but may i just say this <e> <s> we are not talking about this on political grounds we genuinely want to get the wording right <e> <s> with respect to the noble lord lord mcintosh he in his turn is not looking at subsection of new section a which makes it absolutely clear that it is the authority which shall from time to time formulate the general policies <e> <s> as i said to the noble lord lord carmichael it is clause which makes it clear that in securing services it is the authority which has the overall responsibility although the pte when one goes back to section a will do the detailed work <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord <e> <s> lord carmichael has undoubtedly got a point here there is no question about that <e> <s> the governments amendment amendment no <e> <s> is particularly addressed to the situation in shire regional and islands councils which combine responsibility for public transport education and social services <e> <s> of course in the metropolitan areas the situation is different <e> <s> the pta and the ptes have responsibility for public passenger transport and the district councils have their responsibility for education and social services <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall come to that in a moment before i sit down <e> <s> in amendment no <e> <s> which the noble lord lord henderson and indeed other noble lords have been good enough to say they welcome we are saying that councils should at least look at their transport expenditure across the board and that the relevant departments of the council should be aware of each others transport expenditure and the opportunities for obtaining better services and better value for money <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord carmichael has rightly pointed out clause presently applies only to bus stations provided by local authorities and ptes <e> <s> among other things the clause prohibits these local authorities and ptes from operating their bus stations in such a way as to <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord henderson in moving the amendment and the noble baroness lady stedman in speaking just now were both good enough to refer to undertakings given and measures written into this bill on the subject of transport needs of those members of the public who are elderly and disabled <e> <s> perhaps i might reply to this amendment by first of all saying a few words about some of the steps we have now agreed to take in the bill and elsewhere to ensure that proper attention is paid to these problems <e>", "<cs> my lords the code of practice is interim in the sense that i trust it will be in existence before the construction and use regulations come into effect <e> <s> however it is not interim in the sense that the code of practice will be in effect and when the construction and use regulations are brought in the code of practice will be withdrawn <e> <s> as the noble lord lord henderson has said the two will then run side by side the code of practice dealing <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the point <e> <s> i know the noble lord has made it clear on the floor of the house that that is the intention and i do not doubt that at all <e> <s> i am saying that this is a difficult point for the government and i do not think that the wording is as clear on this point as it might be although i accept the intentions of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords any credit for what has been written into the bill so far as members of the public who are elderly and disabled are concerned is due to members of both houses and also to my right honourable friend who i think has lent an attentive ear to what has been said not only in another place but also in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested in what the noble and learned lord lord denning has just said <e> <s> perhaps i may say in reply to the amendment that i recognise that my noble friends lord monk bretton and lady vickers have been quite consistent in showing their concern for subsidised bus services during the passage of the bill through your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always ready to talk to my noble friend <e> <s> but i cannot talk to my noble friend on the basis of this amendment because it is so far away from any practicality <e> <s> so far as some scheme for rural services is concerned this is a matter that my noble friend and i went into in great detail with other noble lords at committee stage <e> <s> my noble friend withdrew his amendment on very much the same worries that i have been expressing today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am anxious to get across the point in reply to the amendment that the words <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is asking in this amendment for a specific exemption from tendering for community bus services <e> <s> i share the noble baronesss support for this movement <e> <s> there is no question about it that community buses have done a lot of good and we wish to see that they continue to do so <e> <s> the government are nearer the position of the noble baroness than i think she realises because we are proposing to make regulations under clause to exempt from tendering all agreements to subsidise services which involve subsidies of less than a year <e> <s> it is our feeling that the vast majority of agreements to subsidise community bus services will escape tendering under the <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of places in this bill where a duty is placed on local authorities to conduct themselves so as not to inhibit competition between operators and potential operators of public passenger transport services <e> <s> those duties are there because we believe a healthy competitive market is essential if passengers are to have good and reasonably priced services <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning has explained with great clarity why he believes that is right and i think it is also a thesis to which the noble lord lord mcintosh subscribed in his opening remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take it that we are speaking also to amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords so we are not taking amendment no <e> <s> a just amendments nos <e> <s> and a together with amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords then i shall reply to the amendments which are concerned with disabled people <e> <s> i assure your lordships that the government share the general concern to improve travel facilities for disabled people <e> <s> indeed the noble baroness <e> <s> lady stedman was good enough to say that we had done our best in the bill so far to take on board a number of amendments to seek to ensure this <e>", "<cs> my lords the categories of children defined in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given the definition <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the case i am resisting <e>", "<cs> not content my lords <e>", "<cs> not content my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already spoken to this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been interesting to hear noble lords speak about the concessionary fares and i make no complaint at all that the debate has gone a good deal wider than the amendment because the noble lord lord carmichael with justice said that the provisions on concessionary fares are complex and we did not really have the opportunity to go into them deeply during the previous stages of the bill <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i meant metaphorically <e> <s> that is my answer to the important question raised by the noble lord lord carmichael <e> <s> however i point out that it is one of the advantages of the bill as regards the encouragement which it gives to competition <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e> <s> so far as concerns the parishes i can reassure the noble lord lord tordoff that nothing affects the power under section of the local government act for parishes if they so wish to give concessions under the tuppenny rate power <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an underlying principle in regulations which are to be made on reimbursement that an operator should be left no better but no worse off from his participation in a concessionary fare scheme <e> <s> where an authority fails to discharge its obligation under clause to reimburse an operator the secretary of state may cancel the notice of compulsory participation <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make it quite clear to my noble friend that where an operator is shown to have suffered loss as a result of a failure of an authority to administer its reimbursement arrangements properly i have no doubt that my right honourable friend will wish to see that the operator is compensated for this <e> <s> there is nothing between the government and my noble friend on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand very well the point that the noble lord is making <e> <s> the amendment would allow a fine maximum instead of the contained in the present provision <e> <s> this compares with the penalties for offences which have a direct effect on the safety of the travelling public such as operating without an operators licence or operating without a public service vehicle drivers licence where the maximum penalty is limited to <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene for one moment <e> <s> i think that i ought to say to the noble lord that when he is talking about defrauding this with respect is not the offence covered in clause <e> <s> clause covers failure to provide a concession when under compulsory participation <e> <s> if this is fraudulent it would be a matter for normal criminal sanctions <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord henderson if i may say so <e> <s> he expressed an interest in these matters at an earlier stage and i am grateful to him for his generous remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i was just giving details when the noble viscount lord ingleby came into the chamber <e> <s> it is indeed million which we believe is the necessary allocation and which we are going to make <e> <s> part of the expenditure up to a maximum of two-thirds will be recoverable through the annual lrt ratepayers levy in the same way as ratepayers now contribute towards lrts costs <e> <s> i can assure your lordships once again that lrt fully support this particular approach <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be glad on behalf of the government to welcome these amendments <e> <s> even if others of your lordships wish to take part in the debate i think it might perhaps be for the convenience of the house if i answer my noble friend who asked about the intentions of the government so far as concerns the regulation-making power in regard to these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would have the effect of enabling my right honourable friend to make grants available to authorities <e> <s> in regard to the powers of authorities i would remind your lordships that it is the intention that they should have powers <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount is persuasive on this <e> <s> indeed he was good enough to warn me that he had secured the agreement of british rail but i put it to the noble viscount that i really do not think it makes very much sense to impose a duty on the british railways board in relation to a small part of their operations when no such duty applies in relation to the rail network or other bus operators <e> <s> british rail are aware of concern expressed on this issue during the passage of the bill by the noble viscount and the noble baroness and british rails view which they have made known to the noble viscount is that a general duty to have regard to the needs of elderly and disabled passengers would be acceptable <e> <s> this of course would be a duty of a kind which is infinitely preferable to them to the imposing of absolute standards of the kind proposed in the earlier amendment which was tabled on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i also very much welcome these amendments which have been tabled by the noble baroness lady lane-fox after consultation which was promised with the government <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the noble baroness on bringing forward these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord talks about extending the steps during the transitional period and i had hoped that we had gone some way i think my noble friend lord sandford recognised that we had to give a little more elbow room to local authorities and those authorities who are setting up the new transport companies by adding one month at the end <e> <s> indeed in the reply given to the noble lord <e> <s> lord sandford by i think my noble friend lord caithness about the setting up of the passenger transport companies within the transitional period it was said that there would be more elbow room there <e> <s> we would be talking about st april instead of an earlier date <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord had in mind a particular newspaper report when he was referring to or per cent <e> <s> i believe i am right in saying that the newspaper report went on to say that the surveys on which this statement was based had not been finished <e> <s> so far as concerns the civil service this is indeed true <e> <s> surveys have been undertaken in the north-west of the country and in the county of avon which showed that in areas where the ethnic working population averaged per cent <e> <s> of the total population the numbers in the civil service were only per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the first part of the question from the noble baroness the government are an equal opportunity employer and making ones way in the civil service is on the grounds of merit <e> <s> as to the second part of the noble baronesss question i think that the civil service is doing a great deal <e> <s> a survey of staff in post is being undertaken a survey of recruitment is being undertaken a survey of progress of staff within the civil service is being undertaken and perhaps most important of all a survey of the attitudes of school leavers to the civil service is being undertaken <e> <s> it is in the light of that last survey particularly that it may of course be necessary to decide what further action to take <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to look at that question <e> <s> if i may say so i believe that surveys which have been undertaken since the time of the tavistock report have invariably been undertaken in consultation with the civil service unions <e> <s> however the noble lords question goes rather wider than that reply and i hope that he will forgive me if i look at his question and answer it in writing <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt whether the information is available <e> <s> i pointed out to the house that one of the difficulties of surveys which will be familiar to the noble lord is that of getting replies to the survey questions <e> <s> in fact in the survey which has just been taking place in the county of avon and the north-west of england per cent <e> <s> of staff did not reply <e> <s> it is good news that as i understand it the surveys which will be taking place over the next four years will be undertaken in consultation with the <e>", "<cs> my lords the race relations act is quite clear that there must be no discrimination and in order to decide whether there is one has to look at the details of the act <e> <s> i do not think that my noble friend falls within any of its clauses <e>", "<cs> my lords i think not but in all seriousness the adjuration of the race relations act is no discrimination <e> <s> i am quite certain that the government are an equal opportunity employer and we are determined to remain as such <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord i have not admitted on behalf of the government that there has been such a failure <e> <s> in my original answer to the noble lord lord rochester i endeavoured to go out of my way to say that the recruitment survey for the north-west of the county of avon shows that recruitment in those areas is very nearly up to the percentage of the working population which is drawn from the ethnic minorities <e> <s> however the noble lord has a point but we cannot tell to what extent it is valid until we begin to get more information from the surveys going on at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i said earlier that there had been consultation with the council of civil service unions and other trade unions so far as i know <e> <s> the monitoring programme which is being embarked on at the present time is being done as a result of consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord teviot indeed raised this matter at report stage and i agree with my noble friend that on that occasion i made the point on behalf of the government that we were satisfied that there is no obstacle in the legislation as it stands to public service vehicle operators or indeed anyone else for that matter making representations about applicants for public service vehicle operators licences <e> <s> if these representations are relevant the commissioner will take them into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for his reply to the long amendment which i moved and i apologise that such a lengthy set of amendments are on the marshalled list <e> <s> however as i explained they were first of all in response to points put by the noble lord lord carmichael on report for which we are indeed grateful and secondly they are not intended in any way to change the policy which i have put to your lordships house at previous stages of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer is that it would not be possible but perhaps i should write to the noble lord because it is important to get it right and the noble lord will no doubt wish to send advice to others who are interested <e>", "<cs> my lords we have of course debated on report the provisions with which these amendments are concerned though i think that that debate was in slightly different context <e> <s> as the noble lords lord carmichael of kelvingrove and lord tordoff have explained todays amendments are concerned with clarifying the meaning of the various provisions of the bill which require local authorities so to conduct themselves that they do not inhibit competition <e> <s> i assure your lordships that there is nothing between us so far as trying to achieve clarity is concerned but i find difficulty with these amendments <e> <s> i think that they may accidentally have certain other effects <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i follow the noble lord but i do not think that i agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall certainly take into account what the noble lord says although i cannot say whether we will go beyond what we say on the face of the bill <e> <s> i undertook to write to the noble lord if i was wrong on a previous point <e> <s> i suspect that i may have been in error and so i owe him a letter <e> <s> perhaps i may add something in writing on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords we ought to be clear what it is that we are talking about and what it is that we are not talking about in relation to this amendment <e> <s> i understood the noble lord lord murray to be critical of the jeopardy into which the noble lord asserts pension entitlements accrued before transfer to companies in the local government scheme would be put <e> <s> i think that i ought to quote from my noble friend lord trefgarne who replied to a very similar amendment on th october <e> <s> at col of hansard my noble friend said <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships will know the government and indeed governments before have always taken the view that it was appropriate for concessions for people in the groups about whom the noble lord has been talking namely the mentally handicapped and those who are deaf and dumb and others to continue to be provided by the social services authorities who have the necessary powers with concessionary fares <e> <s> however it become clear during the course of the debate at the previous stage that there are cases where the division of responsibility between authorities could give rise to problems <e> <s> the noble lord lord carmichael wrote me a long letter about this and i should like to thank the noble lord for sending it to me <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may reply to noble lords who have spoken i am grateful to the noble lord lord henderson <e> <s> this was not exactly as the noble lord would have wished <e> <s> apart from anything else i know that the noble lord would have liked it to have been in a separate clause but i endeavoured to explain what were my problems there and the noble lord has been most magnanimous <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are talking here about circumstances in which operators may vary or cancel registrations during the transitional period <e> <s> my noble friends amendments seek to limit what is known as case only to variations resulting from contracts with local authorities or from the submission of nil tenders <e> <s> case does not give <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend strongly resisted the proposal at the last fisheries council meeting <e>

to show that they are usually within the per cent <e> <s> by-catch limit <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise the truth of what the noble lords says but let us at the same time look on the bright side <e> <s> the package of total allowable catches and quotas agreed earlier on this year for this year includes significant improvements in the availability of the main human consumption whitefish stocks in the north sea which is really the area about which we are talking in my noble friends question <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm to the noble lord that denmark would be the main beneficiary from the derogation being proposed by the european commission because it is only the danes in europe who have an industrial fishery <e> <s> i agree with what i <e>", "<cs> my lords i well remember the important report which was the first one for this session of parliament produced by your lordships select committee to which the noble lord lord john-mackie contributed and which we debated on th march <e> <s> i venture to suggest to the noble lord that we have to be just a little careful about figures <e> <s> my advice is that of the total by-catches notified to the commission during the period of the derogation last year tonnes was whiting tonnes was haddock and under tonnes was cod <e> <s> one has to compare that with tonnes of whiting and tonnes of haddock discarded in the human consumption fisheries in <e> <s> i know that those figures cannot be absolutely accurate <e> <s> nobody can completely vouch for them but i think that they cause us to be a little careful when looking at the figures and drawing from them the conclusion that the by-catch situation is on a disastrous course <e> <s> nonetheless i repeat to the noble lord what i said to other noble lords during this question <e> <s> we believe that the commissions present proposal is unwelcome and unhelpful and we shall continue to resist it <e>", "<cs> my lords these are the national returns to the commission <e> <s> i like the noble lord was a little hesitant in drawing conclusions from them <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> the next meeting of the fisheries council is due on th november <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree very much with what my noble friend says <e> <s> i hope that the three-year funding guarantee after the intitial pump priming funding of million runs out in is evidence that the government believe that <e> <s> my noble friend talks about the importance of both the domestic and the export markets <e> <s> it might interest the house to know that exports of food and drink from this country have risen from something over billion in to nearly billion in <e> <s> i think that that is a trend which we should be determined to continue <e>", "<cs> my lords the amount of grain being shifted out of the community in the form of aid is quite substantial <e> <s> on top of that there is community aid as well as national aid which is given in cash terms <e> <s> it is important for me to add in domestic terms that the ministry the nfu and the food and drink federation as well as food from britain have joined together recently to launch a series of joint studies to explore the scope for improving market prospects for united kingdom food production in certain specific sectors for instance pig meat lamb soft fruit convenience salads and oats in manufacturing <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is fair to say that our effort in europe is very effective <e> <s> my noble friend may care to know that the british presence at the anuga world food fair in cologne last

agree with the noble baroness but on this occasion i most cordially do <e>", "<cs> my lords a little dirt never hurt anyone <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend made a public statement which in essence i have repeated in my answers today <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble baroness is a very simple one <e> <s> the move downwards because of the rpi minus per cent <e> <s>

many others probably will do <e> <s> i repeat that my answer to the noble baroness is that for the rest of the decade the working of that part of the british telecommunications act will be of benefit and not otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already pointed out both domestic and business subscribers come under the rpi minus per cent <e> <s> rule <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords but i cannot add to that <e> <s> i think it is perfectly clear <e> <s> that arrangement will continue for the rest of the decade <e> <s> i do not believe that it would be for the convenience of the house if i went yet again over the ground which we have already been over this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i now pass on to the third element in the motion <e> <s> this speaks of maintaining good labour relations which are central to the success of any business <e> <s> as privatisation reinforces the pursuit of business objectives so it reinforces the incentive for good relations between management and employees <e> <s> i am saying to your lordships that in effect privatisation builds up a team spirit <e> <s> but it does more than that and this is to be found in the fourth part of the noble lords motion <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear that the applied plant breeding work at the plant breeding institute is critical to the future of the national seed development organisation and that is why we are looking at the two together <e> <s> it is the governments policy both to encourage industry funding of agricultural research and development and to consider privatisation where this might foster sound management commercial efficiency and good value for money for the taxpayer <e> <s> therefore i do not agree with the first words spoken by the noble lord in asking his supplementary question

and development the amount of <e>", "<cs> my lords the welsh plant breeding station does not fall within the scope of the question nor of my answer save to this extent <e> <s> if the nsdo is privatised it will mean that the afrc and the agriculture department in the welsh office will need to consider separate arrangements for the marketing of future varieties from that station <e> <s> i

with respect to the noble lord we went over this ground last time <e> <s> the difficulty which is not the fault of anybody working at the pbi or the nsdo is that the real costs of government r d on material passed to the nsdo are not paid for directly <e> <s> we therefore do not have a way of knowing exactly what are the costs for the applied plant breeding work of the pbi and we believe that it would be more efficient commercially to consider privatisation of the nsdo and indeed of the applied plant breeding work of the pbi <e> <s> that is what we are considering at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat what i have just said <e> <s> the arrangements whereby payments are made by the nsdo for the varieties that it receives are unusual <e> <s> it makes no payments at all but has a royalty sharing arrangement with and pays a dividend to the exchequer <e> <s> the net result is that nobody knows precisely what the applied plant breeding work at the pbi with the varieties going on to the nsdo is costing <e> <s> that was the basic reason why we originally started looking at the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords with your permission i should like to repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture fisheries and food <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their reception of this statement <e> <s> may i first try to answer the question asked by both noble lords as to whether the payment was based on any form of survey <e> <s> it is the case of course that there has been some time in which the farming community which has suffered so terribly in the north of england and especially of course in northern ireland and in scotland and parts of wales has been waiting because some of them are literally facing a crisis for the reasons which both noble lords deployed in their remarks <e> <s> my right honourable friend together with my right honourable friends the secretaries of state for northern ireland wales and scotland during that time consulted very seriously indeed with the advisory services in all four parts of the united kingdom in order to try to see where as the noble lord lord walston quite rightly said the available resources because obviously there is a finite amount of money although a very great deal is involved in this package could best be brought to bear <e> <s> we felt that the areas which have been chosen were the places where the situation was most serious <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to the noble lord lord grimond that i will draw his remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> however may i make it absolutely clear to the noble lord lord grimond that this is a very long and complicated statement and i know he will perhaps wish to look at it more closely <e> <s> in the early part of the statement it does make it clear that for suckler cows and ewes the rates of payment will be and p per animal respectively and the areas concerned will include the whole of the less favoured areas in scotland as well as throughout northern ireland and of course scotland is covered to a very considerable extent by lfa status <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say i am disappointed by the reception which my noble friend has given to the statement although i do realise that he has suffered along with the rest of the farming community throughout the united kingdom and not least in wales <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that my noble friend comes from a part of wales which will benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord kimball for his references at the end of his question to its now being possible to retain the suckler cow premium even though cow numbers may have fallen away on an individual farmers holding through no fault at all of the farmer but because of fodder problems or abnormal losses <e> <s> indeed do not let us forget too that the sheep annual premium in the less favoured areas is to be brought forward to the tune of per cent <e> <s> of the payment as a payment we hope before christmas <e> <s> i hope that that will be helpful too <e> <s> i was interested in what my noble friend said about farm woodlands <e> <s> the ministry of agriculture together with the departments of agriculture in scotland and in wales produced about two months ago a report called <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lords question concerning the six-year period is that the fourth schedule which is the subject of the first order rests on a relatively new concept giving outgoing tenants in arable areas credit for improving the fertility within the soil by leaving more land under leys than normal farming practice in the area would dictate <e> <s> that is the answer to the question that the noble lord put to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the annual report of food from britain which had most excellent publicity within it and on its cover shows that the organisation has made a most excellent start <e> <s> seventeen commodity sectors now bear the food mark as a guarantee of good quality to the purchaser <e> <s> there is excellent progress with exports and sales both at home and overseas show an optimistic trend <e> <s> i believe that food from britain is pushing this in its promotional work <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed <e> <s> i shall inquire whether there has been contact between the two organisations on that <e>", "<cs> my lords if one compares the exports of food and drink from this country in which was the year before food from britain was set up one sees that they were worth billion and last year exports of food and drink from this country were worth billion a growth of per cent <e> <s> there is no question that in the areas which food from britain covers fresh foods and lightly processed foods exporting abroad will be a great help in regard to the surpluses that are being produced <e>", "<cs> those are in actual terms my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted at what the noble lord says <e> <s> in the climate that we have and with the expertise we have we produce the best food in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely understand the concern of the noble baroness on this point which goes a little wide of the question <e> <s> but however attractive a one-off scheme of that kind is it would not make a tremendous amount of difference to the large surpluses of dairy products <e>", "<cs> my lords with permission i should like to repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture fisheries and food <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord gallacher and lord mackie of benshie for their reception of my right honourable friends statement <e> <s> both noble lords have made observations about the statement so far as sugar is concerned <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the noble lord asked me when and i am afraid i am not in possession of that information but the matter must be returned to <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has a great deal more experience in these things than i have but i venture to part company with him on his expression of view <e> <s> we are dealing with an enormous complex <e> <s> we are also dealing with tasks which the south bank board is creating for work which to some extent has been exercised by the glc central services on behalf of the south bank <e> <s> that is why the original answer referred to rather wider responsibilities <e> <s> i would make the point again to the noble lord that the rates of pay are comparable to those which have been paid for similar work <e> <s> i commend the south bank board for its overall approach to staffing policy as being conducive to economy and efficiency <e>", "<cs> my lords under the rules the posts have to be considered within the rules of the london and metropolitan government staff commission which means that applicants from inside in other words those who have been working for the glc or the arts council have to be considered first <e>", "<cs> my lords basic salaries will be shown as being slightly higher but almost certainly that is because the work will not be done on an overtime basis <e> <s> take-home pay will not be higher <e> <s> the answer to the question which was asked by the noble baroness regarding whether the south bank board will have enough money is that that is a matter for the arts council <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the question of the noble lord lord grimond is no <e> <s> the answer to his second question is also no <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is not comparing like with like <e> <s> the glc was responsible for running the three concert halls and only the three concert halls <e> <s> the south bank board will be the landlord of the whole estate and will it is very much hoped be responsible for presenting an integrated programme of all the arts <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell the noble lord lord barnett how it fits in with government policy <e> <s> we have made it perfectly clear for the past six years that we support the arts <e> <s> that is what we are doing and that is what we shall continue to do <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not a matter for the government <e>", "<cs> my lords we have just given an extremely good up-rating to the arts council and i should have thought that the noble lord would have been satisfied with that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make it crystal clear because it is important that i should do so even though the noble lord has asked a skilful and amusing question <e> <s> i believe on behalf of the government that the south bank board is pursuing its staffing policies in a way which is conducive to economy and efficiency <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble baroness <e> <s> i think that the million was a splendid up-rating from the million which had been negotiated previously by my noble friend lord gowrie <e> <s> therefore it is an extra step in the right direction <e> <s> i can only add that it will now be for the arts council to determine how much of that million is allocated to the south bank board <e>", "<cs> my lords the job creation scheme is something of which we are proud <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely understand my noble friends concern about building alterations being brought within the scope of value added tax <e> <s> indeed my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer is considering representations from the charities vat reform group <e> <s> a meeting was held at the treasury only last week <e> <s> but my noble friend will be aware that we have always felt that the right way to go about supporting the voluntary sector is through direct grants and direct tax reliefs <e> <s> those have been increased enormously since <e>", "<cs> my lords for reasons which the noble lord lord mellish will know we have always reckoned that the way to go about helping the voluntary sector was as i have said through direct grants and direct tax reliefs <e> <s> perhaps i ought just to spell out that direct grants for the voluntary sector have more than doubled since <e> <s> the total of grants to voluntary organisations from all government agencies is well in excess of million a year <e> <s> direct tax reliefs for the benefit of charities have been substantially increased since and are now worth million <e> <s> as this question is about the royal british legion which all of us enormously admire perhaps it is right just to say that the royal british legion housing association limited received million from public funds last year and i am delighted that is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there is a difficulty about which my noble friend knows probably better than i in exempting all charities from vat <e> <s> the chief among the difficulties is that it would be an indiscriminate way of bringing help because the benefits would depend much more on the pattern of spending of an individual charity than on the level of public support which a charity attracts <e> <s> it is for that reason that i come back to the basic point that we have believed in the last six years that the way to go about it is to improve direct grants and direct tax reliefs and we have done an enormous amount in those six years <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that this point was raised at a meeting on th december with my honourable friend the minister of state at the treasury <e> <s> i should be misleading the noble lord lord cledwyn if i did not remind the house that it is of course difficult to protect charities from every budget change <e> <s> i repeat that what is possible and what we have done is to increase direct aid to charities and to the voluntary sector <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed i shall most certainly do that if my noble friend will get in touch with me <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be the view of the noble lord lord paget <e> <s> i am not quite so sure that the taxpayers generally in this country would be all that pleased if in an indiscriminate way all charities were simply relieved of vat and the taxpayers were asked to make up the difference <e> <s> what i think the individual taxpayer understands is that where help is most needed it should be brought to bear effectively and my goodness <e> <s> the present government have done this as is shown by the figures that i have already given to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that to start to reclassify charities would be very difficult indeed <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend however for pointing out the difficult and uncertain territory we would get into if we started going down the road suggested in this question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure my honourable friend would be only too pleased to do that <e> <s> my right honourable friend is of course as it were in purdah before the budget so far as representations are concerned <e> <s> on the second part of the question may i just say to the noble lord lord molloy that i entirely agree with him that we have everything to be thankful for to those who are represented by the royal british legion and not least my own generation <e> <s> however i do not agree with the noble lord that this should simply be thrown on to the state <e> <s> surely the way to do it is to have a splendid organisation like the royal british legion which raises huge sums of money through its poppy day appeal an appeal which of course lies totally outside the scope of vat <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i recognised in my first answer to my noble friend that the change in the scope for alterations regarding vat had a serious bearing on charities and i therefore take seriously what the noble lord said on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord barnett and lord taylor of gryfe for their response to my right honourable friends statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord barnett asked me first of all what will be the penalties for recklessly misleading <e> <s> they will be appropriate <e> <s> it will be necessary for instance to consult the home office as he will know from his experience before bringing the exact proposals forward <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friends statement takes the view that the jmb affair shows that there are shortcomings in the act <e> <s> we believe that the proposals that we have put before your lordships this afternoon go in the right direction to put that right <e> <s> my noble friend asks why the government believe that that is so <e> <s> the answer is the improvements in statutory powers and procedures for authorisation and supervision and also in the organisation of supervision <e> <s> that is vital and was not addressed in the act <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord williams first disagreed with the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe on the view that the noble lord had put forward over where the board of banking supervision should be located <e> <s> if i may i shall stick to the position of the government who believe that it is right that it should be within the bank of england <e> <s> noble lords opposite will know a great deal more about this than i do but i am advised that if one looks around the developed countries of the world one will see that the central banks of other countries almost without exception are involved in one way or another with banking supervision <e> <s> we have believed and i think it is the case that in this country it is better not to alter things dramatically unless there is need <e> <s> we believe that the spread of proposals within the white paper including that particular proposal is the way to go about this move <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right <e> <s> it is proposed that the two-tier system should be abolished <e> <s> the government intend to establish that there will be a threshold of million of net assets for authorisations of institutions that will be authorised under this procedure <e> <s> it may very well be therefore that matters will move in the opposite direction to the one that my noble friend suggests and that some institutions that have been licensed to take deposits may find they do not have the necessary capital base <e>", "<cs> my lords there are indeed proposals in the white paper that there shall be <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not go over the ground again <e> <s> i cannot give the exact figure <e> <s> it is embedded somewhere in the white paper and the noble lord must forgive me if it has slipped my mind <e> <s> i would repeat that there have been additional appointments made both to senior supervisory posts and also the back-up posts in the bank <e> <s> i shall write to the noble lord if i may to give him the exact figures <e>", "<cs> my noble friend mentioned one very well-known bank <e> <s> perhaps i ought to answer by saying that i am advised that first-time sponsors have been attracted by the business sponsorship incentive scheme including which were attracted by the pound-for-pound matching offer which was introduced on st april this year <e> <s> so far as tax relief is concerned i am sure my noble friend is aware that direct tax reliefs for charities including arts charities are now worth about million a year <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall draw the attention of my right honourable friend to what the noble lord lord strabolgi has said on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that about per cent <e> <s> of the sponsorship money which has been generated by the business sponsorship incentive scheme has in fact gone outside london <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is in essence asking me whether the government expect business sponsorship to replace official and metropolitan funding <e> <s> i am very ready to say to the noble baroness that the answer to that is certainly no that the government will maintain their level of funding <e> <s> but we believe that business sponsorship provides for growth <e>", "<cs> my lords that supplementary question goes a little wide of the original question because one is getting into more general funding matters through the arts council and in other ways <e> <s> i shall draw the point to the attention of my right honourable friend the minister for the arts <e> <s> however i repeat and i think the noble lord lord somers will be pleased to hear this that a considerable slice of the additional money which has been generated by the business sponsorship incentive scheme has so i am advised gone outside london <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i cannot answer that off the cuff <e> <s> i shall certainly write to the noble lord <e> <s> but speaking from memory we are talking about an arts council budget of at that time just in excess off million <e> <s> of course it has gone up as a result of the announcements made by the minister for the arts and we are talking here of what will in the forthcoming year be a government contribution of some million for business sponsorship which it is <e>", "<cs> my lords in the united kingdom the public fund the arts through taxes and subsidies and in the united states it is done largely through tax incentives <e> <s> the systems are different <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall most certainly draw the attention of my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer to what is being said about the american experience i have heard this view expressed before in your lordships house and i shall certainly do that <e> <s> but i think that the noble and learned lord would wish me to make the point again that as i understand it in the united states the majority of money to support the arts comes from private donations foundations and companies but with the vast majority of it coming from private donations whereas here the system is rather different <e> <s> the public are to a very considerable extent providing support for the arts through taxes and subsidies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested to hear what the noble lord lord jenkins says in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly take on board the wise words of my noble friend lord peyton and i repeat that i shall draw the attention of my right honourable friend to what has been said on tax incentives for business in this particular respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that they are very well looked after <e>", "<cs> my lords on the ecu point i shall have to write to the noble lord <e> <s> i am sorry about that but he has bowled me out on that point <e> <s> i would simply repeat that so far as the maximum payments <e>", "<cs> my lords the million does not represent an increase in expenditure in cash terms <e> <s> the government are now being advised by the priorities board on the allocation of government research resources and the priorities board in its first report has not made any specific reference to straw utilisation <e> <s> it has however recommended an increase in the proportion of the research and development budget allocated to straw incorporation <e> <s> research broadly speaking extends over seven different areas of research <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the middle part of my noble friends question <e> <s> i disagree with the first and last parts <e>", "<cs> my lords there are strict rules on burning in order to see that it is done in a responsible way <e> <s> we also have strict rules which were introduced as the noble viscount may remember in and were further strengthened in <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord in his remarks about the value of this process <e> <s> indeed i know of two such firms and i have visited one <e> <s> however in a free economy people must be allowed to take their materials from where they want though i understand that there is an increasing demand for the kind of materials to which the noble lord is referring <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the areas of research about which the noble baroness asked me is indeed into the use of straw in feeding and in particular to improve the ammonia treatment of straw <e> <s> i would guess that with the dearth of hay that will be about quite a lot of farmers in the north of england north of the border in northern ireland and in parts of wales will be glad this winter that we have done work on feeding straw to animals <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for that question <e> <s> this is the subject of a feasibility study at the present time <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend lord onslow deals with amendment no <e> <s> to which he also has his name and before your lordships decide perhaps i ought to reply to the noble earl lord perth <e> <s> the question of administration and cost in my own words was linked to the concern that you have the situation in england wales particularly in england where the water authorities particularly so far as enforcement would be concerned would be operating in the great conurbations of greater london manchester birmingham and so on <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord denning makes my task a little easier in trying to reply to the noble lord lord moran in respect of amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord denning has said while the wording of clause differs in some respects from that of clause any differences merely reflect the differing legal frameworks in scotland and england <e> <s> the effects of the two clauses are supposed to be and indeed are essentially the same <e>", "<cs> despite the three speeches that have been made on this amendment i must say that the government are not persuaded <e> <s> in our consultation paper on the review of inland and coastal fisheries in england and wales we considered whether the arrangements for the control of salmon fisheries in tidal waters should be changed to include the sea fisheries committee in other words exactly the point that the noble lord lord moran is raising on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am certainly prepared to look again at what the noble lord said on second reading in the way that he has suggested <e>", "<cs> i think that we are almost bound to get into the question of onus of proof in talking about the earlier part of the clause <e> <s> but i have taken on board the fact that my noble friend lord trenchard is expecting a letter in answer to his question as to why my noble and learned friend the lord advocate has said that it would not be possible to go down the same road that legislation has gone down in that part of the salmon and freshwater fisheries act which my noble friend lord trenchard mentioned <e> <s> my noble and learned friend the lord advocate deployed some of the reasons in reply <e> <s> but i think it would be for the <e>", "<cs> it is on that point that i have undertaken that either my noble and learned friend or i shall write to my noble friend lord trenchard <e> <s> it may be for the convenience of the committee if i make sure that copies of that letter go to noble lords who have spoken on this particular subject <e>", "<cs> i think that amendments nos <e> <s> a and b should really be dealt with together with amendment no <e> <s> f <e>", "<cs> may we take that amendment with amendments nos <e> <s> a and b <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> as the noble lord says the amendments would create a distinction between a person acting alone and a person acting with another in relation to the new handling offence <e> <s> the noble lord together with my noble friend lord nugent of guildford is proposing that someone charged with a handling offence when acting alone could only be tried summarily and someone acting with another could be tried either way <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can satisfy the noble lord that the effect of these amendments is covered in legislation and for that reason the amendments are not necessary <e> <s> clause attracts to the enforcement of the new offence the relevant powers that the salmon and freshwater fisheries act gives to water authority bailiffs <e> <s> we believe we have included all the powers necessary and relevant to the new offence <e>", "<cs> if noble lords would not object the government suggested that with the amendment of the noble lord lord moran amendment no <e> <s> we might take amendment no <e> <s> the second amendment marked amendments nos <e> <s> a c a b and <e> <s> in other words we <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to the speeches which noble lords have made this evening and have learned a good deal from them <e> <s> one word of caution was uttered by my noble friend lord home and it was repeated by several of your lordships the noble earl lord perth among them <e> <s> it was a word of caution which touches upon the effect of this amendment for though it is the case that the amendment of the noble lord lord moran speaks of a transitional period of five years of course as salmon drift net fishing licences are valid for one season only under this amendment the drift net fisheries would in fact all be closed by the end of the first year <e>", "<cs> i was asking your lordships to give the new rules a chance to work but in what was perhaps too brief an aside i said that other countries ought to give the new rules a chance to work also <e> <s> let us not forget that there is a substantial drift net fishery off the coast of ireland and as i understand it another off the coast of newfoundland <e> <s> we are not alone <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that your lordships wish this to go on much longer <e> <s> i have given an assurance that we shall review the position after three years experience <e> <s> i indicated to the committee that i <e>", "<cs> very briefly the water authorities do enforce these rules <e> <s> i was simply reminding the committee that it had been to the advantage of conservation generally that there were people in the licensed fishery who in case after case had brought to the attention of the authorities that illegal fishing had been taking place <e> <s> so far as coastal protection is <e>", "<cs> we are going over the same ground again and again <e> <s> i said that we would review it taking the matter in the round <e> <s> obviously probably first and foremost we would have to review it from the conservation point of view <e> <s> we would have to look surely to see whether the effects of the drift netting fishery were affecting conservation <e> <s> i do not think that i can go further than that this evening <e> <s> an assurance of a three-year review is something which the government have already given <e> <s> i am only repeating it this evening <e> <s> i am sorry but i cannot go further than that <e>", "<cs> i think that perhaps for the last time i shall say that i have said all that i can say <e>", "<cs> i have listened with care to my noble friend lord trenchard and indeed i also congratulate him not only on not being defeated but also on bringing a new element into the discussion in subsection of this new clause <e> <s> on the other hand my noble friend will forgive me if i remind him that this was a matter which was discussed over a period of very nearly an hour two days ago <e> <s> the committee did not agree on it <e>

back at the next stage <e>", "<cs> clause removes the present distinction in the act between offenders acting alone and those acting together because that particular distinction is no longer considered relevant to the seriousness of the offence being committed <e> <s> clause is drafted so that it does not differentiate between persons acting alone or together in relation to the new handling offence <e> <s> however the noble lord has hit on a problem in this particular amendment and we recognise that clause as drafted presents a problem in that some simple angling offences fishing without a rod licence or the kind of offence that the noble lord mentioned would be triable either summarily by magistrates or on indictment by crown courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the new trust body will be seeking funds from a variety of sources and will be in discussion with the london docklands development corporation and the local authorities concerned and that the estimated cost of the development is some million <e> <s> if the noble lord will forgive me i do not think that it would be appropriate to go into the details of planning here <e> <s> as regards the government giving support that is a matter for the trust but we welcome the proposal as an imaginative contribution to the redevelopment of the docklands <e>", "<cs> my lords the site is on the north quay of the old west india dock <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the noble lord asked me <e> <s> the docklands development corporation has indeed been very much involved in this <e> <s> my information is that it has made funds available so that preparatory work can begin on collecting material for instance very near to the site where it is proposed that the museum shall be <e>", "<cs>

sympathetically because the government have their part in the museum of london <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the expressed intention as i understand it through the museum of london for the new museum

wells <e> <s> it does indeed play a vital part in the cultural life of london and the nation and naturally my right honourable friend is concerned about the future of the theatre <e> <s> however it is essentially a matter for the arts council to work out the possibilities and it is in consultation with sadlers wells and other interested parties <e> <s> my right honourable friend is keeping in close touch with developments and has every confidence in the arts councils desire and ability to achieve a satisfactory outcome <e>", "<cs> my lords of course in asking that question the noble lord lord jenkins is referring in essence not only to sadlers wells but also to the other receiving theatres which are to be found on merseyside and in the north-east <e> <s> it is for the arts council to determine the allocation of its grant and it is its policy to fund bodies and not buildings <e> <s> but useful and constructive discussions are going on between the council successor authorities and

year <e> <s> it is reasonable that the rest of the glc and metropolitan counties spending should be taken up by successor authorities which after all are going to be relieved of substantial precepts

this matter and i think we ought to see how those negotiations proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe there is not a shortfall and i have explained the reason for that <e> <s> i also do not believe on behalf of the government that <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so to the noble lord it is far too early to talk about the cancellation of the chinese ballet visit <e> <s> as i have said the arts council is looking for a solution which will enable sadlers wells to remain open <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add to what i said to the noble baroness at the beginning of this exchange when i replied that the million allocated to the arts council specifically for post-abolition funding took account of the assurances <e> <s> the arts council of course has a long-standing policy of not funding receiving theatres and it announced recently that it planned to adhere to that after abolition <e> <s> but the arts council also made it clear that it was prepared to come to arrangements with successor authorities in the areas affected whereby in determining its support for other arts bodies in such areas the council would take account of the authorities support for the receiving theatres <e> <s> that is a matter in which the arts council is responsible but so are other people as well including the local authorities concerned <e> <s> i think that with these negotiations it is better now to wait and see how we go <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord perhaps will not have noticed that the local london borough council islington has for next year a grant which is million more than it received in the year before <e> <s> i should have thought that if islington borough council is prepared to have a look at its priorities and use its money sensibly it could play its part in assisting sadlers wells theatre <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i should comment on the noble lords last suggestion but i think there is no doubt at all about it that the ministers in the council had regard to what they believed was consumer opinion and there is no question about it all that the decision was not based upon the available scientific evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understood it the question which my noble friend lord radnor asked me was would there be continuing research into residues <e> <s> although it is perfectly true that the noble lord lord john-mackie made it clear that the question he emphasised was would there be research into hormones <e> <s> i think there are two points that i ought to make on that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord john-mackie always has one shrewd thrust and he produced one on this order <e> <s> my response is that fish might escape in one direction but they might very well escape in the other direction and therefore there could be pollution either way across the irish sea <e> <s> it is something which could happen whether or not this order is agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the noble earls concern <e> <s> we keep records of the large livestock units on a computer and also records of where slaughter houses are sited so that we know where they are and can give advice whenever necessary <e> <s> advice has already been given to owners of large livestock units on precautions to prevent the introduction and spread of disease <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad the noble lord lord john-mackie asked that question because i join with him in being to some extent perplexed by the thrust of that supplementary question from the noble earl lord shannon in the sense that in a large livestock unit the space devoted to each particular animal is not likely to be any less than the space in a smaller livestock unit <e> <s> none the less i recognise the general thrust of the noble earls original question in that if there is an outbreak of disease the difficulties of clearing up after such an outbreak in a large unit are of course very great indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer that <e> <s> i shall look at the records and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble viscount i very much doubt whether that is the case <e> <s> as i understand it so far as foot and mouth is concerned in the event of the tragedy of an outbreak the direction of the wind and the currents of the air are the absolutely crucial factors <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord ritchie that the collection is very valuable as is the service that the bta provides <e> <s> there are of course a number of larger libraries that could take over the bta collection and administer it at less cost <e> <s> this is one of the suggestions that has been made by my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords this flows of course from a general decision applying to all specialist bodies that service the arts the arts council having decided to concentrate on helping the performing companies <e> <s> i shall certainly draw the attention of my right honourable friend to what has been said <e>", "<cs> my lords no decision has yet been taken as to whether the arts council will make good the removal of the glc funding <e> <s> as to whether the arts council should draw on the large sum of million post-abolition funding that is a matter for the arts council <e> <s> to get the record straight the department of education and science funding for this year is going to be at a level of about <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand my noble friends interest in this matter <e> <s> i shall certainly respond to my noble friend by saying that i will draw the attention of my right honourable friends to this question in your lordships house today <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we come to that tomorrow on the salmon bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is always fair and i think perhaps he has not picked up the written answer to a question in another place which showed that the horizon is a good deal brighter so far as sadlers wells is concerned <e> <s> my right honourable friend the minister for the arts answering a question on monday of this week said that the arts council have announced today that was that day that they will be holding a meeting on friday with sadlers wells and the three companies that regularly use the theatre the purpose being to discuss the possibility that the companies should be given additional funds to enable them to pay economic levels of rent and that in that way the arts council would make a substantial contribution to keeping that theatre open <e> <s> my right honourable friend said that he applauded that initiative <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no difference between the government and any noble lord in this house about the value of the collection <e> <s> but the one thing i have not said so far on behalf of the government is that the problem over the bta library was there before the arts council took their decision <e> <s> the library is expanding because it is indeed successful <e> <s> it is in an expensive part of london and there is no scope on the site as i understand it to enlarge the library <e> <s> there was therefore before the arts council said anything at all clearly a funding problem <e> <s> i have given an undertaking to the house today that i will draw the attention of my right honourable friends to these exchanges in your lordships house <e> <s> i do not think that i can go very much further than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to repeat this point from this side <e> <s> i know that my right honourable friend has been in touch with the british theatre association to try to help to identify other forms of funding <e> <s> i know that my right honourable friend will continue to try to do that <e> <s> in doing that i should have thought that it would be possible and desirable to look everywhere for money and that would include also local authority funding <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene again <e> <s> of course i should have spoken in the plural <e> <s> my right honourable friend should have been my right honourable friends and when i referred to discussions with the water authorities they most certainly included discussions with the welsh water authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i have indeed met the noble lord <e> <s> lord moran on this point and also read the report of the welsh water authority and now concede that the noble lord has made a valid point <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i should like to speak to this amendment because i ought to say two things <e> <s> i will give an assurance to my noble friend lord trenchard that the matter of the onus of proof so far as the english law is concerned should be the subject of further consultation between now and the third reading stage <e> <s> the second matter if i am not wearying the house is that i think from the point of view of the record and so that we can digest what we are all saying on this subject i should just reply to my noble friends amendment <e> <s> after that we then come to the amendment of the noble lord lord moran amendment no <e> <s> and another amendment of my noble friend lord trenchard amendment no <e> <s> since they may go together <e>", "<cs> my lords in amendment no <e> <s> the noble lord lord moran seeks to clarify the provision of the new offence in clause and he has done so by in effect repeating the provisions of clause <e>", "<cs> my lords if the house will allow me to comment just once again before your lordships finish with this amendment if my noble friend cares to read lines and on page of the bill then he may change his mind on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely understand the desire of the noble lord lord moran and the noble lords whose names are to this particular amendment to have the report of a review of the north east english drift net fishery reported to parliament although i noticed from the amendment that the outcome of the review would if noble lords will forgive me for saying so be prejudged before the review had started <e> <s> nonetheless i appreciate the reasons both national and international which have prompted the desire to move this amendment <e> <s> i also appreciate the reasons which prompted the desire of my noble friend lord lansdowne to speak to amendment no <e> <s> an <e>", "<cs> no my lords i did not say that <e> <s> i must be careful that i say exactly what i intended to say <e> <s> i said that in seeking for the right words for an amendment to fulfil the assurance i am giving now it is the governments intention to table an amendment to give effect to the setting out of a review of the kind that i have described which would be reported to both <e>", "<cs> my lords if your lordships will allow me to speak just once more and no more on this amendment there are two things i think i ought to say <e> <s> in reply to my noble friend lord trenchard i am afraid i could have given a better answer than i did <e> <s> i now give it the government would have power to ban drift nets using powers in the sea fish conservation act <e> <s> i omitted to say that to my noble friend and i think it is important that it should go on the record as a matter of fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall indeed write to my noble friend <e> <s> i think i ought just to say ahead of a letter that following the very exceptional drought of and indeed the dry summer of officials of the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food asked water authorities for evidence of damage to stocks of fish <e> <s> i have to say that the generally given scientific assessment was that the drought did no long-term damage to stocks <e> <s> i shall certainly write to my noble friend <e> <s> i am concerned that the amendment refers only to nets but on the other hand i have heard the reservations which were voiced by my noble friend lord home about any restrictions which would be placed on rods <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that the research data during the review will be of considerable importance and i certainly will draw to the attention of both my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture fisheries and food and the secretary of state for scotland the desirability of getting the data out as quickly as possible during the period of the review <e> <s> i do not think i can go further than that but i assure my noble friend that i will use my best endeavours in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have had put to them in strong terms to which we are now responding the need to protect the fish stocks which would be swimming into the great rivers of the east coast of scotland as they pass through the area fished by the north east drift net fishery <e> <s> we have not had similar complaints about other parts around the country <e> <s> it is for that reason that the proposal that i make to the house for an amendment at third reading would be confined to the north east coast <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a useful debate this evening and it is certainly good to have heard support for the work of the museum of london from all noble lords who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble baroness lady birk for recognising the amendment which was made in another place about publication of the results of our archaeological research and the undertaking given for a further amendment which will be brought forward in your lordships house about reporting the work of the museum of london as a statutory obligation <e>", "<cs> my lords as i promised we shall look at what the noble baroness said <e>", "<cs> my lords those fears are unworthy <e> <s> i do not think that there is anything in my right honourable friends statement that could possibly have given rise to such fears <e>", "<cs> my lords if it were done as a result of the review of drought legislation then it would need to be dealt with through primary legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to my noble friend lord burton is yes sea trout are included <e> <s> to reply to my noble friend lord trenchard whose generous acceptance of this amendment i very much appreciate he will forgive me if i do not give him an exact answer <e> <s> although it is the case that the government are on record as wishing to introduce a licensing scheme that will provide as strong a chain as possible from the time when the salmon starts to change hands until it reaches the consumer it has to be a matter now of consultation as i said in my opening remarks with the interests concerned as to where precisely the dealer licensing system ought to begin and end <e>", "<cs> my lords again the answer to that is as i think my noble friend very well knows that the position is different in scotland from england and wales <e> <s> i can give my noble friend the assurance that he seeks as regards england and wales that nothing is ruled out in this respect <e> <s> i understand from my noble friend lord gray of contin that the same answer refers to scotland that it is now a matter for consideration in scotland as it will be in england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the point which the noble lord lord moran is putting to the government in that the water authorities have expressed concern that there might be a disease implication so far as concerns this amendment <e> <s> but while notifiable fish diseases are suspected or confirmed movement controls may be applied by order under section of the diseases of fish act <e> <s> this is done by the government and not by the water authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i would not deny that there is obviously a danger that something of that kind could happen but that is precisely the reason that the order-making power under section of the act exists <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so to my noble friend <e> <s> i think that i covered that point when i introduced this amendment just now <e> <s> the exceptions are in the case of genuine illness or injury to the licensee <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord lansdowne for his generous words when he began to move his amendment <e> <s> indeed i should like to thank my noble friend for promoting my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture fisheries and food in the amendment putting him in charge of fisheries not only in england but also in wales and in scotland and i think also in northern ireland a small defect in drafting which nonetheless does not detract from the discussion that we are having <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may briefly repeat the views which i expressed about nasco a few moments ago in reply to the noble earl lord perth <e> <s> we have not included an express reference to nasco partly because these fisheries are strictly outwith nascos remit being fisheries within the coastal waters of an originating member of the european community and partly because we do not think it appropriate to commit ourselves in advance to views which may develop in nasco over the next three years <e>", "<cs> my lords there is not a gap <e> <s> if my noble friend looks at subsection of amendment no <e> <s> he will see that the areas to be covered by the review will be the yorkshire and northumbrian which my noble friend knows so well water authorities and then the salmon fishery districts including the river tweed and from the river ugie to the river forth <e> <s> i am advised that the river ugie is in the fraserburgh area but the point i need to get on the record is that there is not a gap <e>", "<cs> my lords i am going to break the rules of the house by rising again and saying that i am most grateful to the noble lady <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend and to the noble lord lord tryon <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said i think that further consideration as to whether adequate sufficient or optimum should be the right word is something which perhaps ought to be looked at in another place <e> <s> at the moment we think that adequate is the right word but i think that it perhaps needs another look and i do not think that i ought to say anything more about it than that this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has made clear that he is concerned that the effects of all netting in rivers estuaries and coastal waters on salmon returning to spawn in the rivers concerned should be covered in this way in the review <e> <s> i can assure the noble earl that the clause tabled in amendment no <e> <s> provides for this <e> <s> subsection of amendment no <e> <s> says that all fishing for salmon by means of nets in those areas will be reviewed <e> <s> i hope that with that explanation the noble earl will feel that the matter which he has raised is fully covered <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment which the noble lord lord moran has moved would appear to make progress in securing agreement on international measures to conserve salmon dependent on the outcome of the review which is the subject of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the noble lord has been a very distinguished diplomat and i am sure he would be the first to say to me that it would be to take up a totally false negotiating position for us to start off our negotiating stance in that sort of way <e> <s> incidentally we have a better record on salmon conservation than many countries and i believe that what we are doing in this bill despite certain remarks which have been made this evening will be recognised internationally as enhancing our contribution <e> <s> the adoption of the noble lords amendment could i suggest delay progress in reducing the faroese and greenland catches because they could argue that they would wait to see what further restrictions we would be offering them <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed gratifying that our consultation paper is recalled so warmly by the noble lord that he wishes to enshrine part of it in legislation <e> <s> however i suggest that it is one thing to describe policy objectives in a consultation document a green paper which is designed to provoke discussion and it is another thing to enshrine them in precisely the same form in legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may very briefly thank the noble lord lord ross for what he has said and simply make two points <e> <s> first i am already on the record as saying that statistics i am speaking at the moment for the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food and also after consultation with the welsh office as i understand it would be published in the year following the year to which those statistics relate <e> <s> that is an improvement for this side of the border in the sense that although we have provisional statistics coming out the year following we do not have the official statistics until a year after that <e> <s> so we intend to try to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked whether this was enough <e> <s> this of course is a matter between the arts council and the theatre but i think i ought to point out that the sum of which i understand the theatre says that it is seeking for the next financial year includes for a new studio theatre which is not yet complete and a further which would be needed to replace the loss of a major sponsor <e> <s> the glcs grant to the theatre for this year is <e> <s> so far as concerns the long-term future this and ways in which the theatre can raise its finances is a matter for the arts council <e>", "<cs> my lords i made absolutely clear on the last occasion when we discussed this matter that if anything of that kind were to befall sadlers wells no one would be more dismayed than the government <e> <s> if <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that we should talk about irretrievable ruin <e> <s> the original answer that i have given points in precisely the opposite direction <e> <s> regarding repayments to the london residuary body i must confess that i am not in any way aware that that could be the position if the hypothetical situation which the noble baroness puts to me were to occur <e> <s> but i repeat that i think the situation is hopeful <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it islington borough council which will have a grant of million more than it has for the present financial year in order to cope with its post-abolition responsibilities is maintaining a policy of masterly inactivity <e>", "<cs> my lords arrangements for that visit are proceeding <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition to an additional million which islington borough <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the noble lord lord hooson for putting down the motion that we have been debating <e> <s> the relationship between the government and parliament and the civil service is rightly seen as being of considerable importance not just to the government or to parliament but i suggest also to the welfare of our country <e> <s> the importance of the subject has attracted four former cabinet ministers and a former head of the home civil service to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an argument with which i am familiar <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for reminding me and the house of that point <e> <s> i should like to stress in reply to the doubt which the noble lord lord hooson i think expressed about the reality of the accountability of ministers to parliament the actual weight of information that has to be made available now <e> <s> in the conservative government helped to set up the departmental select committee system of another place <e> <s> the terms of reference as your lordships know very well are very wide <e> <s> it is generally agreed i believe that those <e>", "<cs> i listened with care to the noble baroness speaking to this string of amendments <e> <s> i very much share one idea behind them namely the importance of the museum of london being seen to be a museum for all london <e> <s> that is a point that the government had very much in mind when drafting the bill <e> <s> as i mentioned on second reading it is provided for in clauses and <e> <s> clause lays down <e>", "<cs> it might help if i were to add one further word before the noble baroness decides what she considers best to do with the amendment <e> <s> i quite understand the point made by the noble lord lord howie about the need for the trustees to have representatives who have a london-wide view <e> <s> but with respect to the noble lord this is gone about in a way that is rather different from the way of the amendments <e> <s> it is nonetheless dealt with within the bill in a perfectly clear way <e> <s> clause lays down that one of the central duties of the board of governors is <e>", "<cs> may appoint i am so sorry <e> <s> the proposed subsection states <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord jenkins chided me with being unable to follow the logic of his argument on the second reading of this bill <e> <s> i must confess that i join with my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls in being a little unable to follow the logic of lord jenkinss argument now that we are in committee <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> he put forward a point with which i am familiar because i remember that he put forward a similar point when we were legislating one part of the transport bill in the last year by reference <e> <s> i shall most certainly draw to the attention of the editor of the <e>", "<cs> in answer to the point which the noble lord lord strabolgi has made the idea is simply to give the board of governors the option to allow museum premises to be used for functions and events which are outside the scope of the boards main objectives as defined elsewhere in the bill <e> <s> but the key phrase is that the board are required to be satisfied that any such activities would not conflict with those functions <e> <s> the provision allows the board to raise money for the museum by charging for such hiring of its premises <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord may agree that with this proviso which is an important one about not conflicting with the functions of the board this is a desirable provision <e>", "<cs> i am surprised that the noble baroness is concerned about the passmore-edwards position as a result of the passing of this bill because for the first time the bill will provide for a single co-ordinated london-wide archaeological service with one focal point <e> <s> that is something which has not been put into statute until now <e> <s> but in addition to that the museum of london will continue to work in conjunction with the passmore-edwards museum and <e>", "<cs> i have one or two things i wish to say to the noble baroness to whom i shall of course write before the next stage of the bill <e> <s> at the conclusion of my reply on second reading i made a specific reference to the government not wishing to see any diminution in the archaeological work which is going on in greater london <e> <s> both the noble baroness and i should perhaps look up that reference but i was quite specific in what i said <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is absolutely right <e> <s> perhaps we may finish this committee stage by registering from both sides of the committee that this manuscript amendment and again i apologise for its lateness is the product of co-operation by the political parties on this bill in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am saying to the noble baroness that she needs to wait a little while and she may well find although the case is slightly different that the attendances will rise <e> <s> incidentally the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee who is always very fair in the case he makes although he was supporting the bill of the noble lord lord jenkins said fairly in his speech that he felt the way in which those voluntary contributions were being collected at the v a was sensitive and sensible <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady birk in moving this amendment referred back to the committee stage and quoted what i had said on behalf of the government about the objective in this part of the bill being for the first time to provide a single co-ordinated london-wide archaeological service with one focal point <e> <s> that is something which if i may say so we see as being a great advance because for the first time the service will be put on a statutory basis <e> <s> i recognise the important role that has been undertaken by the passmore-edwards museum for many years and the special place it has been given since it joined in with the provision of what is generally known as the greater london archaeology service <e> <s> i hope that what has been said in the brief exchange on this amendment has now given the noble baroness the assurances she would wish to have in respect of this important institution <e>", "<cs> my lords if the house will give me leave i should like to say that i quite understand the noble baronesss desire that the right message should get to all the various organisations which will be beneficiaries under clause <e> <s> i think the first thing i would say is that one of the great difficulties over this amendment would have been that the amendment mentions only the passmore-edwards museum and not all the other various organisations which are also involved in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know that i agree with the noble lord that the monitoring will have to cease <e> <s> exactly the same situation presented itself in tyne and wear and there the district councils have made sure that the sea fisheries committee will continue to operate in a satisfactory way <e> <s> i very much hope that a way can be found to go forward so far as concerns the lancashire and western sea fisheries joint committees <e> <s> secondly may i just say that the levels of mercury in fish in liverpool bay are below the environmental quality standard laid down by the community and have been for many years <e> <s> the monitoring that we do takes place on about days of every year and of course britains membership of various international conventions requires us to continue this work <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for those comments <e> <s> the only point i ought to add and which the noble lord lord tordoff will be pleased to hear me add is that we shall keep the situation under review particularly in the context of this question and make such changes as may be necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not rely upon the monitoring work undertaken by this committee <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the problem is not a clwyd and gwynedd problem the problem is whether the successor district councils in the merseyside and greater manchester areas are prepared to come forward and take up membership of this important committee <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord i did not quite say that <e> <s> i was in effect saying that there really is no monitoring of fish quality by this sea fishery committee and it is for that reason that we do not rely on the monitoring <e> <s> it does not exist <e>", "<cs> my lords it is essentially a matter for the councils in the district of the sea fishery committee to decide on whether or not to support the committee <e> <s> my right honourable friend has a statutory role in considering applications to set up or to modify sea fishery committees <e> <s> my right honourable friend cannot force district or county councils to give their support <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the noble lords first point let me say that i am talking about liverpool bay when i refer to the days <e> <s> my understanding is that there is no monitoring of fish quality <e> <s> there is monitoring of samples taken from the bed of the sea and there is monitoring of water quality <e> <s> both of those activities are important activities but they are not the same as the monitoring of fish quality <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that is definitely yes <e> <s> perhaps i ought to remind my noble friend that there is a private members bill in your lordships house which would seek to end that but that the government do not agree with that particular bill <e>", "<cs> no my lords in that sense i do not like the word either <e> <s> but we want to improve their independence and their general financial state and if i may say so nothing could have done more to that end than the budget of my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords the government believe strongly that the trustees of the institutions must have the freedom to introduce charges if they believe that that is right in the particular case of their own institution <e> <s> at the same time in the government gave a manifesto undertaking that we would keep up government support for the arts and this we have done <e> <s> this question is about museums and galleries <e> <s> since exchequer funding of national museums and galleries financed by the office of arts and libraries has increased by per cent in real terms <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps this is something that we ought to discuss on the noble lords bill tomorrow <e> <s> i congratulate the noble lord on introducing the concept of business sponsorship for the arts in i think <e> <s> at that time business sponsorship for the arts was running at about half a million pounds <e> <s> today it is running at million <e>", "<cs> i should like if i may to add my voice on behalf of the government <e> <s> the amendment is a reasonable attempt by my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls to relieve museum trustees of the effects of this bill <e> <s> but it does not fulfil the important point of principle that trustees should be free to exercise their judgment in the discharge of their responsibilities <e> <s> it is right that we should take to heart what my noble friend lord eccles has said about the distinguished people who form the bodies of trustees in our institutions <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an interesting debate <e> <s> many of your lordships have spoken i know either from a close knowledge of or a close interest in the energy industry <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce who has just spoken and the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter were members of another place when the gas nationalisation measure went through both houses of parliament and became law in <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not give any such assurance this evening <e> <s> i am saying that an absolutely cast-iron guarantee is being given for the first time in the gas industry that there will be a formula for domestic tariff consumers and all who are on the tariff that there will be absolutely fair play as regards their price formula <e> <s> it is a formula which i admit is complicated but its principle is straightforward <e> <s> it sets a limit on changes in the price of gas by reference to changes in gas costs the <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord i do not accept what he has said about the effect of the price formula under the telecommunications act <e> <s> nonetheless in essence the noble lord is saying what about cross-subsidisation <e> <s> i am telling him and the house that the formula will prevent cross-subsidisation because when we come to debate the formula in committee as we undoubtedly shall we shall see that the formula with the price element deducted from which is the x factor from the rpi gives the customer a formula which will be fair to him or her as well as being fair to the investor <e>", "<cs> my lords may i look at that point <e> <s> if i may i am not going to reply to the noble baroness on that and i do not agree with the noble baroness about the undesirability of it <e> <s> it is something to which we must return when we get into committee <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i understand that and i accept what the noble lord has said as being sound common sense <e> <s> but the noble lord does not mention any figures in that intervention <e> <s> my advice is that

agree with the noble lord <e> <s> if i may i shall read the record tomorrow and write to the noble lord as i said i would if i feel it is necessary to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords again we must debate this when we come to committee stage <e> <s> i am surprised that the noble lord asked me this question <e> <s> my reading of the proceedings in committee in another place is that the government were asked again and again why british gas was to be allowed to go back into other operations apart from the supply of gas <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble lord is suspicious of that <e> <s> i should have thought that this was something that we should want to encourage but as i say perhaps we can discuss the nuts and bolts of this when we reach committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord gallacher and the noble and learned lord lord templeman on the production of the three valuable reports on problems in community agriculture which seem to grow even more complex <e> <s> of course we are now in a tough and complicated price-fixing negotiation <e> <s> indeed the community ministers of agriculture are meeting today in luxembourg <e>", "<cs> until seven oclock <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord whaddon speaks may i just ask whether he will be speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i fully accept the importance of the two characteristics which noble lords have identified in amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> however like my noble friend lord sanderson i would be against making special mention of these two particular qualities in the bill for the reasons which my noble friend gave even though it is the case that the noble lord lord diamond has so worded his amendment that it would only be in particular that the characteristic of expertise in consumer affairs should be taken into account <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord for not making myself clear <e> <s> i was simply referring to an annex called annex a to the notes on clauses which has been put in the printed paper office for any noble lords who are interested and to the note for clause <e> <s> that shows that there are broadly different areas where it can be said that the director has functions if one looks through the bill <e> <s> perhaps it would be helpful to the noble lord if i briefly identify one or two of those functions <e>", "<cs> i would just ask the noble baroness whether she has taken the trouble to read annex a to the notes on clauses to clause or whether the noble baroness for whom i normally have a great admiration took the trouble to listen to what i said in reply to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> very well <e> <s> which of the characteristics that i gave in answer to the noble lord does the noble baroness think is eyewash <e>", "<cs> the trouble is that we are being asked to discuss an amendment ahead of discussing a great deal of the detail of what the director does <e> <s> that is not the fault of the government <e> <s> it is the fault of the amendment that the noble baroness is supporting <e>", "<cs> i do not in the least mind being asked but with great respect the noble lord would be the first to criticise the government if we had made up our minds about the terms and conditions of employment for the director before the bill had even started going through your lordships house <e> <s> the fact is that no appointment has yet been made and therefore the answers to the questions do not exist <e> <s> what does exist is the fact that my right honourable friend is of course considering very seriously all the points that the noble lord has put forward <e> <s> it is for that reason that i do not in the least mind being asked the questions <e> <s> it is absolutely right that we should go over this ground in debate <e> <s> i repeat however that if i was able to stand up and say that conclusions had been reached on all those questions i really believe that the noble lord would say to me that the government were treating the committee with disrespect when the bill had only just begun going through your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their reception of my right honourable friends statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord john-mackie has kindly said a few words about my right honourable friend who is not well which i know he will appreciate <e> <s> the noble lord lord john-mackie put the question as to whether we should now join the ems <e> <s> all that i would say on the agro-monetary aspect is that the community states i believe would feel that justice was done <e>", "<cs> my lords the community so i am advised has taken on board in the council of agriculture ministers the prevalent feeling about this point <e> <s> if i may confine myself for a moment to milk products the terms of any trade with libya would depend upon offers made by traders <e> <s> however i am absolutely certain that the commission will take account of the current trade relations with libya arid the commission has said that the community will not be offering any further special deals for libya <e>", "<cs> my lords i in no way disagree with the noble lord lord cledwyn in his last words <e> <s> he has every right to counsel caution and to warn me that there should be a becoming gravity in these matters <e> <s> however i ought to say to the noble lord that the original proposals which were put forward by the commission were estimated to produce savings after taking account of revenue from the cereals co-responsibility levy of million ecu which is about million <e> <s> as a result of this council the savings will be some million ecu which is the equivalent of about million <e> <s> therefore as a result of the deliberations which ended on friday the savings have been very much increased over and above what the commission had intended <e>", "<cs> my lords the savings to which i have been referring are savings over projected expenditure <e> <s> once again i in no way try to hide the fact that this means that the cost of the community from the point of view of agriculture will continue to rise and that that means that we shall need a consistent policy in order to bring it down <e>", "<cs> my lords it is one of the many matters which i think we shall have to ask the treasury to deal with because it is not so much an agricultural as a financial council <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that it is per cent <e> <s> of the intervention price and as things stand at the moment it will work out in cash terms at per tonne <e>", "<cs> in moving this amendment the noble lord lord diamond has asked whether there is any precedent for the drafting of subsection of clause which is the subsection that we are discussing at the moment <e> <s> the answer to that question is that the wording of this subsection is identical to section of the fair trading act <e> <s> removal on the grounds of incapacity or misbehaviour is widespread and commonplace for officers in such positions and for board members of nationalised industries <e> <s> indeed i have no doubt that on many occasions when nationalised industries were being set up some years ago governments of which the noble lord was a leading member probably approved this kind of wording for the legislation concerned <e>", "<cs> i think i ought to say that the statutory precedent which i mentioned is on all-fours with the precedent which is in the bill <e> <s> the task of the director general of fair trading is the regulation of economic activities in exactly the same way as the director general of ofgas will be regulating the affairs of the gas industry <e> <s> i do not think i can add to that <e> <s> it is true that i have not crawled through legal precedents but i did not realise that i was to have the pleasure of hearing the noble lord lord diamond putting the case for the amendment in the way that he has <e> <s> however i think i have given a reasonable answer and certainly i have given a good enough answer to vote against the noble lord <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord was moving this group of amendments he said that amendment no <e> <s> b would remove the words as such and that perhaps the government would explain the reason for having them in the bill if there was one <e> <s> i shall deal with that point <e> <s> as i understand the drafting the director general who is in office at any time should hold and vacate his office as director general in accordance with the terms of his appointment <e> <s> t hat is the meaning of subsection <e> <s> the words as such refer to the office of the director general and are therefore necessary for the proper construction of the subsection <e> <s> laymen might think that one could refer to that office but the parliamentary draftsman has said as such <e> <s> as i understand it that is the intention of the drafting <e>", "<cs> indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords the glc asked the designated south bank board whether if they did install the bookspace area they would propose to continue to use the space for literature <e> <s> they were told that the south bank board would not so decide to do <e> <s> it is therefore rather surprising that the glc nonetheless went to the trouble and expense of creating something which they knew would be moved in five months time <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see no reason at all why anybody should be apprehensive about the future of the festival hall <e> <s> it is part of the complex for which the south bank board are the ground landlords and i have every confidence in the south bank board <e>", "<cs> my lords not in this particular case <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that the area which was called bookspace totally blotted out the splendid view of the thames and the london skyline so that nobody could see them at all <e> <s> now the south bank board have some rather better plans <e> <s> they are looking into the possibility of accommodating the arts councils poetry library on the south bank they are considering whether the purcell room could be more closely identified with literature in performance for example poetry readings and play readings and they are also looking in detail at the scope for exhibitions and other events related to literature in the foyer area as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that has very much to do with the bookspace area <e> <s> i said that this was one of the plans of the south bank board <e> <s> it is being considered and quite rightly too <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord chalfont is absolutely right <e> <s> the area in question was used as a restaurant and certainly consideration is being given to returning it to restaurant use again so that people can not only eat there but also enjoy the view <e> <s> i am particularly glad that the noble lord has asked his second question because the government would most certainly agree with what the noble lord lord chalfont has said <e> <s> we believe also that literature has its rightful prominence in the type of centre which is being developed on the south bank <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no information on that matter <e> <s> it will be a matter for the south bank board <e>", "<cs> i ought to make clear from the government front bench that with regret i do not support my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls on this amendment <e> <s> i find that characteristically he is being too reasonable on this occasion <e> <s> i must confess to the noble lord lord jenkins that on behalf of the government i disagree fundamentally with this bill <e> <s> i therefore do not believe that there should be any seive or court of appeal of the kind which has just been suggested <e> <s> i believe that the trustees who are distinguished people should be completely free to exercise their judgment in the discharge of their responsibilities <e> <s> but i must confess that i do not believe this amendment is a waste of time <e> <s> i do not believe that it is a wrecking amendment <e> <s> nonetheless it would not be fair to the committee if i did not say that i cannot support my noble friend in the division lobby for the reason i have given <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord jenkins in reply to my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls said that there was a large body of support for the bill <e> <s> but as my noble friend lord swinfen has clearly shown there are other views about this <e> <s> i was glad that the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale made the point which as i understand it is absolutely right that subsection would force museum trustees to abandon their existing arrangements for charging for entry at outstations <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord can draw attention to the part of the bill which would continue to make that proper <e>", "<cs> as the bill stands it would prevent outstations from charging <e> <s> when we debated the second reading of the bill the noble lord lord jenkins said that there were ways in which the museums could replace the money which his bill if it became law would deny to them <e> <s> indeed he went further and said that we should no doubt be able to discuss the ways in which other moneys could be raised in committee <e> <s> i have been waiting to hear suggestions from the noble lord as to how those other moneys could be raised and i think that those suggestions could come on this amendment <e>", "<cs> may i remind the noble lord that the money which has come from the government to the arts council has gone up in real terms very considerably over recent years <e>", "<cs> nonetheless i am talking here about the arts council <e> <s> let us hear from the noble lord where the alternative money which will be denied by this bill will come from if all the museums including the outstations are refused the right to be allowed to <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord lord john-mackie spoke at the beginning of the debate this afternoon he said that the gap between the committee stage in another place and the time when the bill had come now to your lordships house had made many people almost forget that the bill existed <e> <s> but the number of your lordships who have taken part in this afternoons very interesting debate and the quality of the speeches show that your lordships have remembered well enough the main features of this comparatively short but important bill <e> <s> they are features to which undoubtedly we shall be returning when we come to committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a difficulty i feel here <e> <s> i hope that we can go into this in more detail in committee <e> <s> as i understood speeches being made not least from the noble baroness and the noble lord lord hunt both were saying that if one had the situation which is in the bill where there is no statutory provision for free environmental advice this is not desirable because one would not give integrated advice <e> <s> my understanding of the situation is the exact opposite <e> <s> a statutory right to free advice i suggest could make it impossible to provide integrated advice without the risk of a sterile argument on almost every occasion as to whether or not the advice which was being given to the individual farmer should be free by statute <e> <s> advice on conservation would have to be split off into a completely separate category and this we feel would not benefit the farmer or the environment <e> <s> i think this is something we need to come back to but i am simply saying that if you start putting in statute the fact that consultation should be free you have to decide in statute where the dividing line is to be drawn <e> <s> that could lead us into difficulties but this is something we must come back to at committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords it will indeed <e> <s> i am saying that it is our intention that grants will be available and i am saying that in the circumstances which i have endeavoured to outline there will be powers to withhold grant <e>", "<cs> this has been an interesting debate <e> <s> we have had a speech from the first chairman of the national gas consumers council my noble friend lady macleod who intervened because indeed it would not be possible for her amendment no <e> <s> to which the noble viscount lord hanworth has also <e>", "<cs> the south-east i apologise <e> <s> i was a little surprised that the noble lord was not aware of the reasons why the government decided it would be better to house the staffs dealing with the north thames and south-eastern regions in one office <e> <s> i tried to explain that on second reading and i said then that we felt it would be more efficient to house these staffs in one office together with the headquarters <e>", "<cs> may i finish this point <e> <s> there is nothing in the fears expressed by some noble lords that the governments intention is to sell the consumer short <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord knows from looking at the schedules which i agree we are not talking about now but i have referred to a schedule so i must answer the noble lord there is also the treasury hand in this <e> <s> but i have just gone out of my way to make the point and it has been made in another place so i am saying nothing new that in essence the financing of the consumer councils under this bill will be demand led <e> <s> i have repeated the paragraph which my noble friend lord sandys read out <e> <s> obviously it means what it says that the national consumer council could make the best dispositions that it wished <e>", "<cs> the constraints to which i referred when we were earlier discussing amendment no <e> <s> put down by my noble friend and the noble viscount lord hanworth really relate to drafting <e> <s> i must make it absolutely clear that i wish to accept the spirit of amendment no <e> <s> but the two main difficulties are that somehow one must define the regions and all this part of the bill is about public gas suppliers and not about a single supplier although as we all know it will be british gas who will be the first public gas supplier <e> <s> however there is a drafting problem there <e>", "<cs> i have already said that the government will now consider the drafting of this part <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for all the diverse advice which i have been given <e> <s> indeed i was delighted to feel that i moved from being a caricature to somebody of some ability in the speech of the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> the difficulty is this <e> <s> if the noble lord looks at amendment no <e> <s> and at the amendment of my noble friend and viscount hanworth amendment no <e> <s> i think the noble lord will see that my noble friends and the noble viscounts amendment no <e> <s> is really rather more specific than amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble lord and the noble lord lord stoddart <e> <s> although the noble lords on the front bench opposite have used the word choose which sounds very decisive they have been very relaxed in the way in which they have put the amendment down because the government are only being asked to agree to choosing and then the words of the bill follow after which are <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble lord lord gallacher together with the noble lords lord stoddart lord williams and lord diamond whose names are to the amendment have provided us with the opportunity to discuss the important area of the protection of the less advantaged among british gas customers <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord diamond asked me to confirm that the effect of amendment no <e> <s> is covered by what happens <e> <s> i can give that undertaking <e> <s> the appropriate machinery already exists within the responsibility of the department of trade and industry and will continue to operate after privatisation <e> <s> in practice when a vacancy arises the existing councils will indicate the nature of their requirements to the department of trade and industry which will then approach any number of a comprehensive list of organisations who produce a short list of suitable candidates for consideration <e> <s> names collected as a consequence of such approaches are kept in a data base for further reference <e> <s> this data base is updated regularly and the people whose names are on it are approached to determine their continuing interest in the possibility of appointment <e> <s> the department of trade and industry may also approach bodies such as the public appointments office for possible candidates <e>", "<cs> if i may say so i think that the absolutely straightforward answer to the noble lords lord bruce and lord diamond is that what i said about the existing practice of the department of trade and industry is in fact the case but it does not entirely equate with what the noble lord is trying to achieve in his amendment <e> <s> let me be perfectly straightforward about this <e> <s> one of the reasons why it does not equate with the amendment is as i said because in practice when a vacancy arises under the present situation the existing councils will indicate the nature of their requirement <e> <s> as the bill is drafted and as members of the committee have agreed by disagreeing to amendment no <e> <s> almost certainly there will not be regional councils <e> <s> so this amendment is trying to ensure that there shall be consultation at large <e>", "<cs> i have already said that i shall look at it <e> <s> i have tried to outline what i think are the problems <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord stoddart called in aid a precedent which he said concerned a requirement on local authorities to consult with industry and commerce before they set a rate <e> <s> i can only say that if some local authorities which i can think of had consulted industry and commerce before setting the rates which they have set at the moment i think they would have had some pretty direct answers back from industry and commerce <e>", "<cs> i never invite amendments they always come as a pleasant surprise <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides what he will do with the amendment i must say that i owe an apology to noble lords opposite for omitting one piece of information to which i do not think any of us has referred <e> <s> but we can all be forgiven for that because it comes after and not before this part of the bill <e> <s> if members of the committee will glance at the opposite page page they will see that in clause the duties of the secretary of state and the director are set out <e> <s> in clause <e>", "<cs> i realise that this is a practical matter as the noble lord lord diamond has explained <e> <s> in the bill we are proposing a clear break that we believe will be helpful for all concerned <e> <s> it is surely more effective to have the new gas consumers council operating from the appointed day in conjunction with the office of gas supply with its staff securely in place <e> <s> since we imagine that there will be a considerable cross-over between the staffs of the old and the new councils i hope very much that many of the old council staff are going to be members of the new council staff it must be right for there to be a <e>", "<cs> one of the great difficulties if i may say so briefly presented by the amendment is that there are staff of the old council who in many cases i hope will be members of the staff of the new council <e> <s> it becomes tricky therefore if one is saying that the old council should go on for an extra year in order to give the new council time to get itself up and running <e> <s> that is a problem <e> <s> the second point is that the amendment addresses itself so far as local representation is concerned to a difficulty that does not exist <e> <s> there is going to be time enough for the organising committee to arrange what the best local arrangements should be <e> <s> this is a matter to which we shall come on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lady gardner for tabling this new clause because it undoubtedly has given us an opportunity to have a quite wide-ranging but short debate on the way that the new consumers council will be represented at local level <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that we share the same aim <e> <s> we are committed to the formation of a new gas consumers council in a manner which will enable it to carry out its work in the most practical way possible to ensure full protection of consumers interests <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has used a device which at one and the same time i find appealing but highly irritating <e> <s> the noble lord has of course picked out from evidence which has been given in the select committee the part that he likes and agrees with and the part that he does not like he says he does not agree with and is suspicious of <e>", "<cs> i recognise the concern that lies behind the amendment moved by the noble lord lord stoddart and the importance which noble lords opposite attach to protecting the interests of those presently working in the gas consumers councils is fully acknowledged by the government and clearly from the intervention of my noble friend lord sanderson he is also concerned with this matter <e>", "<cs> it is supposed to be the same but one has to look at the small print to see whether it is exactly the same hence the use of the word analogous <e>", "<cs> no the sponsoring department for the consumers council will be the department of trade and industry and the relevant minister is my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry <e>", "<cs> i regret to say that i cannot answer that skilful and difficult question but i shall write to the noble lord <e> <s> i did not reply to the question that the noble lord raised about dynamised pensions and i am not furnished with an answer <e> <s> i should like to look into that point <e> <s> it is important that the noble lord should have a reply and i shall write to him fairly swiftly on that point as well <e>", "<cs> the noble lord asks that the government recognise that he has a genuine concern that the council should be fully staffed to represent the interests of gas consumers and to deal swiftly and effectively with their complaints <e> <s> i hope that i am not misrepresenting anything that the noble lord has said in saying that such is my feeling <e>", "<cs> if i may say so i do not wish to pour cold water on the noble lords riposte <e> <s> but although my reply may have been a little loose and made it seem as though i felt that the amendment was at large instead of referring only to the treasury control over numbers there are still the two points first of all that it is the consumers of gas who will be paying the costs of the new council and of course the numbers of staff manning the council will have some effect on the total expenditure <e> <s> there is that and there is the point which perhaps i mentioned rather too quickly but i would have thought that this paragraph gave what i call the normal transparency to procedures within the government in that all governments secretaries of state have to work within the agreements of the government in which they serve for collective responsibility including collective responsibility for finance <e> <s> hence the mention of the treasury referred <e>", "<cs> there is nothing between the government and noble lord lord diamond on what a good deal it is for the consumer to have a properly staffed and properly funded consumers council both now and in the future <e> <s> indeed dare i say perhaps the noble lord lord diamond and i do not see entirely eye to eye with the noble lord lord bruce who seems to feel that the fact that the gas consumer will have to pay through his bills for the new consumers council <e>", "<cs> i must say that i think it comes all right from my own side of the committee to hear expressions of concern about how the public utilities which remain in the public sector are going to fare compared with a great public utility which is being put into the private sector <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord ezra will take it in good part when i say to him that i do not think that it lies in his mouth having over three days now from that side of the committee criticised the intention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for energy in putting british gas into the private sector then to stand up at the end of a long day to say to the government that that is unfair because british gas will do too well <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord gallacher is on to an important point here but i think it is covered by existing arrangements <e> <s> the new gas consumers council has been set up specifically to provide effective protection for consumer interests <e> <s> as i think the noble lord will be well aware the new clause makes it clear and explicit that the new council will be responsible for protecting consumer interests by investigating complaints across a whole range of matters including those itemised in this amendment <e>", "<cs> very briefly because people do read the <e>", "<cs> that is quite right <e> <s> so far as the sale and marketing of appliances is concerned this is already under the eye of the director general of fair trading and the monopolies and mergers commission and that is a situation which is going to continue <e> <s> so far as the enormously important matter of the actual standards of the machinery is concerned particularly imported machinery it is not a question of wishful thinking so far as the department of trade and industry is concerned <e> <s> they are currently preparing regulations which they will introduce for all gas cookers whether they are made at home or overseas <e>", "<cs> the first of the three amendments moved by the noble lord lord ezra centred upon the principle of least cost resource acquisition <e> <s> as may be remembered this was strongly resisted for good reasons in another place when it was discussed <e> <s> this requirement would extend the directors field of action upstream and into the vetting of the purchase price of british gas <e> <s> the government are clear that this is not appropriate <e> <s> british gas has every incentive to purchase its gas supplies cheaply since it is in competition with other fuels and energy sources <e> <s> indeed as my right honourable friend commented in giving evidence to the select committee on energy if the director of ofgas could assess better than british gas what gas purchases the company should be making the director should really be the chairman of british gas <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord is putting that question to me in the context of the formula for the consumer tariff because the matter in the forefront of the noble lords mind is his concern that the factor in the formula for passing on the cost of gas to the consumer will lead to an unreasonable burden on the consumer then that is something we must debate when we come to the formula which we will not do tonight <e>", "<cs> i certainly will not do that but if we debate the same subject in the same way again on clause i may give a rather short answer <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord stoddart has raised a very important point concerning safety but i can give the noble lord an assurance that all the aspects mentioned in his amendment are covered by existing legislation the factories act and the health and safety at work etc <e> <s> act <e>", "<cs> so far as concerns the second point that is of course indeed the case though i should just like to look at what the noble lord has said on that particular aspect <e> <s> as regards the first point put to me by the noble lord the health and safety executive is recruiting inspectors and proposes to increase its effort in respect of gas safety matters by over per cent <e> <s> the fact of the matter as i think the noble lord knows is that the health and safety executive numbers reached a low point in <e> <s> there has since been a recovery and recruitment is taking place at the present time <e>", "<cs> i have listened to what the noble lord said <e> <s> he will be aware that british gas has already made it clear that it will be continuing its free safety checks for the elderly and disabled and will continue the existing disconnection code <e> <s> in addition it provides a variety of services to help elderly and disabled people from special adaptions to cookers to free information and advice through home service advisers <e> <s> the interests of the disabled would also be of particular concern to the gas consumers council which will have at least one member with experience in that area <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely sure that those who are interested in the welfare of elderly and disabled people would want existing services cast in stone for evermore <e> <s> it is much more likely that they would want to see services improved as time goes on <e> <s> i shall certainly look at the point that the noble lord lord bruce puts <e> <s> i hope however that he will accept that we should always be in a moving situation in respect of people who need particular help and not try to cast in stone the state of services previously <e> <s> nonetheless i have said that i will look at the publication side <e> <s> i shall certainly look at the same time at what the noble lord lord bruce has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not go into detail because i have covered several times in your lordships house the reasons for the governments proposal <e> <s> we are not going to a merchant bank asking it to approve our reasons <e> <s> we are asking for advice on how best to carry out the policy that we believe right in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his recognition of what my right honourable friend did to obtain agreement within the community for the principle of designating environmentally sensitive areas <e> <s> that recognition of course was for the use of national funds and the million which is to be devoted to the designation of these areas is our national money <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends logic is immaculate <e> <s> however he has overlooked the fact that at the moment support for market prices in the community is running enormously above what anybody budgeted for a year ago <e> <s> we must first think about that <e>", "<cs> my lords in no way do i disagree with the noble lord lord gallacher <e> <s> the government want to see as many of the areas designated out of the as is possible <e> <s> however this will depend initially and very considerably on the costs of the areas <e> <s> once again they differ enormously <e> <s> as far as we can see from the proposals which have been put to us they vary from as much as only capital <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the noble lord since i do not have that percentage with me at the moment <e> <s> however it is a fact that the storehouses are groaning with cereals at present <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mackie of benshie knows better than i do the council of ministers has now decided that we must try to grow more for the market which means growing more milling wheat and malting barley <e>", "<cs> my lords the million is firmly secured so far as agreement with the treasury is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords we must see where we go so far as designation is concerned <e> <s> i have no doubt that we shall be discussing this in some depth when we reach the committee stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that a period of five years would be about right for the initial designation of environmentally sensitive areas but again this is something on which we would want the views of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite understand why the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon has spoken about the late start of the bill <e> <s> we indeed share his regret that the bill did not start earlier in the afternoon <e> <s> it was agreed through the usual channels that a bill would be taken beforehand <e> <s> that bill proved as the noble lord rightly said to have attracted more interest than perhaps we had thought <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord stoddart for moving fairly succinctly this long new schedule to the bill which is in fact a rewrite as he explained of the authorisation which was made available to the committee soon after second reading so that we could all have a good look at it in order to debate it <e> <s> i welcome that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i assumed that we were taking amendment no <e> <s> a as well <e> <s> i shall content myself with saying only three things <e> <s> the first is that i am sure that the noble lord will not mind if i say that there are certain slips of the pen in the drafting of the amendment which make the amendment considerably defective <e> <s> i say that only because amendment no <e> <s> ba has the same printing errors <e> <s> i know that he will be the first to say if we start crawling over them that they create defective amendments <e> <s> i merely say that for the record <e>", "<cs> i hope the committee will not think me tedious if i very briefly repeat part of what i have said before <e> <s> the reason why i part company with what the noble lord lord bruce of donington is saying is simply this <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that there are very important things in the authorisation and i mention two examples one being that there are important new safeguards for consumers of gas so far as connection charges are concerned which is something which is very important and another being important new provisions giving information <e>", "<cs> we have had a long day and we have just completed an important amendment <e> <s> i think perhaps this might be a moment when the house might be resumed if your lordships agree <e> <s> i beg to move that the house be now resumed <e>", "<cs> my lords my answer to that question on behalf of my noble friend the leader of the house was that i shall of course draw the matter to the attention of my noble friend lady young <e> <s> if she thinks that there is anything that should be added i know that she will consider it carefully in the light of what the noble lord lord hatch has said <e> <s> if of course my noble friend does not think there is anything that should be added as a result of the statement then in this house there is ample opportunity for any noble lord to raise any question that he or she may wish <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i also am most grateful to my noble friend lord stanley of alderley for presenting this bill to the house <e> <s> it is a small but very <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of the noble lord lord hatch relates of course to a hypothetical situation <e> <s> it relates to possible action on the part of the south african government against unspecified targets and at no specified time <e> <s> this is of course a matter for your lordships house but i really do not believe that the procedure of the private notice question is the appropriate vehicle for the noble lord on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i finish <e> <s> that was my understanding if i may say so i think that after all that has gone on over this bill and it is for the house to decide whether it agrees with me or not for there <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly i have taken the advice of the table <e> <s> the advice is that under standing order the noble lord lord shepherd is perfectly within his rights and it comes very close to the advice given to him from the bench behind him <e> <s> perhaps it would be for the convenience of the house if i referred to standing order <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the concern of the noble lord lord gallacher that there should be proper consultation on the important matters associated with public gas supply in particular on the question of the authorisation itself <e> <s> this is i agree a matter of the widest public interest and it is right that the legitimate views of all interested parties should be taken into account <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble lord lord ezra the bill does not substantiate what the noble lord has just asserted <e> <s> if he would care to glance at page of the bill he will read there that before not after granting an authorisation the secretary of state shall give notice that he proposes to grant the authorisation that he must state his reasons and that he must specify <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord gallacher is very persuasive in putting forward this amendment but i must confess that first and foremost it would have the effect of leading to quite substantial delays before supplies were authorised and consumers received the gas for which they were waiting <e> <s> having said that i think we ought to keep this in proportion <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ezra puts a direct point to me which refers back to one that was made by the noble lord lord bruce about experience in the united states <e> <s> with respect to the noble lord i do not think that the united states experience is a very good one to follow <e> <s> my advice is that in the s the need for public hearings contributed significantly to delays in processing applications for price rises and the regulatory chaos that led to mass shortages in gas supply <e> <s> that is not an example we would want to follow <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bruce is basing his argument for this group of amendments which hang on amendment no <e> <s> on the fact that there is a parallel with the telecommunications act <e> <s> indeed i agree with the noble lord that the provisions of section of the telecommunications act provide that where an order designating a public telecommunications operator is given it shall be subject to a parliamentary procedure <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bruce has put forward one argument to which i think the house will want a reply <e> <s> understandably the noble lord has said that when dealing with matters relating to the supply of gas the public mind is immediately drawn to the need for particular safety measures <e> <s> perhaps i may quickly say that in my understanding and experience british gas are to be congratulated on the great care that they take in regard to safety <e>", "<cs> all the noble lords who have spoken in support of this amendment have explained their concern that there should be proper control over the standing charge so that there is no possibility of <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> the government have put a condition in the authorisation <e> <s> i believe that this is the right place for it <e> <s> it is true that it is a proposed authorisation but it is subject to exhaustive parliamentary discussion <e> <s> it is quite clear that once parliament has finished discussing the authorisation then parliament can be assured that that is what the authorisation will look like <e>", "<cs> that is a somewhat different matter <e> <s> both of the points which noble lords have made are reasonable points but the one which the noble lord lord ezra put to me is directly and wholly relevant <e> <s> i should now like to prove to noble lords opposite that i have tried to listen <e>", "<cs> no it is not <e>", "<cs> i have to confess that i have discovered that the brief in front of me for amendment no <e> <s> a has the word resist written on it at the top <e> <s> however i am sure that when i come to that particular amendment i could put the situation in rather more parliamentary language for the noble lord <e>", "<cs> paragraphs <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> if i may say so i was not putting it as well as that <e> <s> my noble friend has put it much better than i did <e> <s> it is for the reason she has mentioned that my noble friend did not speak to <e>", "<cs> i have not yet started to answer my noble friend but by all means intervene <e>", "<cs> it has been made clear in another place that the authorisation text has been published in draft and indeed we have referred to this earlier this afternoon <e> <s> i can understand the noble lord lord stoddart feeling that the obligation here is not as clear as it ought to be because of the words about the presentation of the code being used <e> <s> therefore i am perfectly willing to take away that particular wording with a view to bringing forward a clearer text so far as that is concerned before the report stage <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to insert schedule of the revocation terms for an authorisation into the bill <e> <s> i can see that because clause specifies how a public gas suppliers authorisation should be issued it may seem appropriate to provide the terms under which an authorisation once issued can be revoked <e> <s> however the government both in drafting the bill and also in drawing up the authorisation do not believe that the same applies to revocation of an authorisation <e>", "<cs> i gave an undertaking to the noble lord that if he came back to me i would look carefully at what he said <e> <s> if the noble lord feels it within him not to press the amendment i shall do my best to look with care at what he has said and i will undertake to write to him <e>", "<cs> we are on a point here which has to do with whether parliament should insert conditions in an authorisation given to a public gas supplier after british gas have their authorisation <e> <s> it is a comparatively narrow point but i agree that it is an important one <e>", "<cs> this important amendment is about putting into the authorisation for british gas a requirement that the supplier should encourage the efficient use of gas by consumers <e> <s> i have to say to the noble lord lord ezra that i realise that he has been absolutely consistent in this matter throughout the proceedings on this bill <e> <s> we come once again to a subject that the noble lord and others have spoken about before <e>", "<cs> i come now to the main part of the amendment which is all the first half of the amendment <e> <s> noble lords are not arguing in this amendment that the bill itself should refer to energy efficiency <e> <s> i assume that that is because we already have a reference to energy efficiency in clause where there is a duty laid on the secretary of state and the director to exercise their functions in a way best <e>", "<cs> i too listened with interest to the speech by the noble lord lord stoddart <e> <s> i recognise that the noble lord speaks from personal experience of the matters covered by amendment no <e> <s> a and i respect him for that <e> <s> indeed i have learned a thing or two in listening to him <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady seear expressed concern that the health and safety at work etc <e> <s> act does not cover the welfare of employees <e> <s> i should like to set the noble baronesss concern at rest <e> <s> section of the health and safety at work etc <e> <s> act says <e>", "<cs> that shows a rather sad confidence in bills passed through both houses of parliament <e> <s> all that i can say is that i do not agree with the noble baroness on this point <e> <s> i should like also to raise a point with the noble lord lord ezra who referred to the importance of participation <e> <s> one of the great benefits of privatisation is that employees will be able to take a personal stake through a shareholding in their industry in a way that was not possible under nationalisation <e> <s> that is something which has not occurred under previous governments and is occurring under the present government <e> <s> as it is quite clear that those who are working for british gas at the present time are looking forward to privatisation perhaps it would be better for noble lords opposite to listen rather than to laugh <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord lord diamond would care to look at col of <e>", "<cs> i think that all noble lords who have spoken are on to an important and valid point where gas purchasers are concerned <e> <s> i know that many oil companies have expressed concern that the problem which is raised in this particular amendment could arise <e> <s> it is for that reason that we have included in clause of the bill a provision enabling my right honourable friend to give directions to a public gas supplier when its authorisation is granted which is <e>", "<cs> may i say to the noble lord lord bruce that the direction is in fact being drawn up at the moment <e> <s> it will have the effect of placing an obligation on british gas not to pass geological or geophysical data obtained during sales negotiations to people in that company or any associate company which is involved in obtaining licences or interests in licences <e> <s> if the noble lord feels that this is not properly reflected in clause i hesitate to say we may return to this when we get to the clause because i was taken at my word previously and we had another debate the noble lord clearly could return to it when we get to clause <e> <s> that is what is going on now and i thought i ought to reveal that to the committee <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord lord ezra i think that for once he is not correct <e> <s> i think that the timing of clause is the same as the timing of the condition which noble lords are attempting to put forward in this amendment <e> <s> the enforcement provisions in clause are along exactly the same lines as those for authorisation conditions and there is therefore no reason for duplication <e> <s> i am in fact saying that in clause we are doing exactly what noble lords are wanting us to do in the amendment which has been put forward <e>", "<cs> i must apologise to the noble lord lord diamond for not being in my place when he began his remarks on the question whether the clause stand part <e> <s> as i understand it the noble lord put three points only one of which i missed <e> <s> the one i missed was in regard to how the efficiency factor will work in the price formula <e> <s> this is a matter to which we shall be returning <e> <s> we had a chance to debate it on the last occasion the committee met but there are amendments down again <e> <s> it is a factor to be deducted from the retail price index in order to fix the non-gas costs <e> <s> the way in which it will be fixed is in order to give a spur to efficiency in the company <e> <s> perhaps i may ask the noble lord to wait until we come to the formula as otherwise we shall be in danger of debating this not once but several times <e>", "<cs> as presently drafted clause <e>", "<cs> clause with respect to the noble lord lord stoddart does not protect british gas and with respect to the noble lord lord ezra who i think is saying much the same thing clause sets obligations on british gas and any other public gas supplier to meet any reasonable demands where those are economic <e> <s> i do not think one can interpret this as being a protection for british gas <e> <s> but i will go just a little further than that and say that i think it is important for the committee to note that when we reach the next clause <e> <s> clause it contains a specific duty to supply which is not subsidiary to the general duty to supply in clause <e> <s> therefore a public gas supplier cannot refuse to give a particular supply <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is troubled because the words economical and economic both appear in the clause <e> <s> i can not see that there is anything wrong with that <e> <s> the noble baroness may feel that there is unnecessary duplication <e> <s> of course i shall be happy to look at it and take advice but i think subsection <e>", "<cs> i do not want to waste time but i do not want it to seem that the government are uncertain here <e> <s> it seems that paragraphs <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble lord lord gallacher has moved this amendment because for once instead of the government saying that they feel that the amendment goes too far the amendment is rather too modest and not specific enough <e> <s> if one looks at the bill and the general scene one sees that the situation is more encouraging than the amendment would make one think <e>", "<cs> i first refer to amendment no <e> <s> a on the maintenance and development of adequate services for elderly and disabled consumers including the checking of appliances <e> <s> the noble lord lord diamond has put his case for that amendment <e> <s> my noble friend lord campbell has now referred to certain difficulties which he sees in amendment no <e> <s> a and as i think the committee knows my noble friend feels that his own amendment amendment no <e> <s> zb is superior to the other amendments <e>", "<cs> without giving any commitment i undertake to do that <e>", "<cs> i apologise for assuming that the noble lord was moving both amendments nos <e> <s> a and b <e> <s> without repeating what i said before let me say that condition of the draft authorisation provides exactly what he is asking for <e> <s> it provides that there must be a code that it must deal with those who have difficulty in paying bills that it must be prepared in consultation with the director and that it must be prepared in consultation with the gas consumers council <e> <s> the difference between what i am saying and what the noble lord is putting to the committee is <e>", "<cs> i recognise the concern which my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne has expressed about the effectiveness of regulation in british gass upstream activities once british gas has been transferred to the private sector <e> <s> the amendment would not only require suppliers to avoid undue preference in the supply of gas as currently expressed at clause of the bill but would also extend this to gas purchases <e> <s> as i think the government have explained on an earlier occasion we do not believe it would be right to extend the powers or duties of the director upstream <e>", "<cs> the amendment of my noble friend lord campbell seeks to require the secretary of state to issue a code of practice covering special services to the elderly and disabled and to provide apparatus for the enforcement of the codes provisions <e> <s> i listened carefully to my noble friend and i understand exactly what it is he is aiming to achieve <e> <s> he was most generous in giving me a briefing of what he intended to say and what he was aiming to achieve before we came to the committee today <e> <s> but i have to say that i am still extremely doubtful as to whether this really is the most desirable way to set about ensuring that the gas industry continues to act in the very responsible way in which it has acted up to now in these matters <e>", "<cs> on this side of the chamber i am responsible for the bill and i think that we have said all that we are going to say on this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am genuinely grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington for making the simple point that although the formula set out at the moment in the proposed authorisation looks enormously complicated it is based on a simple principle a principle on which all sides of the committee would agree in subscribing that there should be some guarantee set aside from politics that tariff consumers should know the maximum that they would be called upon to pay for gas every year <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i cannot give that undertaking <e> <s> i know the government will be moving as fast as possible on this but that is an undertaking i cannot give to the committee <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce then asked why do we talk about the maximum average price <e> <s> the answer to that is simple <e> <s> it is because british gas will be free under the formula to charge less than the maximum <e> <s> in our formula we have set a maximum average price and that is why we have called it the maximum average price <e> <s> as i say if british gas wish to charge less they will be free to do so <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may speak very briefly because of the time <e> <s> so far as the x factor is concerned i express my regrets to the noble lord lord diamond that i have to repeat that while the government are indeed assessing the scope for increased efficiency in the gas industry and will set x in the light of their conclusions and i can assure the noble lord that the figure will be announced in due course i cannot it is the case give the undertaking which the noble lord wishes me to give this morning <e>", "<cs> three points arise from the noble lords remarks in this short debate <e> <s> first the noble lord expressed anxiety arising from the difference of choice which has been made by him and his noble friends and that of the government in choosing either the maximum average price or the average price <e> <s> the noble lord explained that he is concerned and it is his view not mine or that of the government about differences in price rises in british telecom after privatisation when so he said smaller subscribers were facing larger rises than were larger subscribers <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will forgive me for interrupting him but will he also be dealing with amendments nos <e> <s> aa b and c <e>", "<cs> my lords i think replies have been received from about three of the local authorities concerned <e> <s> my understanding is that two of the authorities have made clear that this position does not apply to them and i think that is encouraging <e> <s> the noble lord asked whether there were powers under sections and of the act which enable the government to move in this matter <e> <s> as i said in my original reply my right honourable friend has written to library authorities about this matter and i think that we should consider the position when the replies have been received <e> <s> with regard to the third point that the noble lord made i entirely agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a power to act <e> <s> it is as the noble lord lord harris said under section of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the choice of reading of the noble lord lord brockway does not mean that he is veering dangerously to the right <e> <s> the noble lords second point is a very important one <e> <s> perhaps i may say on behalf of the government that we deplore any attempt to ban from public libraries <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we welcome the news which the noble baroness has given in that question <e>", "<cs> i do my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords preliminary reports show losses averaging some per cent <e> <s> in england as a whole but there are regional variations <e> <s> losses were highest in the north of england averaging per cent <e> <s> the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food is continuing to monitor the position <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not have any plans to relax import controls <e> <s> so far as the impact of bee losses on pollination of crops is concerned i am advised that the reports for the prospects of flowering and fruit set of top fruit crops are excellent <e> <s> at present it is unlikely that pollination may be inadequate because of the losses that have been suffered in the bee stocks <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much sympathise with those who have suffered losses in their bee colonies <e> <s> but i would say to the noble lord lord dean of beswick that the financial assistance which was given last winter was given to those whose livelihoods were most seriously affected and who we thought could not continue in the livestock sector unless a special package of aid on a very limited basis was provided and that was a once-and-for-all emergency <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not met beekeepers in their professional association <e> <s> i have however replied to a very large number of letters from beekeepers and members of another place making representations <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the answer to that supplementary question <e> <s> i apologise <e> <s> i will find out and write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords cheap sugar would not have repaired the losses in the bee colonies <e> <s> we do not have any such plans <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that uncharacteristically my noble friend is being a little less than fair <e> <s> the ministry of agriculture provides a free diagnostic service and advice to beekeepers in this country and we make sure that bee health is preserved by very strict import controls which means individual scrutiny of any imports coming in being carried out again by ministry of agriculture officials <e> <s> we really do <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly have a look at the relevant regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend is on to a good point but pouring government money into assisting rural industry is something which we need to look at and i shall certainly look carefully at what my noble friend is saying on this particular point <e>", "<cs> my lords nonetheless it is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord gallacher is seeking in this amendment to maintain in every area a point of contact for the consumer and it is on this basic point that the noble lord made most of his speech <e> <s> it is clear that british gas will very much wish to go on selling appliances and they have already given an undertaking that showrooms will continue to offer a full range of services covering all of the matters to which the noble lord has referred in his amendment <e>", "<cs> i will make one comment in reply to the noble lord <e> <s> i understand why noble lords opposite and the noble lord lord bruce finally have laid very great stress on the importance of showrooms <e>", "<cs> i am glad to discuss for a moment with the noble lord the common carriage provisions to which we now come and indeed in this case backup gas <e> <s> after hearing the last few words of the noble lord lord williams of elvel it occurs to me that members opposite may have overlooked the amendments which the government introduced into clause <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord stoddart hazarded certain guesses at the beginning of his remarks about why the draft authorisation in annex a contains the definition that it does of gas supply business <e> <s> we attach considerable importance to ensuring that gas supply is properly accounted for and that those accounts are audited and published and to prepare proper accounts there needs to be complete clarity over the details of exactly what should be included in the accounts and what should not <e> <s> it is for this reason that there is a definition for accounting purposes at annex a of the authorisation <e>", "<cs> i shall just respond to that point put by the noble lord <e> <s> on many occasions noble lords opposite have suggested that the authorisation is a draft authorisation and is not directly part of the legislation although there are mechanisms for changing the authorisation which are in the legislation <e> <s> i say that because as i am talking about something that is not in the legislation what i say on the floor of the committee on behalf of the government on this occasion perhaps is of some weight <e> <s> the government say that the definition of annex a is only for the purpose of separate accounting <e> <s> i give the noble lord that assurance and i give the assurance that there is no intention behind annex a to break up the company <e> <s> indeed in preparing and presenting the legislation the government have always said that we believe that the break-up of the british gas corporation would not be in the interests of consumers <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has identified a very important aspect of the rights of entry powers <e> <s> i can almost come to accept it <e> <s> i am glad to be able to say that i believe the noble lords point is fully covered in the legislation <e> <s> the fact is that the protection that the noble lord is seeking in this amendment is already provided in the rights of entry gas and electricity boards act and section of that act provides that no right of entry to which that act applies shall be exercisable in respect of any premises except with the consent given by or on behalf of the occupier of those premises under the authority by a warrant granted by a justice of the peace under section of the act or in an emergency <e> <s> clause specifically applies that act to any right of entry regulations to be made under this bill <e> <s> i am sorry it is a little complicated but i think i can honestly say that the noble lords point is fully covered <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> which the noble lord is moving has attached to it amendment no <e> <s> x <e> <s> as the noble lord lord stoddart has explained that really incorporates entirely the new draft of the approved code of practice on standards of training in safe gas installation which the health and safety commission have formulated <e> <s> i am very ready to give a sympathetic response because the code has been produced in response to a request from employment ministers to the health and safety commission <e> <s> the noble lord has explained the main aspects of the code i would only add that failure by any installer to comply with the codes provisions may be used in criminal proceedings as evidence that the installer has failed to discharge his duties under the health and safety at work act unless he can prove that he has complied with those duties in some other way <e>", "<cs> i should like to look at that point <e> <s> as the noble lord is aware and as i recorded the code of practice will give guidance required under the health <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord diamond has certainly got a point here and when the noble lord lord whaddon said from the same benches that he felt it moved in the direction the government wish to move in in respect of clause the noble lord too had a point <e> <s> it is the case that this amendment would require the director to give such directions if he considers that competition in gas supplied through pipes would be facilitated thereby and this is what we are trying to do in these common carriage provisions <e>", "<cs> the solution which the noble lord lord diamond has put to me would overcome the criticism i have ventured to make which is that this amendment would remove discretion which the government believe is not only desirable but indeed necessary if the director is to conform to his clause duties <e>", "<cs> for the reasons given by the noble lord lord diamond in the first half of his introductory remarks the government have sought an assurance from british gas that they will not discriminate against producers on the united kingdom continental shelf offering gas in the circumstances which the noble lord has outlined <e> <s> i am able to say to the committee that british gas have confirmed that they will not disciminate but will <e>", "<cs> this is a question as it so often is of balance <e> <s> here there is the danger as the government see it that if one agrees to the principle of british gas being able to issue directions to british gas to require them to buy quantities of gas up to per cent <e> <s> of the gas which it is conveying for others of agreeing to the director becoming involved in the purchase of gas <e> <s> so <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that the noble lord lord harris of high cross is seeking to remove the new principle which we have included in the bill to guide the director in setting common carriage charges to put into practice in effect the recommendation of the select committee on energy in paragraph of their report that charges may in some circumstances be related only to short-run marginal costs <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i thought the noble lord was going to say is it really unfair on british gas <e> <s> which would be offering the facility for as it were no profit but that is not the question the noble lord asked me <e> <s> the noble lord has asked me about the equality of terms so far as the other supplier is concerned <e> <s> i am advised that it will not be commercially impossible under our proposals for the other supplier to be able to operate on a profitable basis after the figures are worked out <e> <s> our provision will ensure a basic fairness of treatment between british gas and the third party and we feel very strongly that we have to adhere to that principle <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord stoddart appreciates that we were concerned in drafting to achieve a balance between a requirement which resulted in adequate information being provided with a requirement which would not be unduly or unreasonably burdensome on british gas <e> <s> we decided on the scale which is in the bill <e> <s> however in the space of only a very short period of time the noble lord has been so persuasive that i feel i can do no more than move fairly rapidly towards the position which he has taken up <e>", "<cs> it is of course the case that british gas as a public gas supplier will have statutory supply and other obligations <e> <s> in order for it to be able to fulfil those obligations it is necessary for british gas to have corresponding rights and privileges <e>", "<cs> it is the town and country planning general development order <e> <s> it is part of that <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> the noble lord characteristically has got the better of me on this <e> <s> i normally brief myself as to what it is that carries on the statutory relevance <e> <s> i have to admit to the noble lord that in this particular case i cannot put my finger on the provision that does carry on the statutory relevance <e> <s> i believe it is simply that the gdo continues no i must not say that <e> <s> i do not know what it is that carries on the statutory relevance <e> <s> if the noble lord will forgive me i shall find that out and will give him the information later <e>", "<cs> by one of the marvellous ways by which ministers suddenly do know something i can tell the noble lord lord diamond that the gdo is an order under the town and country planning act and that of course remains in force <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> strangely enough i have <e> <s> the order is subject to parliamentary procedure under the town and country planning act <e> <s> therefore i must say that the noble lord is right that the gdo as it is known is liable to change <e> <s> however where i hope the noble lord can take encouragement is that there is a parliamentary procedure necessary in order to change it <e>", "<cs> i will gladly look at the point to see whether it is necessary on the governments side to meet the points made by the noble lords lord diamond and lord whaddon but that will be without commitment <e>", "<cs> i should first like to get a technical point out of the way <e> <s> the amendment would require the director to give a direction that a modification be made if competition is facilitated whatever good reasons the public gas supplier may give when he is consulted on the application for that modification not being made <e> <s> i do not think that can be right <e>", "<cs> the provision for payment that is in clause which this amendment is probing in fact is almost identical with the one in the petroleum and submarines pipe-lines act where an applicant makes a similar application in relation to an offshore pipe-line <e> <s> i would have thought that where modifications are to be made solely for the benefit of a third party it is really only fair that the third party should pay the full costs <e> <s> in fact in most if not in all cases the full costs and the marginal costs will be the same <e> <s> where the pipeline system is already in existence which is the circumstance catered for in this clause and the additions are for the benefit of the third party marginal and full costs of modification are the same or if not the same much the same <e> <s> i hope that that answers the point that the noble lord is probing <e>", "<cs> the amendment of the noble lord lord diamond deals with the franchising of areas for gas supply for a five-year period of franchisement <e> <s> it is an interesting concept but i feel that it suffers from two drawbacks <e> <s> the first derives from the fact that the supply of gas is an inherently long-term business <e> <s> the main physical asset of any gas utility is its network of pipes sunk into the ground some of which have lives of years or more <e> <s> the main commercial assets of a utility are its gas supply contracts with gas producers which are also very long term sometimes years or more <e> <s> it is difficult to see how a five-year franchise to supply could fit in with the realities of such a business <e> <s> that is one difficulty <e> <s> one would have to do more than tinker with the five years to overcome it <e>", "<cs> if i may say so without appearing unfriendly the ball is in the court of the noble lords whose concept it is <e> <s> i have tried honestly and openly to say what i think are the two drawbacks to the concept and they are considerable drawbacks <e> <s> it would be up to the noble lords opposite to decide whether they could overcome those drawbacks in devising some alternative amendments <e>", "<cs> very briefly there is a problem with this which i have not mentioned but which i would have thought must be obvious to all members of the committee that is the funding of such a franchise <e> <s> with many financial experts here i shall not launch off into the rapids of that matter except to say that when the noble lord lord whaddon talks about the benefits of franchises in radio and television of course we are there dealing with assets which are comparatively short lived and comparatively easy to dispose of compared with the gas industry where one would be left at the end of a franchise of whatever length with questions unanswered about what to do with the gas which has been contracted for ahead and what to do with the pipes which have already been put into the ground <e> <s> because of these difficulties we are seeking to encourage competition in the bill through improving the common carriage provisions <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord williams has explained that this amendment would require a reference at least every five years to the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> it does not in fact make clear what particular aspect of supply to tariff customers would be the subject to the reference <e> <s> but as i understand the noble lord it would be of a general nature to take stock of the way the monopoly as the noble lord said is working <e>", "<cs> i follow the noble lord and i apprehend we shall be at those amendments soonish <e> <s> looking at this amendment my reaction is this <e> <s> when all is said and done the provisions of the bill as a whole will mean that the director will need to keep under review the activities of a public gas supplier and to consider whether in the interests of achieving the goals set out in clause incidentally a matter to which we can come back again under amendment no <e> <s> a including the interests of consumers and promoting gas safety the authorisations conditions ought to be modified <e> <s> if the director comes to the conclusion that these clause goals would be better achieved by some revised provision in the authorisation then he will if he cannot agree a change with the supplier make a reference to the monopolies and mergers commission under clause <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to the case put by the noble lord lord harris of high cross and that put by the noble viscount lord hanworth but what troubles me is that both cases seem to be based on the assumption that there is simply a monopoly power for gas to do what it likes and that there is no competition in the energy market <e>", "<cs> i shall be brief in replying to this amendment <e> <s> it is perhaps the most important of the group of amendments that the noble lord lord williams has moved <e> <s> the bill refers the monopolies and mergers commission to the duties set out in clause to guide it in considering where the public <e>", "<cs> not specifically and that is one of the reasons why i do not like the amendment <e> <s> i do not believe that it would truly be to the advantage of gas consumers whom we are seeking to protect in this case <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord there is not a printers error <e> <s> the amendment would require the monopolies and mergers commission where it becomes aware that a public gas supplier is a party to an agreement that may be registerable under the restrictive trade practices act to consider whether the agreement is in the public interest or not <e> <s> we believe that this would be misguided because the restrictive trade practices act gives the task of determining whether such agreements are in the public interest to the restrictive trade practices court <e> <s> we feel that it would only serve to create confusion if the monopolies and mergers commission was to investigate such a question when the task is properly for another body <e>", "<cs> my lords netting for salmon and migratory trout is already tightly regulated in united kingdom waters <e> <s> existing legislation provides powers further to restrict and in appropriate circumstances terminate commercial netting for salmon in england and wales and subject to minor exceptions elsewhere in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords we are taking powers in clause of the salmon bill to enable weekly close times in scotland to be increased by statutory instrument <e> <s> i fully understand the reason why the noble baroness has asked this question and i have to say in responding in the way i have that we must also consult all interested parties before we take a final decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord moran for his welcome for the announcement made in standing committee in another place by my right honourable friend the minister of state that a standing advisory committee on salmon conservation is to be set up <e> <s> indeed that was a response to opinion in another place but also very much took into account the views expressed on all sides of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a point that was made by my noble friend during the passage of the salmon bill a couple of months or so ago <e> <s> i am therefore familiar with it <e> <s> indeed i am sure that the government would wish to look with interest on the proposal if it were to form part of a private members bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested to hear that view from the noble lord which certainly the government will take with seriousness <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly made it clear during the passage of the salmon bill that we were bearing precisely in mind the view expressed by the noble lord lord glenamara <e> <s> the noble lord will remember that further restrictions are to be introduced so far as the north-east drift net fishery is concerned and their effects will be reviewed after three years <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord will agree that we must not pre-empt that review <e>", "<cs> my lords great britain already controls salmon fishing very tightly and has a better record on conservation than many countries <e> <s> i believe that the further measures contained in the salmon bill will be recognised internationally as enhancing that contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i think perhaps i ought very briefly to say a few words in reply to the noble lord and to the noble lord lord stoddart <e> <s> the committee ought to be aware when the noble lord lord diamond calls in aid the fact that this bill was guillotined in another place that after the guillotine was imposed the discussion on the guillotined clauses never in fact ran <e>", "<cs> there is a precedent in the sense that subsection provides that subsection shall apply to the members of a body corporate responsible for the management of its affairs as if they were directors <e> <s> we find that in the case of a nationalised industry such as british gas <e>", "<cs> i should like to look at this again <e> <s> the precedent that i have is the gas act sections and <e> <s> it may be that those two precedents suffer from the criticism which the noble lord is levelling at me <e> <s> i have given the noble lord some information in reply to his question <e> <s> if i might have a further look at it possibly i might write to him <e>", "<cs> i am a little surprised that the noble lord lord bruce has intervened in that way because i understood that the noble lord lord diamond was satisfied with subsection <e> <s> but once again perhaps i can read what the noble lord lord bruce has said and if there is anything which we feel we need to add i shall write to the noble lord lord bruce <e>", "<cs> there is nothing sinister in the efficiency or x factor in the price formula which is to be found in the authorisation and which is the subject to the two amendments moved by the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> it is a factor that will be set prior to privatisation when the scope for improved efficiency has been fully assessed and the idea is that it will ensure that customers benefit <e> <s> as i think on all sides we agree that that is highly desirable it is also highly desirable that we should get the efficiency factor right <e>", "<cs> i cannot give the assurance for which the noble lord asks <e> <s> i am sure that we shall be doing our best and i have no doubt that i shall be able to say something more shortly <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i have exhausted the offerings that i can make to the noble lord except to say that shortly means shortly <e>", "<cs> i must say that i am disappointed in the noble lord <e> <s> he started his remarks on this amendment by generously saying that i was a reasonable man who would treat in all fairness the committee and the things that we do <e> <s> now the noble lord is suggesting that i shall make some announcement just after the house has gone into recess <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord was not saying that but i am not sure <e>", "<cs> it had crossed my mind that that is what the noble lord lord bruce meant <e> <s> i could not credit though that the noble lord was casting aspersions upon my right honourable friend the secretary of state who has produced an admirable bill which will be excellent in the effects that it has upon customers <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord williams will not think that i am being in any way dismissive because the noble lord has every right to have an interest in the proposed capital structure of the company <e> <s> obviously it is a matter in which the committee has a right to be interested <e> <s> however at the moment it is premature to expect that i can answer detailed questions not least about the figure of billion because the capital structure is a matter requiring careful consideration with the corporation itself and with city advisers <e> <s> therefore i really cannot be as forthcoming as the noble lord and indeed perhaps the committee might wish <e>", "<cs> in view of the hostile reaction from the noble lords lord bruce of donington and lord diamond i should say that we are as a matter of fact although noble lords might not suspect it conducting a short discussion on a group of amendments which would make it impossible for the company to issue debentures to my right honourable friend <e> <s> it is that which i am resisting <e>", "<cs> on the first amendment this is a question of drafting <e> <s> my advice is that it is quite clear that the text is referring to the value of the shares per share <e> <s> the proposed amendment is therefore not necessary <e> <s> if one looks at the text the value refers back to the shares on the drafting <e> <s> i was not surprised to receive advice that this is not a necessary amendment <e>", "<cs> all i can add is that i am surprised that the noble lord says that <e> <s> the value of a business must surely be judged by reference to the income that can be generated from its assets or by the value of its assets if they are sold individually on the open market rather than the accounting value computed by adding together the replacement cost of the assets <e> <s> i am sorry but if the noble lord thinks that the government do not <e>", "<cs> the noble lord talks about transparent manoeuvre <e> <s> what the noble lord lord bruce has omitted to say is that we are talking about the net asset value being a suitable basis or not for valuation on a flotation <e> <s> the noble lord lord diamond talked about this earlier <e> <s> as i understood the noble lord he said that company directors ought to be concerned if their share price drops below the net asset value <e> <s> i would agree <e> <s> that is indeed the case if that net asset value is calculated on the basis of what would be realised on disposal of those assets since a new owner could then take the company over and dispose of the assets <e>", "<cs> this is an important group of amendments <e> <s> the new schedule in amendment no <e> <s> y puts forward a number of propositions which the noble lord lord williams just went through in relation to the disposal of securities when the flotation <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has moved amendment no <e> <s> va and spoken to two other <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord recognises clause has been included in the bill to deal with the problem which he outlined <e> <s> it will enable my right honourable friend to give a direction to a public gas supplier to ensure that no unfair commercial advantage is gained from information acquired in the course of gas purchase negotiations <e> <s> the intention of the government is to give a direction to british gas which requires the company not to pass on geological and geophysical data obtained during gas purchase negotiations to people in the company or any associate company who are involved in obtaining licences or interests in licences and the direction will apply to all negotiations for gas supply <e>", "<cs> having heard from all round the committee expressions of view on the importance of adas i wonder whether i may now intervene <e> <s> from the benches opposite we heard criticisms from the noble lord lord melchett and the noble baroness lady white of how it is developing at the present time <e> <s> the noble lord says that the service is not developing but i disagree and i hope to explain why <e>", "<cs> that is a fair point that the noble lord lord walston has made <e> <s> it is the point around which the debate is turning <e> <s> although i realise that there is a difference between a duty and a power we are i hope showing our <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to the speech of the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> the government yield to no one in their view which coincides with the noble lords about the importance of giving first-class environmental advice something incidentally i accept that the advisory services benefit from as well as the recipients <e> <s> i know perfectly well having worked in the ministry now for three years how much one learns from going to see people and hearing what they have to say as well as how much clients in the case of the advisory services are learning from adas <e> <s> it is fair to say that an enormous amount has gone on in recent years in relation to training in adas <e> <s> there have been regional conferences at which speakers from many conservation and environmental agencies have been welcomed to address officers in the advisory services <e> <s> i assert that the expertise of adas today not only on agricultural production but also on environmental advice is on the up and up <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may once again briefly intervene <e> <s> i think that both my noble friend lord sandford and the noble lord lord melchett are upbraiding me from each side of the committee for not addressing myself to what they regard as the fundamental question <e> <s> just for once perhaps i may throw the ball back because they have left me in some perplexity <e> <s> if for reasons which i deployed when i dealt with amendment no <e> <s> the ministry of agriculture intends to introduce charges for the advisory services and i realise that there is a difference of view on this somehow or other there must be a way of drawing a dividing line between where you charge and where you do not charge <e>", "<cs> with respect i think that i answered the point raised by the noble baroness lady nicol when i spoke on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i made it clear in answer to the noble lord lord john-mackie in relation to amendment no <e> <s> that because we are drawing the remit of adas in clause of this bill infinitely wider than it has ever been drawn before we want to make it a power <e> <s> i gave two examples of ways in which if we made clause into a duty people could come to the ministry of agriculture and cause great difficulties for the ministry because the remit had become wider and wider <e> <s> it would mean that the duty to provide advice and advisory services had become yet wider and wider <e> <s> i did not think that that was reasonable <e> <s> i particularly hung it on the peg of the fact that clause <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may speak at this stage because i want to pose two questions <e> <s> the key element of section is that advice must be provided free but that is to farmers and clause of this bill is not just wide in substance it also has no restriction as regards farmers <e> <s> first does that not create some problem in knowing where to draw the line <e> <s> secondly if the noble baroness is saying and i quite understand what she is saying that there is no problem here that we simply keep a duty as it was in section but we leave paragraphs <e>", "<cs> i am glad the noble lord lord melchett has asked that question because it is a perfectly fair one <e> <s> the answer to it is if i may be absolutely honest that in drawing a line which i have made a statement about we would be having to use the words i have already used an honest judgment <e> <s> it would be possible if the farmer believed or indeed not only the farmer under clause but someone involved in the food industry or in rural diversification maybe a whole variety of people but if the recipient believed the line was being drawn in the wrong place i have said in the statement i made there would be a right of appeal to the regional panel of the ministry whose advice the minister almost always accepts <e> <s> so we believe this would be the right way of going about it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord melchett has put his finger again on a point <e> <s> we are talking about the difference between an appeal to an advisory panel which is well understood certainly by farmers in all localities <e> <s> there are a large number of appeals going on about the extension of less favoured areas for <e>", "<cs> this is an interesting amendment and once again it has received much support <e> <s> it is unusual in such circumstances for a minister to turn down an invitation to extend the governments powers but i am going to make a case for doing so <e> <s> i would remind your lordships that clause of the bill already provides powers for advice to be given to any person on a very wide range of issues including those relating to the natural beauty and amenity of the countryside and any other agricultural activity or enterprise of benefit to the rural economy <e> <s> as the noble lord lord walston quite rightly said the requirements of clause to have regard to and endeavour to balance all the considerations set out in that clause including the promotion of the enjoyment of the countryside by the public apply as much to adas as they do to other statutory activities and i contend would adequately meet the concerns which have been expressed <e>", "<cs> the noble lord asked me whether i have consulted with the countryside commission <e> <s> no i have not though i should be very pleased to do so <e> <s> it is true that there is overlap between ministry functions in clause and other statutory functions but this would be an absolutely direct duplication of another statutory function <e> <s> it would be very questionable whether that would be desirable whether it is desirable from a statutory point of view and whether it is desirable as a matter of practice in our public life to lay duplicating duties on two bodies or more than two bodies <e>", "<cs> clause as its sidenote says deals with a duty to balance interests in the exercise of the ministrys agricultural functions <e> <s> i believe that the four ways in which that ought to be done which include the promotion and enjoyment of the countryside by the public are right <e> <s> however clause as the noble lord lord melchett says is different <e> <s> it concerns a direct power inviting the ministry to give advice which in this particular amendment would relate to the promotion of public enjoyment of the countryside <e> <s> that would mean such things as drafting and giving out pamphlets and literature on public access <e> <s> i am clear in my own mind that if we do that then it would be a direct duplication of the duty that is laid on the countryside commission by the countryside act <e> <s> i do not believe that would be right <e>", "<cs> i do not want to appear unhelpful or taciturn but i am not going to have other people making statue law for the government <e> <s> i do not believe that the amendment is right and i have given my reasons <e> <s> i am delighted to talk to anybody but i do not think that further discussion would make the government change their mind on this point <e>", "<cs> the giving of information and advice is already covered by paragraph <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first of all say that adas is taking an increasing interest in organic methods of farming <e> <s> we already provide advice and we have plans to designate a number of advisers with specialised interests in organic issues to help us respond to the industry on this matter <e> <s> i am not sure that we have said this publicly before but i am saying it now <e> <s> this is one reason for having a probing amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to give a straight answer to the first question <e> <s> i think that it was two years ago that i had the opportunity to pay a visit to that particular farm in wiltshire <e> <s> there were two members of the agricultural science service who were monitoring the pests and diseases in the organically grown crops on that particular farm <e> <s> incidentally as a matter of interest my visit took place about three weeks before harvest started in july and it really was something i shall never forget <e> <s> on that particular farm the crops were entirely clean <e> <s> they were wholly free from disease of any kind <e> <s> it is certainly an abiding memory for me <e> <s> i am sure that the farmer concerned would have been the first to have pointed out that whereas the corn crops in the first year after the land had been laid down to grass it was being done on that cycle were producing really quite heavy crops when one reached the second year of corn of course the crops were less thick and no doubt this has some bearing on their freedom from disease <e> <s> nonetheless there were some very good crops of winter and spring wheat the first year after being laid down to grass and all the fields the whole lot were absolutely clean <e> <s> i think that is something on which our minds need to dwell <e>", "<cs> i must write to the noble lord on that matter <e> <s> i am sure the answer will be yes but as i am not briefed on this question i shall write to him <e>", "<cs> i give my noble friend an undertaking on those last words of his <e> <s> i shall be in contact with him on the amendment before the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> this has been an interesting debate and i have also listened carefully to it and learned something from it <e> <s> the first reason i say that it is interesting is that the effect of the amendment of the noble lord lord john-mackie would be that advisory services were provided entirely free <e> <s> however interestingly enough the noble lord is more draconian than the government in that the amendment says that there should be a charge of a reasonable amount for any goods provided as part of an advisory service <e> <s> there of course the government want to keep more flexibility <e> <s> for instance we think that advisory publications or emergency vaccines which the noble lord mentioned could in some cases be free as well as being charged for <e> <s> so there are quite interesting cross-currents in relation to this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry but i do not have that information <e> <s> i shall have to come back on that to the noble lord <e> <s> when i visited germany my understanding was that it was on a subscription basis at the beginning of the year but i shall come back to the noble lord on that <e> <s> however the noble lords question leads me to try to answer a question which was put to me by my noble friend lord stodart who said that while we are on this subject we ought now to know exactly what it is that the government are putting before the committee as regards charging <e>", "<cs> i should like to look at that and perhaps have a word with my noble friend between now and the next stage of the bill <e> <s> there are problems as to where one would draw the dividing lines in this particular matter <e> <s> it was because i was bearing in mind the sort of point my noble friend has just put to me that i started my statement by pointing out that we will have two levels of subscriptions and the first will be at a very reasonable level indeed <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble lord lord melchett we had a long debate on his amendment no <e> <s> and this was exactly what we discussed and i had hoped that we had moved on from that <e> <s> may be we differ on this but we can agree to differ <e> <s> i do not see that there is much point in going over all the ground again if i may say so <e>", "<cs> i am interested that the noble lord who has been consistent in advising that he does not like the idea of charging for adas is nonetheless saying that if there are to be charges they could be collected comparatively painlessly and reasonably by way of levies <e> <s> i should be foolish if i disregarded the advice that he gives <e> <s> there are advantages in doing it that way <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord radnor has made clear in moving the amendment that he is anxious to see that where adas charges are made they should reflect the full economic cost of providing the service <e> <s> i quite understand why my noble friend moves the amendment although as the noble lord lord mackie of benshie observed the private sector has competed very successfully with free adas services in the past <e> <s> and really there should not be any reason to suppose that the introduction of charges will change that <e> <s> none the less there is a very <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may simply say this <e> <s> there will continue to be written up in the scientific press in the normal way the results of publicly funded rd <e> <s> as such this will be freely available to interested parties such as outside consultants for them to draw their own conclusions and to formulate their advice accordingly <e> <s> discussions are in hand between adas and representatives of the private advisory sector concerning future possibilities for collaboration including arrangements for access by outside consultants to other data and services that adas can provide <e>", "<cs> on annual reports we are not sure that they have been putting before the general public information which is of interest <e> <s> it has always been nice to see an annual report <e> <s> it has been extremely interesting and encouraging to see the reflection in the annual report of the activity going on in the experimental husbandry farms <e> <s> however if one wants to get the results of the work done in experimental husbandry farms we believe that there are other ways of doing so <e> <s> the noble lord has put his finger on an important point <e> <s> i can assure him that there will continue to be written up in the scientific press in the ordinary way the results of work at the experimental husbandry farms and horticultural stations not to mention the fact that there will continue to be the open days which are always such an enormous success in these establishments <e>", "<cs> i do not think that there is anything unreasonable in the last few words which the noble lord has spoken <e> <s> to pay for literature is not unreasonable <e> <s> there will be subscription schemes in order to do that <e>", "<cs> i thought that i gave a rather valuable assurance to my noble friend lord radnor about the dissemination of publicly funded r d particularly with regard to consultants <e> <s> i think that what i said will be welcomed by consultants in that respect <e>", "<cs> that is indeed the case <e>", "<cs> this is an amendment of my noble friend lord stanley about milk and dairies regulations and also licences for swill feeding <e> <s> in deciding to introduce charges for inspections under the milk and dairies regulations we were conscious of the fact that producers derive benefit from this work <e> <s> the high quality and reputation of our domestic milk production helps to maintain liquid consumption and this in turn benefits producers returns which would certainly suffer if consumers had less confidence in the product <e> <s> it is for that reason that we felt that there was a strong case here for charges to be made <e>", "<cs> if it was not possible to have checks for health in dairies i think we should very soon find that liquid milk consumption would be harmed and if we were unable to have the assurance of licences for swill feeding i think swill feeders would simply go out of business <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend was not in the committee earlier this afternoon when i gave figures for other european countries which show that charges for their advisory services started earlier and are higher than ours <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord gallacher who i think has a very great deal of knowledge of this subject as it falls within the scope of the committee of your lordships house of which he is chairman i shall not try to embark upon the details of the socio-economic proposals of the community because they have only just been published and are not all that easy to follow <e>", "<cs> this amendment has brought about a somewhat improbable alliance on agricultural matters between the noble lord lord john-mackie and the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> i must say it is an alliance which i join but not because this amendment does not seem like a good idea indeed it does seem like a good idea and it was run in another place <e> <s> we have thought very seriously as i do not mind revealing about whether it is possible to bring together the available advice <e> <s> perhaps i might just say in passing that some of the discussion we have had seemed to indicate to some extent that there was not very much advice going out to all the various people who ought to have it <e> <s> i must say that there really is a library every year of published material which goes out from the four different services which make up adas <e> <s> if anybody is interested they have only to put the publications together or even to keep one or two of them to be able to be on the right lines in a whole variety of ways <e>", "<cs> i do not want to appear unfriendly but the noble lord lord melchett has put his finger on the one section of the rural community who really are well informed <e> <s> if one is a consultant the one thing that one makes sure of is that one has the available literature <e> <s> indeed one of the reasons why my noble friend lord radnor moved amendment no <e> <s> earlier this evening was that he was anxious that consultants should know exactly where they would stand with adas in the future <e> <s> probably in my noble friends mind although he did not dwell on it was the wish to know that there would be a continuing flow of information from adas <e> <s> i like to think that i gave some reassurance on that particular point <e>", "<cs> the home-grown cereals authoritys functions are concerned with improving the production and marketing of home-grown cereals and not promoting the production of cereals <e> <s> i do not think that it should be part of the authoritys role to remind cereal growers of their on-farm responsibilities <e> <s> for that reason i resist the amendment <e>", "<cs> i welcome the opportunity to explain the reasons for seeking to increase the maximum membership of the mlc to <e> <s> as the noble lord knows membership is limited to a maximum of at the moment <e> <s> of these ministers appoint three as independents and seven on the basis of industry nominations <e> <s> broadly speaking three commissioners represent the livestock production sector two the slaughtering wholesaling and manufacturing sector and two the retail sector <e> <s> last year a group of key industry organisations from all three sectors proposed that membership should be increased to so that the direct levy payers producers and slaughterers could each be represented by three commissioners <e> <s> clause was drafted accordingly <e>", "<cs> on behalf of the government i most certainly support the noble lords amendment <e> <s> the noble lord acquainted me with it on peterborough station last week <e> <s> it sounds even better in your lordships committee than it sounded then <e> <s> i have great pleasure in supporting it <e>", "<cs> i agree with my noble friend that there is something of an impasse <e> <s> my understanding is that poultry slaughterhouses are able to refuse access to plants to trainee poultry meat inspectors for practical instruction which community legislation requires before qualification <e> <s> this has led to a very unsatisfactory state of affairs <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend lord middleton moves amendment no <e> <s> let me say that i wish to suggest that consideration of two government amendments be postponed to places later than those shown on the second marshalled list which has been prepared for us today <e> <s> that is because i think it would be convenient for the committee to consider milk quotas in england and wales before those in scotland <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the efforts that my noble friend lord middleton together with the noble lord lord walston have made in an attempt to find a more simple solution to the question of end of tenancy compensation for milk quotas <e> <s> however i have to say that a large number of people in the farming community would not see this particular amendment apart from the attempt for simplicity as being fair to the tenant <e>", "<cs> the figures which we intend to put before the chamber for consideration for the computation of excess quota are something to which i was intending to come on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> these figures would be written into the statutory instrument if parliament agrees to schedule becoming a part of the bill <e> <s> in addition to that the concept of an excess quota is also contained in amendment no <e> <s> which i shall be hoping to move in a few minutes time when we have finished with other amendments <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to be unforthcoming to my noble friend indeed he is one of the last members of your lordships committee to whom i should wish to be unforthcoming on an agricultural matter <e> <s> but there is really one particular difficulty in connection with this amendment <e> <s> incidentally i think both my noble friend and i can take some comfort from the fact that the disagreement which has existed in the agricultural organisations and which has prompted my right honourable friend to come to parliament with proposals in clause and schedule has to some extent been reflected here this afternoon in that your lordships in giving advice on this amendment have not by any means always agreed if i may say that gently and mildly <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that consideration of the new clause in amendment no <e> <s> be postponed to before amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> yes that of course would be the case if there was then no statutory succession <e> <s> may i just underline the fact that as schedule makes clear this is a one-off exercise <e> <s> this payment of compensation at the end of a tenancy to retiring or moving tenant farmers who have a milk quota is a once and for all payment <e> <s> that is made clear i think in schedule <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the committee which i must admit has looked at this government <e>", "<cs> the noble lords intervention demonstrates the governments difficulty and the different views put forward <e> <s> he feels that the idea of the tenants improvements being related to the amount that the tenant gets of the standard quota which is called the tenants fraction is not fair whereas members of the committee who voted for the first amendment of my noble friend lord middleton would say that what is in the bill is fair and that the amounts that i have read out are considerable <e>", "<cs> i should like to say to my noble friend lord stanley that we have now had about two and a half hours or more of close discussion and i know that whenever i have spoken it has been a bit tortuous <e> <s> my noble friend has produced an amendment which contains a good deal of ingenuity <e> <s> it is terse clear and based on an interesting concept but i agree with my noble friend lord middleton that my noble friend is opening his mouth a little wide <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make one point before we finish <e> <s> the noble lord lord walston has said that this chamber does not know what the tenants fraction amounts to <e> <s> the way in which the tenants fraction is to be computed is set out in paragraph of schedule <e> <s> it is supposed to be the part of the standard quota which is to be credited to the tenant <e> <s> its size will depend upon the value of the tenants improvements compared with the rental value of the land <e>", "<cs> that is correct <e>", "<cs> i always listen with the very greatest care to what the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos says <e> <s> the noble lord was a minister previously and he has unrivalled experience <e> <s> however there is one difficulty as regards what the noble lord has just said <e> <s> the noble lord understandably attributed some of his views on this particular matter to briefs which had been issued by the milk marketing board <e> <s> i think it is fair to say that the milk marketing boards assessment understates the value of the governments proposals to tenants <e> <s> for example it ignores the fact that we have allowed for the full effect of per cent <e> <s> quota cut-back even though many tenants have had some of that cut-back made up <e>", "<cs> i was indulging in a courtesy <e> <s> the figures which the milk marketing board had set out in its briefs are not correct <e>", "<cs> annual rental value at the end of the quota base period normally of the tenants dairy improvements and fixed equipment is to be the basis so it is proposed in paragraph of schedule that is so far as the tenants contribution is concerned that the annual rent paid for the land used for the feeding accommodation and milking of dairy cows during the base period will be the assessment of the landlords input <e>", "<cs> i should have thought that the answer i gave first does not include overdraft interest <e> <s> it is a straight annual rental value at the end of the quota base period of the improvements and the fixed equipment <e> <s> if that leads still to trouble of interpretation for the noble lord perhaps i may write to him <e>", "<cs> i have just been passed a note to the effect that of course if it has been genuinely written down one will take the written-down value <e> <s> does that take us a step further forward <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord lord mackie of benshie if i may say so there is a world of difference between the governments proposal in amendments nos <e> <s> and which seeks and the committee has agreed to use as the basis for calculations the land used for the feeding of dairy cows when looking at what ought to be the quota on that particular farm taking into account normal management and my noble friend lord stanleys amendment amendment no <e> <s> which we have disposed of which specifically said that one only took into account the actual land itself and the feeding of no additional concentrates in deciding what the standard quota ought to have been <e> <s> i hope that makes it clear <e> <s> i think the amendments are entirely different and amendment no <e> <s> is really consequential on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord melchett for welcoming this clause <e> <s> i think i ought just to say as we embark on clause that the arguments about whether an amendment to a clause of this sort ought to have been written into a private members bill some months ago were in the context of <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord says we have communicated with each other about the ministers hill farming advisory committee and of course there is a wide range of experience on that committee in regard to all aspects of hill farming <e> <s> i have a feeling that the noble lord lord melchett does not approve of that reply but i do not really think i can improve on it <e>", "<cs> clause will be taken into account when the committee consider relevant agricultural functions <e> <s> there again i am not entirely sure that the noble lord will like that reply but i think it is the right one <e>", "<cs> if i may say so the previous answer which i have just given to the noble lord is the one which i must stick on <e> <s> we have clause <e> <s> we take it into account where committees relate to relevant agricultural functions <e> <s> if the noble lord feels that in the case of the hill farming advisory committee the appointments we made were not consonant with clause then the noble lord must say so to me <e> <s> but i do not think one can stand by that thesis <e>", "<cs> let me follow what my noble friend lord ferrers said and give one more reply to the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> the purpose of my right honourable friends hill farming advisory committee is to have advice given to the minister on hill farming affairs <e> <s> i was very careful in starting my reply to the noble lord lord melchett on this amendment to say that we must remember that the primary purpose of agriculture is still food production but that in carrying out that primary purpose clause is saying that there should be a balance <e> <s> that is why the word land is there and why paragraphs <e>", "<cs> i think it would be fair to say because i chair the committee and my noble friend lord ferrers chaired it before me that we have a wide range of expertise on this committee and are not wanting members of the committee who have a working knowledge of forestry <e> <s> but i think the committee would not mind if i said that when we were specifically considering farmers in the hills and uplands we would obviously want to have expert advice <e> <s> i assure the noble baroness that we would certainly consider the importation of expert advice if we were considering forestry on this committee <e>", "<cs> i agree with all that has been said on this amendment <e> <s> our intention was that archaeological features should be covered <e> <s> but i quite see that there might be some element of doubt in the minds of those who have a particular interest in the archaeological aspect as to whether these interests are to be taken into account on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> it is fair to claim that the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food has given a good deal <e>", "<cs> i sympathise with the considerations that have led noble lords to put down the amendment and with the intention as the noble lord lord oram explained that underlies it <e> <s> it is very much the considerations that the noble lord explained in his speech that lead her majestys government to argue in the ministerial councils of the european communities which determine the community line taken in the gatt in favour of policies that encourage the free flow of trade in agricultural products and the participation in that trade of the developing countries <e> <s> to convert that line of thought that policy into this amendment would nonetheless be difficult <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say after listening to all your lordships saying the same thing that we are indeed sympathetic to the approach in this amendment <e> <s> we have actually been carrying out studies in this field and looking at the type of approach embodied in this amendment <e> <s> may i just say how very encouraged i was to hear what the noble lord lord sandford said about trying to free up the planning attitudes to rural diversification <e> <s> the difficulty which i have in replying to this is that the following issues are raised and i do not think they are issues which i have heard in speeches already <e>", "<cs> i can hardly wait <e> <s> i am not sure that i share the optimism of the noble lord that the commission will get hold of this objective <e> <s> the objective is laudable understandable and desirable but do not let us fool ourselves <e> <s> the commission realises clearly that the agricultural budget has to have a brake put on it otherwise we shall find the european budget breaking through the ceiling <e> <s> i shall not go down that road now but money is very much in the minds of the commission and the agriculture ministers <e> <s> nevertheless i take the point on board <e> <s> the noble lord has a valid point <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord melchett has explained the concerns he has about keeping beef bulls in fields <e> <s> i will just say that section represented five years ago a compromise between the practical needs of farmers and the legitimate concerns about rights of way <e> <s> for most farmers raising beef artificial insemination is simply not a practical alternative <e> <s> the beef cow unlike the dairy cow is not brought in twice a day and may indeed be quartered outside and at some distance from the farm buildings for the greater part of the year <e> <s> thus the only way successfully to get cows or heifers into calf is to run a bull with them over a period and in many cases it may be possible to avoid doing this in fields crossed by rights of way <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i am equipped to do that this evening <e> <s> i am not equipped to do that because that is not what the noble lord lord melchett wants <e> <s> the noble lord is not satisfied with the move that was made in and now wants to move further <e> <s> i do not think the noble lord lord melchett will thank the noble lord lord winstanley if we return to the law as it was before <e>", "<cs> the amendment would enable agriculture ministers to designate large tracts of the countryside as environmentally sensitive <e> <s> in many <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord craighton is right to remind us that the introduction of environmentally sensitive areas will make a big contribution to the publics enjoyment of the countryside <e> <s> many of the areas proposed for designation are enormously popular with tourists and a source of pride to local people <e> <s> but i am not so clear what would be gained by specifying enjoyment of the countryside as a separate objective <e> <s> indeed i think it could be counterproductive <e> <s> naturally the public right of access to environmentally sensitive areas has to be maintained but to say that access to working farms must be promoted as a statutory duty could very well conflict with a desirability to conserve and enhance flora and fauna <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord craigton indicated on second reading that he would be tabling this amendment and amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i have studied what my noble friend said then and i have listened carefully to his comments today <e> <s> i believe that it is the duty of the ministry of agriculture to work through agriculture towards the wider objectives that my noble friend recommends <e> <s> i think that in that respect i am at one with my noble friend <e> <s> however i part company with him on a further point <e>", "<cs> the point i am trying to make is that agricultural practices are relevant to the protection of archaeological sites <e> <s> for instance field barriers can be damaged by agricultural methods <e> <s> as my noble friend knows sites of archaeological interest can be damaged by ploughing equally historic buildings can be protected through agricultural use by using them for the housing of livestock rather than letting them fall into dereliction <e> <s> these are all things which can fall within the agricultural scope of this particular clause <e> <s> i repeat that if we start going beyond that we will be trying to turn the minister of agriculture into a minister for the countryside <e> <s> he then would be responsible for a much wider range of development even industrial development and would have a much wider range of powers than he could possibly have <e> <s> once we start to try to do that we shall find that we fall foul of the community regulations under which we are introducing esas <e>", "<cs> i do not agree <e> <s> i am looking at line <e> <s> let me read from paragraph <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> my noble friend lord craigton has exactly the same amendment down to subsection <e> <s> it is clear that that amendment amendment no <e> <s> and this amendment stand together <e> <s> i resist both of them <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that environmentally sensitive areas may not be an ideal name although i think that the idea of using the word sensitive meant very much what my noble friend lord renton suggested <e> <s> vulnerable <e> <s> indeed we have made it quite clear that we believe that the areas we ought to designate are areas that would otherwise be in jeopardy <e> <s> certainly we have made it clear that they are areas which from a national point of view are important environmentally <e>", "<cs> of course i shall think about that <e> <s> i feel rather sad because we have gone down the second half of this page of the marshalled list and it was my intention when i began going through my noble friends amendments a few days ago to see whether there was something which could properly be accepted because my noble friend always has plenty of ideas <e> <s> he occupies an extremely distinguished position in the conservation world as chairman of the all-party environmental committee <e> <s> i was rather sad when i found that i kept having to say no <e> <s> i must not mislead my noble friend i think that three words are better than four when you are designating something and although the noble lord lord melchett said it had not become all that familiar i must say that the expression environmentally sensitive area is now pretty well known throughout the world which is dealing with this <e> <s> i shall certainly look at my noble friends suggestion of environmentally sensitive farming area but i must say i have a hankering after environmentally sensitive area indeed i confess that i rather like it <e>", "<cs> as drafted this clause envisages that individual environmentally sensitive areas will be designated by statutory instrument <e> <s> the statutory instruments will be signed by the minister of agriculture and by a treasury minister <e> <s> by signing the instrument the treasury minister will simply be confirming that the treasury has agreed to provide the money to fund the esa <e> <s> in short his signature will simply reassure all concerned that any agreement they enter into will duly attract the promised payment <e>", "<cs> this will make <e>", "<cs> if you removed this provision from the bill you would be removing from the face of the bill the recognition that the treasurys agreement is necessary before spending any money in environmentally sensitive areas <e> <s> the assurance i have given however on this amendment is that this is not some kind of veto of the treasury to say that a particular environmentally sensitive area is a good thing and another one is not <e> <s> that is all done as it is put in the clause by consultation between my right honourable friend the secretary of state and the statutory conservation agencies the nature conservancy council and the countryside commission and there are other discussions going on as well <e> <s> that is the answer to what the noble baroness asked me <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws the amendment may i make two simple points <e> <s> first as my noble friend lord renton said there are literally hundreds of examples <e> <s> those examples are peppered into legislation for good reason that is because this is a normal formulation <e> <s> the other point is that there is a reason for seeing that you need more than the minister of agricultures signature on the order <e> <s> in just the same way as we have put into this clause that there shall be consultation with the countryside commission the nature conservancy council and my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment because a great many people felt that that was right so in this case it is i suggest right that if the treasury are to provide the money anyway and it is well precedented then the treasury need to sign the order at the same time as the minister who also has the departmental responsibility <e>", "<cs> it may be that the treasury would not consent if the budget was being overspent and it is common knowledge what the budget is at the moment it is million <e> <s> if the departmental minister my right honourable friend or one of his successors decided that he would deliberately flout the budget at that moment it would be perfectly proper for the treasury to withhold consent <e> <s> therefore it would not be automatic <e>", "<cs> i assure both my noble friends that we have looked with great care at the two amendments <e> <s> they are very important <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would impose an obligation to consult all landowners before an area was designated <e> <s> that reveals my noble friends desire to see that as a matter of common courtesy and sensible prudence the government will listen to people living in the area and find out what they think about the area being designated <e> <s> the serious point is whether a scheme in a particular area will succeed and my noble friend put his finger on that <e>", "<cs> this amendment raises a very interesting issue <e> <s> on various occasions we have been asked to agree that the management prescriptions proposed by the nature conservancy council and countryside commission should be implemented without amendment <e> <s> this amendment of my noble friends lord buxton and lord onslow is saying that an area designated as an esa shall be managed in accordance with guidelines prepared by the nature conservancy council or the countryside commission in england scotland and in wales <e>", "<cs> an environmentally sensitive area agreement will constitute a contract between the minister and the farmer <e> <s> contracts can of course normally be varied from time to time but it would have to be by mutual consent <e> <s> after all if it is to be a voluntary scheme it would have to be even-handed <e> <s> if the government were able to alter the contract then the farmer must be able to opt out too <e>", "<cs> may i give my noble friend a direct and very brief answer about this <e> <s> i think i have already revealed that we have not got that far in other words i admit to your lordships quite openly that we have not yet decided what we ought to make arrangements for so far as detailed monitoring and management of esas is concerned <e> <s> we have a lot of ideas so far as monitoring is concerned for instance aerial surveys and things of that kind and obviously we are gradually getting our thoughts together so far as management is concerned which is really the object of this particular amendment but we have not got it in detail as yet <e> <s> the broads scheme has been a happy example the co-operation between the countryside commission and the ministry of agriculture based as i have said on the norwich office and obviously we are going to take all the evidence into account in deciding exactly how we are going to manage <e>", "<cs> my noble friend asked me a direct question about what moment in the consultations on esa designation will the tenant applicant have to sign a declaration stating that he had notified his landlord and shown the agreement to him <e> <s> the answer to that is that it will be when we approach the tenants before they send back the agreement <e> <s> if they have not notified their landlord and have not shown the agreement to the landlord they will not have their application accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been monitoring of milk vegetables and meat since the chernobyl disaster <e> <s> the monitoring of milk and meat is continuing <e> <s> the results of the monitoring efforts have been published as frequently as has been possible in particular on th th and th may with a publication recently on th may <e> <s> with regard to the irish sea as a matter of habit the ministry of agriculture has monitored the areas around nuclear power stations <e> <s> the reason that the public hears nothing about that is that there has been nothing to report <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall continue to monitor and to publish the results <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely interested to hear that but it is a matter for the medical profession <e>", "<cs> i think this amendment raises an important issue and it is one to which we have given a great deal of thought <e> <s> it is of course to be expected that some farmers within an environmentally sensitive area will wish to carry out improvements to their holdings <e> <s> perhaps i may say first of all that the amendment does not seek to prevent capital grants in order to try to make improvements <e> <s> it tries to ensure that such improvements will be entirely within the spirit of the esa and will pose no environmental problems <e>", "<cs> i have to admit to my noble friend that those who advise me are very much quicker on the uptake than i am and i should like to try to reply to my noble friend in this way <e> <s> i would agree with my noble friend that in judging the suitability of a grant proposal we shall need to have a proper strategy for each area <e> <s> my noble friend referred and has referred again to national park plans <e> <s> as to environmentally sensitive areas the countryside commission and the nature conservancy council have already provided us with an analysis of each area <e> <s> this analysis surveys the environmental value of each area these are the areas which they recommended of course and the agricultural threat to each area <e> <s> each analysis from the ncc and the countryside commission runs to several pages and constitutes a proposed plan for the area <e> <s> we intend to draw on these in managing the environmentally sensitive area in each case and we shall be in <e>", "<cs> may i just say before the noble baroness speaks that i am grateful to the noble lord for those words because in my heart i feel very much as he does but perhaps i ought to reveal that at least a year ago i remember talking to environmental organisations and one of the obvious questions which came up was how are you going to designate <e> <s> this was long before we had got down to the short list of which had come from the nature conservancy council and the countryside commission <e> <s> the ncc and the countryside commission were still considering matters and had i know a list which was very much longer than that <e> <s> one of the things which i sought to say in reply when i was talking to the voluntary organisations was that i felt the jeopardy of an area was something which would count with us in deciding at the end of the day which areas ought to come up first for designation and which ought not <e> <s> having said that i do not think i can quarrel too much with the word threat <e> <s> nonetheless i am glad the noble lord raised the point but i am glad that i have had an opportunity to explain also what was in the governments mind so far as jeopardy is concerned <e>", "<cs> if i may try to take the two questions which the noble baroness has put to me it is a fact that so far as national parks are concerned as my noble friend lord sandford knows very well you do get cases where there is a retrospective claim for a grant and we have to look at them extremely carefully <e> <s> i should like to think about that one if i may before the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i must confess to the noble baroness that i could not hear the question <e> <s> will she put it again <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first take amendment no <e> <s> moved by the noble baroness lady nicol the effect of which will be to monitor the effects of designation as environmentally sensitive areas and to make an annual report to parliament <e> <s> i have no trouble at all in giving the noble baroness an assurance that this is going to happen because first of all the european commission will require us to do so <e> <s> i have no doubt from the debate we have had in the last minutes or quarter of an hour that parliament will question the government regularly on how the matter is going <e> <s> for our part we have not entered lightly into the issues which environmentally sensitive areas raise <e> <s> we are fully aware of the importance which parliament attaches to this clause and to the principle of ministers of agriculture tackling these issues <e> <s> the clause is <e>", "<cs> i will take that point away and think about it <e> <s> i have gone quite a long way down the track on amendment no <e> <s> by saying that i should like to put something on the face of the bill to provide that there will be monitoring so that one will be able to look at the bill and say yes there will he monitoring <e>", "<cs> as regards the second point i shall think about that and perhaps the noble lord would like to do so too <e> <s> i gave an assurance though i did not say that i felt this ought to be written into the bill <e> <s> the noble lord was good enough to say that he felt it was a valuable assurance <e> <s> perhaps i can think about the matter between now and report and possibly the noble lord and i can have a discussion <e>", "<cs> in this amendment the noble lord lord moran is saying that forestry development within an environmentally sensitive area must be subject to consultation with the appropriate minister and also with the countryside commission and the nature conservancy council whether it is in england scotland or wales but the amendment also gives a right of veto to any one of the bodies consulted including incidentally my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment as well as my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture if any of the bodies concerned consider that the proposal for forestry will adversely affect the objectives of the environmentally sensitive area <e> <s> so this is quite a draconian amendment with a veto in it <e>", "<cs> my answer to the first part of my noble friends question is yes my answer to the second part of his question is that i think that would be a great pity <e> <s> my noble friend has highlighted the fact that there is a real difficulty with this amendment quite apart from the merits and there are different views about the merits <e> <s> indeed my advice is that it would put us in breach of the treaty if we were to accept this particular amendment <e>", "<cs> with great respect that is not the case <e> <s> we are using our money and only our money in order to set up the provisions under this clause <e> <s> no community money at the moment will flow into the provision in order to set up esas <e> <s> but every time that we designate an esa and i hope that if parliament agrees to the bill that will be before not too many months have gone by we shall have to show the commission what we intend to designate so that it may be assured that we are not indulging in illegal state aid under the guise of an esa <e> <s> if we put forestry into the provisions of the clause it is at that moment that the commission would say to us look at the treaty and you will find that you are doing something which you ought not to do <e>", "<cs> let me repeat what i said because i think that it is important that i should <e> <s> i have apologised to the committee and the amendment as such would not break the treaty <e> <s> but we cannot pay money for forestry under the esa regulation <e> <s> that means that forestry cannot be fully in esas <e> <s> the amendment brings forestry within esas <e> <s> the effect would be that forestry developments within an esa would be subject to consultation and ultimately to possible veto <e>", "<cs> it is i believe important for me to make clear that the short list has been in existence ever since my right honourable friend the minister of state in the ministry of agriculture in another place on st january listed them at column of the proceedings in standing committee b <e> <s> of course the south downs was one of the areas on the list <e> <s> i simply drew one out of the list to make my point <e> <s> i mentioned the south downs for that reason and for that reason only <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may begin by referring to the two questions which have been put to me by the noble lord lord walston one of which i can answer and the other of which i am afraid i cannot <e> <s> the noble lords second question was about the situation of water authorities which take their water from deep in the ground thus generally affecting the water table in the locality which could be an environmentally sensitive area and therefore affecting the area concerned <e> <s> this is a matter to which i have not given the thought that i should have done <e> <s> moreover i do not know what the water legislation says so far as this particular danger is concerned <e> <s> i am sure that it is a matter which water authorities have very much in mind when they are making their plans <e> <s> however i shall have to look into it and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the answer is no i do not think so <e> <s> the particular case the noble lord cited is a case in which the minister of agriculture does not have any statutory powers to intervene <e> <s> the allegations that the noble lord has made and which i have read in the press are being investigated but the legal advice i have had so far is that we do not have any powers of direct intervention <e> <s> the noble lord says in that case why not accept his amendment <e> <s> my answer is that i genuinely believe that in this country you get the best out of people particularly in the countryside if you can try to get them to do things in a voluntary way <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord says in speaking to clause stand part tax matters are for treasury ministers <e> <s> but the noble lord who was good enough to give me notice that he wished to raise this matter is really concerned about uncontrolled planting and would like to get at it by the withholding of forestry tax benefits from owners who plant without having obtained clearance from the forestry commission <e>", "<cs> lord melchetts rhetoric conceals the fact that we cannot discuss the merits of this particular amendment because it has no merit <e> <s> it is an amendment which seeks to bring agricultural land in its use within the scope of planning control <e> <s> i should have thought that that was something which would dismay not just the farming community but anyone who has lived in and loved the countryside over the years <e> <s> i leave aside the really extraordinary complexities and anomalies which that would raise <e> <s> i simply content myself this evening with saying that i would have thought on all sides of the committee we have reached a position now in public life where we all agree that in our small island there are cases where it is right to protect the land from some farming operations because they may damage its special character or scientific value <e>", "<cs> if i may say so i think i replied to the noble baroness lady white about a couple of hours ago <e> <s> i have given a pretty full reply to the noble lord lord melchett and we have disposed of clause <e>", "<cs> if anybody needs to be politically well advised on this amendment the labour party needs to remember that it is being told from its back-benches that blanket planning controls should be imposed for the first time ever upon the whole of the agricultural community <e> <s> let that go out from this committee stage <e> <s> this is a most ill-advised amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not dodging the question at all <e> <s> the noble baroness is seeking to go back to a clause of which we have disposed <e>", "<cs> that may well be but we did not accept the countryside commissions recommendation for extending planning control to the uplands as the noble lord knows very well <e> <s> it was a good report <e>", "<cs> no quite frankly i do not think there is a problem <e> <s> i was interested in the first example that was given by the noble lord <e> <s> i am speaking from memory and without advice and if i am wrong i shall write to the noble lord and put the matter right but if my memory serves me correctly about a year ago or perhaps a little more we made sure that with government money no longer could there be the breaking up of the ground following the cutting down of trees and the noble lord gave the example of coppicing so that the land could be returned to agriculture <e>", "<cs> i am inclined to agree with my noble friend <e> <s> the power that the noble lord is seeking to take in the amendment could lead to time-consuming and unproductive litigation <e> <s> individual walkers may disagree with the restoration work even where the local authority is content that the law has been met <e> <s> it is worth recalling that under the law as it stands local authorities can restore the surface of a path or way and subsequently recover the cost from the responsible farmer <e>", "<cs> in the context of that act of defiance from the noble lord i have this to say <e> <s> i am grateful to him for drawing the point to our attention <e> <s> her majestys government are very pleased to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady white was indeed correct that on th june the government announced that we would issue a consultation paper later this year to seek public views on a possible order-making scheme for landscape conservation orders <e> <s> it would clearly be wrong to pre-empt the results of that consultation exercise by introducing in this bill a provision such as the one proposed in the amendment of my noble friend lord onslow <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their reception of this statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord john-mackie said that it was necessary for the public to be assured that they are going to get information properly <e> <s> ever since the chernobyl disaster using the incident room which was set up by the department of the environment we have sought to publish on a regular basis the findings of monitorings which have been done by the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food <e> <s> the one thing that i would say in answer to the very wise remark of the noble lord is that all food in the shops at the moment is safe <e> <s> the restriction described in this statement is in order to ensure that that should continue <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so although this is a serious point that the noble lord lord stoddart makes it is getting wide of the statement <e> <s> of course i speak on behalf of the government in this house and on this particular statement <e> <s> on behalf of the government i say that i believe that our nuclear record in this country is safe <e> <s> the government will take every step possible to see that that continues to be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely understand why the noble lord asks this question <e> <s> the welsh people have every right to be proud of the lamb meat which <e>", "<cs> may i just say in answer to that that we are continuing to monitor but in fact the monitoring we are doing has been stepped up <e> <s> the monitoring data at the moment is being built up from a wide range of results including over sheepmeat samples in england and wales <e> <s> it is that level of monitoring which we are now stepping up <e> <s> that should make it the more likely that we could react with speed if it were necessary to do so <e> <s> but as i think we <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord john-mackie and lord mcnair for their reception of this order <e> <s> the noble lord lord john-mackie said and it is true that this is in the context of reductions in government funding <e> <s> it is a fact that million has been cut from the provision for

flowing into research and development for horticulture <e> <s> in addition to that it is hoped that this levy will raise an amount in excess of million <e> <s> i think that the noble lord was perhaps million too high in his estimate <e> <s> those who are planning the council hope for a figure in excess of million <e> <s> undoubtedly there will be some overheads to meet although i am glad to be able to tell your lordships that the ministry will certainly try to give some assistance with the setting up of the council <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> as i understood it the noble lord asked me a question about hardy nursery stock <e> <s> i hesitate to suggest that i am the possessor of knowledge of which the noble lord is not considering that the noble lord has personal experience of this but i believe that the particular examples he gave me fall within the hardy nursery stock category <e> <s> the nursery stock people were very closely consulted before this order was brought before your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an ingenious question and rather a fast ball <e> <s> as we shall have the pleasure of dealing with the report stage of the agriculture bill next week perhaps i may consider my reply and deliver it when we next meet on that bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it difficult to accept that the number of people at the head of the office of gas supply i am sorry i have pre-empted the noble lord lord stoddart <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall continue then <e> <s> i cannot accept that the sheer number of people at the head of the office of gas supply is vital to regulation under the bill <e> <s> i should have thought that what really matters is the statutory powers and rights provided in the bill <e> <s> i have been interested in listening to this short debate to observe that none of the noble lords the noble lord lord diamond the noble lord lord shepherd or the noble lord lord ezra has said anything about the powers and duties of regulation in the bill <e> <s> none of those three noble lords has even glanced at clause which sets out the general powers and duties on my right honourable friend and on the director from which flow the many other duties and powers in the bill <e>", "<cs> no my lords i shall not give way for the moment <e> <s> i agreed with the noble lord lord shepherd when he talked about undue interference <e> <s> all of us know that over the years governments have felt it necessary to give their views as to how a nationalised industry should conduct itself <e> <s> i put it to your lordships that one of the advantages of privatisation is that departments will no longer be able to exercise the kind of undue influence on the affairs of the gas industry to which the noble lord lord shepherd referred <e>", "<cs> my lords if one is running a plc one needs to bring together on the board different expertises to achieve success <e> <s> one needs to bring together the technical engineering marketing and finance expertise on a board <e> <s> if one has a regulatory authority one needs a firm hand in which the industry and people generally will have confidence <e> <s> one does not need to bring together the different expertise on the board <e> <s> that is not to say that the director is not going to need to have and want to have skilful and well-qualified people in his office <e> <s> but it is a matter for the director to decide how he deploys it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i refer the noble baroness to the schedules <e> <s> the noble baroness will see that obviously there will be quite a free hand <e> <s> on the other hand the treasury is written into the schedules <e> <s> but i do not think i would depart from what i have said <e> <s> if the house will give me leave to say this once again i think that it will be for the director to decide how his office ought to be organised <e>", "<cs> my lords the government agree with the noble lords lord stoddart and lord grimond in wanting to see effective regulation but i think we part company as to how best to achieve that aim <e> <s> the noble lord in moving the amendment saw beauty in it <e> <s> they say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and all i can say is that i do not see how it can be right to spell out in this bill the structure of the office of gas supply <e> <s> it is not something that parliament thought it was right to do with the office of fair trading it is not something that parliament thought it was right to do with the office of telecommunications and i do not think it is right to do it with the new ofgas <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i understand why the amendment has been moved <e> <s> the noble lord lord diamond has made very clear the case for it and the noble lord lord stoddart has supported him <e> <s> i will put two points to noble lords <e> <s> the first is that if the noble lord lord diamond is concerned as i believe he is about parliament having some oversight of such matters then the bill provides that the secretary of state will have responsibility for the director as well as having the power to remove him <e> <s> he receives an annual report from the director on the directors activities <e> <s> that report must be laid before parliament <e> <s> that ensures that the director is accountable through my right honourable friend to both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that in the second of these two amendments the noble lord lord diamond is endeavouring to make more specific an amendment which he moved in committee <e> <s> however for reasons which have been deployed by my noble friend lord marshall of leeds i prefer to stick to the wording in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer that question <e> <s> all i can say to the noble lord is that i have no doubt that the draft contract will mirror the provisions in clause of this bill provided that parliament agrees with clause <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord diamond is quite correct in recalling the proceedings which took place in committee <e> <s> the act extends only to employees and not to office holders <e> <s> i have to make the point that this was not an act which was passed by a conservative government it was passed by a labour government <e> <s> if the government of the day thought that it was right that the legislation should extend only to employees and not to office holders i think that we are in a position where if there is to be an amendment it needs to be made to the act and not in this way to this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may interrupt the noble lord one minute <e> <s> may i ask what <e>", "<cs> not content <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments are seeking once again to maintain the existing structure of gas consumer representation although they have gone a step further in providing for the regional chairmen other than for scotland and wales to serve on the national body on a rotational basis and in defining the role of and a reporting structure for the proposed regional councils <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee on th may my noble friend lady macleod supported by the noble viscount lord hanworth moved amendment no <e> <s> calling for tighter wording on regional representation on the gas consumers council <e> <s> in debate on an earlier amendment from the noble lord lord stoddart the committee had established there was all-party support for such a change <e> <s> the noble lord opposite asked the government to consider also changing the indirect words <e>", "<cs> my lords may i finish before giving way <e> <s> otherwise i am in some difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords just before i come to that particular question may i say incidentally that on the question of flexibility there was a specific question which the noble lord lord williams asked me about small businesses <e> <s> it was the same sort of question again what would be the amount of representation <e>", "<cs> my lords these are important amendments <e> <s> i recognise the concern that the noble lord lord diamond has expressed about the adequacy of consumer representation arrangements at local level <e> <s> i come straight to the point and say that we are bringing forward an amendment about this when we come to debate amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this has been tabled in response to the committee stage amendment of my noble friend lady gardner of parkes supported at committee stage by the noble lord lord diamond <e>", "<cs> my lords i do indeed think that the power is adequately placed in the schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think i made clear at a previous stage of the bill it is the governments policy to standardise the terms and conditions of employment of non-departmental public bodies such as the new gas consumers council will be on terms analogous to those of the civil service <e> <s> this policy has begun to be put into effect in the london regional transport act and the creation of the london regional transport committee <e>", "<cs> my lords may i with the leave of the house say with respect to the noble lord lord williams that although we sit on opposite sides of the house i often follow his advice and always listen to him but i think just for once he is not on to a good point so far as a is concerned <e> <s> the difficulty of the criticism that the noble lord aimed at the government is that the noble lord uncharacteristically rather unfairly left a lot of words out <e> <s> it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am wholly out of order but if i may be given the permission of the house to be wholly out of order for just seconds and reply to the noble lord lord diamond on starred amendment no <e> <s> really the detailed arrangements must be for the gas consumers council <e> <s> but of course the clear statutory intention in government amendment no <e> <s> is that local representatives shall help locally with problems that arise in their areas <e> <s> i would like to think that the value of this is that it is on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords may i reply to my noble friend lord craigton <e> <s> by way of background i just wanted to set the scene to make it clear to the house that any suggestion that clause is in some way a licence for adas to be withdrawn and to disappear from the scene is not the case <e> <s> in order to prove that it is not the case the government have put down amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it remains the case with amendment no <e> <s> if your lordships agree to that amendment that clause will be a power and not a duty <e> <s> this is what this amendment is all about <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know that i have the permission of the house to speak a third time and it would be unfair if i made debating points and the noble lord lord melchett could not speak again <e> <s> therefore may i in one sentence simply say to the noble baroness lady white that of course advice is a service under the bill <e> <s> i think that really answers the point she was putting to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to those noble lords who have taken part in this brief discussion and not least to my noble friend lady elliot of harwood speaking from the benches on this side and the noble lord lord somers speaking from the cross-benches for saying in their slightly different ways that they are concerned about this amendment <e> <s> i must say that i too am concerned because i think it will put the agriculture advisory services into a very difficult position if they are put into the bill in this particular way <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord de la warr is kindly endeavouring to assist me <e> <s> if your lordships want a cast-iron undertaking that an advisory service of the ministry is to continue covering england and wales this clause does not extend to scotland please support amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i shall come to amendment no <e> <s> in a moment <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> provides an absolutely cast-iron undertaking that whatever goods and services in other words advice and so on may be provided the minister shall establish an organisation <e> <s> that is an absolutely cast-iron undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend lord stanley of alderley that this is an interesting amendment <e> <s> it casts a new angle upon the bill <e> <s> the effect of the amendment is to oblige the government to set up a food consumers committee to replace the consumers committees established under the agricultural marketing act and to advise on food policy matters generally <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord sandford for explaining the problem to your lordships <e> <s> i am also exceedingly grateful to my noble friend for suggesting that this amendment should be used as a vehicle for getting agreement for further meetings and not for a division <e>", "<cs> my lords simplicity has very great attractions <e> <s> this amendment of the noble lord lord mackie of benshie the noble lord is not such a simple soul as some might think but a highly skilful farmer and a highly knowledgeable man in the industry this schedule with the greatest respect gets simplicity but desperately at the expense of accuracy <e> <s> the truth of the matter is that the great attraction of this amendment in leaving out the governments schedule with all its length and complexity is that that is achieved by leaving out so much that there is considerable uncertainty about the operation of amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i am indebted to my noble friend lord de la warr provided he does not successfully press the amendment <e> <s> he has raised an interesting debate in which i have learnt things and to which i shall draw my right honourable friends attention <e> <s> like the noble lord lord john-mackie feel that perhaps he was referring to the quota system as he wished that it should have been <e> <s> although he made many valid points as my noble friend lord massereene said it is now a little late for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that my noble friend lord stanley is seeking in this amendment to cover the situation when somebody other than the tenant himself bore the cost of acquiring quota through a land transfer <e> <s> my noble friend feels that if a third party bore the cost on behalf of the tenant the tenant should receive compensation as if he had borne the cost himself <e> <s> i agree that this amendment in a sense is technical <e> <s> i am not sure however that it is equitable <e> <s> we are talking here about money which the landlord will have to pay out <e> <s> it is fair to ask whether the landlord should make a payment where the tenant has himself incurred a cost as a result of which the landlord will benefit through the presence of quota on the holding <e> <s> my answer to that is yes <e> <s> but if the tenant did not himself bear the cost <e> <s> why should we require the landlord then to compensate him <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend feels that he would like either to write or to have a word with me i should be very ready to consult him on this <e> <s> as i say at the moment i think that there is a difficulty of principle which i have enunciated <e> <s> but if my noble friend cares to contact me in whatever way he thinks best perhaps we can look at the point again <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment has been moved by the noble lord lord northbourne <e> <s> it would be my intention when we get to amendments nos <e> <s> and to move the governments amendments <e> <s> it is not being done as a matter of habit <e> <s> i should be delighted to accept this amendment or the amendment of my noble friend lord stanley which is no <e> <s> on the marshalled list but on the amendment of the noble lord lord northbourne and my noble friend lord kinnoull which is being moved now although it covers section lettings i do not think with respect that it covers section lettings that is the lettings from two years to five years <e> <s> i think that we would wish those lettings to be covered <e> <s> i like to think that the governments amendments covers those <e>", "<cs> my lords i can understand the logic of this proposal <e> <s> i can see that buildings and equipment especially accommodation whether in the form of skyscrapers or not can affect the productive capacity of a holding and there is of course a serious point here <e> <s> i would again say to my noble friend lord stanley that i listened to eloquently-moved amendments at the last stage of the bill about looking only at the productive capacity of the land with no concentrates added <e> <s> indeed i believe we have on the marshalled list another amendment which we shall deal with later <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that i agree with every word that my noble friend lord middleton has just said <e> <s> it would not be acceptable to the government persuasive though my noble friend lord stanley of alderley is to accept altered standard quotas of some two-thirds downwards when the standard quota which has been put forward by the government is based on an assessment of national yields which have been calculated downwards because of the imposition of quotas by some per cent <e> <s> with of course the interests of tenants in mind and when i made no secret on the last day of the committee stage that we had also made our calculations by constantly rounding down in the interests of tenants <e> <s> in those circumstances i could not voluntarily agree to accepting my noble friends amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an amendment which i have called in shorthand for the past few weeks the no concentrates amendment <e> <s> it is amendment no <e> <s> i believe <e> <s> we seem to have travelled across a couple of borders and i have slightly lost track of where we are <e> <s> this is the no concentrates amendment which in essence provides that if the matter goes to arbitration or indeed if the landlord and tenant are deciding between themselves the land must not be looked at in a way in which it would be reasonable to suppose it should produce a yield of milk but should be looked at in terms of what the land alone could have produced if no concentrates had been put on it at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that there is something in the spirit of this amendment <e> <s> i appreciate that there may be instances where a landlord may have agreed to accept a rent lower than he could have claimed under the agricultural holdings act <e> <s> i also know that as rent reviews normally take place at three year intervals the rents which were being charged in were in many cases lower than they would have been if they had been fixed during the year <e> <s> but while i can understand the reason for the amendment i have to say that i think there is some difficulty in ascertaining what rent would have actually been paid in <e> <s> in essence we will be talking about a sort of retrospective rent review <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i have the right point here <e> <s> my understanding before my noble friend moved the amendment was that his worry was to ensure that if the landlord and tenant have agreed that a particular tenants improvement should be written down to by a certain date for the purposes of calculating compensation under the agricultural holdings act that agreement should not spill over into the calculation of the tenants fraction for quota compensation <e> <s> it would clearly be wrong if there was any such spillover effect <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend lord peel withdraws amendment no <e> <s> as he referred to amendment no <e> <s> a may i speak to that amendment so that it does not have to be spoken to again <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> a is supposed to be the government response to the very cogent case which my noble friend lord peel together with my noble friend lord sandford put forward at committee stage <e> <s> my noble friend lord peel presented the case for an amendment similar to no <e> <s> a in committee and has really played a great part in bringing this issue before the house <e> <s> i would just say to your lordships that this issue has been pursued all the way through another place and it is my two noble friends who have brought it to finality today <e> <s> in committee i said we would do what we could and amendment no a is the response <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a great deal of truth in what my noble friend lord burton has said <e> <s> i was interested to hear my noble friends lord stanley and lord peel explain the problems for farmers my noble friend lord stanley referring to land near the sea in wales and my noble friend lord peel dealing with the uplands and the national parks of which he has knowledge if an amendment of this kind were to be made <e> <s> we are incidentally talking about the production of beef in some cases through suckler herds <e> <s> the production of high quality beef is what we rather hope farmers will concentrate upon instead of growing too many acres of cereals <e>", "<cs> my lords that point is easily answered <e> <s> the ramblers association has prepared a dossier of incidents where bulls may have presented a hazard to members of the public <e> <s> the reports include just one incident in which a member of the public has been injured by a bull being kept in accordance with the act <e> <s> even one incident is one too many <e> <s> but we have to keep a sense of proportion <e> <s> in saying that i think the balance of advantage lies very definitely against this amendment <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord onslow put down this amendment because we covered the point at a very late hour in committee and he wanted to probe a little more regarding the governments announce-ment of a consultation paper on landscape conservation orders <e> <s> the noble baroness lady nicol asked what would be the timing <e> <s> the consultation paper is now in hand within the department of the environment <e> <s> the process of preparing a final text for issue is bound to involve consultation between my right honourable friend the secretary of state and his colleagues in other departments who have an interest in the scheme <e> <s> at the moment i cannot give an exact answer about the timing but i know that this paper will be issued as quickly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish i could respond to my noble friend lord renton and indeed to the noble baroness lady nicol but i really cannot and i shall tell your lordships why i cannot <e> <s> there is not a single precedent that i can find there may be one but i cannot find it whereby treasury consent is fettered in the way that the noble baroness would wish it to be in this bill <e> <s> for example in the agriculture act which was legendary legislation passed during the tenure of the famous labour minister of agriculture tom williams there is no such limitation nor is there in the agriculture act nor in the agriculture miscellaneous provisions act on drainage and other grants nor in the countryside act of which is often in our minds all these acts were passed by labour governments nor even in the agriculture act of governing capital grants which was again an act passed by a labour government <e> <s> there is no precedent for this provision and i cannot accept it in this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am saying that there is no precedent but i am also saying that i think that because there is no precedent there is no case <e> <s> if i may say so the case for the treasurys surveillance is well put in the wording that we have <e> <s> this evening i have interpreted what the wording means and by tabling the amendment that i have brought forward i have tried to make that wording as clear as possible <e> <s> i cannot go further than that <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord craigton mentioned this subject at an earlier stage of the bill <e> <s> he put down the amendment which i had time to see <e> <s> it is not a name that we should have chosen but it is a name adopted by the community <e> <s> it is rather technical and long-winded i know but by now everyone with an interest in the matter has heard of environmentally sensitive areas <e> <s> we have all become accustomed to using the tags and we all know what they mean <e> <s> that is not a good reason for saying that the name should not be changed but it means that a new name must be better <e> <s> i should readily accept a new name that was so compelling and accurate that it displaced esa from our memory <e> <s> i am not keen to change the name without an attractive alternative <e>", "<cs> my lords without going over the ground again perhaps my noble friend lord onslow would like to read what i said <e> <s> i did not say that it specifically included it <e> <s> i set out the situation with regard to forestry in a few words <e>", "<cs> my lords during the course of this bill the government have given a number of assurances about the position of landlords <e> <s> in essence there is not very much between my noble friend lord <e>", "<cs> my lords if the house will give me leave the first and important difficulty is this <e> <s> in an environmentally sensitive area which could be a huge area if the amendment is accepted one has to find every single landlord and to contact him <e> <s> that is a very formidable administrative task <e> <s> it means that hard-pressed staff in short supply will be used in pushing pens instead of doing what we want them to do in environmentally sensitive areas that is to get on and see that the areas are monitored and managed properly <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the reasons which have prompted the noble lord lord melchett to propose this amendment <e> <s> however having listened to the noble lord i still think that the amendment is not necessary <e> <s> guidelines to water authorities and to internal drainage boards on fulfilling their obligations with regard to conservation while carrying out land drainage operations have been in existence since <e> <s> however those guidelines are currently being revised following a review of their initial operation and to take account of the recommendation of the house of commons environment committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for saying that <e> <s> i have the current guidelines in front of me <e> <s> it seems to me that they go a great deal wider than just consultation <e> <s> however i am very ready to write to the noble lord and i shall endeavour to do so before the third reading of this bill <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would seek to ensure that gas supplies are managed and used in accordance with national interest and without detriment to other fuels and energy sources <e> <s> one of our aims in putting forward the privatisation of british <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment that the noble lord is moving amendment no <e> <s> is about promoting competition between fuels <e> <s> all i can say is that we believe there is already strong and effective

amendment no <e> <s> b in the name of the noble lord lord stoddart who made the final speech in this debate because that is also an amendment to amendment no <e> <s> the effect being to ensure that in respect of these two groups of people arrangements exist for the checking of all their domestic gas appliances free of charge <e> <s> once again my advice is that this is really not in the right place but i recognise the strength of feeling which the noble lord put not only into the drafting but into speaking to this amendment and i should like to say a further word about it when we come to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely sorry <e> <s> if the house will bear with me for just a few more sentences there is of course amendment no <e> <s> on the marshalled list <e> <s> i apologise to the noble lord lord diamond and to the noble lord lord ezra <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may say that we shall certainly take into account what the noble lord lord molloy has said on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords clauses to set out the arrangement for modification of public gas suppliers authorisations whether by agreement or following a reference to the monopolies and mergers commission under the provisions of the bill or under competition law <e> <s> i am advised that an authorisation as modified under those clauses remains an authorisation granted under clause <e> <s> a public gas supplier whose authorisation has been so modified remains a public gas supplier within the meaning given by clause <e> <s> therefore the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord diamond is unnecessary for the reasons i have just given <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of these amendments generally is to provide for consultation with parliament in granting an authorisation to a public gas supplier <e> <s> as your lordships are already well aware there is in the bill a full system of consultation prior to the issue of an authorisation to a public gas supplier <e> <s> we have already provided ample opportunity for parliament to scrutinise and comment on british gass draft authorisation by publishing it before the second reading of the bill in another place and i really do not accept the need for further parliamentary involvement <e> <s> it is basically for that reason that i cannot accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> the noble lord has down amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i simply say that i do not believe that even a reduced form of parliamentary approval which is contained in the noble lords amendment would be appropriate having regard to the fact that once again parliament will have passed the bill with the draft of the authorisation before it <e> <s> perhaps i may remind your lordships that the first draft of the authorisation was put before the house of commons <e> <s> we made sure that the revised draft of the authorisation taking into account drafting points and points put forward in the house of commons was put before your lordships house at second reading <e> <s> i have now made sure that a further draft of the authorisation taking into account points put by your lordships in committee has been placed before your lordships for the report stage <e> <s> all along so far as the authorisation is concerned we have kept your lordships fully informed <e> <s> i repeat that if either the director or the public gas supplier later wants to make a change to the authorisation he has to do so via clauses to <e> <s> if the house wants to change clauses to the house has every right to do so <e> <s> they will receive full parliamentary scrutiny <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i am right in saying that it is up to the time of the setting up of the public gas supplier <e> <s> up to that time we will ensure that parliament is kept fully informed as it has been so far about the authorisation <e>", "<cs> my lords for the last time and only by leave of the house the answer to the noble lord lord diamond on that important point is that the changes that have been made to the authorisation hitherto have been confined to drafting changes and to changes made in response to points raised in both houses of parliament <e> <s> that will remain the situation <e> <s> there is therefore no danger that something will be put into the authorisation of which parliament would not approve <e>", "<cs> my lords we have already discussed in committee the principle of including a public hearing in the authorisation procedure <e> <s> we had a vote and the committee voted against the proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords both the noble lord lord diamond and the noble lord lord stoddart have expressed their concern about proper control over standing charges <e> <s> we share that concern <e> <s> it is for this reason that the draft authorisation which has been made public includes provisions controlling standing charges <e> <s> these fall within the general control of prices under the price formula set out in condition <e> <s> under this formula british gas will have a clear and strong incentive to reduce the costs within its control and customers will benefit from improved efficiency through the efficiency factor x which is now set at <e> <s> there will be adequate incentive for british gas to keep the standing charges as low as possible <e> <s> i suggest to your lordships that it is clear rules of this nature rather than intervention by secretaries of state after wide-ranging consultations which provide the necessary incentive <e> <s> however there is the important question as to how the total should be recovered between the standing charge and the rate per therm <e> <s> here i come much closer to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is in order to prevent unreasonable increases in the standing charge that the government believe that there should be a further control to ensure that they rise no faster than the rate of inflation <e> <s> that is why we have condition of the draft authorisation setting out the obligation <e> <s> indeed we have removed the words best endeavours from condition so that the obligation is absolutely direct that the standing charge shall not rise faster than the rate of inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not refer to it because it is not part and parcel of the deal that the government are offering which i think is an excellent deal <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this arose at a previous stage of the bill but whether or not it did the noble lord has asked me a direct question <e> <s> my answer is that if there is a material change in the basis of the index such other index as the director may after consultation with the supplier determine to be appropriate in the circumstances would be the index which would be used <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord is very well aware the problem with this amendment is that it is essential where investment of the kind necessary to sustain activities of a public gas supplier is concerned to provide some certainty as to the duration of the authorisation <e> <s> in this case we provide what we regard to be a realistic period which totals years <e> <s> however if the secretary of state was minded to terminate the authorisation he must give years notice and of course as the noble lord is again aware there are the provisions in clauses to whereby there is a mechanism for changing the authorisation either by agreement or not by agreement <e> <s> we think that this adds up to a fair package but of course different arrangements might be appropriate in the case of other suppliers <e>", "<cs> my lords this is covered in condition of the authorisation and i therefore resist the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if we were to accept this amendment it would mean giving the director a role in vetting gas purchase contracts which i must say we believe would be clearly against the best interests of gas consumers and indeed gas producers alike <e> <s> i can assure the house that while we share the keenness of noble lords opposite to avoid any unfairness which could arise in the purchase of gas we are satisfied that existing competition law would be adequate to tackle it <e> <s> it is for that reason that i oppose this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not the case <e> <s> the noble lord got up a little while ago and charged me and i am in charge of the bill on this side of the house together with my noble friends on the front bench with not providing the necessary and correct papers <e> <s> the papers to which the noble lord referred were safely in the printed paper office <e> <s> the noble lord had no right to do that and owes an apology to the house for acting in that particular way <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord campbell of alloway accurately recorded the objections which i raised to this amendment when my noble friend moved the same amendment at the committe stage <e> <s> because i am still uncertain on the particular issues i raised at that time i said on an earlier amendment today that i should like to look again at this particular amendment <e> <s> that i shall do and indeed i have given an assurance that i shall come back with a response to this amendment and will get in touch with my noble friend and the other noble lords who have added their names to this amendment before the next stage of the bill <e> <s> with that assurance i hope that my noble friend lord campbell will feel that it is right to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said i raised objections at a previous stage of the bill <e> <s> i still have reservations about this amendment but i give the undertaking the noble lord asks for that in looking <e>", "<cs> my lords as clause makes clear the public gas supplier will be required to publish not only tariffs but also the principles on which charges are to be made <e> <s> this should provide the necessary assurances that within the overall framework of price control tariffs are being set in a way which is both fair and non-discriminatory as required by clause <e> <s> although he has no direct role clause is of course one of the clauses to which the directors enforcement powers under clause of the bill apply <e> <s> if the public gas supplier failed in any of his duties under clause or the director would be able to make an enforcement order which if not complied with would open the way for damages by anyone whose interests were adversely affected <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i do not think that the noble lord lord diamond need worry that in some way the public gas supplier in trying to satisfy his shareholders will inflate prices for the consumer because your lordships will remember that the bill has already provided for the director to have a considerable control over gas prices to tariff customers through the price formula in the authorisation <e> <s> if the formula is exceeded the noble lord will remember that the director has the right to step in and in the ultimate case actually fix prices if there has been overpricing by the supplier <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the reasons which have prompted the noble lord to move this amendment they are valid and understandable <e> <s> i ask the noble lord to recognise that in this part of the bill we are not changing the law <e> <s> i understand that when the bill was being prepared considerable thought was given as to the way in which an avoidance of undue preference duty should be imposed upon public gas suppliers <e> <s> the act requires the corporation to avoid undue discrimination in fixing tariffs for supplies <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that the noble lord is moving this amendment in a desire to frame nobody but the parliamentary draftsman is quite clear that the word framed is the one that we ought to use <e> <s> i understand that it is defined as meaning to form or construct by fitting parts together <e> <s> as your lordships may be aware the tariff may be composed of a variety of elements such as the charge for gas supplied and the standing charge and it is those various elements which have to be fitted together in such a way as to show the methods by and the principles on which charges are to be made <e> <s> it is for those reasons that i feel we ought to stick to framed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord diamond is seeking in this amendment to involve the director and the secretary of state in the setting of tariffs <e> <s> we went through this at committee stage and i sought then to explain that the government believe that the primary responsibility for the setting of tariffs should be with the supplier but within the overall framework of control set by the bill and the authorisation <e> <s> it will be for the director to ensure that the supplier adheres to the requirements of the bill and the authorisation <e> <s> he will also of course need to have regard to the duties set out in clause which include promoting economy and efficiency <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords premise is absolutely right it is the retail price index minus <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret to have to say that i must oppose this amendment for two reasons <e> <s> the first is that it is really a re-run of amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> the effect of that your lordships may remember would have been to require the public gas supplier to agree his proposed tariffs with the director <e> <s> this amendment says that the director must be satisfied that a new tariff would be fair and reasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that in this amendment the noble lord seeks to be as fair as possible to the customer <e> <s> i shall go straight to the part of the amendment that deals with meter reading and the emptying of meters <e> <s> this is of course a very expensive operation <e> <s> the man-hours involved lead to a significant cost which is of course passed on in turn to the consumer <e> <s> given this i do not believe i can agree that it would be right to lay a statutory require-ment on british gas to read meters within specified time limits since this would reduce the flexibility we desire and would require british gas to carry out an expensive exercise which we do not consider to be as a tried requirement of advantage to consumers generally <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say a word a little more generally <e> <s> paragraph of schedule to which this amendment is addressed needs to be read together with clause of the bill <e> <s> under that clause a gas meter may not be used unless it has been stamped by or on the authority of a meter examiner appointed by the secretary of state <e> <s> before stamping or authorising <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear from the intervention of my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls to whom i am grateful because i very much agree with much of what he said that we differ on the basic principle of the bill namely the privatising of british gas <e> <s> that said though i should have thought there was one thing on which all parts of the house could agree <e> <s> that is that this bill gives an opportunity to produce an idea in this case it is the formula for giving an undertaking to the ordinary customer the tariff consumer that he or she is going to be protected so far as the monthly bills for gas are concerned <e>", "<cs> i am inviting the noble lord to look at page of the licence <e> <s> this is one of the occasions when there is an advantage in the licence not being in the bill <e> <s> the noble lord is troubled because he is reading from clause <e> <s> we are not looking at clause at the moment <e> <s> we are looking at the licence and i am saying to the house that under the terms of the licence it is necessary to go through the various steps that i set out to your lordships and it could never be against the interests of the customer that we would find a change being made in the price formula <e> <s> that is the first thing that the amendment is about <e> <s> incidentally and i realise that both noble lords are trained accountants and they feel that the factor is not correct there is a per cent <e> <s> factor because there is a divisor of in the authorisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we should stick to the groupings if your lordships are prepared to do that otherwise we shall be constantly chopping and changing <e>", "<cs> my lords let me just set at rest the mind of the noble lord lord diamond on a matter which does not have anything to do with this amendment as i said before the authorisation cannot be changed in a way which would be detrimental to the interests of the consumer <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned clause <e> <s> it is true that changes to the authorisation can be made but it must be by agreement between the director and the public gas supplier <e> <s> as the noble lord will well know the very first duty of the director under clause is to consider the interests of customers and consumers <e> <s> that must come at the top of his list <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord knows we have developed a system of grouping amendments in your lordships house <e> <s> the government provide suggested groupings on a sheet of paper <e> <s> we try to do it the day before the debate <e> <s> it is given first of all to all the parties <e> <s> provided that the grouping is agreed and the noble lord is the leader of his party it is put in the office <e> <s> even then noble lords individually can depart from it if they so wish when they come to their amendments <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to say i do not like the grouping <e> <s> this is not the way that i wish to do it nobody can prevent him <e> <s> when we came to this group which was to be <e>", "<cs> interpretation my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is all about providing an emergency service to deal with escape of gas and british gas is called out to deal with the escape <e> <s> if the escape is on british gass side of the bill iself <e> <s> paragraph of schedule requires a public gas supplier to prevent escapes of gas or make safe <e> <s> when we discussed this in committee it was explained from this side that where a statutory duty is placed on a body and no statutory provision is made for charging that body must carry out the obligation free of charge <e> <s> schedule says nothing about charging in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> if the noble lord lord somers glances at schedule paragraph he will see that there are not surprisingly duties laid on the customer to treat the pipes in the house in a reasonable way <e> <s> it is therefore not possible for complete neglect to take place not reporting that rust is forming or something of that kind and to expect after a catastrophe that the customer should get off scot free <e> <s> under schedule there is a duty on the customer to do his bit <e> <s> however in that context the answer to the noble lord is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i have spoken twice but if the house just this once will allow me to speak a third time very briefly i will say this <e> <s> the bill is continuing the law as it exists at the present time except that we are taking an extra step forward and putting into statute the fact that on the customers side of the meter in other words in the home there will be a statutory duty in future for british gas to make safe after an escape <e> <s> that is a free service although as i have explained the half-hour business comes in if there is other work to be done <e> <s> it is the half-hour business on which the noble lord is pressing me <e> <s> the noble lord is being reasonable as he has been throughout our consideration of the bill <e> <s> i entirely understand the reason why he says that if we could have put it into the licence there could have been agreement here <e> <s> but on behalf of the government i am trying to say that we are going further in statute than any government has gone before <e> <s> i am repeating an assurance which the chairman of british gas is giving to my right honourable friend that the entirely non-statutory assurance which has been given up to now will be continued for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords the first sub-paragraph of this amendment seeks the maintenance in every area of a point of contact for the consumer in other words the continuation of existing showrooms <e> <s> it is this commitment in the amendment which is not acceptable <e> <s> certainly it is quite clear that british gas will wish to go on selling appliances and they have already given an undertaking that showrooms will continue to offer full range of services covering all of the matters to which the noble lord has referred in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lord with the leave of the house may i just make one very quick observation <e> <s> noble lords for understandable reasons have gone rather wider than i had expected on the amendment and they have started to talk about a complaints procedure <e> <s> let us remember that earlier on in our proceedings on this bill the house has accepted an amendment from my noble friend lady gardner of parkes which will ensure that it will be possible in future for there to be voluntary trouble-shooters for complaints for the gas users council in districts and localities in addition to the fact that there will be regional representation on the gas users council as well <e> <s> therefore with respect to the noble lord lord gallacher if somebody in the future is going to have a complaint it will not be necessary to have to find someone in london to take on the complaint <e> <s> there will almost certainly be district representation <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that neither noble lord will feel that i am being unfriendly when i say that they are not even making a mountain out of a molehill i am so sorry is the noble lord going to make a speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that the noble lord lord stoddart is worried about informa-tion on the bill <e> <s> i believe that i am correct in saying that i wrote to noble lords who are concerned with the bill about alterations that had been made to the authorisation <e> <s> as i said when we debated this bill two days ago the redraft of the authorisation was placed in the printed paper office <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house we have been over the ground as to whether the annex ought to be in the licence or in the bill <e> <s> i remain of the same view <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce is if i may say so somewhat misreading the text <e> <s> i believe that there is a full definition of research and development at the bottom of page of the authorisation <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of this amendment is to provide that any person allowed to reconnect a fitting or restore a gas supply under subsection must be licensed by the health and safety commission <e> <s> there is nothing between noble lords opposite and the government concerning safety and the improvement of standards of training and competence <e> <s> it has already been made clear in the debates on this bill that the health and safety commission is planning to introduce an approved code of practice for installers <e> <s> noble lords have referred to this code already this evening <e> <s> the commission is also working on proposals for an independent successor body to corgi the confederation for the registration of gas installers <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to refer first to the second of the noble lords group of amendments <e> <s> if i may say so i think that if we were to draw attention only to the competition aspects of any particular common carriage arrangements we would not permit the director to consider his safety duty under clause <e> <s> i do not believe that would be right and i would recommend that we ought to leave the bill as drafted in this particualr respect so that the director can consider all his duties in coming to a conclusion as to what he ought to do under clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can satisfy the noble lord on this <e> <s> the parent legislation is the town and country planning general development order <e> <s> under that british gas may indeed without planning permission lay a main pipe or other <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would give the secretary of state a straightforward right of veto over modifications to a public gas suppliers authorisation <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords <e> <s> am i saying something exceptionable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am now going to show why i disagree <e>", "<cs> my lords if the house will allow me to speak a second time i would say that i sought to explain that the first of the two reasons why i said we had reservations was that the secretary of state does have a role <e> <s> he has a reserve power if he believes that a modification reference ought to go to the monopolies and mergers commission <e>", "<cs> no my lords it is not a different question it is the same question but it is a different answer <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two reasons why i am still concerned about this particular amendment which we discussed at committee stage <e> <s> the first reason is that the business of supplying gas is necessarily a long-term one in which the assets are depreciated slowly and decisions have to be made over long planning periods in order to acquire new gas <e> <s> one of the questions on which this amendment is silent is how the new franchised area gas company will in fact obtain access to supplies of gas in order to meet its demands <e> <s> i think it is fair to say that the running of a gas industry is not the same as for instance providing television programmes where the assets are shortlived and can be disposed of for alternative use if the franchise is ended and of course that is exactly what <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the second bite at this particular cherry <e> <s> on the previous occasion in committee i thought that the noble lord was receptive to the argument that if the monopolies and mergers commission pronounced on matters that fall under the restrictive trade practices act there would be danger of confusion in the mmcs jurisdiction and the restrictive trade practices court jurisdiction <e> <s> the noble lord comes back now with this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords amendment is seeking further clarity about the extent to which conditions of an authorisation may be modified using the procedures in the bill and would require the secretary of state to add an annex to any authorisation to say what conditions could or could not be modified under the provisions of the bill <e> <s> the simple answer is that any conditions could be modified by these provisions since the wording of clause means that an authorisation could be changed to take account of a monopolies and mergers commission recommendation under general competition law <e>", "<cs> my lords clauses to set out the procedure under which the director can make enforcement orders against public gas suppliers <e> <s> if the supplier does not comply with such an order the way is open for any person who suffers loss or damage from that failure to seek civil damages before the courts <e> <s> the director also has the power under subsection of clause to seek an injunction to require compliance with the order <e> <s> this procedure applies to the enforcement of the relevant requirements listed in clause and the conditions of a public gas suppliers authorisation <e> <s> the noble lords amendments seek to <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the mechanism both noble lords have overlooked the fact that that is catered for in the existing schedule to the authorisation which at paragraph l <e>", "<cs> schedule my lords paragraph l <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the third bite at this cherry <e> <s> we had amendments earlier on in the bill saying that there should be three commissioners of gas supply <e> <s> we then had an amendment on the first day of report saying that there should be two assistants to the director general of gas supply <e> <s> now there is this amendment and the group in which the noble lord has included it which all hang upon amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the noble lord lord diamond spoke to that amendment two days ago <e> <s> that would set up a directorate of gas supply in which additional officers would be available to assist the director <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give an assurance to the noble lord lord ezra that the director will have full powers under condition of the authorisation to obtain information about the components of gas cost to ensure that british gas properly reports the true cost of gas to him <e> <s> but i think that is as far as my assurance can go because although i understand the concern to which the noble lord lord ezra gives voice and i listened carefully to what the noble lord lord stoddart <e> <s> said the argument that has been put on this amendment runs flat in the face of the arguments that have been put to the government in the preceding days on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks me a direct question does the director have a right of entry to gas suppliers premises to look at accounts and records he might want to peruse <e> <s> that is a very sensitive matter as the noble lord very well knows and we have thought it not necessary <e> <s> the reason why we have thought it not necessary is that the office of fair trading and the monopolies and mergers commission do not have such rights of entry and yet they are able to carry out their investigations quite satisfactorily without those particular powers <e> <s> meanwhile as i have said before the director will have full powers under condition of the authorisation to obtain information from british gas about the components of gas costs and other matters <e> <s> the difficulty with this particular amendment is that really it would make british gas the directors research tool <e> <s> according to the amendment the director would have a duty to cross-check every fact he came across in order to check its accuracy and i do not think it really would be an efficient use of either the directors time or the time of british gas <e> <s> there are clear powers in clause and condition of the authorisation which give the director full access to the specific information he needs when carrying out his functions <e> <s> i suggest to your lordships that this is enough and this amendment goes too far <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the noble lord not a third speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i must admit to your lordships that i am guilty of having not discerned that amendment no <e> <s> f which the noble lord is moving ought to have been grouped with amendment no <e> <s> d because it has precisely the same effect as amendment no <e> <s> d <e> <s> i am afraid therefore that my reply must be precisely the same as it was only minutes or half an hour ago <e> <s> i do not think this is appropriate <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> f my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive my saying so i think this group of amendments are a bit late in the day <e> <s> on the th june <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not disagree at all with the noble lord and he will agree with me that the union was very heavily defeated <e> <s> however the government have an even more fundamental difficulty with this amendment <e> <s> in moving it the noble lord lord diamond said that the great thing was to ensure that employees should have their own real interest in the company in which they could hold shares <e> <s> yet what do we find when we look at the marshalled list <e> <s> we find that the first thing which is going to happen is that the employees shares are all going to be thrust away into a trust <e> <s> with respect i do not think that is the right way <e> <s> it is a trust in perpetuity so far as i know <e> <s> i think that that is not the way to give a real personal interest in share owning to individuals some of whom may never have held shares in a company before <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i know the voting rights will be the same as the voting rights for other shares <e> <s> i realise that this does not meet the point which was made by the noble lord lord diamond in a rather curious proposal that there should be special voting rights <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect it is detail which is not suitable to the bill but it is suitable to a government announcement and the government announcement has been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully recognise the concern which has been expressed by the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe <e> <s> it is of course british gass intention to maintain its existing regional structure <e> <s> it also recognises the benefits of having staff at regional level who understand the particular problems which customers in those regions face and it is determined to ensure that this highly valued local interface should be maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords the first of these amendments amendment no <e> <s> j is aimed at paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall not be pricing gas on replacement cost but on a different basis in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords if the house will allow me to speak for a third time which i do not think i should ask but i shall the point that i would put to the noble lord lord bruce is a simple one <e> <s> we are talking about a flotation <e> <s> the companys value should be seen as the value of the business to investors and depends on factors including the profitability of the company <e> <s> if i was buying shares in british gas which i shall not be i would not buy on any other basis <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord and the noble lord lord bruce of donington have both performed the somewhat inelegant feat of standing the traditions of government accounting on their head <e> <s> the noble lord lord diamond knows much better than i do that it is a general principle that government revenue should be paid into the consolidated fund <e> <s> the noble lord also well knows that those moneys are well protected in that payments out of the consoli <e>", "<cs> my lords i am terribly sorry and i apologise to the noble lord but i could not hear what he was saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i have great sympathy with what the noble lord lord harris says <e> <s> we are taking legal advice in order to decide on the next steps <e> <s> there is no doubt that some of the replies that my right honourable friend has received raise questions on which we have to have legal advice before we can decide what to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with my noble friend that it is absolutely essential that public libraries should impartially maintain the public right of access to all the main publications of news and opinion <e> <s> as i said in reply to the first question there is no doubt about it <e> <s> we have to look at the powers under the act and that is what we are doing at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that it has <e> <s> the difficulty i believe is that under section dealing with the duty to maintain a comprehensive and efficient library service we must have legal advice which we are taking at present on what constitutes an efficient and comprehensive library service and also what constitutes a political ban <e> <s> i have no doubt that once my right honourable friend has received advice on that he will take the matter further forward <e> <s> it is our hope that it could then be resolved without having to resort to further powers under the act <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly i shall look into that and let the noble baroness know <e> <s> there is no disagreement i believe in the house and no disagree-ment from the library association which is the professional body <e> <s> it is clear that under the act there must be a comprehensive and efficient library service <e> <s> the difficulty is to find out or to make sure whether what is being done in certain library authorities constitutes a breach <e> <s> i repeat that once my right honourable friend has legal advice on that he will consider what to do <e>", "<cs> possibly my lords but we are operating in the context of the replies received from the various authorities <e> <s> it will not surprise the noble lord to hear that those replies differ <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already made clear that the government strongly disapprove of anything that smacks of political censorship <e> <s> now we have to see how we can prevent it provided that we are absolutely certain that it is happening and that it can be put right under the act <e>", "<cs> my lords it will include all anti-fouling paints <e> <s> the form of control will depend on the nature of the anti-fouling concerned and its intended use <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason for the control of anti-fouling paints is that comparative field trials and indeed other tests undertaken have shown that these paints undoubtedly have a severe effect on shellfish around the coasts <e>", "<cs> my lords new paints would of course have to be cleared under the regulations <e> <s> indeed our procedures here would be in line with but no more onerous than the european communitys directive on the notification of new substances <e> <s> the regulations will be subject to debate in your lordships house before the house rises for the recess and are subject to the affirmative procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords if the boat is painted in this country it will be subject to the regulations but my noble friend asks a good question because we have no controls which apply to vessels which are painted abroad and which then enter united kingdom waters <e> <s> we have however kept the commission of the european communities informed of our initiative and have urged it to consider a community-wide system of controls <e>", "<cs> my lords there have of course been discussions with the paint trade on this particular matter <e> <s> that is why the controls are not due to come into force until st july that is to say in a years time <e>", "<cs> my lords boats are repainted as the season progresses <e> <s> i do not think that the controls will miss all the boat painting in <e>", "<cs> a copper-based one my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the brief introduction of the noble lord lord diamond to his amendment no <e> <s> shows that amendments nos <e> <s> and the last two amendments being government amendments are all aiming to do something which i believe noble lords in all parts of the house wish to see accomplished <e> <s> i am anxious in the few words that i shall speak to try to make a case to your lordships that although it is true that the government amendment comes at a point in the bill where it is permissive and not mandatory at the end of the day the amendments we are putting forward together with a changed condition in the authorisation for british gas add up to the same thing as the noble lord lord diamond wants namely a mandatory requirement <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may be permitted to speak again i ought to tell the house that my noble friend lord campbell of alloway notified me that he could not be present today but he particularly requested that i should say on behalf of the government that he endorsed amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of the noble lords amendment is to require the director and the gas consumers council respectively to include in their annual reports a section on the functioning and staffing of their organisations <e> <s> as the noble lord lord diamond has explained this derives from his concern that there shall be a strong and effective system of regulation based on the office of the director general of ofgas <e> <s> the noble lord is of course also concerned that the new gas consumers council shall be properly staffed <e>", "<cs> my lords if your lordships will allow me one more word may i say that with respect to the noble lord lord stoddart who is as ever persuasive i do not think that this amendment would improve the bill <e> <s> the difficulty is that if one starts to specify the functions to be reported upon in the annual report and in this case the government are being asked to agree that only the functions concerning the facilities and the staffing of the director of ofgas shall appear in the annual report i think that most readers of the bill would raise an eyebrow and ask what about all the other activities <e> <s> the answer is that as it is drafted the bill says that the secretary of state shall receive a report from the director and in that report there shall be included the activities carried out by the director during the year <e> <s> if i may say so i think that is a safer and better way of legislating <e>", "<cs> my lords during the various stages of this bill we have debated the question of whether what are called indicators of service these being one of the ways in which efficiency should be measured should in some way be written into the bill or possibly into the authorisation <e> <s> as the government have previously made clear they do not believe that provisions about indicators of service ought to be in the bill because they consider that it is the responsibility of the public gas supplier to respond to normal commercial pressures and to maintain and improve standards <e> <s> this amendment proposes that there should be a statement of increases in efficiency in each of the areas of the public gas supplier put into the directors annual report <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may reply to the noble lord lord diamond who was concerned about an undertaking which we gave to make a change to the authorisation so that the public gas supplier should give advice to tariff customers about the efficient use of gas supplied to them <e> <s> the wording in the authorisation is <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords in this amendment the noble lord lord diamond is seeking to establish a committee drawn from the bank of england the stock exchange and the offices of the comptroller and auditor general and the public trustee to advise the government on the disposal of shares for the successor company <e> <s> as the noble lord has rightly said this is largely a re-run of a series of amendments that the noble lord tabled at report stage but withdrew <e>", "<cs> my lords i always enjoy listening to the noble lord lord bruce of donington who until now had not taken part in our debates this afternoon <e> <s> it occurred to me that any of your lordships who might have come in during the noble lords speech and heard him referring to offshore holdings the westland company and the prospects for the next general election might not readily have realised that he was in fact picking up a point which he raised at the last stage of the bill about the circumstances in which it might be proposed to redeem the special share under this particular bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i unhesitatingly give the noble lord lord bruce an assurance that the government have no present intention of redeeming the special share this side of the next general election <e>", "<cs> my lords i most certainly recognise that the noble lord is on to an important point here and it is something which has concerned people <e> <s> that is why clause has been put into the bill <e> <s> the point the noble lord lord ezra is on to is the fact that an oil company might give the public gas supplier confidential geological information about a gas field that it wished to sell and that this information would then be used as an unfair advantage by the public gas supplier <e> <s> as i say we have put clause into the bill precisely in order to try to deal with this <e> <s> the clause if the bill is agreed to by the house will enable the secretary of state to give a direction to a public gas supplier to ensure that no unfair commercial advantage is gained from information acquired in the course of gas purchase negotiations <e> <s> the intention of the government is to give a direction to british gas which will require the company not to pass geological and geophysical data obtained during gas purchase negotiations to people in the company or any associate company who are involved in obtaining licences or interests in licences <e> <s> the direction will apply to all negotiations for gas purchases <e> <s> that means that it will not be possible for british gas to permit sensitive information to be seen by their own exploration and production people <e> <s> the very real sanction preventing that is the threat of civil damages <e>", "<cs> my lords the case that the noble lord lord stoddart has made for the last two amendments on the marshalled list rests very particularly on comparability as the noble lord saw it with the dockyard services bill <e> <s> in just a moment i should like to draw your lordships attention to the considerable differences that there are between the bill that we are discussing now and the dockyard services bill <e> <s> before i do so i shall briefly make one or two other points <e>", "<cs> my lords the arrangements that there have been either for taking on or not taking on existing staff of the councils are a matter for the new gas consumers council <e> <s> however as i have said it is not a transfer <e> <s> the old councils are being wound up and a new council is being established <e> <s> i will simply add that as a matter of fact and not just as a technicality the regulations on page of the marshalled list cannot extend to the national gas consumers council because such councils are not commercial undertakings <e>", "<cs> my lords not only british gas itself but also picking up the point the noble lord opposite made my right honourable friend has met the trade unions as recently as the middle of may on gas subjects <e> <s> i simply remind your lordships that all this has happened with a welcome from the employees <e> <s> i understand that of the employees of british gas literally only a few dozen have when asked told the management that they do not wish to be informed about the share offers which are to be made to them <e> <s> i believe that they welcome the change which is to be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move hat this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord monson asked me one direct question about the consequences of the european court decision <e> <s> i have on many occasions heard threats of renationalisation from the party opposite <e> <s> i am confident that when everyone sees the great success that will be made of privatisation of british gas no future government <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly within the directors conditions of service that they should be able to be properly rewarded for their expertise <e> <s> i think this is a question of balance between what is due to the companies and what is due to the directors <e> <s> sir kenneth cork is at the moment chairing an arts council inquiry into the funding of the live theatre and my right honourable friend the minister for the arts has asked sir kenneth to look specifically at this issue and to produce guidelines for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords as the governments reply which i gave says my right honourable friend has full confidence in the boards of the two companies and incidentally a senior officer of the arts council attends meetings of both boards <e> <s> nonetheless i think that it will be of use generally that the inquiry of sir kenneth cork will be looking at this particular matter <e> <s> i am sure that it will help <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the enormous popular success of the national theatre and the royal shakespeare company are eloquent of the ability of the directors as well as the staff and the performers <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not pick up any attack on the governments investment in the arts during this question and answer session <e> <s> if i do so like the noble baroness i shall resist it <e> <s> i agree with her about the success of these two great companies <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already paid tribute to the success of those two great companies <e> <s> my noble friend lord nugent has however asked a serious and important question which has elicited two pieces of information for which i think i should thank my noble friend <e> <s> the first is that the government reiterate their confidence in the ability of the boards to maintain value for money and the second is that nonetheless we think that it is helpful that sir kenneth should be looking into the question of balance in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords that is fair comment <e> <s> nonetheless i reiterate that i believe that it will be to everybodys advantage to have some recommen-dations from sir kenneth corks inquiry about the balance in this matter <e> <s> i hope that we shall also receive some guidelines for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not entirely surprised to hear my noble friend ask that question a question to which i shall draw the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am again not wholly surprised that the noble lord lord strabolgi moves on to that particular ground <e> <s> however it is ground which lies rather outside the scope of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the first question asked by the noble lord lord hutchinson but with respect to him i disagree with his second question <e> <s> if we take the years to the present financial year we see that the real term increase for the royal shakespeare company is nearly per cent <e> <s> and for the national theatre over per cent <e> <s> they are not doing so badly <e>", "<cs> the run of figures for the royal shakespeare company shows a healthy increase <e> <s> i have given the figures <e> <s> i shall draw the attention of my right honourable friend to the question asked by my noble friend lord butterworth but i think that there is no more that i can possibly add on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i have it in command from her majesty the queen and his royal highness the prince of wales to acquaint the house that they having been informed of the purport of the agriculture bill have consented to place their prerogatives and interests so far as they are affected by the bill at the disposal of parliament for the purposes of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has explained clearly in his brief remarks on this amendment that what he is concerned about is that the setting of figures for the standard quota for the milk arrangements in the less favoured areas in scotland and the setting of figures for less favoured areas in england and wales will lead to a preferential position so far as concerns scotland <e> <s> in setting the average figures to be used for the purposes of calculating the standard quota we feel that we must look at the average yields achievable in those areas so my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture fisheries and food in england and the secretary of state for scotland have looked at the average yields per hectare in the original less favoured areas in england and wales and in scotland respectively <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships may remember having established the standard quota for a farm and your lordships agreed to amendments which moved a small but significant distance in favour of the tenant in doing that at previous stages of the bill there is then a need to establish what share of the value of that standard quota is attributable to the tenant and what share of that standard quota is attributable to the landlord <e> <s> in assessing that the starting-off point is the total theoretical rental of the farm what it would have earned in if all the facilities had been provided by the landlord <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords who have taken part in different stages of the bill <e> <s> there are noble lords in the house this evening who have instituted interesting and important debates who have not spoken on the question <e> <s> that the bill do now pass <e> <s> some of your lordships have and contributions have come not least from the noble lord lord john-mackie on the front bench opposite and the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for her question <e> <s> we think it was successful more than farmers members of the general public schoolchildren and general interest groups visited the events that were held <e> <s> we certainly should like to repeat it either in whole or in part <e> <s> we must look at our budget to see whether that will be possible <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we certainly are million is due to be spent by the end of the next financial year <e> <s> we have promised that from then onwards for a three-year period we will put in government money on the basis of for every of industry money provided industry puts in a minimum of million in any one year <e> <s> the government maximum would be million in any one year <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know that there will be an integration of those involved in generic advertising but i know that they will be considering contributions <e>", "<cs> my lords the intention of the agriculture bill with which your lordships have just parted company is to increase the size of the council on which my noble friend sits so that there is representation not only of the farmers unions but of the food manufacturers the milk meat and cereal sectors and the retailers <e> <s> obviously it is our hope that money will come in from those different sectors <e> <s> perhaps i may just say that if industry plays its part at the end of the first eight years of the food from britain campaign the government will have contributed million <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an exceedingly interesting but other question <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess that i did not have the pleasure of seeing the programme to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> but i believe that the trustees and the director concur in their views on the return of the marbles <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is an opinion which is not shared by the museum trustees by the director or indeed by her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a hypothetical question but it is nonetheless an interesting one and as always i am grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> that is true my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps we ought to finish the exchange by reminding ourselves that in the noble lord brought forward a bill which would have had that effect and your lordships house did not agree to it having a second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i ought to comment on that interesting question <e> <s> but i am grateful to my noble friend for giving me the opportunity to say that the sculptures have been admirably looked after by the british museum <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft apple and pear development council order which was laid before the house on th june be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to say that i do not think there have been any recriminations as a result of the invalidity of the previous orders and the necessity to replace them <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think we can have two or more than two noble lords on their feet at the same time <e> <s> i wonder whether i might ask your lordships if it is the feeling of the house despite the fact that this is a matter of considerable concern that after minutes we ought now to move on to other business <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for saying that the first part of my answer was acceptable to him <e> <s> in the letter sent at the end of july to the library authorities concerned my right honourable friends view was made clear <e> <s> it was that a local authority which bans newspapers to make a political or industrial point will almost certainly be acting <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> the answer is yes <e> <s> news international commenced judicial review proceedings in the high court on th october against three authorities <e> <s> i understand that the judgment is expected shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords that will presumably be a matter for the court <e>", "<cs> no it is not my lords the english courts <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the noble and learned lord is a very distinguished representative of the principality perhaps a slight error in this matter is understandable <e> <s> but of course the noble and learned lord was quite right to draw the attention of the government to the fact that this matter is before the high court <e> <s> perhaps i may make two comments in reply to the noble lord lord harris <e> <s> if after the judgment of the high court my right honourable friend the minister for the arts thinks it necessary to act he will act quickly <e> <s> indeed i shall draw the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland to this exchange this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords we are discussing statutory duties under the act of and i shall confine myself to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to have that pointed out to me by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords this situation has been continuing during the summer months but the fact of the matter is that it has been necessary for my right honourable friend in a matter which has never before been tested by the courts to find out the facts of the case <e> <s> my right honourable friend therefore sought information from library authorities took legal advice and then gave the library authorities the governments view in no uncertain terms i think with some success <e> <s> meanwhile however a case has been brought and we feel that it is now right to await the judgment of the court <e>", "<cs> my lords that interesting intervention i think goes a little wide of the original question but i shall have great pleasure in drawing the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education to what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> section of the salmon and freshwater fisheries act makes it an offence to introduce fish or spawn into any inland water without the consent of the relevant water authority <e> <s> there is no right of appeal if the water authority says no <e> <s> although the government recognise the need for section we consider that it represents a considerable and unnecessary burden for the general run of fish farms <e> <s> we therefore have clause of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e>

grateful to my noble friend for what he has said about the success of the negotiations and i shall draw his words to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is more or less right in what he said at the beginning of his intervention <e> <s> the figure i have is a per cent <e> <s> reduction in the production of milk products <e> <s> the noble lord put to me the logical conclusion that therefore the mountains will continue to grow <e> <s> with respect to the noble lord he is neglecting that part of the statement which makes clear that there will be a policy of stock disposal by the commission about which i said to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter that i did not think i could say more this evening <e> <s> however i said to the noble lord lord john-mackie that the intention through the stock disposal policy is that over the next two years it will be possible to reduce the stocks of both butter and skimmed milk powder to normal proportions

asked me to pass on to my right honourable friend <e> <s> that i shall do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for saying that he feels that this important and difficult negotiation

mcintosh that does not address the position of the secretary of states representatives within the joint negotiating committee <e> <s> it is precisely that point which has caused the trouble in the burnham committee <e> <s> it is precisely that point which the teachers and the employers are saying they are addressing in their letter and it is precisely that point which remains obscure at the present time and which of course finally caused the unilateral scrapping of the concordat in and as the noble lord lord houghton rightly said in his speech the position in which we all find ourselves today <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the figures for exports but one attraction of deer farming is the potiential market and there seems to be a long way to go before deer farmers approach levels

slaughtering <e> <s> as i said i believe that we should wait until the government give their response to the recommendations and that response will be given shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i cannot satisfy my noble friend on that question <e> <s> i think the answer is no <e>", "<cs> no my lords because deer meat is not in surplus <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is i am not aware of it <e>

and food the organisation food from britain and the highlands and islands development board assisted the british deer farmers association to set up and run its marketing co-operative the british deer producers society <e> <s> as regards the future which was the main thrust of my noble friends question the best encouragement that deer farming can have is the fact that unlike so many other agricultural commodities it is one which is not in surplus at present <e>", "<cs> my lords action is going forward on a number of fronts <e> <s> government departments are continuing their review of forms <e> <s> led by the management and personnel office this initiative has resulted in the abolition of over forms and the redesign of a further forms since work began in <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the drafting of bills i ought to make two observations <e> <s> first in the view of the government the drafting by parliamentary <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess that i was not aware of this particular problem <e> <s> i must say that i am surprised <e> <s> the plain english campaign had an exhibition in the house of commons during the first half of last year which was sponsored by my right honourable friend the minister for the arts mr luce <e> <s> i know that my right honourable friend has said in another place that he feels the campaign is doing a great deal to encourage the use of plain english <e> <s> indeed i know of three government departments or organisations which have won plain english awards from the campaign and feel proud to have done so <e> <s> i think what i must do is to draw the attention of my right honourable friend who is responsible for the management and personnel office to what the noble lord lord cledwyn said <e>", "<cs> my lords of course there are problems occasionally in parliament <e> <s> i can think of some plain english expressions which would not be parliamentary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that both the government and the advice which parliamentary counsel give to the government will try to achieve that objective <e>", "<cs> my lords i very rarely disagree with the noble and learned lord but certainly whenever there is a slight complication in the drafting of legislation in this house someone always refers to the report of my noble friend lord renton and quite rightly so too <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first part of my noble friends question is concerned at the end of the day the legislation which is introduced into either house of parliament is the responsibility of the ministers in the departments concerned and if it is the case as the noble and learned lord lord simon the noble lord lord grimond and my noble friend suggest that legislation is sometimes not as easy to understand as it might be i must stick to the point that i have made namely that i believe that the advice that ministers receive from parliamentary counsel is excellent and that if there are any faults then they are ours when we sit on a front bench in either house <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall try <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a most interesting suggestion and i shall draw it to the attention of my noble friend the leader of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his first comment <e> <s> we remain fully committed to reducing surpluses <e> <s> we will continue to press in the forthcoming price fixing for realistic cap prices as the central plank of our policy in this area <e> <s> those negotiations will begin next month <e> <s> we strongly welcome the agreement in principle last december on a scheme for diversion of land out of sectors in surplus <e>", "<cs> my lords over the past two years taking all commodities there has been a per cent <e> <s> reduction in prices for farmers in the community <e> <s> this shows that the agriculture ministers contrary to what has been said are trying now through the price mechanism to see that surpluses are reduced <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for that reason that i said to my noble friend lord campbell that we very strongly welcome the agreement taken in principle in the negotiations last december for a scheme for the diversion of land out of sectors in surplus <e> <s> the noble lord lord mackie of benshie asks when the government are going to do something about that <e> <s> of course the agreement in principle must be carried forward to agreement in fact and i hope that we shall hear more about the matter from the agriculture council later next month <e> <s> in the meantime the government are considering land use in the context of reform of the cap and we intend to keep your lordships informed on that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord lord john-mackie asked me the first question because it enables me to underline the fact that i entirely agree with him <e> <s> there must be a two-pronged approach toward our problems <e> <s> they cannot be solved by price alone <e> <s> we shall be as tough as we possibly can be and i hope that the community will be tough too so far as the price fixing is concerned <e> <s> however in the interests of both producers and consumers there must be another plank to the platform of trying to reduce surpluses <e> <s> that plank is involved in the answer that i gave to my noble friends supplementary question when i said that we strongly welcomed the agreement on a diversion scheme for land where sectors are in surplus <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked me to quantify my reply <e> <s> the size of the milk problem in the community is over-production of around million tonnes <e> <s> the government reckon that what <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i think that my right honourable friend had many reasons for saying that further thought was needed <e> <s> however the council of agriculture ministers finally came to the conclusion that this should be done <e> <s> i can say to the noble lord lord cledwyn that my right honourable friend the minister of state mr gummer will today be contacting charity organisations <e> <s> further details of how the scheme will operate in this country will be announced as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i cannot state the physical percentage <e> <s> i can say that the range of foods covered by the scheme will be very wide indeed <e> <s> as i said earlier it is reckoned that initially the scheme will cost about million <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it that is a community figure <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i think that my noble friend has put his finger on a very important point <e> <s> for a scheme of this kind to succeed what we would need to do is to make sure that those who are the more marginal producers will come out of production and will take enough out of production to reduce the size of the cereal mountain <e> <s> my noble friend lord stodart gave the figuring so far as this is concerned and what i am saying to my noble friend lord onslow is that i believe we can have this particular scheme without having to take any large quantities of the very best cereal land out of production <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate comes at an important time for the future of the united kingdom sugar industry <e> <s> i have listened with interest to the points made by your lordships most of whom are experts on this matter <e> <s> i shall do my best to give a government reply <e> <s> i must make one thing clear at the beginning <e> <s> i am not in a position to disclose today the outcome of the as yet unpublished report of the monopolies and mergers commission on the future of british sugar <e>", "<cs> we have had a lengthy debate on this group of seven complex looking amendments <e> <s> however as i believe my noble friend lord renton rightly said the issue we have been discussing is straightforward and indeed fundamental <e> <s> the issue is whether the committee should agree with these amendments which would immediately set up a new national joint committee for negotiating teachers pay or do we need some time as the bill proposes in order to find new negotiating arrangements which will have a brighter prospect of working than the present system which has not worked in recent years <e>", "<cs> there is overwhelming support from parents and people in the country who feel that at a time when an unparalleled pay increase is being offered there should be something in return and that that something should be a better education service and peace in our schools <e> <s> the noble lord lord hatch is however right <e> <s> there is no agreement among teacher unions as to the way forward <e>", "<cs> i shall not give way at the moment <e> <s> i thought that my noble friend lady cox was right when at the end of her words she said that we must <e>", "<cs> the professional association of teachers is not a large association though it represents an important section of the teaching profession <e> <s> i forbore to read out the whole of the press statement which ends <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble baroness i endeavoured to cover that in my speech <e> <s> from onwards by an agreement of burnham there was a working party to work out a future structure for teachers pay <e> <s> of course from onwards the government were more or less excluded from burnham except for the two seats which they continued to have on the committee <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a final word <e> <s> if it could be avoided nobody would want to do away with a negotiating machinery which had been part of the education scene for so many years <e> <s> but the time has now come when all members of the committee who have spoken this afternoon except i think the noble lord lord glenamara agree that burnham must go <e> <s> that is what clause of the bill will achieve <e>", "<cs> if i may say so if the noble lord will take the trouble to talk to parents he will find that there is no parent who wants to see his or her child going to a school where there is disruption <e> <s> as my noble friend lady cox said at second reading sometimes teachers were there and sometimes they were not <e> <s> this is not good for the profession either <e>", "<cs> i have enjoyed the debate on this amendment <e> <s> i have done so because i always enjoy listening to the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> as she spoke i was thankful that i was not called upon to answer questions about two apparently quite innocuous amendments which turned out to be amendments of almost byzantine complexity <e>", "<cs> i agree with my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> indeed for once i would go further than my noble friend and say that i think it is difficult to see how the situations which this amendment apparently envisages could actually arise unless noble lords opposite are looking to a world in which there would be no role at all for the secretary of state <e> <s> where then would the money come from <e> <s> what is the meaning which the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey attaches to the word agreement <e> <s> are the noble lords sponsoring this amendment looking at a situation like that which has arisen recently in the burnham committee in which the local authorities and some of the teacher unions have reached a consensus on a course of action which they know my right honourable friend cannot accept <e> <s> it is precisely because it has not proved possible to reach an agreement which is supported by the local education authorities all the unions and the government that <e>", "<cs> perhaps this is the moment just to say that we have been listening for the past three quarters of an hour to a catalogue of criticism against the bill and the resentment which it will cause <e> <s> let us be absolutely clear about one matter before we go any further this evening <e> <s> the fact that pay and conditions for teachers have never been negotiated together is extremely unusual <e> <s> when i made a speech on the first amendment this afternoon i said that an agreement of the burnham committee was that in a working party should be set up to try to get a better structure for teachers pay <e>", "<cs> if i may go some way towards what the noble lord lord mcintosh said at the end of his remarks about making clear what the advisory committee would do in the context of these amendments the amendments are unnecessary because the advisory committee will do what the proposers want in taking evidence from associations of local education authorities and organisations representing school teachers <e> <s> a government amendment to clause will be moved to ensure <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mcintosh asked whether it was the governments case that the negotiating process had broken down <e> <s> i would not put it quite like that but as recent history has shown the negotiating process has certainly not been working <e> <s> i would also add that that is why matters need to be referred to the advisory committee and that is the reason for the bill <e>", "<cs> while the noble lord lord mcintosh is thinking about that perhaps i may say that i believe my noble friend lord elton is right <e> <s> i am not absolutely certain whether he is totally right <e> <s> however there is no question that the effect of this amendment means that the recommendations of the advisory committee would have to be implemented by the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord mcintosh for moving this amendment and speaking to the large group of amendments which go with it <e>", "<cs> if i may say so with respect to the noble lord lord monkswell i should have thought that the point he has raised should come under amendments nos <e> <s> and when we talk about an order making different provisions for different cases <e> <s> i should like to look at what the noble lord has said to <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord lord monkswell i did not make myself clear to him <e> <s> when i replied to the noble lord lord mcintosh about the reference to individual local education authorities i said that ordinarily local education authorities are represented through their associations <e> <s> we believe that that provides an adequate and sensible means of consultation <e>", "<cs> the amendment would require any modifications to the advisory committee recommendations to be referred back again to them for further consultation before an order is made <e> <s> although i understand the thrust of lord kilmarnocks case i should say in reply that the arrangements in the bill have two important stages <e> <s> the first stage involves the advisory committee with its independent chairman addressing issues referred to it by the secretary of state and then in the light of evidence and representations submitted to the committee making a report <e> <s> the second stage which is equally important involves consultations between the secretary of state and those directly affected namely the local authority associations teacher unions and bodies representing voluntary school interests <e> <s> it is on that second stage that i gave an assurance about consultation which the noble lord lord mcintosh said he thought was valuable <e>", "<cs> where i part company with the noble lord lord kilmarnock is when the noble lord says that he looks with suspicion on the objectiveness of the advisory committee <e> <s> i am sure the advisory committee will be objective in its attitude the point where i disagree with the noble lord is that the advisory committee will be independent <e> <s> i emphasise the importance of this and i stick by it <e> <s> yes the advisory committee will be appointed by my right honourable friend but there are such bodies as the university grants committee the advisory board for the research councils and the council for national academic awards all of which i think i am right in saying are appointed by the secretary of state <e> <s> such bodies are entirely independent in what they say and do <e>", "<cs> i do not think i can help the noble baroness much further with this <e>", "<cs> i have gone out of my way to give three examples none of which the noble baroness has been interested in of important committees which are appointed by my right honourable friend but which do difficult and sometimes controversial tasks without evidence of political bias <e> <s> that is a matter to which the noble baroness has not addressed herself <e> <s> there is an alternative which neither the noble baroness nor i have mentioned and that is that there can be mandation <e> <s> that is a subject we discussed earlier today <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has made it clear that he is probing in this amendment <e> <s> i shall try to give some information to him in answer to his first amendment <e> <s> there must be a real prospect contrary to the hypothesis that he put forward that a resolution of the existing pay dispute will not have reached a conclusion by the time that this bill receives royal assent <e> <s> i emphasise however that the government remain willing within the existing pay determination processes to seek an outcome consistent with the principles of a pay structure which provides adequate differentials and a sufficient number of incentive posts together with an overall cost that is within the resources available which total the enormous sum of million over and <e> <s> that will mean that over an -month period if that is done the teaching profession will have received a per cent <e> <s> pay increase <e>", "<cs> we looked with considerable care yesterday at some of the proposals that have been made in regard to the setting up of the advisory committee <e> <s> i have to say to the noble lord straight out that the government were happy to accept some changes to the bill and indeed i was particularly happy that we accepted immediately the insertion of the word interim before advisory committee which the noble lords lord mcintosh of haringey and lord ritchie of dundee put forward <e> <s> that shows the intentions of the government to be as they have said that they are <e> <s> this is an interim bill <e> <s> however there were a great many other proposals put forward for the setting up of the advisory committee which i hope the noble lord lord kilmarnock will forgive my saying were ones that we felt we could not accept <e>", "<cs> naturally i listen carefully to what the noble lord lord henderson says so far as concerns questions of parliamentary procedure <e> <s> indeed when the noble lord speaks on other matters i also listen carefully <e> <s> but there is a point here which the noble lord has not perhaps brought out in his words and that is concerned with what as the days go by will become of increasing urgency that is to get the first slice of the very substantial pay increase to the recipients the teaching profession who quite rightly expect that it should have been paid on time which was to have been the first pay day of this year though clearly it will be later than that <e> <s> i say that by way of background <e> <s> the noble lord lord henderson said that nonetheless that ought to be decided this year by the affirmative resolution procedure come what may <e>", "<cs> i was interested in the intervention of the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> he said that agreement had been reached in scotland where things are done so well <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> the committee will wish to be aware that the pay arrangements which my right honourable friend is proposing for england are very much akin to the arrangements which have been agreed in scotland <e>", "<cs> there is no problem there <e> <s> they are not exactly the same but they are certainly akin and my right honourable friend was delighted to see the conclusion of the arrangements in scotland <e> <s> that is the first point <e>", "<cs> the amount of delay depends on whether one runs into the easter recess the whitson recess or as i sincerely hope will not happen the summer recess <e> <s> the procedure on negative resolution is that the order can be made as soon as consultation is concluded <e> <s> the order can then be laid before parliament and brought into force <e> <s> that means that everybody including local authorities can get on with it <e> <s> the affirmative resolution procedure as my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter has so rightly said must wait upon not only the laying of the order but also upon debates in both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> i may say that i am surprised at the intervention of the noble baroness <e> <s> she spent the <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a final word from this side <e> <s> with respect i wish that the noble lord lord glenamara would sometimes listen to what is being said <e> <s> there is no way that the order can be made today because there is clearly a responsibility upon my right honourable friend regardless of what happens with the bill under discussion to try to reach agreement if he can possibly do so with both sides of the education service on how this unprecedented sum of money should be distributed <e> <s> it is not possible for me or indeed for any other noble lord to say how long that will take <e> <s> it is for this reason that i had to give that answer to the noble baroness lady seear <e>", "<cs> this is the amendment of the noble lord lord henderson and i think we ought to proceed to a conclusion <e> <s> the reality is that the noble lord lord monkswell has been talking about a crisis procedure <e> <s> as was set out by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter if you use the negative resolution procedure once you have laid the order everybody including the local authorities can get on with it <e> <s> that is in the interests of the teaching profession <e> <s> if you use the affirmative procedure you have to wait in both houses until after the laying of the order and until after a period has gone by <e> <s> then you have to have debates and you must also allow for extra time if recesses come into the matter <e> <s> this factor could be quite significant <e>", "<cs> this amendment would mean that the first order made by my right honourable friend after the passage of the bill cannot include any provision in respect of any period after st march <e> <s> i suspect and having heard the noble lord i think i now know that he wants clarification of the governments intentions as regards teachers pay for the period after st march <e> <s> in that respect i can give an assurance that my right honourable friends proposals for teachers pay like their scottish counterparts are designed to run up to st march and no later <e> <s> the next date for reviewing teachers pay would be st april and i presume that teachers would then revert to a normal settlement date of st <e>", "<cs> there is no question at all that the great concern that lies behind these amendments which the noble lord lord henderson moved with great clarity is that the bill we are discussing could become permanent <e> <s> none of your lordships who has spoken wishes to see that <e> <s> that is understood by the government and i was grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for making the valid point that the government had endeavoured to show our recognition of the main thrust of the debate bearing on todays discussion when yesterday we accepted a small but significant amendment to make the description of the advisory committee such that it became the interim advisory committee <e> <s> that description has now gone on to the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord henderson will want to come to a conclusion <e> <s> therefore i simply say from this bench to the noble lord lord alexander that the message to the teaching profession is that the bill is certainly temporary <e> <s> that matter is in the long title the bill provides for its own expiry <e> <s> only yesterday we put on <e>", "<cs> i well understand what the noble lord is saying but i think it is an inappropriate role for the advisory committee <e> <s> i put it to the committee that it is not for the advisory committee to decide whether it and the act ought to continue for a further period <e> <s> that must be a matter for the secretary of state to put to parliament for decision <e> <s> the various bodies should surely therefore be addressing their representations to my right honourable friend and no doubt they will do so without any need for a formal provision to that effect in the bill <e> <s> with respect to the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey to put the advisory committee in the amendment would not be appropriate <e>", "<cs> i have to confess that that was not in my mind <e>", "<cs> in the event that parliament agrees to extend the life of the act and so of the advisory committee beyond the work of the advisory committee would continue to be much the same as before <e> <s> it should devote its time to examining such questions relating to teachers pay and conditions of employment as are put before it <e> <s> i do not think that it would be appropriate for the committee to spend its time compiling and publishing a report on the operation of the act <e> <s> the committees successive reports on matters referred to it are in any case bound to contain such remarks as it wishes to make on the operation of the act <e> <s> it is important to bear that in mind <e> <s> it is mainly for that final reason that i should prefer not to lay extra bureaucracy on this advisory committee if and that hypothesis is very much an r the act extends beyond <e>", "<cs> the real intention as i understood it when the noble lord lord mcintosh started speaking was to ensure that the government should meet their part of the teachers pay settlement <e> <s> as regards that point the government certainly are not unwilling to share the cost of a satisfactory agreement <e> <s> however i do not think that this new clause is the way to go about ensuring that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcintosh fairly said at the beginning of his remarks that these amendments do not attempt again to put before the house the idea of a national joint council <e> <s> indeed these are amendments which come from a lesser known part of the burnham negotiating machinery <e> <s> i understand that for several years now the secretariat of the burnham committee has produced an annual pay data report designed to inform the work of the committee <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> which is the first of the substantive amendments would give this work to a research unit within the office of manpower economics <e> <s> its reports would inform negotiations but it does not appear that the employers and teachers organisations would be bound by them in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords i should say straightaway to the noble lord lord monkswell on the actual drafting of his amendment that the bill does not provide that remuneration shall be determined by the head teacher <e> <s> the bill provides that remuneration shall be determined and paid to teachers by local education authorities in accordance with the scales and other provisions set out or referred to in an order <e> <s> i hope that this first point meets the drafting of the amendment of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords if the house will give me leave to reply to the noble baroness lady phillips the noble lord lord somers suggested more effectively than i can that good head teachers and i would say education authorities recognise good teachers in all kinds of ways as do pupils and parents also <e> <s> however i take the point that the noble baroness is making <e> <s> if one of the legs of promotion is to be for a teacher <e>", "<cs> my lords both noble lords the noble lord mcintosh and the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby talked about the arrears of pay and the noble lord lord houghton specifically asked for assurances <e> <s> arrears of pay will date from st january <e> <s> the speed with which the money is paid will depend on royal assent for the bill consultation with local authorities and teachers unions about draft orders and the orders being laid <e> <s> those now on promoted posts will get half-way to the st october allowance in payments in respect of st january <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been at this bill for quite a long time now at second reading committee stage and now quite a lengthy session on report <e> <s> there is one point that i know is familiar to your lordships that is that the negotiating system for teachers pay sadly has not been working <e> <s> there have been constant disagreements in the burnham committee leading to disruptions in the schools and at the end of the day it has been the childrens education which has suffered <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house i should like to repeat a statement that is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture fisheries and food <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their reaction to this statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord mackie of benshie has in many ways been generous in what he has said and has welcomed aspects of the statement <e> <s> however in his closing words the noble lord referred to the statement as being a small start <e> <s> we have a situation which has worried this house very much certainly in the time that i have been working in the ministry <e> <s> what is to be done about the ever-increasing surpluses and is it possible to take some kind of action to grow alternative crops and take other measures to reduce the surplus at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend who has been characteristically generous in what he said <e> <s> he can be stern sometimes and there was an element of sternness in what he said <e> <s> may i simply add this <e> <s> it was my noble friend and my noble friend lord peel who persuaded the government to put section of last years agriculture act into that legislation <e> <s> i am absolutely delighted that we are now able to take action on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for what she has said <e> <s> the noble baroness has considerable experience of planning <e> <s> there is no question of opening up the countryside to uncontrolled development as a result of this statement <e> <s> as the statement says my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment is providing for what we think is a more realistic look or approach to the giving of approval for the use of redundant buildings and things of that kind in the countryside <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the take-up of land which is not needed for cereal production as my noble friend quite rightly said we discussed this in the debate the other day there is undoubtedly going to be an effect on that problem so far as the proposals announced this evening on farm woodland and forestry are concerned <e> <s> my noble friend has asked me to specify <e> <s> we are going to spend up to a maximum of a year per hectare <e> <s> these are the recurrent grants <e> <s> there are the planting grants on top of that <e> <s> there will be a number of payment bands <e> <s> three are currently envisaged because the income foregone from planting trees on agricultural land will vary with land quality and area <e> <s> the basis for differentiation will be under consideration <e> <s> all this will be in the policy document and subject to consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will forgive me i think both the noble baroness and i <e>", "<cs> my lords we may find the money will come from european community schemes as associated structures measures unfold <e> <s> there is just one thing i should say about reducing surpluses with which i know my noble friend is considerably preoccupied <e> <s> as i am sure my noble friend knows there is a remit from the commission that they will come forward with proposals for taking sectors out of surpluses <e> <s> the british government have put forward a proposal to the council of ministers for trying to take land for cereals out of surpluses <e> <s> my noble friend lord stodart referred to that <e> <s> my understanding is that the council of ministers meeting in brussels this week expects to have before it proposals from the commission about taking sectors out of surpluses <e> <s> therefore this is an area about which we hope to hear more in the near and foreseeable future <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord taylor has almost unrivalled experience in the field on which he has chosen to ask me questions <e> <s> i shall do my best to answer <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i have understood from the speeches made in support of this amendment that noble lords want to set a course before this bill is passed for the future determination of the process for teachers pay <e> <s> with respect this amendment really is not the way to do it <e> <s> it is not clear in this amendment whether primary legislation is desirable in dealing with pay determination of teachers nor despite speeches which have been made to the contrary is it clear what the role of the secretary of state in all this ought to be <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord henderson bases this amendment on two premises <e> <s> the first is that the bill as drafted creates uncertainty <e> <s> i was a little surprised at that because the noble lord may remember that in committee he moved an amendment to insert the word temporary into the short title of the bill <e> <s> now he wants to take the same word out of the long title <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is that the precedents i have and there are several of them show that the expression temporary has appeared generally in the short title of bills <e> <s> is the noble lord saying that it should not be in the long title because generally precedents have been in the short title and those bills being of a temporary nature have no fixed final date <e> <s> if the noble lord is saying that there is a crucial distinction between having the word in the long title and having it in the short title all i can say is that my advice is to the contrary <e>", "<cs> with respect that is not what i said <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the house will allow me to intervene once more <e> <s> i am not sure that i have made myself clear to the noble lord <e> <s> there are plenty of precedents for acts which are described as being temporary in the short title and having a fixed terminal date as this bill has but including provisions whereby the duration may be continued provided the government bring forward the necessary orders and obtain the approval of parliament <e> <s> the only point of disagreement between the noble lord and the government is whether the word temporary appears in the long title or the short title <e> <s> the noble lord seeks to solve that argument by extracting the word temporary <e> <s> that is not acceptable to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords although some of the issues in this bill have been hard fought there has been agreement on several issues <e> <s> there is agreement that the existing burnham machinery must be brought to an end that pay and conditions must be considered together and that the secretary of state has an important role in the pay determination process <e> <s> i was grateful to my noble friend lord elton for reminding us that we need to recognise that after a long period of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure whether they are more stringent <e> <s> they are equally repugnant <e> <s> my noble friend has touched on an extremely important point <e> <s> this proposal would raise the price of a raw material essential for many processed foods by approximately per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with what the noble lord lord gallacher has said <e> <s> the noble lord is i think saying that this is not the right approach and the government most certainly agree with that view <e> <s> we believe that support costs should be reduced and that revenue should not be raised by taxing the consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that any question of <e>", "<cs> my lords this will be decided if it has to be so decided by qualified majority <e>", "<cs> my lords i would most certainly confirm what my noble friend has said so far as concerns the second part of his question <e> <s> so far as concerns the first part the cost of oil will just about double <e> <s> what effect that would have on individual countries i am not sure <e> <s> but in general terms my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> in addition to the united states many developing countries including small developing countries would be seriously affected by such a tax <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord sainsbury <e> <s> not surprisingly i could not have put it better myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the thrust of my noble friends question but this is something we have resisted <e> <s> we have resisted it successfully over quite a few years <e> <s> as my noble friend lord mottistone reminded me in his question this all stems from a very robust recommendation by the select committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving a professional view of the matter <e> <s> from the point of view of the government i would add this <e> <s> if i may <e> <s> i think consumers should be given the opportunity to eat sensibly taking into account the best dietary advice <e> <s> by increasing the price of vegetable and fish oils by a tax of this kind the consumers choice would be restricted in a very important area of diet <e>", "<cs> my lords variations of this proposal have been discussed i said for the last few years but in fact it is over about the last years <e> <s> in when there had to be a decision although there were discussions subsequently the united kingdom germany denmark and the netherlands prevented the adoption <e> <s> i understand that on this occasion portugal is indicating that it would also be opposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i keep hoping that it will not come before the council of agriculture ministers <e> <s> it is part of the price fixing <e> <s> the next agriculture council will be held in the near future <e> <s> as i have tried to show my noble friend in answer to all the questions we shall consistently oppose the case for this tax <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not done so but it will apply of course to the price of fish and chips <e> <s> to that extent the noble lord has made a good point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both the noble and learned lord lord silkin of dulwich and the noble lord lord winstanley for their reception of the second reading of this bill <e> <s> we have had a useful if short debate and in particular i am grateful to both noble lords for welcoming the main purpose of the bill although they have discussed the question rather more widely and probably will want to discuss it further <e>", "<cs> this was indeed a matter which the noble and learned lord lord silkin referred to at second reading and if i may say so i think that the difficulty that the government see with the amendment which the noble and learned lord has put forward is this <e> <s> when the act was passed the parliamentary commissioner was appointed to carry out responsibilities on behalf of members of another place to protect the individual against maladministration by the state <e> <s> as the white paper then said he was seen as developing and reinforcing existing constitutional rights of the individuals <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should have been more explicit <e> <s> i am saying that if the noble lord lord winstanley has in mind a body which should be regarded as part of the apparatus of government but whose impact on the individual is such that it is a proper candidate to be in the bill we should be very glad to look at it <e> <s> where i hoped i made myself clear was in saying that when one has a body which is clearly not part of the apparatus of government then i feel that such a body is not a suitable candidate <e> <s> i have to be downright on that point on behalf of the government <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord winstanley made a persuasive case and my noble friend lord auckland has supported him <e> <s> i think it is right just to bear in mind that the select committee took the view which was accepted by the government that procedures for referral of complaints against non-departmental public bodies should be the same as for complaints against government departments <e> <s> the select committee made no recommendation that procedures for referral should be widened to include members of this house <e>", "<cs> it is absolutely true as the noble and learned lord says that in practice this amendment would do little more than formalise the current <e>", "<cs> with respect i am not entirely sure i agree <e> <s> that is why i added the last few words that the position in the health service as far as the health service commissioner is concerned is rather different from the position as far as the parliamentary commissioner is concerned <e> <s> the parliamentary commissioner covers a very very much wider area <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord winstanley for his intervention and also to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones who put three points to me <e> <s> the first was are the government really saying that the floodgates would be opened <e> <s> as i understood the noble and learned lord that was a fear in the mind of the government as they were legislating <e>", "<cs> i was there moving amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> the amendments of the noble and learned lord lord silkin of dulwich refer to the case where the commissioner is as he is at present holding all the positions in the person of one man <e> <s> the government amendments make clear that the commissioner not only can hold information jointly in carrying out his offices but may also use it <e> <s> i say that only because i rather slurred over the effect of the last part of our amendments <e>", "<cs> i shall look at what the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones has said on the matter before we come to the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for giving me warning of her intention to table an amendment regarding clinical judgment <e> <s> i am aware that this matter was debated at some length in another place and i was interested that it was not to be debated here <e> <s> my interest has been met with clarification because it clearly will be debated and the noble baroness has kindly so warned me <e> <s> i will endeavour on behalf of the government to be ready to reply on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble marquess i believe that the resources are sufficient <e> <s> the reason investigations take some time is that they are detailed <e> <s> the stages through which they need to pass were set out in the parliamentary commissioners annual report <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble and learned lord <e> <s> the parliamentary commissioner has reduced by about one month the time that investigations have taken during <e> <s> the parliamentary commissioner has said publicly that it is his intention to try to knock another two months off the average investigation time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first of all like to congratulate the noble lord lord carter on the speech that he has made this evening <e> <s> it was exactly the sort of speech which attracts the interest of the house for the noble lord has as many of your lordships have said a detailed working knowledge of agriculture and gave us the benefit of his knowledge in a speech which was closely argued and very interesting <e> <s> there was just a hint of politics without actually being political and it was certainly uncontroversial and yet authoritative <e> <s> the noble lord ended attractively on a severely practical note which i would guess is typical of him <e> <s> i certainly look forward to hearing the noble lord again in the near future and i know all noble lords who heard the noble lord speak this evening will agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness but her statistics and mine still do not coincide hers are very much higher than mine <e> <s> however perhaps we can agree on the fact that the number of complaints which have been rejected because the health service commissioner had found that they were solely in consequence of the exercise of clinical judgment have decreased over the last three years <e> <s> during the same period the number of medical grievances investigated by the commissioner has increased from three years ago to two years ago to last year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord ponsonby <e> <s> the noble lord has <e>", "<cs> my lords no one can accuse the noble lord lord fitt of rushing when he addresses your lordships house although it is always a great pleasure to debate with him <e> <s> in just a moment i shall attempt to reply briefly to the points which the noble lord has made <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may turn to the speech of the noble lord lord fitt <e> <s> making uncooked lamb products subject to clawback has an element of exclusion <e> <s> however it is all in the cause of protecting the sheep meat trade and the producers and consumers of northern ireland <e> <s> i assure the noble lord of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am particularly grateful to the noble lord for two reasons <e> <s> first it was good of the noble lord to say that not only from the point of view of the opposition front bench was he in favour of the levy but personally he voted in favour because every vote counted <e> <s> it was very important if i may say so that the poll went the way that it did <e>", "<cs> my lords let me just finish this point and i shall give way <e> <s> we set out in our manifesto the high priority <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is absolutely right <e> <s> they were indeed in those hands and they were inefficient and underfinanced which is precisely why we are going to privatise them <e> <s> i say to the noble lord and i am sorry to have to sound brusque because he was extremely kind to me across the floor of the house that we do not envisage that local authorities will have the power to run the water supply or sewerage operations in future because the shares in the companies will be offered to the public and not to institutions of local or central government <e>", "<cs> this is any land but it is for the purposes of the concessionaires <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that that was an unfortunate incident and we must try to see that it is prevented in the future <e> <s> i very much hope that the agreement which was reached at a meeting which was chaired by the test and county cricket board but which included also the police the government and indeed the pakistani embassy will lead now to an improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards consultation i feel sure that the test and county cricket board has been in touch with other people in the sporting world and has looked at what other sports have been doing <e> <s> this is a game with a distinctive character <e> <s> the parties that i mentioned were at the meeting <e> <s> indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend the lord president of the council i beg to move the second motion standing in his name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> some of my noble friends and the noble lords lord cornwallis and lord carmichael have argued forcefully that compulsory purchase compensation as a matter of principle is unjust if it is to be in favour of a commercial undertaking which is then going to benefit from the compulsory acquisition of the land concerned <e> <s> first of all i should like to make the point that this bill is applying the compensation code which so far as i know has been the law of the land for some time <e> <s> indeed it is the law applying to both commerical and non-commercial projects <e> <s> this amendment seeks to create a unique exception by providing for enhanced compensation for some but not all of the compulsory acquisitions authorised by the bill <e> <s> under the code the valuation by the district valuer with the right of appeal to the land tribunal is based on the market value of land namely the price a willing seller would realise on the open market in the absence of the development for which the land is being taken <e>", "<cs> i recognise that the channel tunnel and other major infrastructure projects will create strong pressures for development <e> <s> nevertheless local planning authorities already have powers to control unsuitable development and they are encouraged to apply them by well established national policies for the protection of the countryside as a whole to which the government remain firmly committed <e> <s> that is the nub of the answer which i give to both the noble baroness and the noble lord <e>", "<cs> we have already made provision in schedule paragraph of this bill for consultation with the local authorities and the london wildlife trust so that they can offer advice on the mitigation of the harmful environmental effects to which both the noble baroness lady nicol and the noble lord lord kilbracken have referred when

the noble lord was encouraged by what he found when he visited lundy island <e> <s> so far as his remarks concerning changing the law the government feel that although in these cases consultations are often protracted it is important to reach a consensus <e> <s> however i recognise the point that the noble lord makes <e> <s> accordingly we shall be in consultation with the nature conservancy

the bill i said in reply to the noble lord lord cornwallis that the government would take note of the views that had been expressed by the house <e> <s> i have come back to the house this evening to say that i can go further than that and that we will look further at the point which has been made <e>", "<cs> my lords on that point i am afraid that i cannot help the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords if the house will allow me and this is report stage and i am wholly out of order with respect to the noble lord lord mackie of benshie i think i replied to my noble friend lord stanley by saying that

pollution of the sea in the field of marine pollution specifically mentioned by my noble friend <e> <s> in the current year the department of the environment will be contributing towards the organisations annual running costs and exceptionally a further towards the international conference which it is sponsoring this october <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not possible to control the importation of waste until we have a transfrontier directive <e> <s> this we have not yet succeeded in obtaining <e>", "<cs> my lords the united kingdom continues to play a full part as a member of

report to which the noble lord is referring is still being considered by my right honourable friends department <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that is certainly yes <e> <s> however i should point out that as the crown suppliers operate as a trading fund it is possible that it is more appropriate for them to be in the private sector <e> <s> that is what is being considered at the moment <e>",

noble friend the undertaking that he seeks <e> <s> however i say to my noble friend that i think that both members of the government and also parliamentary counsel have heard clearly what has been said in your lordships house about the need for as much simplicity as possible <e> <s> i should add that i should not always ascribe the complexity of what we study in bills to the language of the draftsmen but rather to the complexity of the subjects with which the acts deal <e>", "<cs> my lords they are very important subjects and they all need legislative drafting <e>", "<cs> my lords the parliamentary counsels offices consolidation branch was of course transferred in on loan to the law commission <e> <s> under arrangements which have become firmly established the office now provides the commission with draftsmen normally on two years secondment for the drafting of law reform bills and consolidation bills and responsibility for the commission rests with my noble and learned friend

my lords the noble lord lord grimond missed the point made by my noble friend lord renton at the beginning of his supplementary question that as my noble friend said there are fewer parliamentary counsel today than there were when my noble friend produced his distinguished report in <e> <s> in fact i am not certain whether that is the case but i take it as i always do from my noble friend lord renton as being true <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree with my noble friends concluding remark that the revising role of your lordships house will continue to have a heavy burden placed upon it but i think we can take comfort from the fact that that means that your lordships house is absolutely necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that parliamentary counsel are treated certainly by junior <e>", "<cs> my lords i take what the noble viscount lord hanworth has said seriously but this of course is a dereliction of duty so far as the government are concerned and not neglect so far as parliamentary counsel are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the reasons are different <e> <s> there are six different reasons that have been ascribed to me ranging from retirement to some not being up to the required standard <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perfectly true as my noble friend lord broxbourne says that the office of the parliamentary counsel is operating in a competitive field <e> <s> obviously there is a certain amount of wastage from that point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i think that that falls a little wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what my noble friend has said <e> <s> the three bills concerned are the consolidated fund appropriation bill the finance bill and the british shipbuilders borrowing powers bill <e> <s> the first two bills are money bills which the house would not normally amend the british shipbuilders borrowing powers bill

"<cs> my lords i think there is no question but that from the available evidence the depletion of the ozone layer has a strong involvement of cfcs <e> <s> that is why the agreement of the montreal protocol is so important <e>", "<cs> my lords these are chemicals which contain chlorine atoms and halons which are generally found in fire extinguishers containing what is called bromine <e> <s> they are very stable in the lower atmosphere but once in the upper atmosphere they are broken down by the strong sunlight <e> <s> the release of chlorine and bromine can then destroy the ozone <e> <s> if the ozone layer is depleted its ability to filter out harmful ultra-violet light from the suns rays is reduced and that may be extremely dangerous in regard to cancer of the skin <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to consider what the noble baroness said but i think she has gone outside the terms of the protocol which refers to what is called consumption and production <e> <s> i do not believe that this provides problems of the kind which the noble baroness has put forward <e> <s> however i should like to consider what the noble baroness said <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with what the noble lord said at the end of his question <e> <s> our most up-to-date assessment shows that the montreal measures should reach the goal of preventing depletion of the ozone layer <e> <s> it is interesting to note that no single state which attended montreal went for a reduction of more than per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand my noble friends concern <e> <s> however he has inadvertently left out the fact that the european community has <e>", "<cs> my lords the short answer to the noble lord is that we were not prepared to reveal our negotiating position ahead of important negotiations to anyone not even to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords that of course is something in which the united kingdom is playing a leading role <e> <s> the available evidence has come mainly from united states and united kingdom scientists the latter being members of the antarctic survey <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sad that my noble friend feels that the united kingdom is dragging its feet <e> <s> with respect i do not think that that is the case <e> <s> we were one of the three members states who co-operated with the european commission in the negotiations for the protocol which has been widely recognised as being a major step forward <e> <s> we were the first european community country to ratify the vienna convention on research and the exchange of information

<e> <s> i beg my noble friend not to overlook <e>", "<cs> my lords if one buys an aerosol can without cfcs in it one wants to be extremely careful that it is not flammable <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment on storm damage in england on th and th october <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble baronesses for the welcome they gave to the statement <e> <s> the welcome is a guarded one as the noble baroness lady david said <e> <s> and no doubt both noble baronesses will want to look at the copies of my right honourable friends letter to the local authorities <e> <s> although the statement mentioned that

the first priority is to assess the damage <e> <s> the noble lords intelligence is as usual quite right <e> <s> the forestry commission has taken a look at what has happened by means of both aerial

meeting next monday th october <e> <s> when the results of the surveys are available which i am told will be in about two weeks time the commission will consider the best ways in which it might assist private woodland growers <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly pass on what my noble friend has said to my right honourable friends who are most immediately concerned <e> <s> obviously i take my noble friends remarks very seriously <e> <s> it is a question of timing <e> <s> i realise that my noble friend is talking about the hours immediately after the event occurred <e> <s> i draw to the attention of the house that the extent of the help from all of the services drafted in should be noted <e> <s> in the southern region additional men from the cegb the army and the navy were drafted in

has afflicted many parts of our inner cities and he said he wished to strike a positive note which he did <e> <s> he also showed that such blight need not be inevitable and that new life can be instilled into the inner cities <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i thank my noble friend lord windlesham and all noble lords who have taken part in the debate for what has undoubtedly been a very wide-ranging discussion <e> <s> inevitably when a debate covers such a wide <e>", "<cs> my lords i take that point from the noble baroness <e> <s> however if i may say so her intervention proves to me something that i have suspected during the whole debate namely that much as i enjoyed listening to the noble baroness she did not realise when the election was taking place a few months ago that things were beginning to get better in the manufacturing areas of the country <e> <s> they are not getting worse <e> <s> and people are in favour of a government beginning to look on the bright side of things and not constantly peering at the difficult side of things <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so the noble lord is being less than reasonable which is unlike him <e> <s> the noble lord made quite clear in his speech that what was being asked of my right honourable friend was the setting up of a forum <e> <s> it is in that <e>", "<cs> my lords normally i get along very well with the noble lord <e> <s> however at this hour and when the noble lord has not taken part in the debate perhaps he will forgive me for not pausing <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am not saying that at all <e> <s> i am saying that one of the good things about the forthcoming legislation is that the inner cities are on an absolute par with other parts of the country <e> <s> they will find that the governing bodies of

and the government on this <e> <s> in my first answer to the noble lords supplementary question i pointed out that the department of the environment is doing as much as it can through the estate action programme <e> <s> i also mentioned the question of empty property <e> <s> it is necessary to bear in mind that local authorities could look more imaginatively and positively at ways of bringing their empty stock back into use <e> <s> there are over such properties in london alone <e> <s> referring to the first part of the noble lords supplementary question the objectives which the white paper has set are important <e> <s> i believe that they can be achieved but let us see now what the bill is going to say <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first reply which i gave to the noble lord lord dean of beswick i made it quite clear that there is a very large amount of empty property both private and public which could help ease the pressure <e> <s> i did not distinguish <e> <s> so far as a private members bill in another place is concerned i think we had first better wait and see whether it comes to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mellish did make two points and i endeavoured to respond to that debate <e> <s> i have drawn those points to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble and learned lord about the subject but i have not seen the bill <e> <s> the noble and learned lord would be the first to advise me that i would be rash to say that i agreed on behalf of the government with the drafting of a bill which i have not yet seen <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall be most grateful to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate which we have just had shows that your lordships are at one in appreciating that we have been dealing with a bill which is not only of local interest for all in east anglia who are

refers <e> <s> it is however a fact that my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary for state met staff and union representatives last week and is now considering all the available

the chairman of the sports council specifically dealt with the first point asked by the noble lord in his supplementary question <e> <s> my honourable friend said that we needed to look at how we can among other things alleviate social deprivation <e> <s> the letter goes on to read <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to look at what my noble friend has said and draw it to the attention of my honourable friend the minister for sport <e> <s> this is essentially a matter for local government but clearly it is an important point <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has put forward a point of view <e> <s> however the rules of the football league prevent a single individual from having any involvement in the management or administration of more than one club <e> <s> that is a matter for the league to enforce or if the noble lords view prevails to change as the league thinks best <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the point raised by the noble lord and that policy has brought many sports facilities to both young and old over the past to years <e> <s> however i believe that the answer to the noble lords question is sponsorship <e> <s> in that regard the news is good the contribution of private sponsorship to sport has been growing rapidly in recent years and it currently totals approximately million <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that question goes a little wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no definite information as regards the present negotiations for sponsorship of the fa cup <e> <s> sponsorship arrangements are commercial decisions for the sponsorship company the football authorities and individual clubs <e> <s> the drink industry is one which has a long and successful history of sports sponsorship and it has made a significant contribution to sport <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so in all friendliness to the noble lord i think that is one of the most extraordinary suggestions i have ever heard <e> <s> a letter which starts off by saying that we have shared objectives in trying to improve the nations health to alleviate social deprivation and to help to promote excellence in sport is surely a letter which all of us can agree is a good letter <e>", "<cs> my lords most bills go through several drafts before publication each of which is subjected to critical examination by the legal <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the force of the question which my noble friend asks <e> <s> the difficulty with much legislation undoubtedly arises from the complexities of the subjects which they cover <e> <s> however

lordships will know perfectly well that through the committee system of any government my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor my noble and learned friend the lord advocate and the english law officers as well have the opportunity to scrutinise and raise points about a bill in that committee system <e> <s> in practice my right honourable friends whom i have mentioned will normally always have seen a bill before it comes to a committee so that any points of interest to them will already have been settled <e>", "<cs> my lords again i recognise the importance of what the noble and learned lord is saying <e> <s> i shall certainly draw the attention of my right honourable friends who are concerned in these matters to what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> perhaps i may add one more point <e> <s> in talking about an additional constraint or supervisory process on the parliamentary draftsmen the noble and learned lord will forgive me if i remind him of the following point <e> <s> in the noble and learned lord then speaking as lord chancellor pointed out in an answer to a parliamentary question that the drafting recommendations of lord rentons report are taken <e>", "<cs> my lords the legislative burden of your lordships house is indeed heavy <e> <s> i suggest to your lordships that constraints of time imposed by the parliamentary programme have however been a feature of legislation of all governments <e>", "<cs> my lords i was endeavouring in my first supplementary reply to suggest this <e> <s> the particular question which is being raised by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale is covered at present by the scrutiny which my right honourable friends and my noble and learned friends undoubtedly give to bills by seeing the bills before they reach a particular committee <e> <s> it is also covered by shaking out any points of interest in departmental discussions <e> <s> to go down the road which the noble and learned lord is suggesting would consume enormous amounts of time <e> <s> i reckon that that was the reason why it was relinquished <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend is referring to legally trained members of your lordships house who look through the drafting of bills very carefully all i can say is that i think that whatever happens there will always be a pretty full-time occupation for the revising work of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords the desirability of having somewhat shorter and simpler legislation is something that we should all like to see carried out but it is a desirable objective which i am afraid is not always achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords on th july in answer to a parliamentary question i reported to the house that the number of parliamentary draftsmen was being increased

emissions from their peak than many members of the per cent <e> <s> club will be able to show <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that appears in my original answer <e> <s> our record before was much better than that of most other countries <e> <s> but the club rules do not count that <e> <s> it is true that the federal republic of germany is spending more than we are but so far as i know it is

cutting sulphur and nitrogen oxide emissions from existing power stations between now and <e> <s> with new stations the figure could well rise to billion <e> <s> i am also glad to say that we have agreed with our european colleagues on the vehicle emissions directive which has recently been agreed in the environment council of the european community <e> <s> that is also important for the damage

foolish to try to answer a hypothetical question of that kind <e> <s> all i would say to the noble lord lord dean is that the relevant clauses clauses and and i think clause as well give a fair crack of the whip so far as contract work or what is called functional work is <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes a fair point <e> <s> if may say so there is an answer and no doubt we shall go on batting it across the floor of the house <e> <s> i have among my papers a long questionnaire which has to be filled in before one ever gets to the tender procedure <e> <s> it comes from leicester city council <e> <s> having read that questionnaire i take the view that this makes it very difficult indeed for a contractor to get in and compete with a direct labour organisation <e> <s> for that basic reason we feel that we need to open up this work to competitive contract and then at the end of the day by all means let the best man win <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly check up on that <e> <s> but it is for the precise reason that i very carefully said it is the clear and consistent advice that i have received that quotas of the kind we have been talking about this afternoon are illegal under european community law <e> <s> i have to say that i checked again this afternoon <e> <s> if i find that i have made any mistake i shall certainly write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is referring particularly to the local authority warden services i am speaking from memory but i believe there are about such services at the present time <e> <s> the money is being found and can indeed be found i should have thought for expansion in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the first motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lord lord diamond is that this is a matter which has been agreed through the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords it is fair to say that these exchanges promote better understanding between both government and the private sector promote personal development of the person seconded and introduce into both government service and the private sector people with particular skills and experience <e> <s> in answer to my noble friends supplementary question i can say unreservedly that the civil service has benefited from these arrangements <e> <s> i am sure that other organisations have also found them of great value <e>", "<cs> my lords the build-up of the scheme has been good <e> <s> the scheme as we know it started in <e> <s> in the past eight years the numbers have more than doubled if one takes the secondments between the government service and industry and commerce and the secondments between government and other organisations notably such organisations as the health service and local government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord and i heard my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter also saying hear hear to the fact that these secondments go back a very long way <e> <s> as the schemes exist at the moment the conventional secondments last about one or two years and are to enable a man or a woman to go to do a job for another organisation or to come in to do it for a government department <e> <s> these range from higher executive officer level to grade which is what used to be called assistant secretary <e> <s> there are the short-term attachments called the whitehall and industry scheme which are for about grade and then there are some non-executive directorships which are for more senior management in the civil service at grades to <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right that there clearly are dangers in the interchange scheme <e> <s> great care is taken to ensure that conflict of interest does not arise when civil servants are attached to other organisations <e> <s> similarly when businessmen are seconded into the civil service care is taken to see that they are not put into positions where they would have access to sensitive <e>", "<cs> my lords if one takes the secondments between government and industry and commerce in the latest date for which i have figures there were outward secondments and inward secondments of people coming in from industry and commerce <e> <s> that represents an increase of per cent <e> <s> over the previous year <e> <s> in the same year there were very nearly secondments to or from other organisations typically health and local government organisations of which were outward and were inward <e>", "<cs> my lords that goes a little wider than the original question and is something that i should draw to the attention of my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not been advised that that is the case <e> <s> if i find that in any way i am misleading my noble friend in saying that i shall certainly write to him <e> <s> it is perfectly true that the broad arrangements that i gave in answer to a previous question that normally the department pays for individuals sent out and will pay for the services of people coming in with no diminution in pay is the basic rule <e> <s> in addition to that and flowing from my noble friends question there are certain arrangements that have to be made concerning national insurance superannuation and so on <e> <s> in preparing for today i have certainly not been advised that those other arrangements are inhibiting <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can say to the noble lord is that the government are concerned to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of information at all times <e>", "<cs> my lords in a sense i have replied to the noble lord lord molloy on that point <e> <s> perhaps i may add to what the noble lord lord mishcon said in that it would be better not to probe too deeply into this because it goes very wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord would not expect me to comment on any individual case <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i take seriously the point made by the noble lord <e> <s> this is in fact wide of the original question but that does not detract from its importance <e> <s> perhaps i may go back to my orginal answer to the noble lord lord molloy <e> <s> quite genuinely this government as all governments have been are concerned to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of information <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot possibly improve on the question of the noble lord lord mellish <e>", "<cs> my lords i do indeed take seriously the exchange which we have had across the floor of the house but i do not think that i should repeat the answer to the first supplementary question which the noble lord asked me <e> <s> i do not believe that i can improve upon the original answer that i gave to him <e> <s> all civil servants are under an obligation to keep the confidences to which they become privy during the course of their work <e>", "<cs> my lords that is characteristically wise advice <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that that entirely appeals to me much as i have enjoyed the exchanges this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that an humble address be presented to her majesty in the terms set out on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies to the noble baroness perhaps i may remind your lordships that there is important business to which we must return <e> <s> perhaps it would be the wish of the house to take the noble baronesss question and a question which i know was coming from behind me and then call it a day and return to the legal aid bill <e>", "<cs> my lords it is precisely because i know that other noble lords wish to ask questions that i ask what the house would like to do <e> <s> let us take the next two questions and we shall know whether your lordships wish then to return to the legal aid bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord cledwyn and lord diamond for their reception of my right honourable friends statement in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may take the last point first <e> <s> i should have thought that the united states would look with some approval on agreement which has been reached by the member states of the community for something which is legally binding and which is going to last for the next four years <e> <s> if i may say so my noble friend very rarely forgets anything when he is making any mathematical computation but i think that in this case he may perhaps have forgotten exports <e> <s> the community heads of state have taken into account in the figures which the noble lord has just given to the house the fact that there will be up to about million tonnes of exports of cereals <e> <s> that i think puts in context the agreement for the million tonnes maximum guaranteed quantity <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer to the second and third questions of the noble lord lord carter and the point about set-aside are matters to be thrashed out over the next few months so far as the details are concered <e> <s> i do not deny that the noble lord like all farmers wants to see certainty but there are details which still have to be fixed and although the amount of community contribution to set-aside and the amount of premium which farmers can expect has been settled over the last weekend by the council there are to be settled details of set-aside and details of the last question which the noble lord asked me <e>", "<cs> my lords if your lordships will forgive me i must stick with what i said to my noble friend <e> <s> if one takes a maximum guaranteed quantity <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord opposite and also i believe my noble friend were both talking about the increase in size of community stocks <e> <s> the answer to that is the one which i gave to the noble lord opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords it will go up as a result of this agreement over the weekend but it will remain below the level of the present ceiling <e> <s> i repeat that i believe that that is a remarkable piece of negotiation on behalf of this country <e> <s> i also remind the noble lord opposite and i believe it is a reasonable point to be made in view of his remarks about stocks going <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> it is indeed the case that the increase in prices of food has historically gone up below the rate of the retail prices index <e> <s> i am glad that my noble friend made that point which is fairly familiar but which has not been made before this afternoon and is an important one <e> <s> with regard to the first point i never criticise the treasury but i am glad that my noble friend put in context the statistics which the noble lord opposite put to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord gladwyn knows almost better than anyone in your lordships house the ways of europe and of the community and the difficulties particularly in the situation which the heads of state found themselves some of them facing elections in their own countries and all of them facing difficult decisions which had to be taken for the good of europe in reaching agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords if i am wrong i shall write to the noble lord but on coming into the house my understanding was that the effect will be on this years market but coming into effect as regards prices in the next marketing year <e> <s> if i am wrong about that i shall immediately write to the noble lord and place a copy of the letter in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord cledwyn and lord diamond for their reception of my right honourable friends statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord cledwyn said there is a case for reform and i agree <e> <s> although there have been very good examples of improvements in civil service efficiency nevertheless we must look back years to the fulton report which was accepted by the labour government of the day to see that fulton recommended that principles of accountable management should be introduced into the civil service and recommended also further study of hiving-off functions as a means of ensuring accountable management <e> <s> so although todays statement is an important one it is not exactly revolutionary <e>", "<cs> my lords ministers will continue to account for all the work of their departments including the work of agencies <e> <s> the rights of honourable members in another place to question ministers and to hold them to account will not change <e>", "<cs> my lords our intention is for agencies to be allowed some flexibility on terms and conditions for service within the framework set by the responsible minister though obviously there will need to be controls to safeguard public expenditure <e> <s> the degree of flexibility can differ from agency to agency depending on the requirements of the job to be done and that is a very old expression <e> <s> that goes back to fulton <e> <s> staff and unions however will be consulted in the normal way if any change in terms and conditions of service is contemplated <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not as revolutionary as all that <e> <s> it is an attempt and i believe that it will be a successful attempt to follow on from what fulton recommended as along ago as years with regard to improving management in the civil service <e> <s> we are talking about jobcentres and unemployment benefit services which offer a comprehensive service to employment seekers <e> <s> we believe that these are promising candidates as the statement says for agency status <e> <s> there will be proper consultation <e> <s> however we believe that this is right <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter to which we should return <e> <s> there will be proper consultation <e> <s> i am anxious to underline the fact that the list of executive functions which look to be promising candidates for the first agencies have not yet been subject to final decisions <e> <s> nonetheless what i said in answer to the noble baroness stands <e> <s> at the same time the noble baroness had made clear her concerns on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the genesis of this in many ways goes back to fulton <e> <s> there are quite clear recommendations to distinguish those within departments whose primary responsibility is planning for the future from those who are responsible for accountable management <e>", "<cs> my lords i have answered such a question earlier <e> <s> they will generally be within the civil service <e> <s> those who are will be responsible in the same way as all other civil servants <e>", "<cs> my lords i have answered the question about the timescale <e> <s> i have told the noble lord lord cledwyn that i cannot give him any exact timescale <e> <s> however matters will proceed based first on the list which has been placed with copies of the report in the library of your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that the noble lord reads the report <e> <s> he will see then that relocation does not form part of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords we intend to proceed now to implement the proposals in the way that i have explained <e> <s> but there will be opportunities for the views of those who wish to comment to be taken into account as the programme for establishing the agencies proceeds <e> <s> we welcome consideration and discussion of these matters by the select committees <e>", "<cs> my lords it is important that i should say at what is probably the end of this exchange that the report prepared by civil servants on secondment from their departments records that many people in the civil service wish to see a move in this direction <e> <s> the report recommends a move in the direction which the government wish to see as a matter of policy <e> <s> the strides made in the past within the civil service have been undoubted and have <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter that we must consider when the bill arrives <e> <s> all that i have said this evening spells out good news for the north of a kind that we have not seen and cannot see under the present rating system <e> <s> i believe that all i have said will be good for the inner city areas not only for those places that i have picked out but for many other areas with difficult inner city problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i must continue <e> <s> perhaps i may answer some of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to answer the noble and learned lords point <e> <s> the government are preparing and will announce in due course a policy to succeed the governments dispersal <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to your lordships for taking part in this debate <e> <s> it has been interesting <e> <s> it has well illustrated the close attention that your lordships always pay to the water industry as part of our concern for wider environmental matters <e> <s> although some of the points that have been put to the government have not been uncritical this has been a short debate that has shown a depth of knowledge and experience of the water industry and of the power industry which would not necessarily have been matched elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall correct myself in a few moments if i am misleading the noble lords <e> <s> my memory is quite clear that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment made an important speech early in the election campaign during which he made absolutely clear the governments position as regards intended water privatisation <e> <s> early in my opening speech i covered the ground which in effect was covered by my right honourable friends speech in may of election year <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord williams of elvel is reading from my partys manifesto <e> <s> i am delighted to see that the noble lord sees fit to have a copy of the manifesto on the bench beside him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> i am mistaken as to what the noble lord was reading out <e> <s> i remember that document very well <e> <s> an important consultation document it was followed by a second document just before christmas <e> <s> that led us through to the position in which we find ourselves today of having a paving bill which will lead towards the main privatisation proposals that we have not yet reached but that will need to be the subject of privatisation bills <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may look again at the point made by the noble viscount <e> <s> if i have missed anything i shall write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to consider any points that noble lords put to me <e> <s> however i must make it clear to your lordships house that i accept absolutely what my noble friend lord young of graffham has said by way of answer to your lordships <e> <s> among the answers that my noble friend has given is that there are precedents to be found in legislation <e>", "<cs> perhaps the government should accept some of the responsibility for the confusion which has arisen because we offer the groupings to the other whips offices <e> <s> there is a difficulty in ensuring that the numbers of the groupings reach individual peers <e> <s> however stopping short of that fact the groupings which we sent to the other offices this morning made it clear that having disposed of amendment no <e> <s> which accompanies amendment no <e> <s> the next grouping would be and <e> <s> that would mean that amendments nos <e> <s> to have been disposed of <e> <s> however with respect to the chair amendments nos <e> <s> and in the opinion of the government have not been disposed of <e> <s> therefore i think that the noble lord lord peston is right <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee <e> <s> i now understand what the deputy chairman is saying that is that amendments nos <e> <s> and simply fall because they have been cut out of the text of the bill <e> <s> in that case i withdraw what i said <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may from the point of view of the government and of the committee point out that it is not a question of procedure <e> <s> it is a fact that amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the right reverend prelate the bishop of london has removed the words which are the subject of amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> with the best will in the world there is nothing members of the committee on either side can do about that <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say to the noble baroness that that is a little less than fair <e> <s> it is a very well established rule of the house which the noble baroness and i know perfectly well that if an amendment is agreed to and in this case it is amendment no <e> <s> which removes words from the text and puts other words in then it is not possible to move an amendment which relates to the words which have been removed <e> <s> that is a fairly simple principle <e>", "<cs> let us be absolutely clear <e> <s> the words to which amendments nos <e> <s> and relate have been removed from the text because they have been removed by amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if the noble lord lord peston and my noble friend lord joseph wish to put down the effect of amendments nos <e> <s> and they will need to relate those amendments to the text as it is now revised <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter for the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand corrected <e>", "<cs> my lords i take seriously what the noble lord is saying <e> <s> it is obviously for the convenience of your lordships house to have some idea how late the house will sit <e> <s> perhaps we may take that issue away and consider it further <e> <s> i would not wish the noble lord to think that i was dismissive of this point in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> among a large sheaf of papers i have a spendid answer to both the noble lord and to my noble friend lord teviot <e> <s> if the noble lord will forgive me for just one moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord and to my noble friend because this is an important point <e> <s> we are particularly concerned about the proposals to require passenger transport authorities to raise their funds by making a levy rather than a precept on their member district councils <e> <s> i assure both my noble friend and the noble lord opposite that all we are proposing is recognition of the fact that the ptas are effectively a joint venture by the individual boroughs <e> <s> the precepting arrangements would allow them to continue to distance themselves from the ptas <e> <s> the levy arrangements will ensure that the boroughs become clearly accountable for their share of the costs of the ptas and we hope that that will make them more accountable for the decisions of their representatives on the ptas <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give the noble lord the assurance for which he has asked in his second question <e> <s> on the first point which arises from the noble lords second question our position is clear <e> <s> the united kingdom remains committed to unscr for free and fair elections <e>", "<cs> my lords we set no precondition for the implementation of security council resolution but we realise that the south africans are unlikely to co-operate while the cubans remain in angola <e> <s> therefore as a practical matter we support the approach of the united states on this <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount <e> <s> the only trouble is that there are some people who are stretched out flat <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say that the noble lord is doing less than justice to the united states talks <e> <s> i understand that they were businesslike and constructive and that all at the talks stressed their desire for an early settlement with and this is the answer to the noble lords specific point cuban troop withdrawal and implementation of the united nations security council resolution as the basis for it <e> <s> i believe that negotiation is the only way to solve the future of namibia and this has been quite a valuable step forward <e>", "<cs> my lords the right reverend prelate is absolutely right that since the passing of united nations security council resolution there has not been much of consequence to see although there has been a great deal of work <e> <s> however we should bear in mind that these talks were attended by united states south african angolan and cuban representatives <e> <s> i believe that they reached a very hopeful agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the leader of the opposition for his support <e> <s> i also thank the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> in fact i have not repeated the announcement <e> <s> i have made it <e>", "<cs> my lords all three noble lords who have spoken the noble lords lord shackleton and lord houghton and my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter made suggestions which have led to at least something being done <e> <s> although i realise that all three noble lords feel that this is only a modest step forward i am grateful to them for what they have said about what my predecessor my noble friend lord whitelaw and i have done in trying to do something in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may write to the noble lord and also put a copy of the letter in the library <e> <s> for my own benefit the simplest way i can describe the change is that the allowance is specifically aimed at helping peers who have to work during recesses and is intended to meet costs over and above those which can be met from the allowance claimed in respect of attendance on sitting days <e> <s> claimants will be required to certify a separate claim form that these criteria have been met <e> <s> i shall send the noble lord a letter and place a copy in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords on that note perhaps i may say thank you to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> we have had a long debate on the amendments which i believe turn on two issues <e> <s> the first is whether there is any longer a justification for retaining a single authority for inner londons education service <e> <s> the second point is whether the service can be transferred successfully to the inner london boroughs <e>", "<cs> i shall come to the question of the inner london boroughs in a moment <e> <s> however the point which the noble baroness neglects is that for some unexplained reason the level to which i have referred is over twice the average throughout the whole of the rest of the country <e> <s> that includes liverpool manchester newcastle birmingham and the other great conurbations <e> <s> we also know that one in four of all children who leave schools at the end of their compulsory schooling in inner london do so without any qualifications <e> <s> i put it to the noble baroness that those figures are worse by a ratio of two to one than the figures for any other part of the country <e>", "<cs> i should like to reach the end of the sentence all measures if i may say so which will <e>", "<cs> the answer was embedded in the remarks which i have just made <e> <s> whether or not the noble baroness likes the local government finance bill the whole idea of revenue support grant when we come to introduce it and i know that my noble friend lord caithness will have a good time explaining it to the noble baroness is that it will apply to the needs of the boroughs in london as it will apply to the needs of local authorities outside london <e> <s> the exact details under which the revenue support grant will work have still to be worked out but i can say to the noble baroness that i reckon that the way in which the revenue support grant work will be very much akin to the way in which the needs element of the gre works at the present time <e>", "<cs> the right reverend prelate has asked me a question and the answer is very simple <e> <s> as i observed at the beginning of the debate and as my noble friends said in their speeches that may be the case but we have reached the point at which in view of falling standards and increasing costs it is not in the interests of the children of the capital to go on as we are doing <e>", "<cs> my lords the full implications of the recent south african government actions in this respect are not absolutely clear <e> <s> i should like to make it clear that the united kingdom government would regret and oppose any curtailment of aid programmes <e> <s> we have made strong representations to the south african government on this point both bilaterally and jointly with our colleagues in the twelve <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the implication of my noble friends question <e> <s> the government believe that sanctions are ineffective as a means of ending apartheid and would stiffen the resistance of those who oppose change <e> <s> we also believe that the punitive sanctions that have already been imposed have failed to hasten reform have reduced external influence and indeed have strengthened those who we believe are unhelpful in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords first question asks about the south african government cutting off peaceful avenues of political change <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that frustration and despair breed violence <e> <s> we very much deplore what the south african government have been doing in relation to the matters referred to in that part of the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords we are moving a little wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> perhaps i may content myself in answer to my noble friend lord lauderdale with saying that the united kingdoms record with regard to southern african states and the assistance we give to them is very good indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords officials meet anc representatives from time to time as necessary <e> <s> the question of further meetings with ministers at present would be entirely hypothetical <e> <s> the noble lord did not mention this but i should like to make the point that these contacts which we have at official level do not mean in any way that we therefore agree with the views of the anc <e> <s> i must repeat to the noble lord that the views of the united kingdom government on sanctions are quite clear <e> <s> i have given them today in answer to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords i made it clear in my original answer to the noble lord lord hatch that it is the objective of the united kingdom government and i assume of all noble lords that there should be the early and complete elimination of the deeply repugnant apartheid system but by peaceful means <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that when the noble lord comes to look at the first part of the question which he asked he may regret it <e> <s> as regards the second part i think it goes wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most interested to hear what the noble viscount says after having visited south africa and seen it at first hand <e> <s> i do not wish this morning to go further than the original answer which i gave to the noble lord lord hatch <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the point which the noble lord made towards the end of his remarks we should be willing to implement a ban on imports of coal from south africa if a consensus could be reached among the community partners <e> <s> the reason why ministers from this bench have been giving consistent answers is that there is no alternative to working for peaceful change through dialogue and negotiation <e> <s> change we believe must come from within <e> <s> we do not think that there can be a quick or easy solution <e>", "<cs> my lords maybe not <e> <s> nonetheless it is a course around which we go frequently <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> we give aid to the occupied territories through our bilateral programme though the european community and through our contributions to organisations such as the united nations relief and works agency <e> <s> in the european community decided at the united kingdoms instigation to grant palestinian producers preferential access for industrial and agricultural produce <e> <s> we have repeatedly urged the israelis to allow implementation of these arrangements in line with a signed undertaking which they gave in december <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> commissioner cheysson is active in this matter as the noble lord says and the united kingdom certainly supports the activities of the commissioner <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can add to the answer which i have just given to the noble lord lord mayhew <e>", "<cs> my lords although i quite understand why the noble lord asks this question negotiations on all these matters need at the first instance to be bilateral <e> <s> of course we are interested particularly as a member of the european community but first and foremost bilateral negotiations are most important <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly there is no need if i may say so for the united kingdom to look into it <e> <s> the community made a demarche to the israelis on st march <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mayhew said in his supplementary question there is continuing activity through commissioner cheysson <e> <s> if we can unlock this problem the community will certainly try to do so <e>", "<cs> we cannot all speak at once <e> <s> perhaps i may suggest that the speaking order should be first the noble lord lord stallard secondly a noble lord from the cross-benches and thirdly a noble lord from my own benches <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for giving me notice of possible savings to be made by the use of mercury services some of which my noble friend has put before me <e> <s> as i have said in the light of the advice from the ccta and once detailed proposals have been put forward by mercury the appropriate committees of the two houses will

house <e>", "<cs> my lords the simple answer which i also needed to know is that we would not need two sets of lines <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> it is most important that i should say to my noble friend that that could not be the case <e> <s> as your lordships will appreciate the palace has a single exchange and a single unified telecommunications system <e> <s> it would not be practical for the two houses to proceed independently of each other <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a useful exchange <e> <s> perhaps it will be the more useful if before we conclude i say that i was wrong in replying to my noble and learned friend lord hailsham <e> <s> as he probably apprehended but he was kind enough not to take me up on it the offices committee of your lordships house would have to report to the house and that report must be agreed by your lordships house <e> <s> that would be the constitutional position <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perfectly true that technically that could be the case <e> <s> however constitutionally the two houses have co-operated together for many years in administering the joint system and they have devised benefit from such co-operation <e> <s> i like to believe that the two houses will wish to continue with that system <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i ought to make crystal clear the danger that we are in <e> <s> we have no rules in the house about the frequency of questions <e> <s> however if we continue to table the same questions which will elicit the same answers the house will eventually be driven into a position where it will find itself having to ask the procedure committee to implement a rule about the frequency of questions and a mechanism for enforcing that frequency <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord does not wish to drive us down that road <e>", "<cs> my lords no i understand that <e> <s> nevertheless the noble lord tabled a question which was bound to elicit the same answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> i am suggesting that it will increase the direct interest of people who will be paying the community charge <e> <s> i do not know whether they will then go and cast a vote as a result but i am suggesting that at the present time that direct interest is not to be found as perhaps it ought to be and that there is not that spur which i think desirable <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is habitually very fair in her remarks so let me put it straight to her <e> <s> she is not right in saying that we are speaking of the very poorest people who live in the inner city areas <e> <s> the example which the noble baroness gave me related only to people who live in the very highest spending inner london boroughs to be found in this country <e> <s> if i may say so to the noble baroness for the reasons i have just given it is not an accurate <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord caithness agreed to take the point away and to come back on it <e> <s> my noble friend who has been in charge of the bill was very ready to do that <e> <s> let me finally ask members of the committee opposite to take on board this point <e> <s> my noble friend lady carnegy of lour was realistic and i think had a point when she said that our proposals will mean that whatever area people live in those who are on low incomes will have a direct interest in their local authority spending policies as will everyone else <e>", "<cs> i quite understand the concern of the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe <e> <s> i entirely accept what the noble lord says that the needs of glasgow are greater than the needs of other areas <e> <s> the government say that this will be the criterion under which the per cent <e> <s> of the contribution towards the spending on local services will be based in other words in deciding what the government rate support grant of the future will be <e> <s> therefore when the noble lord says to me that there will be problems for instance in glasgow because of need my answer is that the noble lord may well be right and this will be taken into account specifically by the government subvention system in the future <e> <s> it has been said again and again on this bill <e>", "<cs> in listening to my noble friend lord bellwin my feeling was that he had very much in mind that this amendment runs directly contrary to the way in which income-related benefits work <e> <s> my other noble friend who spoke in this short debate lord renton pointed out that age limits are something of a legal fiction <e>", "<cs> i apologise to my noble friend for interpreting him in a way which would not have redounded to my own case <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for reminding me in his last words that when one has age limits they tend to be arbitrary <e> <s> in his earlier remarks i remember him saying that presumably the ages of and are arbitrary as regards retirement benefits <e> <s> there are reasons and some age has to be fixed <e> <s> is it unreasonable to have this particular age in the social security system <e> <s> in passing the social security act the intention of parliament was that in calculating income-related benefits account ought to be taken of a claimants personal circumstances <e> <s> this is because the financial needs of a single -year old are likely to be different from the needs of a married couple with children <e> <s> in turn they are likely to be different to the needs of a physically handicapped pensioner <e>", "<cs> which makes different assumptions about the needs of people according to their circumstances <e> <s> there is a second and a very important point <e> <s> the noble baroness lady jeger is saying hear hear in other words i believe she is suggesting that i am saying something which is hardhearted <e> <s> perhaps i may show a little compassion <e> <s> let us be absolutely clear a person who is under out of work or wholly dependent upon income support will receive exactly the same benefit as someone over <e> <s> in other words he will receive the per cent <e> <s> rebate <e>", "<cs> the government announced in april that the taper for community charge benefit would be per cent <e> <s> which means of course a reduction of p in benefit for every of extra income above the relevant limit <e> <s> previous examples of rebates and estimates of the number of people who would benefit from rebates had assumed a taper of per cent <e> <s> which is the figure which now applies to rate rebates <e> <s> in bringing forward that proposal the government were making an improvement on the rate rebates that people get at the moment if their income so allows <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> would remove the power of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services in the annual subsidy order to make adjustments to community charge benefit subsidy to allow for circumstances which the normal rules do not fit <e> <s> it also removes the power to make deductions from subsidy so as to exclude items which it would be unreasonable to meet out of money provided by parliament for subsidy purposes <e> <s> what it would not do is to require subsidy to cover per cent <e> <s> of benefit paid <e> <s> the noble lord made it clear that he was aware of the high percentage in benefit at the moment and wanted to know whether that would be carried through to the new arrangements <e> <s> the provisions which the amendment seeks to remove are not those that will be used to determine the rate of subsidy <e> <s> their purpose is very specific and they are essential to ensure that authorities in special circumstances do not receive either too much or too little subsidy and to prevent abuse of the system <e>", "<cs> i can give the noble lord an assurance that the principles will indeed be comparable to those which are now used for housing benefit <e> <s> i hope that what i have said is helpful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the noble lord lord cledwyn the critical point is the number of what are called starred amendments meaning that they were tabled on friday but were not printed until today <e> <s> i was most anxious to see the marshalled list to discover where the starred amendments fell <e> <s> it is fair to say that when one looks at the marshalled list one sees that almost all of them are to be found in the second half of the marshalled list <e> <s> in other words the starred amendments will not be taken today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to hear what the noble baroness said in her last few words <e> <s> this as i have said is a very large bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to say that this is not the first time your lordships house has seen a very long bill and it is not the first time that your lordships house has had to sit late <e> <s> in fact i believe that the handling of the bill both from the government and from the opposition and other front benches and indeed from the back benches as well has been exemplary because it is a very large bill indeed <e> <s> but to come to the noble baronesss point we shall indeed do our best to see that we do not sit too late but that does mean an effort on behalf of us all <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to admit to the noble baroness lady seear that it is indeed in my hands because <e> <s> together with the chief whip i am responsible for the management of business in your lordships house <e> <s> i shall not try to duck out of that at all <e> <s> they are two major bills <e> <s> the government wish to see them on the statute book and that is something we are determined to do <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am sorry to hear the noble lord say that <e> <s> so that there is no misunderstanding we are talking about a batch of amendments which the noble lord mentioned in his first intervention which sounds very large indeed <e> <s> the noble lord had every right to raise that matter but in looking at the detail one sees that a large number of the amendments fulfil undertakings given in committee and a very small number only a dozen are substantive amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that perhaps we must now terminate this exchange <e> <s> let us start the business to see how long the amendments take <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is putting the same point to me as my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i shall certainly look at the interval <e> <s> however i must make one thing clear <e> <s> there has been talk about rushing the bill through that is not the case <e> <s> the interval between the end of the report stage tomorrow and the day which has been put down for third reading recognises what is supposed to be the intervals between report and third reading stages <e> <s> i make no secret of the fact that the government have a very full timetable and therefore to alter a timetable is much easier said than done <e> <s> the timetable has already been booked in the diaries of many people and i also have to admit that it is most <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house obviously my noble friend feels deeply about this point <e> <s> although i do not think it will be especially helpful to the house if i repeat what i said previously nonetheless i shall do so in the space of one sentence <e> <s> in putting forward their programme on this point as my noble friend rightly said the government are observing the customary intervals <e> <s> although changes in those intervals might suit some members of the house they may well not suit others <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my regret to both the noble lord lord cledwyn and the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead about any personal inconvenience that that may cause <e> <s> indeed i am aware of two particular front bench spokesmen for both the social and liberal democrats and noble lords opposite who not only have worked exceedingly hard on this bill but have also worked throughout the whole of last night and for whom this is not convenient in fact it is not convenient at all <e> <s> i should like to say that i am extremely sorry about that <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall check that and shall get in touch immediately with the noble lord <e> <s> however that is not the information which i have received <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> provided that the bill appears on monday that gives two and a half days for consideration of the bill as amended and for the tabling of amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord finally asks why the third reading cannot be deferred to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls for his generous personal remarks <e> <s> i simply content myself with saying that there is no question but that we have a very large bill which has had a large number of amendments <e> <s> that is exactly what this house is all about but in this case it has placed a considerable strain on the machinery and that is why i have made a statement today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that we are making much progress <e> <s> shall we simply content ourselves with saying that there has been a great deal of debate on all sides of the house and for that reason the government gave one extra day on report and now we are giving two extra days interval before third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect the noble lord is not on to a good point <e> <s> the noble lord says that the house is receiving legislation very late and that that among other things is causing intolerable strain <e> <s> this busy session is remarkable for having received legislation in very good time <e> <s> the last of the main government bills due to come here has now arrived and that of course is the housing bill which arrived this week <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord cledwyn of penrhos and lord jenkins of hillhead for their reception of my right honourable friends statement which i have repeated <e> <s> the noble lord lord cledwyn specifically said that he thought it was disappointing that no definite policy was set out as regards the combating of terrorisim drug trafficking and organised crime <e> <s> perhaps i may make it clear that there is no doubt that the heads of government all want the removal of all obstacles to freedom of movement <e> <s> however the european council has consistently maintained that the means of achieving that objective must be consistent with the fight against terrorism and drug trafficking <e> <s> its conclusions reaffirm that commitment <e> <s> although that may not be quite the detail that the noble lord wants i believe that the affirmation of that principle is very important indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords it is important for me to make the point in answer to the noble lord that the summit which the prime minister recognised in her tribute to the presidency as workmanlike i reiterate what the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead said in this respect concentrated on two main areas <e> <s> these are mainly the subject of the statement which i have repeated and mainly also the subject of the questions i have been asked from the opposition front benches progress towards the completion of the single market by and arrangements for progressively closer economic and monetary cooperation in europe <e> <s> therefore all the other questions which the noble lord has put to me interesting though they are are to that extent subsidiary <e>", "<cs> my lords my short answer to that question is yes <e> <s> caution will certainly be our watchword <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not catch the subject to which my noble friend attached his question <e> <s> if he was attaching it for example to the main issues which are the subject of the statement i recognise that the question is very important <e> <s> unanimity of course plays a part <e> <s> would the noble lord like to clarify that point <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may then have the luxury of picking out the issue which i think is of great national interest <e> <s> that is the area both noble lords on the front benches opposite asked me about namely monetary co-operation <e> <s> i should like to make it absolutely clear if that is the issue we are talking about that the single european act itself states that <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the prime minister always states government policy when speaking in another place <e> <s> perhaps i may make it clear that my right honourable friend was party to the setting up of the working group <e> <s> nonetheless the deliberations of the working group can proceed in looking at important practicalities in the area of monetary union without having to enter the area of a european central bank or a common currency <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is anything that i can add to what i have already said <e> <s> a working group has been set up the president of the commission is in the chair and very distinguished people will take part in the group <e> <s> they will report back through the finance ministers <e> <s> i think we ought to wait until we hear from the finance ministers on this particular matter <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be that the statement says nothing about that subject but that is for the very good reason that the governments position remains the same as it has always been <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may reply very quickly to the noble lord <e> <s> i think it is important that i should underline the fact that the united kingdom joins with all colleagues in the community in wanting to see liberalisation of the market within europe that is what is all about <e> <s> it applies to the point put to me by the noble lord concerning the movement of people <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord uncharacteristically is being a little less than generous when he refers to my right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> my right honourable friend has led this country to play a leading role in europe <e> <s> it is not a question of going into europe we are in europe and we are playing a leading part in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason order is being called is that there is a paragraph in the <e>", "<cs> my lords in his supplementary question my noble friend draws a distinction between straight commerce and broadcasting <e> <s> in reply i would say that the government see scope for greater co-operation and efficiency in broadcasting but also attach importance to its social and cultural dimensons <e> <s> we seek to create an enabling framework for wider choice but without detriment to programme standards and quality <e>", "<cs> my lords the position at the moment is that the home office has lead responsibility for the constitutional regulatory financial and international aspects of broadcasting policy <e> <s> in this respect i do not think i would want to add to the answer which i gave to my noble friend lord buxton <e>", "<cs> my lords there is nothing between my noble friend lord renton and i in the view which my noble friend and the government take of the way in which the home office discharges its responsibilities <e> <s> as to the original answer which i gave to my noble friend lord buxton of alsa i do not think i can add to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i gave only a partial answer when i read out the lead responsibilities of the home office <e> <s> the department of trade and industry is very much involved with spectrum planning and telecommunications <e> <s> the dtis radio communications division also acts as technical adviser to the home office on broadcasting matters for which the home office has responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the governments intention to bring forward a white paper on broadcasting within the next few months <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that my noble friend has asked that question because the government want to see greater competition and choice in broadcasting and welcome the prospect of additional programme services <e> <s> however such matters as which services should be authorised when and subject to what kind of regulation need to be considered in the round and in the light of the latest advice on technology <e> <s> we shall certainly be addressing all these matters in the forthcoming white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so nothing i have said today indicates at all that public service broadcasting in this country will be altered in the sense that there are obligations on the bbc <e> <s> with the prospect of additional programme services there are however important questions to address about the future content and style of regulation across the itv sector <e> <s> once again these are important matters which we shall address in our forthcoming white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another question and i wonder whether on that point i might write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the easiest way for me to answer that point is to say that the government cannot second guess the broadcasting authorities in carrying out their responsibilities for programme content <e>", "<cs> my lords that again is a machinery of government question which is why i am answering these rather difficult questions today <e> <s> i do not think there is anything i can add to what i originally said to my noble friend lord buxton of alsa <e> <s> the noble lord lord glenamara will have to be content with that <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i am right in saying that sir jeffrey sterling is a special adviser at the department of trade and industry <e> <s> many people are interested in discussing the wide range of issues currently facing broadcasting <e> <s> i think it is nothing but helpful to have an open debate on these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may thank those noble lords who have responded to the motion as well as the noble baroness and the right reverend prelate <e> <s> i should also like to associate myself with the thanks which have been given by your lordships to my noble friend lord pym and the other members of your lordships house who were on the tercentenary advisory committee <e> <s> they <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will forgive me for interrupting but the <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been very refreshing to have a short <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the house for the reception it has given to the motion <e> <s> i am especially grateful to the noble and learned lords on both sides of the house for the remarks which they made <e> <s> it will be for the select committee itself to determine its terms of reference and it will take into account the point which the noble lord lord monson has raised <e> <s> the motion next week on composition will be moved by the lord chairman of committees <e> <s> i commend this motion to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the apology has been accepted and now is the moment to move on to the next business <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate on the amendments follows an amendment moved by the right reverend prelate the bishop of london at the committee stage of the bill when concern was expressed about balloting procedures for testing whether parents wish to apply for grant-maintained status for their school under the bill <e> <s> the debate which we are having concerns the government response which i put forward at the beginning of our debate to the concerns expressed by your lordships as regards the dual balloting arrangement set out in the amendments <e> <s> i am grateful to the right reverend prelate for his support which was qualified by questions he asked <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble earl lord halsbury and the noble lord lord goodman who vied in claiming the parenthood of this set of amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may just refer to the effect of section <e> <s> the definition of parent includes a guardian and every person who has the actual custody of the child <e> <s> in some cases a child may therefore have more than two parents it is true <e> <s> but governors will not have to examine parents credentials <e> <s> only if a question is raised as to a parents eligibility to vote will the governing body have to reach a decision <e> <s> it will be able to look despite the difficulty it is giving to the noble lord to section <e> <s> that section incidentally has been guiding governing bodies in deciding who can vote for parent governors of schools for a few years now since some previous legislation by the present government was passed through both houses <e>", "<cs> my lords it means in effect that the burden of proof in such cases will be on the person claiming to be a parent <e> <s> it will certainly not be necessary for the governors to go looking for parents as some noble lords have suggested <e> <s> the amendments also provide that parents should have days in which to check that they are on the list once it has been formally decided that a ballot should be held <e>", "<cs> my lords my answer to that question is a resounding negative <e> <s> however let me give a rather more satisfactory reply to the noble lord <e> <s> a point was raised by the noble lord lord morton about what would happen if a difficult time was selected for the balloting procedure for instance with christmas coming <e> <s> on that point governors will need to plan ahead <e> <s> the guidance which will be sent out by my right honourable friends department will ensure that governors have to plan ahead <e> <s> the provisions of this bill allow him to require a fresh ballot if the secretary of state is not satisfied that reasonable procedures have been followed <e> <s> so in meeting the point which the noble lord has put to me let us always remember that at the end of the day there is the decision of the secretary of state and it has to be reasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords a period of time had to be selected <e> <s> quite obviously there is a need to maintain momentum so that people remember what it is all about <e> <s> there has already been the run-up to the first ballot <e> <s> leaving another fortnight until the second ballot appeared to the government to be a reasonable period of time to put to another place and i put it now to your lordships house and yet a period of time in which the issues would not be forgotten <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> to the lords amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i have already spoken to these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do not insist on their amendment no <e> <s> to which the commons have disagreed and do agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend asked me a question but i think it would perhaps be best if my noble friend and i had a word outside the chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall certainly announce the date of the state opening of parliament as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords to conclude this matter the procedure for making a personal statement is always available to my noble friend lord jenkin of roding <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government do not now propose to make a statement about that judgment <e> <s> it is being studied and considered with care and my right honourable friend the home secretary made a statement to that effect on the same day as the judgment <e> <s> copies of my right honourable friends statement have been placed in the library of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always ready to reply to a question put to me by the noble lord the leader of the opposition <e> <s> however if the noble lord wishes to raise specific issues they ought to be raised through the normal procedures which are open to us all <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly draw the attention of my right honourable friend the prime minister to this exchange <e>", "<cs> my lords i should make clear that on an amendment on report the recommendation of our own procedure committee is that noble lords should not speak after the minister has spoken <e> <s> there is a proviso to that which is that the recommendation does not apply if noble lords wish to put short questions for elucidation or where the minister has perhaps spoken early to assist the house and it is necessary for him to speak again <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps if i may say so we ought just to see how the noble lord lord hylton goes <e> <s> however i beg the noble lord to remember the words which i read out from the <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter for the house <e> <s> i felt it right to remind the house that it agreed to accept the recommendation of the procedure committee to spend minutes on questions following a statement <e> <s> the matter will arise again when the order is laid <e> <s> i think that it is a question for the house now to decide whether after minutes it has had enough <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me i am putting the matter to the house <e> <s> if the noble lord continues and finds that the house does not want him to do so then we are in difficulty <e> <s> i beg the noble lord to bear in mind the fact that we have a long day ahead of us <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter for the house <e> <s> i made a suggestion to your lordships and i explained why i made that suggestion <e> <s> may i repeat that i think perhaps the moment has come with a long day ahead of us to go on to the next business <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do not insist on their amendment no <e> <s> to which the commons have disagreed for the reason numbered <e>", "<cs> my lords before i come to that point i first of all thank my noble friends lady gardner and lord colwyn for taking part in this debate because there is one aspect which is symptomatic of your lordships house that is the expert knowledge and a consistency of attitude to subjects which we consider are matters of principle <e> <s> i respect both my noble friends for the line that they have taken even though am in the position of not agreeing with them <e>", "<cs> my lords let me take that point absolutely head on <e>", "<cs> my lords privilege is a matter for another place <e> <s> how we respond to privilege is a matter for this house <e> <s> i have attempted to advise your lordships and i now again recommend to your lordships that we do not insist on this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it may assist your lordships if i say just a few words early on in this discussion <e> <s> it occurs to me that the issues in relation to this group of amendments are very similar to those we have just debated <e> <s> another place has voted for the second time in favour of charging for eye tests which would enable about million a year to be spent on improvements elsewhere in the health service <e> <s> in that way it is the same issue as the one we have just debated and decided <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend who keeps a close eye on the matter knows more about the speed with which monitoring statistics are received <e> <s> i stand absolutely by the assurance i gave to my noble friend <e> <s> we would monitor and sample as well <e> <s> as the statistics came in should the evidence require it we would reconsider any aspects of the arrangements <e> <s> it is an assurance given in good faith and it would be carried out by the government <e>", "<cs> <e> <s> my lords may i suggest that we listen to the contribution of the noble lord lord wyatt who was about to get in when my noble friend spoke <e> <s> then i suggest we listen to the noble lord lord kilmarnock then possibly my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter and then see how we go from there <e>", "<cs> my lords at the end of a long debate during which there has been a good deal of disagreement there is one issue upon which all noble lords are agreed <e> <s> it is that unquestionably the national health service as we know it today we are all interested in it for different reasons and although meeting together on one issue today we shall all make use of it at one time or another <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i seemed to be trying to cut out my noble friend and i am glad that we have had an opportunity to hear him <e> <s> the first point i should like to make at the end of this long debate is that although clearly my noble friend lord mottistone and the government do not agree on this issue i believe that there is one matter with which all your lordships would agree that is that the health service as we know it today constantly needs more and more resources <e>", "<cs> my lords we have spent the whole afternoon debating whether money should be contributed to the improvements of primary health care services by asking people who can afford it to contribute towards the cost of dental and eye <e>", "<cs> although noble lords opposite do not like that therein lies a difference <e> <s> it is that the blanket exemption which the noble lord seeks this afternoon is not appropriate <e> <s> what is appropriate and here i agree with him is that help must be available to those who are in need <e> <s> twenty-five per cent <e> <s> of all pensioners are on income support which incidentally was uprated only days ago and accordingly they will automatically qualify for free sight tests under the bill as it stands <e> <s> anyone who relies solely on the basic state pension will be covered by this as will those who are of pensionable age who are diabetics or glaucoma sufferers or have a near relative who suffers in that way <e> <s> the amendments made in another place will enable us to start a scheme to help people who are a little above the income support level <e>", "<cs> my lords on merits and in terms of relations between the two houses i do not think that the noble lord is being reasonable in this amendment <e> <s> i ask your lordships not to agree to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the first proposition put forward by the noble lord <e> <s> as regards the second proposition there was a debate in your lordships house on th february and my noble friend lord ferrers set out the position for the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with what my noble friend said <e>", "<cs> my lords as my original answer said the security services make an invaluable contribution to our security and freedom and will continue to do so <e> <s> the government believe that there are no grounds for instituting a special inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord molloy asked me a question as is his right and i have given him an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to the noble lord and this is one of the occasions when i will not give an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords that supplementary question does not entirely arise from the question <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon is right in that the appointment was made and so far as i know the appointment is valuable and valued <e>", "<cs> my lords these matters were fully dealt with in a statement made by my right honourable friend the prime minister in another place on th may last year <e> <s> the statement was repeated in your lordships house by my noble friend lord whitelaw and i have nothing to add to that statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words about the session which lies before us <e> <s> the gracious speech contains a programme which promises to be vigorous and wide-ranging including as it does some major bills <e> <s> a number of substantial measures will be introduced in your lordships house <e> <s> tomorrow my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor proposes to introduce the children bill <e> <s> in the coming weeks the road traffic bill the companies bill and the football spectators bill will also be introduced here as will some other smaller measures including a miscellaneous provisions bill on the law of property <e> <s> however the fact remains as my noble friend lord colnbrook reminded us that this is a full programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the noble lord lord aberdare be appointed to take the chair in all committees for this session <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the noble baroness lady serota be appointed principal deputy chairman of committees for this session <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that the prime source of information from the government is and should remain statements and answers to parliament but the lobby system of unattributable briefings supplements that flow of information <e> <s> i remind the noble lord that it is welcomed as i understand it by the press <e> <s> as regards the second part of the noble lords question my answer is that i do not agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble lord the leader of the opposition <e> <s> it is interesting to note that in todays edition of <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord if he would like to give me a specific case i would find it easier to answer <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the second part of the noble lords question i would say that i did not know about that incident <e> <s> i deprecate that that should have occurred <e> <s> the answer to the first part of his question an important question i think is that yes indeed it is the case that two newspapers do not attend the no <e> <s> briefings <e> <s> however i understand that those two newspapers are nonetheless ready to receive non-attributable briefings by government departments and others <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that that is a highly desirable step <e>", "<cs> my lords i take on board what my noble friend says <e>", "<cs> we take questions from the official opposition and the liberal democrats <e> <s> after that it is a question of whether somebody on my noble friends side of the house or the side of the noble lord lord walston speaks <e> <s> i think that on this occasion it is the turn of the conservative benches and then the sdp <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that what arises from the noble lords question to me this afternoon is a query as to whether the arrangements and the procedures in your lordships house for dealing with a private notice question in another place and informing the house are working properly <e> <s> i believe that they are <e> <s> as i have said as is customary in this house it was offered through the usual channels to be repeated as a statement and the decision was made that it was not wished for <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will forgive me <e> <s> my noble friend lady macleod has reminded the noble lord that we are on report <e> <s> technically the noble lord is not in order <e>", "<cs> my lords i did give an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much doubt whether the noble lord is right is saying that <e> <s> certainly i shall not be so imprudent as to comment on his question <e> <s> there are two cases in which there is a no harm test <e> <s> if he is referring to the one involving members of the intelligence and security services i should point out that i shall come to that case in a moment <e> <s> however i should like the noble lord to look at clause in order to see the reference made in my speech namely that it is a welcome point in the bill that someone who had no reason to know what it was that either he or she disclosed should not be penalised <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that the anxieties of the noble lord lord molloy are relevant to this question <e> <s> the fact is that the government are enabling individuals to take back responsibility for a whole range of activities in for example education and training home ownership and also share ownership <e> <s> that is good and we believe it is right <e>", "<cs> my lords government policy will be debated by your lordships on th april <e> <s> i think that we had better wait until after my noble and learned friend on the woolsack has given the governments statement in that debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i was at pains to explain to the noble lord lord molloy in answer to the <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that the less that goes into secondary legislation the more provisions have to be written on the face of bills consequently the legislative programme is heavier <e> <s> your lordships house the revising house needs to be vigilant and i know that it always is in considering secondary legislation <e>", "<cs> that depends my lords it has happened on occasions <e> <s> it is very rare indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords quangos have been considerably reduced in numbers <e> <s> there has been a per cent <e> <s> decrease since <e> <s> where new legislation has limited the powers of local authorities it has generally done so in line with government policies in order to protect the interests of ratepayers and incidentally to regenerate our inner cities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i have mentioned education and housing but there is the whole area of deregulation <e> <s> there have been three white papers the latest of which is entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very surprised that the leader of the opposition takes the point about non-elected public bodies because as i said earlier the number of non-departmental bodies has decreased by per cent <e> <s> since <e> <s> whenever a new such body is considered we try to resist proposals unless they can be clearly demonstrated to represent the most appropriate and cost-effective solution <e> <s> i shall not repeat what i said previously about the powers of local authorities <e> <s> from this box i have always tried to recognise the importance and the responsibility of local government <e> <s> however there are certain cases where the responsibilities of local government have been criticised <e> <s> for example later in this session the widdicombe proposals and the local government and housing bill will come before your lordships house <e> <s> they will clearly do something about certain local government powers about which widdicombe believed something ought to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords the local government finance act which is now on the statute book makes it clear how local government is spending its money and ensures that those paying for local government expenditure can see how local government is spending its money <e> <s> we believe that that is a step forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess to my noble friend that in my noble friend that in my darker moments i agree with <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord hutchinson is referring to my noble and learned friends green paper on the legal services <e>", "<cs> then let me pick out that particular green paper and say to the noble lord lord hutchinson that i believe that my noble and learned friend is conducting his consultation absolutely splendidly <e>", "<cs> my lords i would be the last person to claim that as regards legislation our watch-word should be never mind the quality feel the width <e> <s> the government are endeavouring to legislate on important matters during the present session <e> <s> we shall try to do so in as sensible a way as possible and we shall try to listen to what is said in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> we know as the speech made by the noble lord lord hemingford shows that there is disagreement in the chamber as regards this first amendment at the committee stage of this bill <e> <s> when we had the second reading of the bill i believe that there was wide agreement in all parts of the house that the law on official secrets is in a very unsatisfactory state <e> <s> that is because section of the act penalises the disclosure of any official information however trivial and irrespective of the harm that it is likely to do <e> <s> the attempt to try to find an alternative dates back to the report lord franks made in <e> <s> six years later the labour government published a white paper that followed closely the recommendations of the franks committee and in particular its proposal that when there was to be a test of the harm that an unauthorised disclosure would cause a minister would certify that the test had been met <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon skilfully endeavoured to drive a wedge into the arguments that have come from this side of the committee by making the point that it would be absurd as the noble lord saw it when a member of the security services was talking let us imagine to the minister with responsibility for the security services and there was trouble as a result of that conversation <e> <s> thus the member of the security services could be accused of an absolute offence under clause but the minister would find that he had the benefit of having a harm test under clause and <e> <s> when we come quite soon to the amendments on the marshalled list dealing with notification i think my noble friend lord ferrers will be saying that it is certainly the governments intention that a minister of that kind will be notified and will therefore fall under the bracket of clause <e>", "<cs> this is a matter to which we shall come in a little while <e> <s> it is quite important that as in another place in this house we put on record the governments intentions about notification precisely for the reason that the noble lord has given me across the table <e>", "<cs> i hope i can persuade members of the committee that this amendment is unnecessary inasmuch as it would apply to disclosures by crown servants and government contractors who are not members of the security and intelligence services whose disclosures are therefore already covered by a harm test <e> <s> more importantly i hope i can persuade the committee also that it would not be consistent with the introduction of the offence in clause nor would it be right to introduce a defence that a disclosure by a member of the services was of information that had already been made public in some form but that is ground we have already covered <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> i may have been guilty of not getting across the point <e> <s> on the first amendment the government are saying that where there is a test of harm evidence of previous publication is certainly not excluded from consideration <e> <s> on the contrary i said that it might be highly relevant <e> <s> however it cannot be conclusive <e> <s> it is because amendment no <e> <s> is seeking to make it conclusive that the government do not like that amendment <e>", "<cs> the amendments proposed by the noble lord lord hutchinson would completely remove from the bill the category protecting material received in confidence from another state or international organisation <e> <s> first of all although in moving his amendment the noble lord referred to these matters as mere breaches of confidences the government feel very deeply that we need to protect foreign confidences in the way proposed by clause in order to provide the protection of our criminal law in the interests not of other countries but of this country <e> <s> i like to think that the harm test makes that clear <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord harris of greenwich expressed surprise that i had used what the noble lord called <e> <s> apocalyptic language concerning the leaking of foreign confidences <e> <s> the reason for that and the answer were given by no less a member of the committee than my noble friend lord home who gave not one but two examples of occasions when foreign confidences had been of the most enormous importance <e> <s> my noble friend gave two historic examples where there would have been great jeopardy if leaks had occurred <e>", "<cs> we have not strayed at the moment into classification <e> <s> obviously the whole question <e>", "<cs> we have not <e> <s> i shall gladly do so as something separate in a moment or two but perhaps i may continue <e> <s> the noble lord lord harris at one time worked in the foreign office <e> <s> he expressed surprise at the beginning that it seemed that all kinds of information was being given out to the press <e> <s> i think the noble lord ought to read the second line of clause which makes it clear that the clause deals with matters that are revealed without lawful authority <e> <s> presumably when the noble lord was working in the foreign office he was witness to information being given to the press with lawful authority <e>", "<cs> if the committee will forgive me i should like to make my position clear <e> <s> i hope that on behalf of the government i have made the position crystal clear <e> <s> with all the experience that he has i should like to believe that this is the view of my noble friend lord home and also of the noble lord lord hankey <e> <s> i have tried to make clear to the committee the fact that the government deeply believe that in addition to general information relating to international relations we also need to protect material which as i sought to explain we call foreign confidences <e> <s> i shall not cover that ground again <e> <s> if that is the case it must be covered somewhere in clause <e> <s> we have covered the matter in clause b which the first of the amendments tabled by the noble lord lord hutchinson seeks to knock out of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble lord lord hutchinson rose to his feet again and perhaps the committee will allow me to speak once more <e> <s> i am afraid that what the noble lord said shows a complete gulf between his words and what the government have said <e> <s> the noble lord put two main points to me <e> <s> first he repeated and it is true that i had not picked up the point before but i do now that this will be a charter for everything under the sun to be marked confidential <e> <s> we are not talking under foreign confidences about this country giving security markings <e> <s> the provision relates to information which is confidential because of the terms on which it was obtained from other countries <e> <s> if the document is not received on those terms then it is not covered by the particular category <e> <s> therefore that point is easily disposed of <e>", "<cs> if i may say so i think that we should bear in mind that this is an area where parliament has already established a clear statutory framework in the interception of communications act <e> <s> further this chamber is at present in the process of establishing some further aspects of that statutory framework by means of the security service bill <e> <s> the reason i started my reply by stressing that point is that if the noble lord lord hutchinson will forgive me for saying so he is to some extent treading over ground which has been very well trodden and recently trodden in the interception of communications act <e> <s> i say that because the framework which we already have in place recognises the vital nature of the powers about which we are talking and because their effectiveness depends upon absolute secrecy about how and when they are used and about what information they produce <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> but with great respect to the noble lord they are on the face of the statute <e> <s> the effect of this amendment is to begin unravelling the law as we have it <e>", "<cs> although i recognise that the noble lords lord monson and lord hemingford have understandable concerns we are treading very much the same ground as we trod on earlier amendments <e> <s> the points that have been put undoubtedly require an answer and perhaps i may say first that i hope it is some reassurance to the committee that the bill does not unnecessarily inhibit action taken on the matters referred to in the amendment namely serious and imminent threats to public health or safety <e> <s> i hope i can persuade the committee that there is no need to introduce a general defence for something for which the bill creates no general offence and which in most circumstances it will <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to recognise that my noble friend has taken all reasonable steps to try to resolve this matter informally before bringing it before the house <e> <s> indeed if i may say so he has shown the patience of job <e> <s> i wish to thank him for that <e> <s> i should also like to thank my noble friend for recognising that both the clerk of printed papers and indeed the post office itself particularly in his area have been trying to get to the root of the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that the house has had a good go around the course and that we should now return to the companies bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so the noble lord is making a perfectly fair point <e> <s> however so am i i am saying that technology has meant that staff can be removed from doing what has been absolutely routine work to doing the very important work of examining cargoes and gathering intelligence <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give the noble lord no undertaking this afternoon but i shall draw to the attention of my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that my noble friend would expect me to give details of particular cases <e> <s> the advice given has always been kept confidential because of the need to protect the prerogative of the crown <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say that the final question asked by the noble lord the leader of the opposition is somewhat wide of the original question <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will not think that i am being deliberately unhelpful when i say that i do not think that i can add very much to what i said to my noble friend lord onslow in answer to his supplementary question except to say that my right honourable friend the prime minister has always scrupulously adhered to the arrangement first <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that my noble friend is right in that assumption <e> <s> the choice has never been unlimited as there can only be a limited number of suitably qualified candidates in any given case <e> <s> the arrangements introduced in were designed expressly to ensure that there was a more complete appraisal of the available candidates <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has given a very interesting point of view but once again it falls fairly wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords my remarks about the prerogative of the crown apply even more resoundingly in answer to my noble friends supplementary question than to previous questions <e> <s> however i repeat that my right honourable friend the prime minister has made it clear on many occasions that she has always scrupulously adhered to that agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add to what my noble friend lord ferrers and the noble lord lord houghton have said <e> <s> what happened about half an hour ago was that amendments which were moved by my noble friend lord renton were replied to by my noble friend lord ferrers <e> <s> both my noble friend lord renton and the noble lord lord mishcon on the opposition front bench felt that they did not agree with the government reply <e> <s> my noble friend lord ferrers then said that he would look into the matter <e> <s> however the noble lord lord mishcon quite understandably said that it was no good looking into the matter because the bill was now about to embark on its bill do now pass procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords i now beg to move that the house do adjourn during pleasure for half an hour exactly <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is right that as leader of the house i should report to your lordships what was discussed during the brief adjournment which we have had <e> <s> my noble friend lord ferrers and i met those of your lordships on all benches who were interested in a particular point which was raised by amendments moved by my noble friend lord renton at third reading of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords at the same time i must apologise to your lordships that my noble friend lord young of graffham is not present at the moment <e> <s> as a result with my apologies to the house i beg to move that we adjourn during

noble friends lord young and lord strathclyde are now present <e> <s> with my apologies to the house for rising to move the motion i should like to ask leave to withdraw the motion that the house do adjourn during pleasure for five minutes <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord williams of elvel will support me in withdrawing that motion <e>", "<cs> i do not want to cut other noble lords out and i cannot possibly do so because we are in committee <e> <s> however we have been discussing this amendment for two hours <e> <s> it might be convenient if i were to say a word from the government front bench towards the end of the debate <e> <s> it will then be a matter for the committee as to how we proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will be good enough to glance at what i said when we have <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend the parliamentary under-secretary is answering very well on behalf of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house it may be convenient if i repeat a statement about the future of the gurkhas which is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their response to my right honourable friends statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord irving was if i may say so absolutely right that much of what the house of commons defence committee recommended is picked up and fulfilled in the statement which i have just repeated <e> <s> the noble lord asked whether there were any points which the government are not accepting <e> <s> there are recommendations in the house of commons defence committee report about the dharan base in nepal and the british hospital there <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may answer the noble and gallant lord lord bramall <e> <s> i am most grateful to him for his generous words about the effect of the statement <e> <s> the noble and gallant lord particularly appreciated the flexibility in the statement <e> <s> yes indeed it is the case that the statement allows for expansion if demographic trends require it <e> <s> however i simply emphasise that the basis of this statement is not related to demographic trends it is made for all the reasons that the noble and gallant lord and others have given this afternoon namely that these fine soldiers will be needed within the mainstream of the work of the british army in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i shall see that the views that have been expressed in your lordships house this afternoon are drawn to the attention of the brigade of gurkhas <e> <s> i know that there will be widespread satisfaction in that quarter at what has been said in this house this afternoon <e> <s> as regards brunei i can confirm that one battalion will continue there <e> <s> this is an agreement with the sultan and it is reviewed periodically <e> <s> we see value in a continued presence <e> <s> i shall not go further than that this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i know that that

the withdrawal of that battalion has not come and it will not arrive until at least <e> <s> decisions will not have to be taken on that matter until some time next year <e>", "<cs> i recognise the commitment to the cause of family life of noble lords who have spoken this afternoon in this debate <e> <s> however <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will forgive my saying so for a moment perhaps he ceased to listen with his customary attention <e> <s> i said earlier that the law is that the secretary of state must review the <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble lady i thought the same before this debate <e> <s> however family credit unless there are exceptional circumstances has to go to the mother <e>", "<cs> my lords the european elections on th june were to elect members of the european parliament <e> <s> in the general election in the government were re-elected and the government will pursue policies for which they then received a mandate <e>", "<cs> my lords the same conclusions as i believe my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter draws namely that it is not appropriate to use the european parliamentary election in order to ask general questions on domestic policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the answer to that question must be the same answer that i originally gave to the noble lord lord dean of beswick <e>", "<cs> my lords i take on board the experience and wisdom of my noble and learned friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say that the last three elections have been in the middle of the summer and we have not done too badly <e> <s> however i give the noble lord the leader of the opposition an assurance that there will undoubtedly be an opportunity for your lordships to discuss those european matters following the council meeting in madrid <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord talks of the people of scotland having their case deployed in europe <e> <s> i remind the noble lord lord grimond that in the european community the united kingdom since the last euro election has taken a leading part in securing a substantial reform of community finance and making real progress towards the completion of the single market <e> <s>

those representing the people of scotland in the european parliament will do likewise <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed there is no reason and therefore i agree with my noble friends question <e>", "<cs> my lords fewer supporters of the conservative party went to the poll than we might have hoped <e> <s> however as i said to the noble lord lord grimond i believe that we have been following the right policies and that in the end they will prevail <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that at fountainebleu my right honourable friend the prime minister secured a lasting and equitable arrangement as regards the contribution from this country to the community budget <e> <s> had it not been for that the figure quoted by the noble lord would have been much higher <e>", "<cs> my lords my admiration for the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe in managing to raise the issue of proportional representation while discussing this question is only exceeded by my admiration for the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon who manages to raise the issue of community charge <e>", "<cs> my lords before we go on with the debate could i just say one thing <e> <s> i realise that when we have a reasoned amendment of this kind at this stage of our discussion of one of the biggest bills i have ever seen feelings run high <e> <s> however i beg noble lords in all parts of the house to remember that while we jealously guard our own rights in this house regarding remarks of a personal nature made in another place so we ought to have an eye to our own standing orders <e> <s> our own standing orders are absolutely explicit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord cledwyn and the noble baroness lady seear for their responses to the statement of my right honourable friend <e> <s> the noble lord lord cledwyn appeared to be concerned that she had made considerable concessions at this european summit which he felt would reflect adversely on her <e> <s> it was a great step forward to have a european council which took practical first steps on economic and monetary union a progressive realisation towards which has been an objective of both the noble lords party and mine over the past years or so but sensibly went no further without proper study which is a matter that has been agreed by all <e> <s> it was something for which my right honourable friend the prime minister worked very hard <e> <s> to be able to fix job creation as the very top priority of the social dimension was a second great step forward and something for which my right honourable friend again worked very hard <e> <s> if one looks at the foreign press as well as our own one sees reports of a constructive and positive approach by my right honourable friend at this important council <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness but i should make just one point <e> <s> her majestys government did not ratify the social charter as my right honourable friends statement makes clear <e> <s> the statement says that the main reason why the secretary of state for employment was unable to accept the conclusions of the june social affairs council was that we believed that extra burdens on industry which are inherent in the social charter would make the community less competitive and the refusal was confirmed in madrid <e>", "<cs> my lords i was most interested in the intervention of my noble friend on that point <e> <s> he congratulates my right honourable friend on the caution over moving so that there is no automaticity between stage and the other stages of the delors report <e>

this council but is also being quite adventurous in the way in which we have led the way in the abolition of exchange controls in the way in which we have <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to assure the noble lord lord stoddart that i know that anything my right honourable friend the prime minister said she would intend to stand by <e> <s> but i ought to make clear in reply to the noble

never happen in that particular way <e> <s> it is precisely for the sort of reasons that my noble friend puts but for other reasons as well that we have made a statement which my right honourable

this particular statement nonetheless i draw the attention of the house to what i said just now to the noble lord lord stoddart <e> <s> serious work was undertaken at madrid next steps were agreed and i have outlined what those next steps are <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lords reference is to the view of her majestys government on the wishes of the delors committee so far as stages and were concerned not to the statement which my right honourable friend made so far as the exchange rate mechanism was concerned <e> <s> i think it would be tedious if i went over the ground as to why the government were highly cautious about stages and and reached a unanimous agreement that there should be no automaticity between stages and <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are starting to go over the ground again <e> <s> i assure the noble lord lord bruce that there is no difficulty about the aim of progressive realisation towards economic and monetary union which has been under both

<e> <s> however i believe that it is very important that i should say on behalf of her majestys government that when i say that we are committed to progressive realisation of economic and monetary union exactly what form that is to take is to be the subject of further study by the council the commission the committee of central bank governors and the monetary committee <e> <s> there is no automaticity and i repeat no automaticity between delors stage and other stages <e>", "<cs> my lords that would have to be pursued through the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> we have

she generally intervenes very skilfully <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that i am going over the same ground but if my noble friend lord long moves the motion for the adjournment that motion can then be spoken to <e> <s> we shall not conclude until the noble lord has satisfied himself that he has said what he wishes to say and has received a reasonable answer <e> <s> it is just a question of having a motion before the house <e> <s> unless a motion is moved neither the noble lord nor any other noble lord ought to be speaking <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble baroness lady jeger was perhaps uncharacteristically less than fair when at the beginning of her remarks she referred to the governments attitude to debates which took place on the bill <e> <s> of course the noble baroness took a leading part in those debates from the opposition front bench <e> <s> before i leave the point i would just say to the house that my noble friend lord skelmersdale arranged meetings with noble

that as the bill reached its last stages <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so to the noble lord the leader of the opposition i do not believe that it would be appropriate for me to attempt to look behind the wording of the reason <e> <s> but i am advised that exactly these words about which the noble lord is questioning me have been used in the past in such a way as to give the hint of

two and a half times greater than it was years ago and of course it was taken out of taxation in <e> <s> i believe that all those things are good <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with the noble lord <e>

title of the bill <e> <s> however as he knows this house very well he will probably know better than i that it is quite within the powers of any party to change the scope of a bill <e> <s> that is frequently done or attempted by noble lords in different parts of the house <e> <s> i believe that the house would direct very old-fashioned looks at a member if he were trying to change the relevance of the bill <e> <s> however a change to the scope of the bill was required which made a change to the long title necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to make one further comment <e> <s> the noble baroness is always fair in such matters <e> <s> she is a doughty opponent and we respect her for that <e> <s> she made one simple but important point <e> <s> it is that although i have claimed truly that the number of government amendments are few they are substantial <e> <s> they are of the following nature <e> <s> first there is a small group of half a dozen amendments which has an important effect <e> <s> they deal with a major change to the industrial training boards and at second reading my noble friend lord trefgarne gave notice of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall consider the request but i believe that the answer is no <e> <s> throughout the past or minutes we have been talking about industrial training boards <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to open up the area of training commissions it is his right <e> <s> however i believe that we have reached the moment when the house wishes to decide whether to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords the government were concerned to emphasise that there would be national coverage when the new rivers authority and the new curriculum were being set up <e> <s> it is true that in both cases the proposals did not apply to scotland <e> <s> i regret the misunderstanding that my noble friend indicates has existed <e> <s> the problem may be that we lack a term to describe both england and wales when we are talking about them and not about scotland or northern ireland <e> <s> however it was made clear both in the drafting and presentation of the bills concerned and when the debates were taking place that the term did not include scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says that it was imposed <e> <s> it was the subject of a bill which received the approval of both houses of parliament <e> <s> for each subject so far being considered in the national curriculum the secretary of state has sought advice from non-statutory working groups and there have been two rounds of statutory consultations <e> <s> there has been plenty of opportunity for many different organisations and individuals to contribute to what has come forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall take on board what my noble friend has said <e> <s> but for the time being i must stick to my original reply which was that there is some difficulty in this matter in choosing a term which refers to both england and wales <e> <s> in this case it did not it is true apply either to scotland or to northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> the interests of wales were served i believe in what was a contentious bill <e> <s> a distinguished former secretary of state for wales is chairman of the national rivers authority <e> <s> there is an absolute undertaking that there will be a welsh representative on the board of the national rivers authority <e> <s> he is a distinguished professor <e> <s> statutorily written into the bill was a provision that there had to be a special regional committee to keep an eye on the interests of wales <e>", "<cs> my lords that may very well be but i am not entirely sure that that would please my noble friend lord campbell of croy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the noble lord was present in the house when the matter was debated on the water bill and the name of the national rivers authority was the subject of an amendment <e> <s> despite the fact that my noble friend lord caithness invited noble lords to come up with alternatives no one did <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to my noble friend she is being a little less than generous because that is not the answer that i gave today <e> <s> i gave a rather different answer because i looked back to see what had been said <e>", "<cs> but it is always a pleasure my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i take seriously what my noble friend has said <e> <s> before we leave this question i come back to an original point that i made <e> <s> the word national is used fairly indiscriminately <e> <s> for example we talk in england and wales about national parks <e> <s> but that is a term which is not used in scotland <e> <s> in scotland there is quite rightly great pride in the national gallery and the national library once again those being terms used north of the border <e> <s> united kingdom-wide we talk about the national health service <e> <s> we also talk about the national debt <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking both noble lords for their remarks on the statement perhaps i may start by picking up the final words of the noble lord lord bonham-carter <e> <s> i think that what he has just said flies in the face of all the evidence as a result of this commonwealth heads of government meeting <e> <s> the participants at the commonwealth heads of government meeting all thought it a great success <e> <s> the secretary-general is quoted as saying to the press <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kennet casts doubt to put it very mildly indeed on the motives of both my right honourable friends in issuing their statement <e> <s> without in any way trailing through the statement perhaps i may say just one thing in reply <e> <s> it is said within that statement that britain believes that the commonwealth can help a new south africa to emerge in much more positive ways than those set out in the kuala lumpur statement <e> <s> all the rest of what is said except for the four areas where we disagree and where there are obviously terms of disagreement is put very positively to try to plan ahead for the future for the removal of apartheid which we utterly condemn <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for his remarks <e> <s> the reason for my particular gratitude lies in his final words <e> <s> he mentioned that my right honourable friend may have felt nettled <e> <s> that is the one point with which i am at variance with my noble and learned friend <e> <s> my right honourable friends attitude at the commonwealth prime ministers conference so far as south africa was concerned came precisely from the fact that as my noble and learned friend said one is talking about the enormously difficult transition of a country from an authoritarian regime to what we hope will be a democracy of the future <e>", "<cs> my lords one difficulty of which i am sure the noble lord is well aware is that there are some refugees in hong kong at the moment of which the very large preponderance consists of those who are not thought to be genuine refugees <e> <s> of course one has sympathy for them in the tribulations they have faced in crossing the seas but the difficulty is that this is an ongoing process which will never end <e> <s> i am sorry but i cannot go further today than to say that most countries repatriate illegal immigrants so far we have only repatriated on a voluntary basis but voluntary repatriation is not sufficient to cope with the huge number of non-refugees who are now involved <e> <s> that is why we are working to make arrangements which will ensure their return to vietnam in safety and dignity <e>", "<cs> my lords the position and reputation of this country within the commonwealth have not been damaged <e> <s> i hope that i have made that absolutely clear <e> <s> with respect to the noble lord the answer to his question is contained in the original <e>", "<cs> my lords i have also answered that question <e> <s> the prime ministers of those two countries raised the matter in the subsequent meeting <e> <s> no other head of government raised it at all either informally personally or at the meeting afterwards <e> <s> i have been at great pains to make the point thay my right honourable friend the prime minister reported that all her bilateral relations in the meetings that she had in malaysia were of the very warmest <e>", "<cs> my lords that is probably the case and i am grateful to my noble friend for saying it <e> <s> i wonder whether this matter is perhaps a hare that we have now chased just about as far as we can <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord had put his finger on a paragraph with which my right honourable friends disagreed we might have been carrying this exchange further forward <e> <s> however he refers to paragraph which is not one of the four points of disagreement <e> <s> the points of disagreement were paragraph where the statement is that sanctions have begun to influence south african policies and i have dealt with that paragraph which states that existing sanctions should be tightened and paragraph which states that an international agency to review south africas international financial links should be set up <e> <s> we opposed that saying that our money for such an organisation and indeed lastly in paragraph for the running of the committee of foreign ministers on south africa should go directly in practical ways to help black south africans to whom at the moment britain is giving some million a year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for picking up that point <e> <s> it has an enormous bearing on the amount of co which we discharge into the atmosphere which in its turn has an effect on global warming <e> <s> that is a matter about which everyone is thinking in environmental terms at the moment <e> <s> my noble friend is spot on <e>", "<cs> my lords i as well as any other noble lord am in the hands of the house <e> <s> it is for the house to decide the matter but i suggest to your lordships that one more question would be enough <e>", "<cs> my lords the -year rule applies to both <e> <s> my noble friend is quite right in putting his finger on the obligation on former ministers who want to publish memoirs <e> <s> they are therefore required to submit their manuscripts to the secretary of the cabinet and to conform to the principles set out in the radcliffe report of <e> <s> i must tell my noble friend that quite honestly i have not been able to trawl through all the memoirs which have been published <e> <s> i cannot answer his final point as to whether there are any exceptions <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an enormously interesting question <e> <s> i wish that i could answer it but sadly it does not arise from the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords now that the noble lord the leader of the opposition has sat down i am delighted to tell him that i have no information to give about a government document or if such a document has been leaked the regrettable circumstances in which that must have occurred <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is habitually fair <e> <s> i should not have thought that what he has just said about his experience of the governments publicity services in any way contravened any of the existing rules <e> <s> the noble lord says that he has no brief for the right honourable gentleman to whom he referred <e> <s> the noble lord once had a brief for him <e> <s> perhaps he can answer his own question <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall give the same answer that i gave before <e> <s> i can see nothing in what the noble lord said which breaches any of the existing rules <e> <s> however perhaps i may bring the house back to the question <e> <s> this is a question about the release of information about past cabinet proceedings and there is nothing further that i can add on that subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> that is something that has happened very often with distinction over the years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his final supplementary question <e> <s> perhaps i may say that i agree with him <e> <s> let us hope that the rules are kept <e>", "<cs> my lords the government certainly take account of that practice and so do i perhaps i may also consider that proposal in conjunction with my noble friends <e>", "<cs> my lords i meant to show no discourtesy to the noble lord lord lloyd of <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say a few final words from this side of the house in answer to the noble lord the leader of the opposition and i am grateful to my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls for his intervention <e> <s> the noble lord the leader of the opposition has a perfectly fair point and i shall indeed ensure that my cabinet colleagues are aware of what the noble lord said <e> <s> however i think that enough is enough and that we have a task ahead of us on which we should now embark <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend <e> <s> i have been called many things in life but never by the adjective that he was good enough to apply to me <e> <s> he asked me a direct question <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord lord simon does not feel that i am again getting away with parliamentary murder may i say to him to my noble friend and to the noble lord the leader of the opposition that yes what your lordships have said has considerable weight in it <e> <s> i shall be consulting with my right honourable friend the leader in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank noble lords for their responses to the statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams began with a fundamental criticism of it <e> <s> i would only say to him and to your lordships that these proposals will have the advantage of ensuring that electricity privatisation is completed during this parliament <e> <s> we believe that consumers will benefit from competition <e> <s> as the statement which i read out made clear it is a fact that many of the costs of the nuclear industry have only begun to emerge as the preparation for privatisation has continued <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams shakes his head <e> <s> perhaps he will forgive me <e> <s> i very rarely venture to criticise him but there is just an element of complacency on the other side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact that under nationalisation costs can remain hidden which have now begun to emerge is something which i believe is not satisfactory <e> <s> although i am disappointed in the statement i made today i take considerable comfort from the fact that at least we now know that costs that were hidden have begun to emerge <e> <s> we have therefore taken a straightforward decision which we have come immediately to both houses to announce <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply say to the noble lord lord williams that i do not renege on what i said before <e> <s> the noble earl is generally right and he was right on that occasion <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams may wish to talk further to me about it but i am sure he will accept that when i said we had taken great care in looking at the nuclear option so far as concerns privatisation i was speaking the truth <e> <s> there is a wealth of evidence over the years which i have to say did not lead the government to the conclusion that unprecedented guarantees would be asked for at the last moment by national power <e> <s> it felt it had to make these requests <e> <s> i make no criticism but simply state that as a matter of fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i said earlier that i thought one of the benefits of this decision i say this of course from this side of the house is that we can proceed more smoothly towards privatisation <e> <s> but perhaps it is more to the taste of noble lords on the other side of the house if i respond to my noble friend by saying that another of the benefits is that the consumer will benefit <e> <s> the consumer will no longer have to pay the costs which would have arisen from financing nuclear power in the private sector <e> <s> that will also benefit the taxpayer <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord i am a little surprised that he has returned to what he calls a constitutional point <e> <s> as he claimed it is absolutely the case that he made a significant speech on the second reading of the legislation in which he referred in terms to this matter <e> <s> the noble lord referred to it in the terms of what has now happened <e> <s> it is a little strange therefore for him at the beginning of the legislation and other noble lords as the legislation was going through to say that nuclear generation should be taken out of the privatisation and yet when the government finally come to the house and say quite openly and honestly to your lordships that that is what they intend to do and give the reasons why he then turns round and says that that raises a great constitutional issue <e> <s> if i may say so it does not raise a great constitutional issue <e> <s> the governments decision responds to what the noble lord himself called for <e> <s> further if i may say so this side of the house believes it contributes to the public good along with the privatisation of fossil fuel generation <e> <s> finally as i explained earlier but shall now repeat the decision i have announced today does not raise the minutiae of a constitutional issue because it requires no primary legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> a debate is a matter for the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has a great deal of expertise in the subject <e> <s> however with respect i believe that his last point goes over ground that has already been covered <e> <s> briefly we have decided to continue with sizewell b because we believe that it is very important to keep the pwr nuclear option in the united kingdom in order to retain diversity of supply and because of the environmental benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords my answer to my noble friends second question is a resounding yes <e> <s> i am very grateful to him for asking that <e> <s> i am also grateful to my noble friend for saying that he believes that although there are disappointments arising from the statement it is for the best that the statement is made this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think i said the total costs for sizewell are very nearly half the expected total cost of billion at prices <e> <s> i am afraid that i do not have the figures for the other power stations which the noble lord mentioned <e> <s> however figures were given in a cegb memorandum for hinkley wylfa and the preparations for sizewell c for <e> <s> i do not have those figures in my head but they are tiny compared with the cost of sizewell b <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for having put three good questions <e> <s> we say that they are good questions if they are difficult to answer <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the noble lord i have answered that question <e> <s> i made two points <e> <s> first to change course at this moment would be a questionable thing to do when as my <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to my noble friend lord hood is yes <e> <s> he is correct in his assumption <e> <s> the percentage of stations which national power will have has been reduced <e> <s> it is per cent <e> <s> to national power and per cent <e> <s> to power gen <e>", "<cs> my lords on the noble lords first point that the issues we have been discussing have been quite clear to everybody all the time i think we have really come full circle <e> <s> i can only repeat what has been said in the statement the house has been given the best information available <e> <s> new factors have come to light since the electricity act completed its passage and we have laid our proposals before your lordships at the earliest possible moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for what he has said about the future of nuclear power <e> <s> we remain committed to a continuing role for it <e> <s> the pwr option in the united kingdom remains very much open <e> <s> sizewell b as i said earlier will provide capacity equal to about one-third of the total magnox capacity and indeed the magnox stations lives can be extended <e> <s> therefore we are very much on the same side as the noble lord so far as that is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall look at that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly bear that point in mind <e> <s> i shall not conceal from your lordships that that was the one point on which i was not wholly clear <e> <s> the noble lord lord tordoff is normally clarity itself <e> <s> he said that the middle day was unduly congested which does not include as the plans stand the environment <e> <s> he then implied that the subject of the environment merited a day on its own <e> <s> perhaps that is a matter that we can discuss in the meeting that i intend to convene <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps this should be my last response as i have offered a meeting with all parties <e> <s> it is a matter which affects the house <e> <s> the noble lord lord houghton made the point that we intend not to sit on the friday following the state opening and not as things stand at the moment on the following monday when another place will be sitting <e> <s> while i am agog to hear what the noble lord will say on the debate on the humble address i am not sure that other noble lords would necessarily even for the noble lord want to come to the house on the friday of that week <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me the clerk of the parliaments has announced the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the case that the noble baroness informed me this morning that she would like to ask a private notice question on the matter which she has just outlined and that i said i felt this was not of sufficient urgency to justify an immediate reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that the noble lord lord ennals is in exactly the same position as all members of the house namely that we all know the publication of a white paper is intended by the government during the autumn but the <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the interest of the noble lord lord tordoff in the matter <e> <s> however i think that we are now beginning to stray into general discussion on the question of the forthcoming white paper <e> <s> we know that it is forthcoming because the government have promised that a white paper will be published in the autumn <e> <s> if i may say so the correct action to take would be to await an announcement by the secretary of state that he is about to publish the document <e>", "<cs> my lords i never comment on reports which appear in newspapers <e>", "<cs> my lords the decision to call off this meeting was taken by the organisers <e> <s> i understand that they did not seek the advice or assistance of the police before reaching that decision <e> <s> but before the decision to cancel the meeting was taken i understand that the police in consultation with the organisers had made arrangements to police the meeting <e> <s> the noble lord is asking for this to happen automatically <e> <s> that would be an operational matter for a chief constable <e>", "<cs> my lords we have made it consistently clear to moslems that while they have a right to protest peacefully and legally it is wholly <e>", "<cs> my lords the greater manchester police have asked the crown prosecution service to see whether there is a case for prosecution on the grounds of dr siddiquis remarks to the moslem association meeting in manchester on st october <e> <s> however i am afraid that i cannot take the noble lord or the house any further in the matter today <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that each case is looked at on its merits <e> <s> there is no police policy of treating these threats any differently from any other threats <e> <s> however the fact of the matter is that allegations of unlawfulness are for the police to pursue <e> <s> and indeed they are pursued <e> <s> many prosecutions are brought forward each year under the charge of conspiracy to commit murder or incitement to murder <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made it crystal clear that the police have asked the crown prosecution service to see whether there is a case for prosecution on the grounds of the remarks which we have discussed <e> <s> i must make it absolutely clear that incitement to murder is a criminal offence <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon has just said that this may be the last time we shall be discussing the matter presumably before a case is brought forward or not brought forward <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to a request from the noble lord the leader of the opposition which was made on monday i undertook to make a statement on the debate on the humble address in the new session <e> <s> following consultation through the usual channels it has been agreed that there shall be an additional day of debate <e> <s> this will take place by agreement on monday th november when the subject will be the environment agriculture and food <e> <s> it flows from this that the subject of the last day of debate on tuesday th november will be the economy <e> <s> the subjects for the first two days of the debate will remain the same that is foreign affairs and defence on wednesday nd november and home health and social affairs on thursday rd november <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement i made today was the result of agreement between the usual channels including all parties in the house as well as members on the cross benches who were represented by the noble baroness the convener of the cross benches <e> <s> there was no agreement that we should travel down the road to which the noble lord lord hatch is trying to direct my attention <e> <s> as i said it has been agreed that there

interrupt but we have to think of our procedures <e> <s> certainly the noble lord has captured the interest of the house <e> <s> however he is only about halfway through his intervention <e> <s> the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the noble lord lord aberdare be appointed to take the chair in all committees for this session <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the noble baroness lady serota be appointed principal deputy chairman of committees for this session <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords lord cledwyn and lord jenkins for responding to the repetition of my right honourable friends statement <e> <s> both noble lords raised the question of the negotiating stance of my right honourable friend the prime minister and how we come away as it were from this european council which as the noble lord lord ci edwyn quite rightly said was an important one <e> <s> it is clear from the statement that completion of the single market is centre stage in the development of the community <e> <s> as i think the statement rightly says not only is it something that affects the strength of the community itself but it is something that is very important at the present time of dramatic change in eastern europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord walston for his response <e> <s> first he asked me for an assurance that the governor of the bank of england would co-operate with colleagues in europe <e> <s> perhaps i may say that there is an inwardness in the statement which says <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very interested in the intervention by my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls and i thank him for the words of caution which he uttered towards the end of his remarks <e> <s> they exactly reflect what i endeavoured to say but less well a little earlier namely that caution should be the watchword concerning delors stages two and three when we are still having to go through stage one <e> <s> it is very important to bear in mind that

<e> <s> but that is the noble lords affair <e> <s> i do not regard him any the less for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i take seriously what my noble friend lord cockfield says on this and other european community subjects <e> <s> my noble friends record of serving the community is well known <e> <s> i was therefore sad when he said from his experience that the united kingdoms record in contributing towards completion of the single european market is not as good as i think <e> <s> it is the case that the commissioner himself explicitly confirmed that on the commissions figures the united kingdom and denmark have the best records on implementation <e> <s> we take modest pride in that <e> <s> we are up-to-date with of the directives that we should have implemented by now <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is always fair in debates <e> <s> i say that because i think this should be my final answer since the house is waiting for the next statement to be read <e> <s> perhaps i may suggest that the noble lord may care to look at the presidents communiqu so far as concerns the social charter <e> <s> it is clear from that that the united kingdoms concerns about the proposals of the social charter are valid in this sense <e> <s> we believe that what was being proposed is contrary to what was agreed in madrid where there was a prescription for a social charter dealing with unemployment the doctrine of subsidiarity and also the doctrine of international diversity <e>", "<cs> my lords i say once again as i have said many times during the past half hour that the noble baroness has asked an important question <e> <s> i understand why <e> <s> however i think it is most important that i should make this my final answer <e> <s> i said when answering questions earlier on that there is a long-standing western commitment to unity through self-determination <e> <s> however what i have not said and perhaps i may answer the noble baroness in saying this is that the strasbourg statement sets out many very important amplifications upon which all of the twelve agreed <e> <s> those amplifications were that any reunification of germany must be peaceful gradual and democratic

clause <e> <s> despite listening to the noble and learned lord lord ackner i feel that we ought to go on a bit see how we go and try to reach a target which noble lords both inside and outside the house believe we would reach in order to start at a certain position on monday <e>", "<cs> let me put it like this <e> <s> i should have thought that a reasonable time at which to look again at how we were doing would be at about a quarter to midnight <e> <s> perhaps i may say to members of the committee that i believe that the debate on the last amendment took just under an hour and three-quarters <e> <s> it is for the committee to decide how long it wishes to take on particular amendments <e> <s> however if we are to get anywhere near the kind of target which it was thought would be reasonable at the end of today i should have thought that it would be not unreasonable to see where we were at about a quarter to midnight <e>", "<cs> i realise that the hour is getting later <e> <s> as the committee will know from the list of amendments that we placed at the doors we had <e>", "<cs> we have thursday and also next monday <e>", "<cs> perhaps i have not made myself clear in which case that

that the bill had got off to quite <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord stoddart has been trying to put a question <e> <s> perhaps i may suggest that after minutes we take the noble lords question and then that of the noble viscount before moving to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am intervening more than i should <e> <s> the answer to what the noble lord suggested is no <e> <s> however the house would i think wish him to ask one question then perhaps we can proceed to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for what he has just said <e> <s> i shared his objective but his method on that occasion was inappropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords the detailed advice to ministers is contained in a cabinet document <e> <s> it has been the practice of successive governments that cabinet documents should be confidential but there is no great secret about them <e> <s> as i said in my original answer in the then secretary to the cabinet submitted a memorandum to the royal commission to which i referred <e> <s> to all intents and purposes the advice which was rehearsed in that memorandum is the same today <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the leader of the opposition has a great deal more experience of these matters than i have <e> <s> however he would probably agree with me that as the years have gone by and i am talking about the last to years from time to time prime ministers or ministers of the day have given answers about advice to ministers usually in answer to parliamentary questions <e> <s> all the time it has always been accepted by all governments that the advice contained in a cabinet document should be confidential <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may seek to put the matter to rest <e> <s> on assuming office ministers cannot be expected to dispose of all their investments <e> <s> but when a minister takes office he or she is given advice on how to ensure that any investments do not create a conflict of interest <e> <s> i believe that that is right <e>", "<cs> in the circumstances i think we have reached the point at which the noble lord will be in a position to vote against the long title of the bill but as he has not produced a manuscript amendment there is no amendment before the committee <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reply to the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale <e>

is for seeking information and not for giving it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that one of your lordships may propose the adjournment of this particular amendment and then we propose the adjournment of the report stage <e> <s> but for once it is one of those occasions where i do not think that i can help the house very much further <e> <s> i have no objection to ending now but it is a matter for your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord lord mishcon looked towards my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson of ewell to inquire about his intentions with regard to the amendment <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that our procedures most certainly extend to my noble and learned friend now speaking on his own amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hacking has been an assiduous attender at all stages of the bill <e> <s> i must apologise that i was not present in the house just before we broke for dinner when i think the noble lord wished to

the house if they know exactly what part of the bill we shall reach <e> <s> the reason for that is that noble lords want to know what will happen on the next sitting day <e> <s> today is a thursday and the next sitting day will be a monday <e> <s> it is important for noble lords who are involved in next mondays business to know that the business they believed was going to take place on that day will take place <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale has with his customary courtesy consistently brought to my attention his concern about the number of days which have been allocated to the bill <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has always done that with his customary courtesy usually through a letter followed by a few words <e>

that this occurred was last thursday evening when we were considering the amendment which formed the first amendment that the house considered today <e> <s> at pm the noble and learned lord said during his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two points that should make to the house <e> <s> first i understand the point made by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale when he says that large numbers of amendments were tabled by the government <e> <s> he <e>", "<cs> fair enough my lords <e> <s> nonetheless as i said between and amendments were tabled in order to meet points that had been made previously by noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords hearing hear hear from around the house perhaps i may remind noble lords that a friday was chosen for the debate on the green paper so that noble and learned lords who would otherwise be engaged on their judicial duties could attend the house <e> <s> every attempt which could possibly be made has been made to accommodate the house to try to <e>", "<cs> no my lords i shall not give way <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords but the noble and learned lord will perhaps just hear me out <e> <s> every possible attempt which could be made has been made to accommodate your lordships house to try to see that this very important bill is debated fully <e> <s> i say to the noble and learned lord lord simon that instead of speaking to those who are outside the house in an attempt to try to suggest that this bill is being rushed we should now either vote that the bill continues or else we should actually continue with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess that i do not know the answer to that question <e> <s> but i must reiterate that as i understand it there is no power under the statute for the director of public prosecutions in any way to direct police forces as to how they should investigate <e> <s> although in his speech the noble lord said he felt that this was something i would say nevertheless i have to say it because it is the case <e> <s> if i may i will certainly write to the noble lord in answer to the specific question <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall answer the noble and learned lords question in a moment if i may <e> <s> perhaps i may say with respect that remarks about bringing prosecutions on public interest grounds give the government a little cause for anxiety <e> <s> the converse should not and does not occur <e> <s> in other words prosecutions on public interest grounds even though the evidence is insufficient might occur <e>", "<cs> my lords we cannot have two noble lords on their feet at the same time <e> <s> as there has been a slight altercation between myself and the noble lord lord jenkins i invite him to rise to his feet now <e>", "<cs> my lords my impression was that my noble and learned friend quite deliberately waited as is his custom in order to see whether noble lords wished to speak and when no noble lord spoke my noble and learned friend replied <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments intention in answering questions in your lordships house is always to try to give information <e> <s> i hope that my noble friends on the front bench on this side of the house genuinely try to do that <e> <s> as i understand it the noble lord is suggesting that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is right for me to say that there was one question that was not to be fair of inordinate length to which my noble friend lord hesketh said he would need to reply in writing <e> <s> i know that my noble friend

clear <e> <s> i am afraid i must make it clear <e> <s> my noble friend lord hesketh offered to give information in reply to one question to which he was unable to reply yesterday <e> <s> he wrote a full letter which makes it absolutely clear that the premise on which the question was asked by the noble lord lord hatch in particular was a false premise <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend lord hesketh has acted entirely honourably and in a straightforward manner <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be tedious if this exchange were protracted <e> <s> i suggest that noble lords would probably prefer to look at yesterdays <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to your lordships for not being in the chamber when the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale began speaking about this matter <e>

going back a long time now that after we had the famous all day debate in march of last year we added first one day and then two days to the committee stage <e> <s> we had quite a generous ration for the report stage and now we are taking the third reading of the bill <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter is a stickler for the conventions and always remains if possible to the very end usually making remarks which are very much appreciated <e> <s> however i have to make it clear both in my capacity as leader of the house and also as leader of my own party in this house that what i intend is that the bill should be passed today <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> it is perfectly true that from time to time i have to be firm but i hope always in the nicest possible way <e>", "<cs> my lords there are just two things that i should like to say <e> <s> i acknowledge that the noble lord lord peston has conducted the debates on the bill from the opposition front bench in a way which has my admiration <e> <s> the noble lord is both an expert and a very good parliamentary performer <e> <s> i should not want to follow procedures which the noble lord did not like <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend says that he has not had a weekend to consider these amendments <e> <s> he has had the weekend to consider this and other amendments which were tabled on thursday <e> <s> for the avoidance of doubt i repeat that this amendment was one of a clutch which were tabled on thursday afternoon and not on friday <e> <s> because amendment no <e> <s> raises an issue which has not previously been raised in the bill my noble friend the government chief whip and myself did the very best that we could <e> <s> we sought out the chief whips of the two main opposition parties and said that there was an amendment which raised a matter which had not been raised before and that they should be aware of that <e> <s> i like to think that that was as open and honourable a way of going about our business as possible <e> <s> i suggest to your lordships that it is right that this amendment should be considered later on today <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it is unreasonable of noble lords opposite after the specific warning given to them by my noble friend the chief whip on thursday to say that the amendment should not be debated at all <e> <s> i am being asked that the amendment should simply be withdrawn <e> <s> i cannot agree to that for the reasons which i have given <e> <s> i suggest that the amendment should be moved and debated <e> <s> if noble lords then think having listened to the debate that it is wholly unreasonable that it should go on the statute book we must then listen to the majority voice in the house <e> <s> having listened to my noble friend lord nugent of guildford it may be that there will be a majority voice <e>", "<cs> my lords it will mean repeating myself but i shall answer the noble lord <e> <s> as i have already said let us move the amendment let us debate it and if there is then a majority feeling in the house that it should be withdrawn and decided on third reading that is what we should do <e> <s> i am not speaking of forcing a vote through <e> <s> if there is clearly a majority feeling when the amendment is moved then the government should withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say that the noble baroness uncharacteristically is being less than fair <e> <s> it was precisely so that noble lords and noble baronesses opposite were aware that an amendment which raised a new issue was being tabled that my noble friend the chief whip contacted the opposition chief whip <e> <s> let that be quite clear <e>", "<cs> my lords once again the noble earl has been an extremely good performer on this bill but he was not perhaps up to his usual high standard in making that intervention kindly though his words were to start off with <e> <s> even though his chief whip knew about this amendment very early on thursday afternoon he makes it sound as though there was no communication with one of the main spokesmen on the bill on the liberal democrat benches <e> <s> it was precisely in order to achieve that communication that my noble friend the chief whip contacted the noble lord lord tordoff <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> once again i am placed in some difficulty by noble lords opposite <e> <s> the noble lord the leader of the opposition asks that this amendment be postponed to third reading <e> <s> the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon says that it needs to be recommitted <e> <s> those suggestions are very different <e> <s> if i may say so the answer is somewhere in the middle <e> <s> i gave an undertaking that if the amendment is moved which i think it should be and debated and if there is consensus that it should not be decided tonight the expression i used was that the government will not bulldoze it through <e>

forgive my intervention at this point <e> <s> having risen to my feet on many occasions today i feel slightly hesitant in doing so again <e> <s> however a short while ago we were a little out of order but now we are totally out of order <e> <s> the rules for the report stage are quite clear no one may speak save for the mover of the amendment after the minister has replied except in the case of questions for elucidation or when the minister has spoke early in order to assist the house <e> <s> the minister has not <e>", "<cs> my lords we are currently dealing with amendment no <e> <s> with which other amendments are grouped and therefore the rules flow from that situation <e> <s> however perhaps i may make a suggestion which i made only the other day <e> <s> i think that it would be for the convenience of the house if the two front bench spokesmen of the opposition parties were to make their interventions <e> <s> on this occasion i think that we should proceed in that way <e> <s> of course that means that other noble lords will be able to break the rules which apply to the report stage of a bill <e> <s> however when we have finished with this particular group of amendments i ask your lordships to revert to normal report stage procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords we travelled around this course only a week and a half ago <e> <s> on that occasion my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor was dealing with a bill and it was suggested that he might look around to see if any noble lord wished to speak before he replied to the debate <e> <s> the report stage rules in the <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to accommodate the house i think that we should proceed as i suggested <e> <s> it seemed to me that the noble lord lord peston was suggesting that all this procedure came as a great surprise <e> <s> i do not think that the rules pertaining to the report stage of a bill should come as a great surprise to anyone <e> <s> one must try to be ready for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord lord grimond has bowled me out <e> <s> i have just consulted my noble friend lord caithness and he has told me that he did just that <e> <s> therefore i must apologise to the house because if the noble lord is correct and i gather that he is then that is indeed the case <e> <s> nonetheless let us proceed as before <e> <s> we shall be in order if we do so <e> <s> your lordships have every reason to berate me <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene to say a brief word before any other noble lord rises to speak and before my noble friend lord caithness replies briefly to this exchange <e> <s> i concede and accept that there is a point of criticism here <e>", "<cs> my lords at the report stage of the bill the government accepted the principle of an amendment which had been previously moved by my noble friend lady young <e> <s> it provided that when the regulations were first made to establish <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that either i or another place has suggested any such thing <e> <s> in answering my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter i merely put my own construction on the words unacceptable delay which have been used by another place <e>",

not insist on their amendment no <e> <s> to which the commons have disagreed for the reason numbered <e> <s> with your lordships agreement at the same time i should like to speak to amendment no <e> <s> with reason numbered <e>", "<cs> my lords before briefly replying to the debate i should like to refer once again to the right of your lordships house to ask another place if i may use the expression after the speech of the noble and learned lord to think again <e> <s> your lordships do that on many bills and as i said on the first amendment a good many amendments to the bill have been accepted by the house of commons <e> <s> after the speech of the noble lord lord adrian i felt slightly embarrassed <e> <s> perhaps i sounded a little pompous when i spoke at the beginning of the exchange talking about the procedural rectitude of this house but i thought that i should put on record that my understanding and the advice that i received are that we have done everything right even though life has not been made easy for the government <e> <s> it is our constitutional duty to revise and therefore to send amendments back to another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move formally that the house do not insist on their amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord made an interesting speech <e> <s> as he is always very courteous i am sure he will not think that i am being brusque in any way when i say that unlike noble lords opposite i shall indeed indicate before i finish how i see the house of the future proceeding <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should now like to repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the prime minister about the informal meeting of the european council in dublin on th april <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their responses to the statement which i have repeated <e> <s> the noble lord lord bonham-carter suggested that the statement raised a series of aunt sallys which were matters that had not been raised at all <e> <s> yet i was interested that the very first question which the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos asked was whether i would despite what was said in the statement confirm on behalf of the government where the united kingdom stands over the question of government parliament and sovereignty in the european community of the future <e> <s> i should say in reply to that point that the government feel that we need to be certain that the proposals for political union not <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to quarrel with the noble lord lord walston about the use of a verb <e> <s> it was unanimously agreed at dublin that an initial step that is needed is an examination and analysis by foreign ministers of whether a further treaty change is necessary <e> <s> they and those who advise them are the experts <e> <s> it was therefore felt by the heads of government that that was what they wanted their foreign ministers to do <e> <s> there will then be the report back to the council in june <e> <s> that council will then have to decide whether to hold a second intergovernmental conference in parallel with the economic and monetary union igc <e> <s> i hope that that answer more or less satisfies the noble lord even if there is a slight difference over the use of a verb <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lady oppenheim-barnes <e> <s> the statement records that the government have positive ideas for the future of the community <e> <s> i simply wish to assure the house that in the discussions which are taking place we shall not be slow put forward constructive ideas <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested to see that the noble earl makes that point in addition to it being made by the noble lord the leader of the opposition <e> <s> i must apologise for not having <e>", "<cs> my lords although the noble lord who is enormously experienced in european community matters welcomed the tone of my right honourable friends statement i thank him for that he nonetheless referred to the need as he saw it for a smokescreen <e> <s> at the risk of being tedious i must underline the fact that even those most active in pressing for political union agree that the important proposals for political union over which the noble lord lord walston and i had an exchange earlier are linked to words which have no definition of any kind at the moment <e> <s> it therefore seems sensible to try to proceed by a process of elimination <e> <s> that is the process which my right honourable friend has started although we shall now wait to see what comes back from the meetings and deliberations of the foreign ministers of the twelve <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may answer the noble lord rather briefly because we have started to go over ground which has already been covered <e> <s> he asked me what my right honourable friend the prime minister meant in her contributions to the council <e> <s> my right honourable friend meant that we must define the term political union that we shall await the report of the foreign ministers and that britain will then contribute to a decision at the next european council in the light of the foreign ministers report on whether there should be an intergovernmental conference on the issue of political union <e>", "<cs> my lords the quick answer to the noble lord is that germany is to be united and the unanimous belief of the member states is that a united germany should be part of the nato alliance <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is anything that i can reasonably add to the statement about the movement that is taking place in europe <e> <s> political union is ground which we have covered again and again in the past or minutes and i have nothing to add <e> <s> the matter that we have not mentioned at all which arises from the very interesting question that the noble lord asks is that of the single market <e> <s> i am delighted that the statistics that the commission made available at dublin show that britain is in the lead among all the nation states of the community in implementing the directives to bring into effect the single market <e>", "<cs> my lords the reply to that question should await the deliberations of the foreign ministers <e> <s> at risk of repeating myself the government feel very strongly that they would like to see specific recognition that the community should do only those things that cannot be done better by member states <e> <s> therefore we believe in the so-called doctrine of subsidiarity <e> <s> the noble lord said that nonetheless it is surely important that cohesion within the community should take place so that a united germany could feel confident that it would be a part of the nato alliance <e> <s> all i can say is that we know inevitably indeed we have welcomed it that both parts of germany are on a course to become unified <e> <s> therefore it was interesting that it was agreed unanimously at dublin by all the nation states that a united germany should become part of nato <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to my noble friend is yes <e> <s> perhaps i may just explain why i so readily say yes <e> <s> i understand that one of the topics that was discussed at considerable length at dublin and which started as an initiative from the united kingdom was that inter-trade agreements with the eastern <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the single european market to be achieved in comes at last very close indeed to being the common market which we envisaged joining some years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer can be very quick <e> <s> for example setting up an intergovernmental conference will be decided by majority voting but if the decisions which are needed as the result of that conference were to lead to changes in the treaties that would require unanimity <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that intervention <e> <s> i understand the concern which the <e>", "<cs> my lords my hints do not seem to be getting across very well today <e> <s> the hint behind my remarks to the noble lord lord hatch at the beginning of these exchanges was that the answer was no <e>", "<cs> my lords the government welcome the report which the noble lord mentioned and the support which it gives for the work of the office of the minister for the civil service <e> <s> the details of that report are under careful consideration and the noble lord will forgive me if i do not prejudge today the consideration that is being given to the report by the public accounts committee <e> <s> having said that perhaps i may give the noble lord an assurance that as part of improving service to the public all departments are reviewing their training provision particularly with a view to improving the areas of management and customer service <e>", "<cs> my lords there are civil servants in post <e> <s> i must apologise to the noble lord for not having the figures for in-service and

further and agree with the noble lord lord rochester that he mentioned certain important matters particularly the targeting of investment and the evaluation of the outcome of training which the government take particularly seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of the achievements of the civil service college published statistics showing high pass rates for professional qualifications achieved there indicate training well above the average <e> <s> that is to be welcomed <e> <s> i should like to look into the question of whether it has become a centre for research in the way envisaged and perhaps contact the noble lord subsequently <e>", "<cs> if i may say so the noble lord will find that about per cent <e> <s> of families with children are taxpayers <e> <s> tax has to contribute to child benefit <e> <s> it is impossible if that is what the noble lord is putting to me to consider child benefit in isolation from other benefits <e> <s> we have tried tenaciously and honestly to achieve a balance by putting money where there is greatest need <e>", "<cs> the government intend to continue with the bill this evening to the point that it was agreed through the usual channels we should reach <e> <s> we shall of course as a government be considering the result of these divisions in the usual way <e>", "<cs> my lords i have taken advice <e> <s> i thought there was a formal time limit but the noble lord is right <e> <s> there is not because the motion was not moved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that the proper manner of doing this is for the leader of the house to table a motion recording the houses appreciation of sir john saintys services but sir john will be with us until the house rises for the christmas recess and that motion will not therefore be tabled until nearer the time <e>", "<cs> order order <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble baroness lady seear who moved the amendment <e> <s> however i assume that she will not speak yet again <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the noble lords question is answered by part of the answer which i gave namely that it is important to recognise that a ministers actions towards a company when he is in office are constrained by well-established principles <e> <s> if i may say so there is very little difference as concerns that principle between a minister in the government going to work in a privatised company and a minister going to work in an industry in the public sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not accept either of the theses which the noble lord puts to me <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me i have answered that question <e> <s> he is seeking to distinguish between those who work in government taking chairmanships in undertakings <e>", "<cs> my lords the sanction sought by the noble earl is to be found in an area which i am sure has occurred to him and which i shall put to the house <e> <s> there is an important consideration for ministers <e> <s> they are public figures and both they and the companies concerned have a strong motivation to protect their good name <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a difference between the position i set out in reply to the noble earl lord halsbury and that of civil servants <e> <s> civil servants are not normally public figures but are far more likely to have had detailed contractual dealings with their prospective employers and to be privy to trade secrets of competitors <e> <s> it is worth noting that the rule for civil servants is not a prohibition for a period of time when they may not take a paid business appointment <e> <s> the rule is that within a period of two years they must seek permission to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble lord is temporarily overlooking is the fact that in every case that i can think of the privatisation has always been accompanied by regulation indeed in some cases by very strict regulation <e> <s> therefore i go back to the original thesis of my first answer <e> <s> provided a minister has made absolutely certain that his affairs are so conducted that there is no conflict between public duties and private interest the position we have had for many years of people working in government being able to put their experience at the service of industry should be continued <e>", "<cs> my lords usually there is an interval and usually it is a quite substantial one <e> <s> i repeat that for members of the civil service there is no mandatory interval <e> <s> the rule is that within a period of two years there has to be an application for permission to take a paid business appointment <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise what the noble lord the leader of the opposition is saying about the desirability of there being a reasonable lapse of time <e> <s> however i have already answered that point <e> <s> the difference between going into the public sector or the private sector is that in many cases those going into the privatised companies move into companies which have been made into profit-making concerns <e> <s> this has been for the good not only of them but also of the country <e> <s> there have been concerns this applies in all the cases about which i can think which have always been regulated and very strictly regulated indeed in the legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i must tell the noble lord the leader of the opposition that i do not agree with him in that argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> that is the view which has been taken by successive governments over many years <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat that there is not a two-year prohibition so far as concerns the civil service <e> <s> however there is a two-year period during which it is necessary for those in public service to apply for permission if they wish to take a paid business appointment <e> <s> i shall not go over the same ground <e> <s> i believe that the position we have at present is right <e>", "<cs> my lords apart from the self-criticism indulged in by my noble friend lord whitelaw i could not have put the position better myself <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as i could hear the content of the noble lords question i think that the answer is yes indeed <e> <s> my answers have taken account of that aspect of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we are in danger of turning this matter into a debate <e> <s> however i am in the hands of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i have nothing to add to what i have already said <e>", "<cs> with the leave of your lordships i shall now <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i entirely agree <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the home secretary about the bombing of the carlton club last night <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their reception of my right honourable friends statement <e> <s> i am particularly grateful for the sympathy they expressed and the mention of my noble friend lord kaberry <e> <s> it will take more than this to get him down and i am sure that he will be back among us <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for his intervention and on behalf of the government i should simply like to offer sympathy not only to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord lord mason of barnsley with his background of very distinguished service as secretary of state in northern ireland has thought it right to intervene <e> <s> i agree with him that attacks on the civilian population by the ira are not new <e> <s> i only add that i believe they have no friends of any credibility <e>", "<cs> i think that we are to some extent in the hands not only of this side of the committee but of members on the other side <e> <s> we have a working agreement always in this chamber as to how far we wish to get each day and the present agreement was that we would get rather further than my noble friend lord renton is saying with some justification i realise he feels we ought to go <e> <s> if the opposition feel that we should continue i have to say in all friendliness to my noble friend lord renton that we ought to try to reach the point we had earlier intended in agreement with the opposition to get to <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord lord mcintosh what his view is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord the leader of the opposition and the noble lord lord ennals are concerned about the timetabling of the business for today <e> <s> at this stage of the session in order to obtain agreement it is by no means unusual for the two houses to take the final stages of a bill on successive days <e> <s> notice of this was given a week ago through the usual channels <e> <s> however i agree with the noble lord lord cledwyn that the opposition were not happy about that <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me he has been a member of this house for some time but perhaps not quite long enough to know that this has happened on a number of occasions <e> <s> it was a matter which was looked at quite specifically by the committee set up by my noble friend lord whitelaw when he was leader of the house <e> <s> that committee came to the conclusion that whenever possible notice should be given meaning that there should be a longish period but only whenever possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i can speak only as the leader of the house and i think that it should be for the last time <e> <s> i remind the noble lord lord tordoff that this is precisely the reason that commons reasons are given <e> <s> at this stage of the bill it is commons reasons which need to be studied in order to see what line noble lords should take <e> <s> on this occasion although one might be forgiven for forgetting it those show that two quite valuable concessions have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords as the leader of the house i shall answer that question <e> <s> noble lords will notice from the marshalled list that one of the reasons for disagreement is that the bill should not be unreasonably delayed <e> <s> that is the view of another place <e> <s> it is that view which the government put to your lordships today <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to your lordships that i was not in the house when this exchange began <e> <s> i should also like to say to the noble lord lord blease that he has an important point which ought to arise in the substantive debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble viscount <e> <s> i saw three noble lords rising on the opposition benches <e> <s> i did not see another noble lord <e> <s> we have now had minutes of question time <e> <s> i think that it is reasonable to hear the noble lord lord molloy who was on his feet and the noble lord lord dean of beswick and then to call it a day <e>", "<cs> my lords i am trying to be as courteous as i can to noble lords <e> <s> i am in the hands of the house <e> <s> on this occasion perhaps the noble viscount might have been a little quicker on his feet <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the government i must apologise to the noble baroness lady white for the fact that the groupings are late <e> <s> i think that i am right in saying that it is the only day this session that they have come late <e> <s> it is not for the convenience of your lordships <e> <s> the noble baroness is owed an apology <e> <s> i unreservedly give her that apology <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for responding to the statement which my right honourable friend has made in another place <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams expressed regret that <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not add anything else if the noble lord challenged me <e> <s> i am merely telling him that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> i misunderstood the point <e> <s> there we are <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for his remarks and for the congratulations which he has given to my right honourable friend the prime minister on being an important party to the agreement for further reduction of protectionism <e> <s> that also concerns agriculture <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have great sympathy with what the noble lord lord diamond has just referred to <e> <s> however it is worth recording that mr gorbachev wrote letters both to president bush and to the prime minister before the g summit began <e> <s> i interpret the reply to mr gorbachev as a result of the g summit as a positive one <e> <s> the emphasis was on technical assistance and know-how which is precisely what the soviet union needs <e> <s> however the essential point is that we intend to help the soviet union to mobilise its own resources <e> <s> there is a clear paragraph in the declaration on the decisions that the soviet union needs to take to improve its own prospects and to shift resources away from the military sector <e>", "<cs> my lords there is nothing that i have heard which could possibly lead me to give a negative response to my noble friend <e> <s> if i am wrong about that i would immediately write to my noble friend and place a copy of the letter in the library <e> <s> i should add that at the dublin summit the community nations agreed that they themselves would undertake a study which would be led by the commission <e> <s> we are obviously in close touch with the soviet union and it was put on notice as it were <e> <s> as far as i am aware the soviet union was positive in its attitude to that measure <e> <s> in a sense there will be two studies running in parallel <e> <s> i do not believe that that will cause any problems but everyone must ensure that the work comes together towards the end so that coherent conclusions can be studied by both the countries of the g summit and of the community with the well-being of the soviet union in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord john-mackie has almost unrivalled experience on this matter <e> <s> however the mechanism of the agreement is that all the seven countries that are signatories to the agreement the european commission was represented at houston too should agree to a progressive reduction of the huge subsidies which exist in all countries as regards agricultural production <e> <s> one of the prizes for that is that the communiqu contains extremely positive language as regards using <e>", "<cs> my lords my answer is most certainly yes <e> <s> i believe that it has been a most successful summit <e> <s> there is no question but that as a result of what happened at houston it is now possible for those who have the job over the next three weeks of deciding on the framework for the further negotiations on the different areas on which the uruguay round of gatt negotiations will concentrate to go ahead and set that framework <e> <s> then over the next five months the final negotiations will take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that the noble lord has strong and expert views on the aid programme <e> <s> i mentioned cash because that was the figure that was in my mind <e> <s> there is to be a fairly significant cash increase in the united kingdoms aid programme over the next couple of years <e> <s> we are planning an aid programme of million by compared with million last year <e> <s> i repeat that the upward cash figure is in addition to considerable resources which i am very glad to say are <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked me whether the subsidisation of agriculture and he mentioned two particular areas was now to be phased out <e> <s> the wording used is progressive and substantial reductions <e> <s> the noble lord asked whether that would be reflected in the amount of subsidy which it could be said that each family in the country has to provide <e> <s> the answer is that a great deal depends on the negotiations to which the g summit has opened the way and which will take place during the last five months of this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i take seriously the point raised by the noble lord the leader of the opposition and the noble baroness lady seear as well as other noble lords <e> <s> before i reply perhaps i may make one point <e> <s> it is right to remember at the end of a long summer that this house operates by agreement <e> <s> in that regard we must be unique among legislative chambers around the world <e> <s> as leader of the house therefore i am the first to recognise that the house relies on the way in which the noble lord the leader of the opposition and the noble lord the opposition chief whip and his front bench represent the constitutional position of the opposition in seeing that the house is able to run smoothly <e>", "<cs> my lords the leader of the house makes the decision whether or not a private notice question shall be asked <e> <s> i readily acceded to the noble lords request <e> <s> the noble lord is pushing the rules of order a little and perhaps would now like to move to the question he wishes to ask <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend is correct <e> <s> however the noble lord lord tordoff turned to the terms of his question albeit a little belatedly <e> <s> i suggest my noble friend lord brabazon replies to the noble lord and we continue in the way suggested by my noble and learned friend lord hailsham <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation is entirely clear <e> <s> the position that my noble friend lord brabazon took in answering questions has been covered <e> <s> an arranged parliamentary question was then tabled in order to treat the house with every courtesy which was answered but not printed for the reasons given by my noble friend lord brabazon <e> <s> under those circumstances i did not hesitate in agreeing to the private notice question today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but there is nothing that i can add to what i have already said <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will forgive me <e> <s> he was pretty widely out of order because his question was not about the east-west crossrail which is contained in the terms of the question asked by the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> if the noble lord lord stoddart has a question on the east-west crossrail i shall be delighted to try to amplify the replies of my noble friend lord brabazon <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very important that i should make the point that that matter does not arise from the present question <e> <s> it is very important that we do not have a running business session in the house <e> <s> the private notice question is finished <e> <s> however i shall be very happy to discuss with the noble lord outside the house the matter which concerns him <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not <e> <s> as i am in a standing position at the box perhaps i may now suggest that we move on to the next business <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> it should be in the interrogative and through the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is doing his noble friend out of his question if i may say so <e> <s> the noble lord lord dean was on his feet <e> <s> perhaps i may suggest that the noble lord stays on his feet and then we will hear from the noble lord lord mcintosh <e>", "<cs> my lords i have it in command from her majesty the queen to acquaint the house that her majesty having been informed of the <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the government i agree with the noble lord lord mishcon that the marshalled list to be considered by your lordships house is a weighty document <e> <s> if the house sits particularly late i shall regret that as much as anybody <e> <s> however with respect to the noble lord i disagree that there is as he said something rotten in the state of denmark <e> <s> my noble friend lord renton put his finger on the point <e> <s> many of the amendments to be considered today by your lordships are in response to points that were made in your lordships house <e> <s> quite rightly your lordships would be the first to point out if the government had not endeavoured so to respond <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl forgive me for intervening <e> <s> there is just one rule about the taking of statements and that is that the taking of statements should not be turned into a debate <e> <s> the noble earl is always very interesting and easy to listen to but i beg him to bear that in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand why the noble lord asked the question <e> <s> i am grateful to him for what he has said about my noble friend the parliamentary under-secretary <e> <s> however the noble lord was not entirely right in referring to a continuous period of ministers of state for the scottish office in this house <e> <s> for about five years during the s when the noble lords party was in office the noble lord lord hughes was a distinguished parliamentary secretary for the scottish office <e> <s> he became a minister of state in <e>", "<cs> my lords it is important to ensure that the government are well represented in your lordships house <e> <s> i am the first to say that we were very well represented by my noble friend lord sanderson of bowden <e> <s> we continue to be well represented by his successor the noble lord lord strathclyde in whom i have complete confidence <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships house has exactly the same number of ministers of state at the moment as our predecessors had when we succeeded them in office in <e> <s> my noble friend lord lauderdale states that the question opens a wider vista <e> <s> it is important to look at the sum total of government representation in your lordships house <e> <s> one of the good things about this government i refer back to is that for years in addition to a scottish office minister we have always had a lord advocate in your lordships house <e> <s> looking towards the woolsack it can hardly be said that the government have neglected scotland in the highest reaches of government both in cabinet and in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord sanderson of bowden does good wherever he goes <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord taylor has been very fair this afternoon <e> <s> however i believe that he has fallen over his own feet at the last fence <e> <s> public spending in scotland per head is almost a quarter higher than it is in england and wales <e> <s> i call that fair to scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall now repeat a statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the prime minister on the european council in rome on th and th october <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords both noble lords have asked me whether i will give the governments view so far as it is represented by the cabinet <e> <s> i shall start by doing just that <e> <s> in a sense my reply will cover all the points which have just been made by the noble lord lord jenkins <e> <s> before i go any further perhaps i may thank both noble lords for their response but say that on some issues the government clearly do not agree with what the noble lords particularly the noble lord lord jenkins said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for his words of support for the negotiations undertaken by my right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> it is a little difficult to talk about the issue in this house but i must make the point that monetary sovereignty is one of the most fundamental powers of another place <e> <s> speaking both for myself and the government it has not been my impression from reading the debates in another place that another place would lightly throw that away in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord barnett suggests that a prime minister of this country should have agreed for instance to extend qualified majority voting within the council and to delegate implementing powers to the commission as well as agree a common security policy and other matters of that kind all without saying that they should be subject to negotiation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord did not refer to those matters he referred to other matters to which i simply added <e> <s> all of the points that the noble lord mentioned and that i have mentioned have one thing in common <e> <s> my right honourable friend perfectly reasonably together with my right honourable friend the foreign secretary said yes we will discuss those but we will not tie ourselves down ahead of an intergovernmental conference for which when the igc was being planned in dublin a year ago it was quite clearly agreed the agenda would be mapped out at the igc itself <e>", "<cs> my lords the position of the government is perfectly clear <e> <s> we believe that the cart is being put before the horse and we would not accept the imposition of a single currency <e> <s> the very first answer that i gave this afternoon made it quite clear that we are being constructive in putting forward what are called the hard ecu proposals which would need a change in the treaty and the setting up of a new institution in what would be called the european monetary fund <e> <s> that would be a parallel or common currency and could move in time to a single currency <e> <s> however we find it difficult indeed impossible to accept moving straight into what is called stage two leading to the imposition of a single currency <e> <s> we believe that that is impossible and that the cart is being put before the horse because in talking about the date of st january no one seems to have thought what is to happen under stage two <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i think that there is a lot in what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i do not have with me the exact figure for how much has already been achieved so far as concerns the per cent <e> <s> cut <e> <s> i make the point that we are talking about a per cent <e> <s> cut over a period of years <e> <s> if one considers the effect that stabilisers have had in cutting prices since one is year by year starting to talk about a fairly modest amount of cutting <e> <s> it is impossible to get agreement even to that in the agricultural council <e> <s> like a very small amount of a reduction that compares with what has been proposed by the united states <e> <s> however i shall try to find the exact figure <e> <s> i shall send it to the noble lord and put the reply in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his remarks <e> <s> i take the opportunity of his question to repeat that it is very important to notice that three paragraphs before the end the statement goes out of its way to mention that this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i respect the views held by the noble lord <e> <s> he asked me whether there is not a very real danger so far as concerns the gatt round <e> <s> my reply is that continued delay in tabling a community offer poses a genuine threat to the round <e> <s> i believe that there are others possibly the united states and canada which were mentioned by the noble lord and possibly the cairns group who may simply walk away if there cannot be some satisfactory meeting of minds and negotiation with regard to agriculture <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his intervention <e> <s> he says that my right honourable friend and her government have sought to bring the common agricultural policy under some better regulation <e> <s> my goodness me how true that is and indeed with some success <e> <s> we have now seen a reduction in the enormous surpluses which have not been good for anyone including the producers <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i take seriously what the noble lord lord annan has said <e> <s> however we need to look forwards and not backwards <e> <s> with regard to the obviously difficult although brief discussions on the gatt round it seems that the community from time to time finds it more difficult to take the urgent detailed decisions which have to be taken than to discuss longer term concepts <e> <s> whatever the rights and wrongs of the past we all have to try to look forward <e>", "<cs> my lords having said that i respect the views of the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon of course i respect the views of my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the noble lord lord aberdare be appointed to take the chair in all committees for this session <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the noble baroness lady serota be appointed principal deputy chairman of committees for this session <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is always fair and i shall attempt to be fair in reply <e> <s> the noble lord is absolutely right when he says that the then chancellor of the exchequer my right honourable and learned friend in another place increased the rate of vat but there was a package which included the cutting of tax rates <e> <s> what i cross swords with the noble lord about is that he seems to have forgotten that the government under his command faced a total collapse of incomes policy in the winter of which led to the inflation rate of per cent <e> <s> when the noble lord and his government left office an inflation rate which inevitably rose higher and higher and eventually peaked at per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we should wait for the noble lord to make his own speech in the debate <e> <s> i have sketched out the way i believe that the economy is going both at home and abroad <e> <s> in the meantime i wait to hear what other noble lords have to say <e>", "<cs> my
