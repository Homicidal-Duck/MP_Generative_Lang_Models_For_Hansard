["<cs> my lords i have unstinted admiration for those who devote months and years of their lives to serving on royal commissions and i share with the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale his comments about the letter certainly the first part of it from the noble and learned lord lord gardiner in todays <e>", "<cs> my lordsi do not believe anyone can approach this subject without considering with great gravity the consequences and effects of everything one says <e> <s> nor do i believe that anyone disputes for a moment as the right reverend prelate said in a most distinguished maiden speech that it was the size of the primary immigration in the s and up to that did affect british society did cause concern at the effect on the social conditions in our overcrowded island and did create anxiety on the consequences to housing education and social security <e>", "<cs> my lords at that time i believe those were the figures suggested <e> <s> the figure was put at two different scales <e>", "<cs> but they still had the right of entry my lords and that is what i have been trying to explain <e> <s> we have a citizen of the united kingdom and colonies <e>", "<cs> and citizenship was derived from the status given by the independent nation <e> <s> that was the position at that time and therefore as i said control had to be imposed and then we got and obviously got evasion <e> <s> the evasion over the years this is accepted and i do not think anyone would dispute it has on occasions been organised elaborate and ingenious <e> <s> it was not the immigrants who were getting money out of it but those people who were organising it and finance of a very considerable extent has been involved with secret routes established in this human traffic people being passed from country to country the smuggling in of people <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me to take your lordships out of the clear cool waters of inflation gas and electricity and back to the murky subject of pornography <e> <s> before doing so may i say that it is fewer than two years since i was asking for the indulgence of your lordships in my maiden speech so it is almost an impertinence that i have the pleasure of being able to tell the noble lord lord strauss with what great delight the whole house heard his distinguished maiden speech <e> <s> it is a particular pleasure for me because in the latter part of my time in another place he was the father of that place and i sat under his chairmanship in the committee of privilege <e> <s> to hear him again and to see him again is a personal delight <e> <s> i know that the noble lord will go on to entrance and inform this house as he did another place and i hope for an equal number of years <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may correct the noble and learned lord the conviction at the central criminal court was quashed on appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene i should make clear that i think i have appeared more before the european commission than probably any other member of the english bar <e> <s> i appeared in at least two cases in the early s <e> <s> so whether anybody accepts my opinion or not at least i can claim more experience in appearing before the european commission than anybody else <e>", "<cs> my lords for the avoidance of doubt and i think that it can be a doubt only in the mind of the noble and learned lord lord gardiner i am speaking from my place in the very corner of the house <e> <s> and certainly from no other position <e> <s> i am not speaking as a member of the government to which i do not belong <e> <s> i am speaking merely as a member of your lordships house who practices at the bar <e> <s> i want to make it quite clear to the noble and learned lord that what i have to say are my own reflections since i presume that his words were his own reflections which he has just so gracefully given to the house <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am dealing with the actual appearance of the noble and learned lord lord scarman before the subcommittee when there were present mr alex lyon in the chair mr john hunt mr john wheeler and miss jo richardson <e> <s> they were present when he gave his evidence <e> <s> all i am saying is that there was no cut-and-thrust of cross-examination and it might perhaps have been helpful if there had been <e> <s> all i say is that i do not believe that the noble and learned lord lord scarman in his evidence was so certain and so emphatic as to what he felt must inevitably be the result of some hypothetical case which may on some future occasion be brought before the commission <e> <s> i also wonder <e>", "<cs> exactly my lords that is so <e> <s> that gives emphasis to what i have said there was no cross-examination and one would think of course that it would have been most advantageous if there had been <e> <s> with regard to what the noble and learned lord lord scarman said about <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect i invite the noble and learned lord to look at the east african asians case in the days when his colleague sir dingle foot was on the other side to me <e> <s> then it was brought out that it has to be in the names of individuals and individual cases have to be looked at to see exactly what are the circumstances <e> <s> it cannot just be taken as it were as a matter of principle <e> <s> the particular circumstances in a case have to be taken into account <e> <s> noble lords will be glad to hear that i have nearly come to my conclusion <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies i should like to say having had some responsibility at some time in respect of advising her majestys government of that time on these matters that i have absolutely no doubt whatsoever that this clause is a very useful addition and an important one <e> <s> i am glad that her majestys government are going to insist upon clause standing part of the bill <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord accept that the bar has done a considerable amount <e> <s> the difficulty usually lies with the prosecuting authority and with the police <e> <s> the police are always very anxious to see everybody in the dock and the prosecuting authority is too and it is very difficult the obligation on crown counsel makes it very difficult for them to say no we will not prosecute <e> <s> they do on many occasions but the pressures should not be overlooked <e>", "<cs> my lords all i wish to say very shortly is that one is always impressed by the noble lord when he makes a speech of that kind but the air of total unreality which is <e>", "<cs> my lords as a law officer in the government of to with my share of responsibility for the industrial relations act of that time i cannot be other than very conscious in of the need for very sensible and balanced political judgment in this field <e> <s> certainly also as a practising lawyer i am equally conscious of the limited role of law in these matters <e> <s> by limited i do not mean unimportant nor do i mean ineffective and nor do i specially mean unenforceable <e> <s> but i cannot avoid the reflection that in to the government of which i was a member tried <e>", "<cs> my lords it was with great satisfaction that i heard that her majestys government had decided to bring to an end detention without trial at any rate for an experimental period <e> <s> when i first went to northern ireland with the present home secretary who was then first secretary of state for northern ireland we encountered there the need felt for the system of detention without trial <e> <s> i then thought that it was a great trouble <e> <s> it was a blunt instrument sometimes alas <e> <s> indiscriminately used and sometimes illegally used as a result of which many claims were made by persons of little merit <e> <s> because there had been illegal use of the power the treasury had to make very substantial payments to persons who were completely worthless but who were able to bring their claims because of the illegal operation of the power <e>", "<cs> my lords some years ago i was chairman of the conservative party back-bench committee on broadcasting and got involved in the politics leading up to the allocation of the third channel <e> <s> i emerged from that with a very healthy respect for the resourcefulness and putting it politely dedication of senior officials both of the bbc and the companies on their determination to get what they wanted and the scars still remain upon me <e>", "<cs> my lords may i commence by offering my apologies to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for not being here when he moved the second reading of the bill <e> <s> like most of your lordships i am always reluctant to miss any speech by the noble and learned lord especially on this occasion since the speech was about contempt of court <e> <s> the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington has just reminded the house of an occasion when mr quintin hogg was brought before the court on a matter of contempt which was dismissed and i hasten to add that on that particular occasion i was counsel for mr quintin hogg <e>", "<cs> i apologise to your lordships and to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones in particular for not being here when he first began to speak on his amendment <e> <s> i am doing that which a legislator very often does but ought not to do that is joining in an argument not having heard the whole of the argument <e> <s> i apologise to your lordships but particularly to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> again i am doubtful whether it is good manners for former attorneys-general to disagree but i fear that i do disagree in this matter <e> <s> i remember being very personally embarrassed at the <e>", "<cs> it is a crazy thing for anyone practising at the bar to disagree with the noble and learned lords who sit in the judicial committees but taking my future life in both hands i disagree with what the noble and learned lord has just said <e> <s> he referred to unfortunate editors <e> <s> not long ago i did feel for unfortunate editors but as may have been said already this evening my views have been very much amended by what has been happening recently as to whether they are unfortunate editors and whether or not we are getting into the state where the railroad is getting out of control and the assassin kind of press publicity which has probably been referred to previously is not now being accepted <e> <s> therefore i do not believe at the present time that unfortunate editors so much concern us <e>", "<cs> my lords it is obviously a very important bill and one which should be much supported by all who practise the law apart from those who administer it <e> <s> i congratulate my noble and learned friend on his having got time out of the government in order to be able to present this important bill to us <e> <s> there is one matter in the bill one change in the law which i must confess that i approach with a certain anxiety <e> <s> it is that part which provides an extra restriction on the right of a party in a claim in respect of libel to trial by jury <e> <s> it was the subject of a short debate on march nd moved by my noble and learned friend lord roskill supported by the lord chief justice and accepted by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> but the bill now before us provides that an action for libel will be tried by jury unless the court is of the opinion that the probable length of the trial makes the action one which cannot conveniently be tried by jury <e> <s> that is new <e> <s> apart from the principle i find that i am concerned over the wording which leaves as it does no discretion as i understand it to the court and which applies the sole criterion of convenience <e>", "<cs> i would apologise to your lordships for not being here at the start of this debate and particularly to the noble and learned lord who moved the amendment but i am provoked to speak by what has just fallen from the lips of the noble and learned lord lord gardiner <e> <s> he talked about his association with what he described as his <e>", "<cs> whenever i hear the noble lord lord mishcon moving an amendment i find it difficult to resist agreeing with him because of the manner in which he presents his case i also see the very distinguished names which are added to the proposal he is making <e> <s> however i find the proposal namely that there should be two or more separate acts to constitute the offence unacceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to most of the debate and have reached the stage when the only thing i want to do is to go and dine <e> <s> looking around the chamber i suspect that that is what most members of your lordships house are at present doing and so probably i would not get a seat in the dining room <e> <s> i have noted that practically everyone accepts that the present nationality law is fundamentally misleading and of course it is <e> <s> it is grotesquely out-of-date <e> <s> then the same people go on to say there is no urgency <e> <s> my reply is that there is urgency <e> <s> the trouble we have had with passport holders with immigration with cheating and racketeers <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon should read what the noble and learned lord lord scarman himself has said <e> <s> lord scarman said that it was an inquiry into policing as well as other matters <e>", "<cs> the noble lord opposite will have an opportunity to make his own speech <e> <s> all i will say to him is that for the rule of law i think it is very necessary that parliament should go about a very important reform and should get on with the business of reforming the british nationality act which i believe is at the heart of a great deal of trouble in this country today <e> <s> some years after it was <e>", "<cs> if i may <e>", "<cs> i start by apologising to the noble lord who of course should have had precedence i am only sorry that i did not see that he had risen <e> <s> i apologise to him and to the committee <e> <s> we are dealing here with the representation of the people bill and while i fully accept that it is the right of this house and indeed on occasion i can fully understand that it might be the absolute duty of this house to play a very strong part over a bill which deals with election to the house of commons nevertheless i suppose we should take into account that this is a bill which deals solely with election to the house of commons on which the house of commons have exercised their vote and their decision <e> <s> i think it is something that we should take into account <e>", "<cs> i regret that i disagree with my noble friend <e> <s> i think that this bill is right in principle <e> <s> i do not think it is right that anyone who as we say stands for parliament or as the americans would put it runs for office who wishes to represent a constituency in parliament and who has been convicted of offences and sentenced to a term of imprisonment for more than one year should be allowed to stand <e> <s> i do not think it is right that a person should so stand and therefore i believe the bill is right in principle <e>", "<cs> my lords may i return to what the noble lord lord mishcon posed as a question to my noble friend the minister <e> <s> it is very rash always to try to give answers to legal matters from the back-benches <e> <s> it is easier to pose questions <e> <s> however it seems to me that in clause a person has to be found guilty of one or more offences <e> <s> the word offence is the governing word <e> <s> it appears to me that the offence can only be in matters of contempt criminal contempt <e> <s> criminal contempt is governed by the powers of the court to order settled terms of imprisonment <e> <s> it is in civil contempt that indefinite orders are sometimes made <e> <s> if somebody is in breach of an order of the court with regard to a matrimonial matter or a matter of property that is civil contempt and it seems to me that in those cases it would not be an offence <e> <s> this is my preliminary feeling about the very important and interesting question which has been raised by the noble lord lord mishcon that where it is a civil contempt where there may be an indefinite detention it does not become an offence and therefore does not come within clause of the bill <e> <s> as i have said it is a very rash man who gives an answer <e> <s> it is a crafty man though who poses the question <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord home of the hirsel replied to the right reverend prelate who moved this amendment with a speech of great grace and authority <e> <s> i would not dare to intervene between them <e> <s> but the right reverend prelate did refer to the cardinal archbishop of westminster and the roman catholic hierarchy <e> <s> i do propose to intervene being a member of that church between that hierarchy and this house <e> <s> i do it also in the presence of my noble friend the duke of norfolk <e> <s> this is a matter on which as the right reverend prelate said the leaders of other denominations have given their statements <e> <s> they have made their statements and i am saddened to see that it is put on the basis as though there is some moral purpose or moral decision <e> <s> in my view it is a matter of politics a matter of administration and a matter of law <e>", "<cs> the noble lord asks whether i personally know of it and i must say that i do not personally know of it but i do know of those who have spoken of it <e> <s> i believe that there were people who were exploited and who were brought here certainly in the s and in the early s <e> <s> but if the noble lord tells me that it does not exist from the west indies very well then it does not exist from the west indies <e> <s> however i believe that there have been unfortunate people who have been preyed upon by excessive prices and costs which have been imposed upon them in attempting to come to this country <e>", "<cs> of course my lords i am sure that that is very obvious because of the intervention by the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead in the middle of my speech <e> <s> the noble earls intervention now makes the situation clear <e> <s> i speak as i say as a member of that church and i speak with great and due respect to the views expressed by the bishops in my church <e> <s> nevertheless these are my views and they are based upon my political judgment which i maintain <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies to that question i should like to say that i much agreed with him when he said that the extension which was made in another place from two years to five years in these circumstances was sensible <e> <s> i think they were right to do that and i am glad that it is within the bill <e> <s> but is it not here an encouragement for persons to register <e> <s> does it not provide a great opportunity for those leaders of the churches who have been taking an interest in this bill and who have told us their view about it to assist any persons in their parishes to effect such registration <e> <s> may we hope to see from the leaders of the churches a campaign by their clergy throughout the country to help people to effect this registration <e> <s> indeed this seems to me to be just the task which the churches are best fitted to do <e> <s> if it is said that some burden is imposed upon people to effect a registration and the clergy seem to have been so critical of parts of this bill i would suggest that here is a great opportunity for the clergy in this country to be able to assist their parishioners by ensuring that they do become registered <e>", "<cs> i said that many of the clergy had been telling us about people coming to them expressing anxieties and i hoped that this would provide an opportunity for them to assist their parishioners by helping those people to register <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies to that very very long intervention may i say on behalf of myself that i think he is dealing with this matter with extreme fairness and great clarity <e> <s> he has the full support of many of us on these benches <e>", "<cs> would my noble friend lord trefgarne agree that the discussion we have had on this amendment shows if ever it had to be shown how vitally important it is to have this measure <e>", "<cs> i find this a strange new clause proposed as always with such grace by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> i find it strange i find it unnecessary and i find it very remarkable <e> <s> i find it very remarkable that we have a declaratory statement as to various rights which are enjoyed <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord is supporting this clause which is a clause to be written into law does he support that every british citizen including babes in arms should have the right to <e>", "<cs> as a common lawyer i would instinctively prefer review by the courts wherever possible but i find some difficulty in the judicial review of these matters <e> <s> when we were discussing the last amendment i remembered having to appear as attorney-general under the provisions then in force which had been introduced by a labour government in with regard to the deportation of rudi dutschke <e> <s> this was an absurd procedure whereby a part of the proceedings was in public and a part was in private and secret <e> <s> one had to deal in public with matters which appeared to have no relevance but which in fact did because they were going to be dealt with in secret <e> <s> this created great confusion and ultimately the procedure was abandoned <e> <s> but it led me to think about the usefulness of such a tribunal because if the tribunal had decided one way and that way was against the secretary of state the secretary of state would have been forced to resign <e> <s> there was no question but that he would have had to leave office if the advisory committee had found differently on a matter of deportation <e>", "<cs> while i agree with my noble and learned friend in what he has just said he rather foreshadows what we are going to discuss perhaps in the next amendment to be moved by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and perhaps my noble and learned friend would consider <e>", "<cs> my lords how could a member of the judiciary in your lordships house other than the lord chief justice be present who has any responsibility for sentencing for criminal offences <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will accept that what i have to say is said with a new sense of responsibility because i propose introducing a note of dissent into what has hitherto been <e>", "<cs> i must confess that whenever i am encouraged to move with the times as i have been by the noble lord lord mishcon i immediately get a kind of frisson <e> <s> we ought to look very carefully at what we are being asked to do when in your lordships chamber we are asked to move with the times <e> <s> i cannot see the purpose of the phrase <e>", "<cs> i have always thought that for the law to attempt to assess by monetary award some recompense for grief is absurd <e> <s> i have always thought that it is something which the law cannot do and which the law should not seek to do <e> <s> certainly it should seek for the monetary compensation to try to put back people into the position in which they were before a great loss was suffered <e> <s> but for the law to set out and to put in pounds shillings and pence as it was or in pounds and pence as it is now some sum is ridiculous <e> <s> i have been told that i must move with the times and move with the times i must and if the money has to go up to then up to it had better go <e> <s> but i agree with my noble and learned friend lord scarman that what the law wants here is bereavement <e> <s> bereavement is what it is meant to be about though i can see the point made by the noble lord lord mishcon about the loss of society <e> <s> but it is bad enough trying to measure bereavement <e> <s> therefore like my noble and learened friend lord scarman i prefer to keep the word bereavement <e>", "<cs> i have made clear my attitude with regard to damages for bereavement <e> <s> but let us reflect for a moment what this could lead to if we had damages at large <e> <s> i do not know what it is like in scotland none of us knows what it is like in scotland <e> <s> i suppose the cynic would say that if the wife was killed after the marriage ceremony on the way to the wedding reception the husband in those circumstances might get vastly more money than someone who has been married for or years on the calculation that this was going to be a wonderfully happy exciting marriage <e>", "<cs> it is impossible to consider this new clause without reflecting again upon the case of the <e>", "<cs> well if i may just finish <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord on the liberal benches will wait a moment it is my habit to give way and i will give way when i have completed my sentence <e> <s> i really do not need if the noble lord will accept it instructions from him about courtesy <e> <s> all i wished to say was that i do not think that the press council had examined this matter sufficiently carefully for them to consider it had this attack as it were upon freedom of the press the freedom of speech which they purport to do <e>", "<cs> i certainly do not want to be unfair but let us just recollect that here was the press council over that important signature setting out their argument in favour of this particular amendment and referring us to the particular case and to the particular speeches or judgments <e> <s> all i can say is that the person dictating the statement may have got it wrong and the mistake was not noticed but i could not help feeling a little wryly that sometimes the press can get things wrong and they got it very wrong in this particular case <e> <s> however they have corrected their mistake and they have set out their basic belief that this is a grave infringement as they believe upon the liberty of reporting and of the press and they have urged noble lords to support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i declare an interest but it is an interest of sentiment affection and knowledge because for some years i represented epsom and ewell in another place and i have family connections which go back many years when one was a small country town and the other a small village <e> <s> i know the area well <e> <s> i recollect being told by an ancient great-aunt back in the s of herself on her pony watching the crowds come down from london for the derby <e> <s> in those days the banks shut on derby day and parliament rose on derby day it was a great holiday <e> <s> the pearlies used to come down in their wagons brakes and carriages <e> <s> it was a great national occasion throughout the whole of the sporting calendar <e>", "<cs> my lords those of us who might be attracted to my noble friends proposal i hope will appreciate that what the noble and learned lord has said is overwhelming and therefore i hope my noble friend will not press this matter although there is much sympathy in many quarters for it <e>", "<cs> my lords while on a bill such as this some of the comments which the noble and learned lord has already made and which i think the noble lord who moved this amendment anticipated must be an answer and while no one is keener than i to see the law of defamation enacted in a proper form i fear much as i appreciate the views expressed by the noble lord that to introduce just one clause into this bill would not be wholly appropriate <e> <s> there is an argument on the other side <e> <s> the trouble always is that juries in libel actions will give these vast damages and even oddly enough when the party is not a newspaper <e> <s> they seem to get into their minds the belief that damages should be greater for an attack upon a persons reputation because i suppose they are offended by it than almost anything else <e>", "<cs> my lords i react to this amendment in a very similar way as to the last amendment attractively as the noble lord lord wigoder presents it <e> <s> i think that there is a very strong case for the substance of what he said and the substance of this particular amendment <e> <s> but again would it not look a little strange to make this alteration in the law of defamation in the middle of this administration of justice bill <e> <s> the noble lord may say that this bill deals with damages for personal injuries and so we can include too a little bit about defamation <e> <s> however i believe it would look odd and strange and i think it merits much fuller consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords until my noble friend said i beg to move i was not sure on which side he was for having moved it he went on to explain how certain of the points in it were otiose and how others were incorrect but nevertheless he was presenting it as a probing amendment <e> <s> i see his difficulty and share his dilemma because while i support very much what the noble lord lord wigoder had in mind in presenting the bill it seems that we are trying to achieve our objective in a way which we are not capable of doing i say that with respect to either a noble lord or an individual in another place and it ought to be done by the government <e> <s> this is an issue which the government must take in hand <e> <s> if they do not intend to take it in hand we must support the bill and the bill with or without the amendment serves the purpose of concentrating <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale has brought to our attention is that what we are debating <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor in opening this part of the debate invited us to commiserate with the minister my noble friend lord elton who is to reply at the end of the debate because of the different subjects that are bound to be canvassed in it <e> <s> i am going to switch rather starkly from the previous speakers speaking about ireland and hanging and refer to other matters concerning law reform <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies i should like to support what was said by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> as i understand it the minister has seen the borough solicitors legal advice <e> <s> presumably he himself has received legal advice <e> <s> it may be that some lawyers are not always right it may be that the advice which he has received does not coincide with that given to the borough <e> <s> however i should also like to hear a more certain statement from my noble friend that come what may attempts will be made to deal with what is without doubt an absolute public scandal <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an important order which will be welcomed by all those who practise in law <e> <s> it will certainly be welcomed by those whose cases are coming before this court <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord pointed out it will be of very great importance in the criminal division for those who have an appeal pending that that appeal should be heard within a reasonable time <e> <s> the noble and learned lord pointed out the consequences for a person who might have his conviction quashed and who will have possibly spent some time in prison while awaiting that process <e> <s> the court of appeal as described by the noble lord the lord chancellor is the focal point in the administration of justice <e> <s> it is a <e>", "<cs> my lords having regard to what the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge said which in certain quarters may not be fully understood will my noble friend make perfectly clear the utter horrorand degradation which is felt by everybody and particularly the catholic community at this vicious and vile murder which took place last evening <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a privilege to speak first after a maiden speech and therefore to offer the maiden congratulations to the maiden speaker <e> <s> i do so particularly after the noble lords contribution with his particular experience of social care his ministerial experience and also the arcane experience which he had in the whips office in another place <e> <s> that means that my noble friends lord denham and baroness trumpington must look after their onions if that is the right expression and noble lords opposite will have to be even better marshalled than they have been in the past <e> <s> the noble lord has joined us in this debate <e> <s> i am sure his name will appear many times on the paper and he will always be listened to with great respect and great attention <e>", "<cs> i can understand why the noble baroness has proposed the amendment which she has moved with such grace and skill <e> <s> i can also understand the widespread concern which she expressed and which has been expressed to her <e> <s> but it seems to flow from what in some cases is the most extraordinary amount of distortion which was put about before the terms of the bill were properly examined terms which fortunately are now being debated in your lordships chamber <e>", "<cs> i repeat what i said on the first amendment despite the buffeting that i received at the hands of the noble lord lord mishcon and the fact that the ground was cut from under my feet by the draftsman <e> <s> i still think that it is much better to have in the bill the kind of words that are used in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to follow the right reverend prelate the bishop of norwich and as a roman catholic layman may i say that i am very glad to be able to agree with everything he said <e> <s> that should indicate my broadmindedness too <e>", "<cs> my lords once upon a time a debate on the administration of justice would empty this house as quickly as possible but ever since the retirement from the bench of the noble and learned lord lord denning and his contributions and interventions in these debates there is always the chance and the possibility of hearing his anecdotes and of course of getting his guidance which therefore makes debates on the administration of justice very much more pleasurable now apart from being very much more important debates for this house <e> <s> a regular programme of law reform is essential <e> <s> the administration of justice demands constant review <e> <s> it needs vigilance the law needs amending <e> <s> and of course the government business managers are greatly reluctant to give a lord chancellor any time at all to prepare or even to present any bill <e> <s> it is very shortsighted <e> <s> because after defence the most important duty the state has and it is a duty which it owes to the citizen is to ensure that the administration of justice is as well and efficiently managed and as fair as possible <e> <s> it should never be neglected and its importance should never be denigrated <e> <s> i say that not as a lawyer but as a citizen <e>", "<cs> owing to other duties i did not have the opportunity to speak in the second reading debate upon this bill <e> <s> i want to say only that i agree with the noble lord who has just spoken <e> <s> having read what was said by noble lords in that debate having seen the attorney-generals white paper and having heard my noble friend the minister <e>", "<cs> at first i was not so sure about this <e> <s> having listened to the noble baroness lady macleod my doubts are now perhaps much less than they were <e> <s> a great distinction should always be drawn between the process by which a juvenile is brought before a court and the punishment the penal consequences of the act <e> <s> if we are going to make the prosecution of boys or girls of who have committed crimes of violence when they are perfectly well aware how evilly they have behaved too informal or too as it were unimpressive i wonder whether we really serve so well that which we want to serve <e> <s> we want as the noble lord lord hutchinson said to make sure that such a person does not turn into a recidivist which can so easily happen <e>", "<cs> i only wanted to make quite sure and that is why i said that i was uncertain until i heard my noble friend lady macleod that no system is developed which takes it so far away from the juveniles as to make it not have considerable impact and effect upon the juvenile accused <e> <s> it should invoke the majesty of the law so to speak <e>", "<cs> i just wish to make it clear that when i intervened earlier on clause it had been my experience with regard to the director of public prosecutions that the method of appointment at that time was quite wrong and i wholly agree with what is now being proposed <e> <s> i am afraid that i did not make it quite clear that i thought that this clause removed that anxiety and made it clear that the whole of this service will come under the umbrella of the quasi-judicial role which is the great and proud tradition of all attorneys general whose aim is to make sure and maintain that they are wholly outside the influence of politics <e>", "<cs> i should also like to ask for clarification on subsection <e>", "<cs> i appreciated that we are dealing with amendment no <e> <s> but i see that cautioning comes into amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if the cautioning in amendment no <e> <s> is the same kind as that in amendment no <e>

will take the caution but not be prosecuted someone else may say i will be damned if i will be cautioned because i have done nothing wrong <e> <s> i should like to know what the proposers of this particular caution in this particular clause have in mind <e>", "<cs> i welcome this amendment and certainly look forward to hearing what my noble friend the minister has to say in reply because consistency in the principle of prosecution is tremendously important <e> <s> therefore it is important that any advice given by the director in relation to prosecution policies should be publicly well known <e> <s> having looked at this amendment and having heard what the noble lord said i encourage my noble friend to include this in the report if at all possible which the director will be making <e>", "<cs> does my noble friend not agree however that there have been many examples in the past <e> <s> for instance the director has given advice on such matters as sexual offences and on general policy <e> <s> that is the kind of guidance given to the police that sometimes the attorney-general has to answer <e>", "<cs> i find that difficult to appreciate <e> <s> we are providing that there shall be a report by the director to the attorney-general on the discharge of his functions <e> <s> that is provided for in the bill and that it shall be laid before parliament <e> <s> i understand that the purpose is that the director should explain to the attorney-general who shall be answerable to parliament what has been happening in the field of prosecutions during the year <e>", "<cs> may i say that i myself am not so sure <e> <s> i should have thought that prosecution was a public act and that even if the person is accused of terrorism or whatever it is the exact principle upon which a prosecution is brought should be known <e> <s> i am not saying that about investigation <e> <s> matters of investigation of course should be secret <e> <s> but prosecution is a public act with a presumption of innocence no matter what crime the person is accused of <e> <s> therefore i should have thought that such directions are quite proper to be given <e>", "<cs> i should agree with what my noble friend has said in regard to the proposal in this amendment <e> <s> i should like to look at some of the logic of what my noble and learned friend lord simon of glaisdale has said and to consider the clause which it is sought to amend <e> <s> what have we got in it <e> <s> we have got a lot of verbiage which the committee may think is not very necessary here <e> <s> we have <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord denning has long been the hammer for successive attorney-generals and i have at one time been the anvil on which he has struck <e> <s> but i support very much what he has said because i believe it puts an attorney-general in an impossible position if this proposal in this clause remains <e> <s> as the noble lord has said from where does the attorney-general obtain his information <e> <s> will he respond to clamour which is the worst possible guide for anybody in dealing with the prosecution of offenders and the responsibility for the administration of the law <e> <s> there is a distinction with the right of the attorney-general to make references on matters of law to the court of appeal with regard to guidance to jurors which led to acquittals <e> <s> there is i think a considerable difference <e> <s> the attorney-general has the responsibility for the prosecution of offenders <e> <s> he wants to know what the guidance is <e> <s> he wants to clarify what the criminal law is <e> <s> there is a great distinction between that power and the proposed power <e> <s> for the reasons that have been given by both noble and learned lords i fully support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i apologise to your lordships for not being here at the start of this debate <e> <s> i was defending my conduct over the last amendment to some of my friends <e> <s> it gave me a great feeling of <e>", "<cs> i want to raise one very short small cheer that at last this provision has been incorporated into an act of parliament and that the consent of a law officer <e>", "<cs> i fully accept the undertaking given by my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor <e> <s> i believe that he has been put in an impossible position <e> <s> he has been put in this impossible position because he has been asked to put this into the bill presumably by the present master of the rolls in order to alleviate some of the work which is imposed upon the court of appeal <e> <s> i fully appreciate that the noble and learned lord cannot give that explanation as it were but that is what i suspect <e> <s> this has been forced upon him and he has been put in this very unfortunate position <e>", "<cs> in this bill everybody first the government and now the noble lord wants to give further work to the attorney-general <e> <s> the government did not succeed in imposing that duty upon him but now the noble lord suggests it <e> <s> the matter surely turns on the question of what is the exceptional public importance in points of law of exceptional public importance <e> <s> i was interested to hear that the noble and learned lord lord shawcross when he was attorney-general accepted that it would be quite easy to adopt <e> <s> i venture to doubt that in the circumstances of today and with the present amount of business which i think has increased considerably in the last years <e> <s> i also wonder whether it would be so easy <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> will he indicate where in the amendment the attorney-general would be able to take into account for instance the means of the person making the application <e> <s> suppose one of the richest and most powerful corporations had made the application and they said that there was a point of law involved which was of exceptional public importance <e> <s> in those circumstances would the attorney-general if he agreed with it have to certify that the whole of this litigation should be done at public expense <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not share with the noble lord his anxiety <e> <s> it seems to me that the crown prosecutors independence is very clearly demonstrated because it is demonstrated by the position of the director of public prosecutions appointed by the attorney-general <e> <s> i do not share the anxiety that he has that it does not demonstrate the independence of the crown prosecutor <e>", "<cs> my lords always this house and the profession which the noble and learned lord has adorned for so many years loves to hear him speak of wales <e> <s> i have heard him not in this house but on a great oral occasion at the american bar association burst into song to the terror of the american bar and to the great delight of those of us who were supporting him <e> <s> i always wonder when he says that welsh is the oldest european language <e> <s> he says it with great authority but i am never really sure that that is an actual fact <e> <s> however it is now on the record <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord said at the committee stage i indicated my support for provision to be made in the bill for some form of more detailed report which should be laid before parliament and which would be from the director to the attorney-general <e> <s> there were objections to the clause at that time with which my noble friend dealt <e> <s> therefore i sat glowering during that particular division not able to support the proposers of the amendment but not happy that my noble friend was not prepared to accept some further elaboration of the report of the director to the attorney-general <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord because i wished to speak before he formally withdrew this amendment <e> <s> i am one of those who have been urging upon my noble friend that there should be some broad detail in the bill as to what the directors report should contain <e> <s> on looking at amendment no <e> <s> i was going to congratulate my noble friend because that is exactly the kind of matter which i wanted to see and which i think an attorney-general and a director of public prosecutions would like to see and ought to have prepared for parliament <e> <s> therefore i am glad that the noble lord has withdrawn his amendment since i am wholly satisfied with that which we are going to discuss next <e> <s> i congratulate my noble friend on responding to that which was urged upon him that we should have a report of the kind which he is now going to give us <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not sure whether my noble friend lord elton and the noble and learned lord on the opposition front bench had intended to speak straight away but perhaps they wish to fulfil their responsibilities after the common herd have spoken <e> <s> i very much welcome the bill as i think do all noble lords <e> <s> it has long been my desire that there should be a service of this nature <e> <s> during the time that i had responsibilities for prosecution policy i should have much liked a service such as that to be established by the bill <e> <s> i should however like to say that it may impose on an attorney-general considerably more parliamentary matters to deal with in another place <e> <s> i wonder whether this has been thought about <e> <s> i have perhaps exaggerated but that is my feeling <e> <s> he has the responsibility of appointing the director responsible for the service throughout the country <e> <s> as a result there may be more parliamentary work devolving upon the attorney-general <e> <s> i could be wrong but it is perhaps a matter that should be borne in mind <e>", "<cs> it has been made perfectly clear to my satisfaction that in another case recently there was no political intervention whatever and as i have indicated publicly no director of public prosecutions with whom i have ever worked or whom i have known would have tolerated it for a moment <e> <s> they would have resigned at once if there had been direct or indirect political intervention in a decision whether or not to prosecute <e>", "<cs> my lords it was no reflection at all of course upon my right honourable friend the present attorney-general <e> <s> i was just saying that it is reported in <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> it does not seem to me to be at all necessary to import this provision into the bill <e> <s> surely those gentlemen who are to administer this tribunal have good enough wit and sense in addition to their professional experience to know exactly what civil proceedings will entail <e> <s> the bill sets out that <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the ban on proceedings which is contained in these words referred to in respect of it it is a failure to comply with direction <e> <s> as i understand that it means that there will be only one route to deal with a failure to comply and this is within the framework of these disciplinary proceedings <e> <s> therefore it seems perfectly appropriate that these words should be there and the proceedings should be proceedings which are involved in the processes which are set out in the clause <e> <s> therefore i should think it would be right to retain these words <e>", "<cs> my lords while it is clear that it is very important that the errors that were made should be very carefully studied does my noble friend accept that the security service consists of men of great distinction who have over the years worked with great ability on matters which can rarely be made public and that there have of course been times when there have been errors and indeed more than errors in their service <e> <s> as one who first came into contact with them as a law officer as long ago as may i ask whether it is not right that they work in a field in a fundamentally free society which makes their work intensely difficult and which does not have the resources which are given to the soviets their opponent services for them to do the work that they have to do <e> <s> generally therefore does my noble friend agree that we should have great confidence and great respect for those who presently work in the security service <e>", "<cs> my lords having heard what my noble and learned friend has had to say perhaps i may say from these benches though i see i am being waved at by my noble and learned friend that i hope there are sufficient judges in scotland because in the jurisdiction of which i have knowledge in england and wales the very unfortunate habit has grown up whereby when judges retire by virtue of age or for some other reason they almost immediately come back and sit on the bench <e> <s> if you look at the daily cause list in london you will see that every day there are retired judges sitting in the appeal courts <e> <s> they are called to this work in order for the appeals to be heard and the work to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords time was when neither house of parliament ever sat on derby day which was given over to a holiday and a flutter on the horses <e> <s> i have a memory of when i was first the member of parliament for epsom and ewell years ago <e> <s> the inhabitants and the procession of carriages led by the pearly kings and queens used to flow down to epsom downs and there there was also a flow of funds into the satchels of the bookmakers <e> <s> i trust there is no significance in the fact that the powers that be have selected this derby day to discuss lawyers fees and the lack of funds flowing into barristers brief bags over the last few years <e> <s> limiting the debate to two-and-a-half hours certainly ensures that there will be restraint in the flow of words by mainly the lawyers who are to speak in it <e>", "<cs> my lords i must declare an interest <e> <s> i am not a member of the jockey club although once i represented the bookmakers but then in my time i have also represented murderers <e> <s> i hope that i shall not be identified with either of them because in my professional life i once acted on their behalf <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there are many school governors in central london who will be absolutely delighted at the abolition of the inner london education authority <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house will be deeply grateful to the noble and learned lord for the clarity and sincerity with which he has put before the house the report of the committee of which he was the distinguished chairman <e> <s> he said that he approached the matter with hope the hope that this controversy would somehow be settled by the deliberations of a small committee of this house <e> <s> that really was an exercise in hope if that is what the noble and learned lord thought would happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had made it perfectly clear to the house that while i thought it essential and good that the data should be provided what i objected to was in the knowledge that a bill was going through another place the idea that we should come to specific conclusions about such a matter namely the date of termination <e> <s> the point i was making was that i thought it was politically injudicious to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i never said that it was <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has completely distorted what i said <e> <s> when i spoke about the use of the conventions of this house i said that the committee had the power but i thought that it was unwise to exercise that power to go beyond a certain stage <e> <s> i fully accepted the rights of this house <e> <s> i went out of my way to say how enthusiastic i was for the rights of this house <e> <s> i said that this house had conventions which it applied and i simply gave an illustration of one <e> <s> that was the whole purpose of my remarks which i tried to make as clear as i possibly could and it is unfortunate that it should be distorted <e> <s> i said that in this instance the committee went beyond dealing with the bishops bill it was quite right to assemble the data but wrong to go on to draw conclusions at this particular time and i meant that it was wrong politically <e>", "<cs> never my lords never <e>", "<cs> my lords i was invited by the noble duke to wind up this debate <e> <s> that was not for any sectarian reasons as the noble lord lord houghton seems to imagine <e> <s> it was because if enoch powells bill had finally gone through all the stages in the house of commons i had been invited by him to take the bill through this house <e> <s> that is why i am winding up the debate <e> <s> there is therefore no papist plot to worry the noble lords lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i have spent years in this house and the other place <e> <s> i have sat on these benches among friends in a party which i was brought up to believe conformed with the ideas of disraeli <e> <s> the ideas of disraeli were that the purposes of the conservative party were to elevate the condition of the people to maintain our institutions and to conserve what is good <e> <s> it is because i believe that the thinking the concept and the manner in which these proposals have been presented threaten one of our institutions namely the structure of the administration of justice that i find this a very melancholy occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble and learned friend read all those responses <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for that reply <e> <s> does he not agree that the comments of the chief justice of the united states were very significant as they have a combined profession there <e> <s> he said that the contingency fees of inadequately trained lawyers probably took about half of the damages awarded <e> <s> will my noble and learned friend look very carefully at the matter of contingency fees <e> <s> there is more and more opinion coming from the united states that such fees increase costs lead to ambulance-chasing and the stirring up of litigation often frivolous and fraudulent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble and learned friend for doing that <e> <s> when he gave evidence to the english royal commission was not the chief justice of the united states in effect saying dont go the path of the american administration of law <e> <s> follow your own path <e> <s> is it not a fact that he also stated that a case which takes a day or perhaps a day-and-a-half to be tried in this country takes five to days in the united states <e> <s> is that not something which my noble and learned friend will look at very closely indeed before he advises his friends in the cabinet about any legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord replies to those comments will he accept that it is perfectly absurd to talk about decreasing costs by allowing the right of audience to solicitors of years experience <e> <s> none of them i have one beside me here would ever want to appear before your lordships house <e> <s> a great fear has always been that we might move into the american system where litigation is far more expensive and takes far longer <e> <s> what will happen if the lord chancellor disagrees with the judges after the advisory committees proposals <e> <s> what will be the position if the judges disagree with the lord chancellor as alas we have seen in the recent past <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree totally with one point which the noble lord lord houghton the presenter of the bill made in his vigorous and attractive presentation of his argument as he usually presents any argument which he puts in this house or used to in another place <e> <s> i wholly agreed with him that everything that anyone would say was utterly predictable <e> <s> one could look at the list of speakers and know what they would say <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the misgivings that we have just heard expressed by the noble lord lord benson for me this is an occasion of much sadness brightened only if i may say so by the graceful and lucid speech of the noble lord lord byron which made me feel how clever i was at picking people some years ago <e> <s> i know that he will add greatly to the quality and to the style of our debates <e> <s> however as i said that to me is the only aspect of brightness on this occasion an occasion which as a tory and as a traditionalist i never expected to witness especially in the time of a tory administration in three of whose predecessor governments i had the privilege to serve <e> <s> i have also been a conservative privy counsellor for nearly years <e> <s> i was bred to the tory principles of disraeli that the purpose of a conservative administration should be to improve the conditions of our people and to maintain our institutions <e>", "<cs> some years ago i was a member of the legislative committee to which my noble friend lord rippon has just referred <e>

<e>", "<cs> whatever the correct or incorrect interpretation there is no doubt that many members of your lordships house are not totally ignorant of the law <e> <s> yet they are in considerable doubt as to the effect of the clause <e> <s> therefore i <e>", "<cs> i listened to the noble lord lord mishcon with great interest but i strongly counsel against extending the power to hear libel actions in the county court at this time <e> <s> i am sure that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor is well aware of the anxiety felt about the present defamation law and the practice concerning it is very serious indeed <e> <s> i hope that at some time serious attention may be given to the changes to the libel law proposed by the faulks committee which was set up when my noble and learned friend lord hailsham was the lord chancellor in <e> <s> i also hope that at some time we shall have a major debate about what should be the true libel law of this country <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord lord mishcon because in this part of the bill we are really participating in a charade unless my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor can assure us that he has received an assurance that he has and will have sufficient resources made available to him by the treasury in order to make sense of what we are trying to do in part i of the bill <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mishcon said there is no point going over and over again into all these matters if at the end of the day the lord chancellor unfortunately has to say to us i will if i can and if the treasury let me <e>", "<cs>

that time we seem to have had the situation which has just been described and which is becoming worse <e> <s> presumably in the autumn statement of my noble and learned friend sought what he thought would be sufficient to remedy or at least to put into good working order that for which he is responsible namely the county courts <e>", "<cs> if i may say so with respect the noble baroness has spoken with great common sense <e> <s> the argument has been demonstrated before us <e> <s> we have a former president of the probate and admiralty division a former conservative solicitor-general and a treasury minister saying one thing and we have a very powerful speech by my noble friend lord rippon on the generality of the matter <e>", "<cs> in the light of the enchanting flattery paid to me by my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor i can do no other than withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i accept from my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter any rebuke about making a second reading speech

inconveniences because of this rule <e>", "<cs> i hope that i had made it clear that because those tasks given to the committee affect only education training and conduct in court it seemed to me apt and proper that it should be controlled by the judiciary <e>", "<cs> there is a great difference between the appointments which the lord chancellor recommends for instance to the high court bench <e> <s> he makes that recommendation because obviously it has to come from a minister <e> <s> if it is not the lord chancellor in the future then it could be a minister of justice <e> <s> someone has to do that and it has to be a minister <e> <s> but to pretend that nowadays the lord chancellor knows all the people whom he appoints is if i may say so with respect absurd <e> <s> how many candidates

judiciary <e> <s> when the noble and learned lord took up his office he had sat on the judicial committee and seen various counsel who appeared before him then <e> <s> obviously because it is only

we are reformed by the noble lord lord mishcon as he is so determined to do that only this chamber can deal properly with such bills <e>", "<cs> i was very glad to hear my noble and learned friend say that he personally in holding the office that he does would consult with the master of the rolls <e> <s> of course that is the noble and learned lord himself saying that <e> <s> i immediately accept

control the affairs of an independent legal profession <e>", "<cs> i rise to oppose the question whether clause shall stand part of this bill <e> <s> this clause deals with the proposed conditional fee arrangement <e> <s> i should have thought that even commentators who had been seduced by a belief that this bill is one of reform to introduce cheaper and better access to justice would hesitate

chancellor for those comments <e> <s> they are very different from the authoritarian attitude of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter who does not want to see on any basis when we are introducing a

legal profession <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that my noble friend is so sensitive about the word authoritarian which i boomed at him over his right ear <e> <s> i received a copy of a letter which was

i wonder whether it is worth noble lords continuing the debate on the bill <e> <s> i should have divided the committee if it had been reasonable so that we could have obtained a decision <e> <s> i found it not only grotesque as the noble lord lord hutchinson said but shaming that we have got ourselves into this position when our aim is quite simple <e> <s> we want to provide access to more people who are qualified to provide the services <e> <s> we should set that aim out straight <e> <s> judges should be drawn from barristers and solicitors <e> <s> we have been playing with words <e> <s> he does not need sympathy from me but i feel sorry for the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor that we have got into this position <e> <s> it is with a desperate feeling of shame that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the noble duke in the amendment which stands in his name and mine <e> <s> this is a debate in which no one should mock or sneer at the opinions and beliefs of others <e> <s> this matter is unlike the mundane subjects which are usually discussed in the house or in this committee <e> <s> this goes profoundly to the heart of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the definitive evidence on this matter has been given to the benson committee and the marre committee as the noble lord lord hutchinson said <e> <s> like my noble and learned friend lord hailsham perhaps i may be permitted some anecdotal evidence from the time when i had the conduct the power and the responsibility for prosecution in england and wales <e> <s> some of the recollections go back to the days under sir john hobson which is about years but more latterly i refer to my own responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the noble lord lord mishcon posed the question to me <e> <s> i am perfectly happy to do that which i always intended to do withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i wish to say only two things in reply <e> <s> i do not seek to call upon the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> i particularly said how difficult it was in parliamentary and public life to personalise these matters <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the master of the rolls of course immediately did so <e> <s> with regard to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter i have surprised him so much and put him in a state of shock so often that i am surprised he is still so robustly sitting here before me <e> <s> he will be bouncing up and down again speaking often i am sure in our debate <e>", "<cs> my lords not on this amendment because this is a final speech <e> <s> i should <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not read the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we can acquit my noble and learned friend of trying to impugn any person <e> <s> i am sure that he did not intend to do so <e> <s> i certainly did not read his remarks in that way <e>", "<cs> of course my lords i agree <e> <s> when i moved the amendment i said that i was not wedded to the wording <e> <s> the idea was that a name should be recommended to the lord chancellor or the prime minister just as is done in respect of the bishops in the church of england <e> <s> that is what i had in mind <e> <s> i was merely seeking to bring the matter before the house so that it could be discussed <e> <s> my noble and learned friend the master of the rolls has told us what happens and my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor is content that this should be made public <e> <s> however it should be put in public form that there is this consultation <e> <s> that would be much better <e> <s> there should not be this kind of mystique attached to the appointment of law officers <e> <s> in fact going back to the days of wives of tudor monarchs and so on we should have some modern up-to-date and sensible system <e> <s> i believe that i am thinking of henry iii <e>", "<cs> my lords as it concerned a wife it could not be a he so the issue was altogether very confusing <e>", "<cs> my lords we must have a practical modern system <e> <s> therefore a judicial apointments commission to assist the lord chancellor would be appropriate <e> <s> the people who sit around that table should be known to the public <e> <s> that would give a much better perception than having all this hugger-mugger business which is always associated with the law <e> <s> let us move into the st century <e> <s> finally i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>"]
