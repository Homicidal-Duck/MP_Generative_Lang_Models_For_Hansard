["<cs> my lords it was represented to me some time ago that the habit of elderly graduates from another place exclaiming the <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that some of the smaller shire counties like warwickshire which have continuously budgeted prudently have low rateable values and have cut expenditure to the bone find year after year that they seem to come off proportionately worse than the larger spenders and in fact the more economical they are the worse they do <e> <s> can the minister give us any hope that there will be some sort of reward and incentive for these low spenders in the future <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to intervene however briefly in this rather arcane debate but i feel rather confused about this <e> <s> it seems to me that the whole question really revolves around what consultation means <e> <s> it seems quite evident that none of the other bodies which my noble friends have mentioned who could be consulted can have any sanctions or any power to impose their will or advice on the advertisers <e> <s> does the iba in fact have any sanctions or any methods of imposing its views or decisions formally on the cable companies or the advertisers <e> <s> if it does not it does not seem to me to matter what the bill says <e>", "<cs> my lords since it appears now that in france militant pressure groups are able to bring normal trade and passenger and freight traffic to a standstill sometimes not without violence and since this is clearly in restraint of trade is not this as the noble lord has suggested clearly a matter which should be taken up by the european community authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble and learned lord whether it is not time that on these occasions we stopped referring to these people as football fans since it is perfectly obvious that their interest in football matches is minimal <e> <s> they are simply looking for an excuse for a violent foray against persons and property <e>", "<cs> my lords i should perhaps begin by saying that my promotion in the batting order is due to the fact that my noble friend lord bessborough was unable to stay <e> <s> i should also perhaps start by saying that i am aware that my qualifications to intervene in the debate are not strong <e> <s> i have never claimed to be a euro-expert and still less a euro-fanatic <e> <s> i suppose that my attitude since britains accession could best be described as that of one who has gritted this teeth and hoped rather despondently for the best <e> <s> i find myself particularly indebted to the noble lord lord obrien and his committee <e> <s> their report has helped to increase my knowledge to widen my understanding and often to clear my somewhat befuddled mind <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that nothing could do more to increase the confidence and help the morale of those who are already serving their country in the territorial army than this expression of confidence by her majestys government in the reserve forces <e> <s> if the reports in the newspapers are true that the government propose to reconstitute some of the old territorial regiments that have been lost this will surely be a massive aid to recruitment <e> <s> finally is it expected that there will be any comparable increase in second line service and transport units to match the increase in the infantry battalions <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree as your lordships almost unanimously agreed when we debated this matter recently that important as it is to get a satisfactory budget contribution settlement for this country nothing will be of the slightest use unless there is a restructuring of the common agricultural policy and a firm and permanent control of that expenditure <e> <s> because without that no budget settlement can possibly hold indefinitely <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell the house how this rather unsatisfactory compromise squares with the governments assurance that they would insist on a proper restructuring of the common agricultural <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the figure of increase would have been very much larger had not the inland revenue persisted every year in forcing numbers of self-employed people to become employees and that this has resulted in a number of people being unable to start up and expand what would have been useful businesses <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all very grateful to my noble friend lord beloff for initiating this debate <e> <s> after listening to him and then to the noble lord lord cledwyn i am bound to say that i was not sure whether they were both speaking in the same debate on the same motion <e> <s> as the noble lord lord grimond said it is of course possible to define freedom in any number of different ways <e> <s> once one gets into the argument over what constitutes economic freedom it is one that can go on interminably without any satisfactory conclusion ever being arrived at <e> <s> i want to limit what i have to say to certain kinds of property visible property tangible property which i believe have a very close connection with freedom <e> <s> indeed to me the question is not so much whether property confers freedom but whether there is at the moment enough freedom to acquire property <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not realise that it is precisely the enormous increase in the ownership of motor cars in the rural areas that has made the bus and railway services so unprofitable that they have had to close down <e> <s> i admit that it is of considerable inconvenience to those old people who do not have cars <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the principle of the amendment moved by my noble friend lady faithfull and in my case for one particular reason <e> <s> the list of proposed and actual cuts made by local <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that the past troubles of british leyland stem primarily from the folly of the labour government in creating a disparate and entirely uneconomic conglomerate out of various sections of the british motor industry <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many motorists will be delighted to hear that modernisation of road signs is not to proceed apace because experience has shown them that the more the signs are modernised the more confusing they become <e> <s> is he aware that it is a common experience to follow road signs pointing to a particular destination then to come to a major crossroads and find that the place you are trying to get to is not mentioned at all and one is confronted by signs saying to the north to the west or to the south <e> <s> is this not totally inadequate <e>", "<cs> i intend to intervene only very briefly in this debate because i think i am probably in a very small minority on the back-benches on this side of the committee <e> <s> while i have the greatest respect for and sympathy with the intentions of my noble friends who have moved this amendment i do not believe that it is the most practical way to solve the problems that they wish to solve <e> <s> i very much prefer the amendment which my noble friend the minister will move later <e> <s> the amendment of my noble friend the minister gives a reasonable opportunity to vote by post and this will produce a mixed system which others speakers have said is preferable <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that this statement will be welcomed by all those who wish educational standards over the whole range to be improved <e> <s> whereas the existing system has never given any inducement to the raising of standards generally and indeed it has been virtually impossible for employers or parents to know what the achievement of a particular grade actually indicates in terms of standards this at last provides some objective criteria by which an improvement of standards not only can be measured but encouraged <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the evidence from both sides presented to this inquiry has been so highly technical that nobody would wonder if the secretary of state took some time to evaluate it before coming to a decision <e> <s> but is he also aware that there are two reasons for proceeding as expeditiously as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords would not my noble friend agree that since it appears that almost any product that is likely to be grown or raised on new agricultural land is already being produced in embarrassing and costly surplus it would seem that the preference should rather be for environmental conservation than providing new agricultural land <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that as the former member of parliament for stratford-upon-avon i was responsible for persuading the then secretary of state for the environment to set up this public inquiry <e> <s> is he aware that in doing so i was seeking to strike a fair balance between the legitimate apprehensions of my constituents and what seemed to me the very great urgency for the bbc to acquire a high-powered transmitter for its overseas services <e> <s> is he aware that i thought that what i was doing was submitting this proposal to a technical inquiry to be followed by a quasi-judicial decision by the secretary of state <e> <s> it did not occur to me that this would become a matter of parliamentary debate between the submission of the report and the decision <e> <s> i should have thought that it was better to leave this to the normal procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords while no one would doubt the need for considerable quantities of food aid to ethiopia and other countries in africa and elsewhere is my noble friend aware that this is a problem that will be with us year after year after year and possibly over an increasing area of africa unless something is done effectively about short-sighted methods of agriculture and inadequate policies of aforestation and irrigation <e> <s> will he say what the international agencies are doing to grapple seriously with this problem in the long term <e>", "<cs> my lords while this system is obviously a pretty uneconomic way of transporting water is it really true to say that all this water is being wasted <e> <s> apart from burst water mains in built-up areas where water is lost through storm drains surely the leakage from underground pipes is absorbed into the ground and goes to replenish the water table <e>", "<cs> my lords could my noble friend say whether it would not be <e>", "<cs> i do hope that my noble friend the minister will very seriously consider the proposal put forward by the noble lord lord walston <e> <s> to take but one example where a pesticide has been sprayed and it is dangerous to animals it is very important for people taking dogs for a walk in the country to know the situation <e> <s> most people with any sense keep their dog on a lead on a footpath in a field where for example there are sheep but they do not do so in an open field where there are no sheep <e> <s> the dog is likely to be off the lead and wandering around the field probably covering times as much distance as the owner walks <e> <s> but i think that most sensible people would say that if they could see a notice saying that a dangerous pesticide had been sprayed on the field they would then put their dog on a lead and keep it to the footpath throughout and i think that that would be very sensible and helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords as has already been said the select committee dealt with two bills relating to charities one of which was the bill that came ultimately to your lordships house as the small charities bill and was taken over by my noble friend lord renton <e>", "<cs> my lords while i understand the logic of the governments broad economic strategy when we have a large and apparently intensifying bear position open in sterling does it really make sense to fill the weekend newspapers with official and semi-official statements and hints to the effect that the government never intend to interfere in the exchange markets <e> <s> instead of giving open encouragement to the bears to extend their positions would it not be sensible at least to give a hint that the government might intervene without warning and squeeze the bears to their considerable loss <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend clarify the governments oft repeated statement that sovereignty is not negotiable because it seems to confuse two quite different issues <e> <s> while it is clearly true that their <e>", "<cs> i very much agree with everything which the noble and learned lord lord denning said and i can see my noble friends point about trying to make the bill simple <e> <s> if this had been a case of something being included in the bill which did not exist before or if that is what my noble friend is suggesting in his amendment i could understand it <e> <s> but surely the bill is taking away from the parish councils a right which they already have <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord colville of culross has been unpersuaded by the arguments that we have adduced <e> <s> i am afraid that i remain unpersuaded by the arguments which he and other noble lords have adduced because as my noble friend lord renton said virtually all the arguments have been against the principle of clause as such <e> <s> i really find the select committees conclusions very strange <e>", "<cs> yes but with respect perhaps i may point out to the noble lord that views on the other side were expressed with a great deal of force to the goodman committee and to the select committee of another place <e> <s> moreover as i have read the evidence there were a number of bodies as well as individuals in favour of keeping the principles of the small charities bill and they made these points to the select committee <e> <s> the evidence against was not overwhelming <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> briefly i must say that i thought that the first argument adduced by the noble and learned lord lord brightman was absolutely conclusive against this amendment <e> <s> i think it would be quite disastrous that a local authority which was run on party political lines and controlled by a political majority should have the powers that are suggested in this amendment <e> <s> i can see a great deal of controversy and resentment rising out of it if this amendment were to go through <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the suggestion made by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> it seems to me that the clause leaves a loophole which could be much to the disadvantage of some dissatisfied clients of solicitors <e> <s> it is reasonable that i should give some evidence for suggesting that this is a danger <e>", "<cs> i rise only very briefly to say that i really must put in some defence against those noble and learned lords who have attacked me bitterly over what i said about solicitors <e> <s> i wish to make it clear i did not say that any solicitor in my experience had flatly refused to take a case when asked to do so by a client <e> <s> i chose my words very carefully <e> <s> i said they had found great difficulty in getting a solicitor to act against another solicitor and the kinds of arguments with which they were invariably faced were that the case was not a very good one that it would take a very long time and they would be lucky if they got anything at the end of it <e> <s> but the fact of the matter was that there was a very considerable unwillingness to advise the client to undertake proceedings even when in my view the case was very good <e> <s> anybody who thinks that this sort of thing does not happen really is not living in the real world at all <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that all this fuss and a great deal of other fuss and a lot of correspondence to members of parliament and noble lords from various individuals and organisations could have been saved if the treasury or whoever would stop leaking rumours about a forthcoming budget for months beforehand <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for giving way <e> <s> i did not say that it would condemn dozens of charities to uselessness because they could not take <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that since the government have now reconsidered the original list and have arrived at a list which they are confident will meet all clinical needs there is no reason why people in rural areas should be any worse off than people in urban areas or anywhere else <e>", "<cs> my lords having been slightly at odds with my noble friend and certain other members of the select committee during previous stages of the bill i should like to take the opportunity of saying that i regard it as an excellent and useful bill and that i wish it well both here and in another place <e> <s> i should like to congratulate and thank the members of the select committee for all the work that they have done to make this bill possible and to congratulate my noble friend lord colville on the skill tenacity and at times cunning with which he has piloted this bill through the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that it might be considered rather bad form for a member of your lordships house and especially a rather junior one to start his speech by enumerating what he considers to be his own qualifications for speaking on a subject as controversial as this <e> <s> if i briefly try to do so it is only to show that i am able to take a fairly objective and impartial view having been not only on both sides but in the middle as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> i simply do not understand what he means when he says that the editor of a newspaper has a duty to know something and that a member of parliament has a duty to know something <e> <s> both of them may have a duty to try to find out but this is a different matter from having a right to know <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that i received last week at my home in oxfordshire a letter posted in london on th january this year <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that most people will be relieved that at last the government have moved to deal with the abuses of the system which have resulted in quite scandalous increases in rents and lodging charges in certain areas to the extent of grossly distorting the housing market <e> <s> it is a system which has also resulted in many young people without employment being subsidised at the public expense at levels far beyond those that any young person in work could have hoped to earn <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise very briefly to support my noble friends motion <e> <s> there is really a question of principle here <e> <s> apart from the element of retrospection in this clause an element at which parliament has always looked with suspicion there is a very important question of compensation as my noble friend said <e> <s> the noble lord lord john-mackie spoke about the low cost of screening his tennis court <e> <s> it may not have occurred to him that there are some scrap firms in this country whose premises extend over dozens if not hundreds of acres and the cost is a very considerable element in their budget <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not understand the noble lords point <e> <s> will he repeat it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that any sensible scrap dealer gets through his stock pretty quickly and we are talking about a fairly competitive and cost-effective industry <e> <s> obviously if a dealer is told to screen a scrap heap and he puts up a fence ft high and then piles cars ft high there is no question that in order to carry out the original condition on the planning permission he must make the fence ft high <e> <s> but that is totally irrelevant to the present situation <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the secretary of state is to he congratulated for having at last brought together in one wide-ranging study all the elements that go to make up the educational system and has made proposals for improving all of them <e> <s> is he aware that the lesson surely is that we can now stop arguments about whether the bright children are getting a fair deal or whether the less intelligent ones are getting a fair deal and agree at last on the obvious fact that the purpose of education is to develop the talents of every child of whatever intelligence and aptitude to the utmost <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend give us the latest estimate of the number of television sets which are being illegally operated without a licence and can he tell us roughly how much revenue is being lost <e> <s> what are the prospects of making substantial inroads into that problem <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there would be a great many more houses to rent in this country if successive labour governments had not deliberately tried to destroy the private market for rented housing <e>", "<cs> my lords first through his department can my noble friend do <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who has arrived fairly recently from another place perhaps i may venture very briefly to make one comment which seems to me to be relevant to the length of question time <e> <s> i have noticed that in this house it is becoming increasingly common for the noble lord or noble baroness who has asked the original question to be allowed subsequently to get away with two three or even four supplementary <e>", "<cs> in supporting this amendment i should like to say how strongly i agree with my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> the noble lord lord paget objected strongly when my noble friend mentioned thalidomide in this context but there have been innumerable other cases over the years in which accepted medical and scientific opinions about various drugs have been reversed in the fullness of time <e> <s> a number of commonly used analgesics the use of ergotamine for migraines and various things of that kind which are freely prescribed lost their popularity because they were held to be dangerous <e> <s> one does not have to go too far back to remember that the governments economic advisers were advising prime ministers that uncontrolled atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons were perfectly safe and would harm nobody <e> <s> a year later they were saying that the amount of strontium deposited on the grass would kill babies within a year <e> <s> there has been no certainty that the best scientific opinion will not be changed over the years <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be more to the point if her majestys government began to think about restoring the historic shire counties to the state which they were in before local government disorganisation in <e>", "<cs> i want very briefly to make only one point <e> <s> listening to my noble friend lord plummer and to noble lords on the other side anyone would think that when local government reorganisation took place the decision to separate collection and disposal of waste was unanimously agreed as being a step in the right direction and making for efficiency <e> <s> as i am sure my noble friends lord boyd-carpenter and lord harmar-nicholls will remember it was one of the most bitterly contested and controversial items in the entire legislation <e> <s> as i recall it was only by a comparatively narrow margin that the government came down on the side of splitting these two functions and giving waste disposal to the upper-tier authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell me why this country should need to import hazelnuts at all <e> <s> they grow prolifically all over the southern parts of this country and are of excellent quality <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that in a plumbing system so bizarre that access to the storage water tanks can be confused with that of the central heating system almost anything can happen <e>", "<cs> i listened with great interest to the noble lord lord mishcon but i found myself at the end of it all confused as to the purpose or at least the end results of the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord talked about the need to substitute <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the ill-concealed hostility of my noble friend to the bill i should perhaps with even greater fervour than i would otherwise have done thank noble lords opposite who have so generously supported the bill <e> <s> i cannot feel that the arguments that my noble friend has adduced really go the heart of the matter <e> <s> of course we know that if a large district council secures borough status the chairman of the district council becomes a mayor <e> <s> while it may seem anomalous to have a town mayor in one small part of the district and a borough mayor presiding over the whole the fact is that the chairman of a district council is a very remote figure to the ordinary people of a town within that district <e> <s> he cannot for geographical reasons as well as for reasons of time get to know and be known by the people of the town in a way that the town mayor can <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord that is perfectly true <e> <s> the attempt to get everything tidy perfectly organised and computerised at the risk of exacerbating the feelings and traditions of numbers of people is a deplorable tendency <e> <s> i see no reason why we should go along with it <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for at least saying that while he would not help me he would not put any obstacles in my way <e> <s> in the light of that i hope very much that the house will give the bill a second reading <e> <s> i commend the bill to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies would it not be interesting and helpful to the house if we could hear from a representative of the front bench of the official opposition whether they are in favour of or against this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great care to the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> while i understand that he wishes to limit the power that the bill gives to the secretary of state i simply cannot feel that his amendment is either helpful or practicable <e> <s> of international importance is something that has to be defined by someone <e> <s> of international importance surely means that it is not only important to this country but is important to other countries at least one country overseas as well <e> <s> who decides that it is important to some other country overseas <e> <s> it seems to me that it would be possible for someone overseas to do great harm to our own economy without their own government or people or any of their international neighbours thinking that it was of any importance to them at all <e> <s> this seems to me not only a matter that is almost impossible to define but one which is in fact liable to lead us into worse difficulties than now <e> <s> i hope very much that my noble friend will reject the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support very strongly the important amendment moved by the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> i cannot really believe that the government can conscientiously reject it because what is the meaning of consultation if nobody takes any notice of the consultation and of the views that are expressed by the people consulted <e> <s> secondly since we are talking about consulting elected authorities where all the other people involved are unelected it makes an absolute nonsense of the democratic principle that you bow to those who are unelected but ignore those who have been elected <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that experience has shown that pouring very large sums of government money into inner city areas is a very costly way of creating not very many jobs and that one of the reasons why there are not enough jobs in some of these areas is that left-wing local authorities by the size of their industrial rate bills have driven out of their areas the firms which used to provide employment and have deterred any fresh ones from coming in <e> <s> and if the level of industrial rates is not enough to deter new firms from coming in rioting and looting certainly is <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the noble lord lord underhill is absolutely right <e> <s> the real nuisance at night from motor-bicycles comes not from machines which are technically outside the law but from the revving up of machines when young riders start off from cold <e> <s> that is what produces the horrifying roar which wakes up and annoys everyone <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend the lord president probably had to listen <e>", "<cs> that is rubbish my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in addition to the great buildings which have been discussed his department and the welsh office are responsible for an enormous number of old castles and abbeys throughout the country and that their care has been exemplary <e> <s> everything is done to attract tourists and to see that they are well informed with literature and so forth when they get there <e> <s> the care and restoration devoted to these buildings are a credit to both departments <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of your lordships patient suffering over the past six hours or so i shall try to be brief <e> <s> personally i happen to believe that the southern route would be environmentally less damaging than the northern route and i have a lurking suspicion that had the inspector at the public inquiry been a qualified planner or had he sat with qualified planning assessors he might just possibly at least have come to the conclusion that the northern route offered a reasonable alternative <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has said that normal planning procedures are to be overridden in the case of the terminal <e> <s> can he say whether compulsory purchase orders will be subject to normal appeal and public inquiry procedures <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that under governments of the party opposite for a very long time the return on capital investment in this country in real terms was actually negative <e> <s> is it not also a fact that unless profits provide an adequate return on investment real wages cannot increase <e>", "<cs> my lords to revert for a moment to the question of the noble lord lord hatch of lusby is it not a fact that the only person who has been remotely responsible for pillorying an individual civil servant is a back-bench member of the labour party in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i presume that the green paper deals with the question of county precepts which are a substantial part of the burden <e> <s> can my noble friend confirm that about per cent <e> <s> on average of county precepts represents the cost of education <e> <s> has consideration been given to the suggestion that teachers salaries at least should be <e>", "<cs> my lords am i to understand from my noble friend that it is the westminster city council that will be responsible for reversing this malicious and mischievous nuisance <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is really not much point in a company using per cent <e> <s> of british components if the end result is that it cannot hold its share of the market and has to rely on continuous subsidies from the taxpayer <e> <s> surely the answer is to find somebody who can manage this company profitably and successfully and ensure the future of the jobs there <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell us what is a community medicine specialist what he or she does and whether it is necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords may i as one who has for long supported the unionist cause ask my noble friend whether the government can do anything to convey to the leaders of the unionists in northern ireland that they are rapidly losing all the goodwill which over many years has been built up on this side of the water <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the conservative government were elected on a manifesto which undertook among other things to transfer taxes on income to indirect taxes on expenditure the reason for that being that it was thought better to allow more people to spend their own money in the way they chose <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there are many greek cypriots who were forced to flee from what is now the turkish zone losing not only their property but in many cases their means of livelihood yet they have received no compensation at all <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to appear to niggle or be unduly pedantic but i am not very happy about this word thing in paragraphs <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the problem that needs addressing is not that of preserving out-of-date and uneconomic industries but the fact that the rate of innovation in this country is deplorably low and that outside the defence field the expenditure on reserch and development is totally inadequate <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not time that the department of transport woke up to the fact that every new motorway creates new traffic and that the forecasts are always wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords if we are talking about jobs for the future is not the real problem of this country still the fact that the rate of innovation is far too low and that outside the defence field the amount devoted to research and development is much less than is urgently necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether safeguards exist or can be devised for those children who owing to lack of proper parental control have their eyesight damaged by over-exposure to television <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many people think that this building which is one of the best examples of modern architecture in london should not become the site of a government department or quango and that it is ideally suited to be a very prestigious hotel <e> <s> is my noble friend further aware that as the building has access by water and is exactly opposite the houses of parliament it could be a very profitable undertaking as an international tourist hotel <e>", "<cs> my lords since i do not wish to tread on more toes than i need to this afternoon for the purposes of this debate i am prepared to suspend my suspicion that this discussion is all rather irrelevant and a waste of time not only for the reasons which were hinted at by my noble friend lord caithness but also in order to make the large assumption that in fact it really matters who is elected to the european assembly <e> <s> if one makes that assumption presumably it is also important how the members are elected <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is simple <e> <s> it all goes back to a piece of chicanery carried out by lloyd george in to defeat the pretensions of sinn fein <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that while pedestrian precincts are an excellent idea in themselves in country towns where shoppers may come in from villages or miles away the need for on-street parking is very great and if parking space is to be taken away to make pedestrian precincts the provision of other parking facilities is essential <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that most people will consider that there is much to be said for adding an element of hilarity if not farce to what is essentially a very dull business <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that while everyone agrees that section is unsatisfactory the chances of obtaining <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess that i find it a little difficult to relate some of what the noble lord lord winstanley said to the precise question on the order paper <e> <s> however there is no doubt that this is an extraordinarily difficult subject because it is always productive of subjective views <e> <s> it is almost impossible to have a completely objective view about the content of broadcasting and the motives behind it <e> <s> when i was for an unhappy period

against the party which they supported <e> <s> so i had all these broadcasts carefully monitored and found that over the period in question the political balance of the programmes was impeccable <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble baronesss point <e> <s> i am not sure what the answer should be <e> <s> all i am saying is that the effect of having a three or four minute interview with the minister however fair it is and then having two consecutive interviews with spokesmen who oppose it and are trying to prove it wrong with no right of reply from the government however brief leaves an impression adverse to the government <e> <s> it cannot fail to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i see all this but the fact is that for many months before the election campaign started this had been going on and it became more noticeable the more obvious it became that an election was going to be called <e> <s> i do not pretend to know exactly the answer to this <e> <s> the answer is probably that if
