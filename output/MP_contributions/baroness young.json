["<cs> my lords i shall certainly take note of the very significant point which my noble friend has raised <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords this question on university entrance is somewhat wide of the precise question which i have been asked on careers training and i should prefer not to comment upon it <e> <s> however a great deal of encouragement is given to young people to take those courses which will lead them to the kind of jobs which are available <e>", "<cs> my lords they are grants-in-aid and they cover not only research but administration and publications <e> <s> it is of course open to any of those organisations to charge whatever they consider to be appropriate for their own publications <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it would be right to say that there are of course different officials within the department of education and science who deal in detail with the different research councils <e> <s> however it would be appropriate to say that all the research councils are under the advisory board for the research councils and that the secretary of state when considering the review of expenditure which had to be undertaken would of course have done so with the advice of sir alec merrison the chairman of the advisory board <e>", "<cs> my lords the funds are given to research councils and it is the responsibility of the councils to determine the distribution and use of the funds within the amounts that they have been allocated <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret to inform the noble lord that i cannot do so without notice <e> <s> however i shall consider the matter and write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords this is very much a matter for the individual research councils <e> <s> i shall consider the point that the noble lord has raised but it is generally regarded as is the distribution of the funds of the university grants committee as a matter for the institutions concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have circulated local authorities on the question of what is already being done in schools by way of teaching on computers and micro-computers and have also circulated a memorandum on this matter <e> <s> in the time available i have not had an opportunity to check the figure <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has raised a very interesting point but of course before the government considered altering the relationship with local education authorities regarding the curriculum they would have to reconsider the whole of the accepted way in which that curriculum is decided <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of the in-service training of teachers is outside the particular question which has been asked but of course it would be for local education authorities to determine how they use the money which is available to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has in fact given me a piece of information which i had not at my fingertips <e> <s> perhaps he would be good enough to write to me about it and i shall be glad to follow it up <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for raising that point <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why we put the improvement of educational standards in our manifesto and we are trying to do all that we can to carry this out <e>", "<cs> my lords admissions to an aided school are of course the responsibility of the governors but before such a situation was reached the points which the noble lord lord brockway has made and indeed other points that undoubtedly would also be made would naturally all be before the secretary of state and would be considered before a final decision was taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the points that the right reverend prelate has made and they too will be considered when the application should it be made is before my right honourable and learned friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposal is perfectly in order <e> <s> with regard to finance it is a separate issue as to whether or not the section proposal would be approved <e> <s> i think it would be only right to say that in the present economic circumstances it would be unlikely that the borough council would receive more money than it would expect to do under its building programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i would have to write to the noble baroness on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer that particular question i can only say that the total numbers that i have been given and i believe them to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not arguing that they were a burden <e> <s> that was not the point <e> <s> i was merely saying that whatever one may say about the rise in fees or otherwise it has not had the effect of diminishing the numbers of students coming here <e> <s> that was my argument and i think that the figures bear it out <e>", "<cs> my lords i have deliberately given very general round figures <e> <s> however i hope that i have <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems quite clear we are not going to get any consensus on the bill this afternoon <e> <s> in answer to the noble lord lord davies of leek the point about subsection of the clause is that the governors of voluntary schools have always had the right to determine their own policies <e> <s> what we are doing in this bill is to return that right to them <e> <s> we are not altering the situation as it was under the act <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever may be said about education we have certainly had a variety of opinions expressed in the course of our debate this afternoon <e> <s> a number of noble lords have said and have asked whether we cannot take education out of politics <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the best comprehensives in this country and i absolutely accept what the noble lord lord donaldson said about the ones to which he referred have worked very well because everybody has completely believed in them and has wanted to make them work well <e> <s> i believe them to be good schools and i would not wish them to change <e> <s> however i do not think that that is the case with all comprehensive schools and i think that if we are trying to force reluctant authorities to undergo these comprehensive schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord murray of gravesend wants to take me up on a point he might at least get the facts right about what i was asked and what i replied because i do not think that he did so in the statement that he has just made <e> <s> the point that i was making and if he considers the matter i think that he will agree with me is that if one wishes to have a successful enterprise of any sort one must have the willing co-operation of those who are to work in it <e> <s> one will have a much better enterprise if those people are willing than if they are unwilling <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to hear the noble baroness say that because of course we want a balance between central and local government <e> <s> nobody is arguing that each local authority should decide at what age children should go to school or at what age they should leave school <e> <s> but there is plenty of room for discussion of one of the points which the noble baroness and other noble lords have raised which is the whole issue of the content of education <e> <s> i hope that on our later education bill we shall have an opportunity to look at what i regard as one of the most important issues in education which is the content <e> <s> after all it is what goes on in the school not what sort of a school it is that is the mos important question before us <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> any intention to alter an existing educational scheme would require the local authority to go through all the section procedures <e> <s> the noble baroness also asked the meaning of managers and governors in the bill <e> <s> in this sense the meaning of managers and governors of voluntary schools is made clear by clause <e> <s> lastly any proposal made under section for comprehensive reorganisation or any proposal to reintroduce selection will be considered by the secretary of state on educational grounds and the wise use of resources the attitudes of both parents and teachers and the expressed views of local people <e> <s> full account will be taken of objections received <e> <s> these arc of course exactly the criteria that have been used by ministers ever since the education act <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for taking the four amendments together because that will be easier for the committee at this stage <e> <s> i hope i can show that the amendments are unnecessary and that the point that she and her noble friends are concerned about is in fact met in the bill <e> <s> as i indicated on second reading the reference to managers or governors refers to managers or governors of voluntary schools <e> <s> i recognise that the noble baroness and her noble friends have put down the amendments because they desire clarification on this point so perhaps i may explain the position further <e> <s> subsections and have to be taken together with subsection which refers to those provisions of section of the education act dealing with the submission of their respective proposals by local education authorities and voluntary bodies <e> <s> subsection makes it clear that managers or governors as mentioned in the bill are managers or governors of voluntary schools who are treated as having made proposals under section <e> <s> the references to managers or governors concerned in subsections and are therefore references to managers or governors of voluntary schools <e> <s> i hope that following that clarification the noble baroness will recognise that her point has been met and that she will feel that <e>", "<cs> when one is not a lawyer it is perhaps not wise to involve oneself in legal points but my advisers assure me that the bill intends the meaning that has been described by both noble baronesses lady david and lady bacon <e> <s> the reference does in fact mean managers or governors of voluntary schools <e> <s> as the bill has the effect of putting back the legislation to what it was prior to and the interpretation would be the same as that used from the education act onwards to that date we need not feel that the phrase is likely to be open to a new interpretation in the future <e>", "<cs> on this amendment i hope i can show the noble baroness that in fact her point is met implicitly in the bill <e> <s> as she has quite rightly described local authorities managers and governors are under a duty to implement approved proposals which have been made to maintain cease to maintain or to make any change in the character of a school unless they apply under this subsection for the approval to be revoked <e> <s> it follows therefore that they must apply to be relieved of the duty before the date of implementation which i understand is the point which the noble baroness is making <e>", "<cs> i entirely accept that there should be full consultations <e>", "<cs> there are two different situations <e> <s> under the proposals which are made for reorganisation under section of the act there must be consultation because the authority is required to publish notices and the secretary of state receives objections <e> <s> therefore there would clearly be consultation with the teachers and the parents <e> <s> under this bill if an authority were obliged to go through the consultative process not under the proposals under section because of course it was not doing the reorganisation because it wanted to but because it had been obliged to the consultations could only be on the basis of saying you have various forms of comprehensive reorganisation you must take it or leave it <e> <s> many people under these circumstances objected very strongly to it <e> <s> others did not but some did <e> <s> what we are saying under this bill is that if an authority decides now that it does not wish to go forward with the proposals which it had already indicated it did not want and it consulted on that <e>", "<cs> the effect of the amendment is of course to reverse what is said in the particular subsection in the <e>", "<cs> my noble friends lord eccles and lord swinton have indicated clearly that this bill is not a bill against comprehensive schools <e> <s> we have been over this ground very firmly and it would be quite wrong to have a further second reading debate on that but i should like to make it clear from the government front bench that we believe the bill is one to restore freedom of choice to local authorities <e>", "<cs> if this amendment were accepted it would introduce a completely new element into the relationships between central and local government <e> <s> indeed it would be an unprecedented interference by central government in the way in which local authorities allocate resources in their schools <e> <s> of course we all want to see that schools of all types get the best resources they can but this is always left to the discretion of the local education authorities and i believe there is no reason at this stage for considering that we should in any way alter the balance of relationship between central and local government <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge for introducing me to a new phrase <e> <s> modest compulsion is a phrase i must remember i think i shall be able to work it in on a number of occasions <e> <s> of course this is a serious matter about the allocation of resources and i am sure that we can all quote from our own experience the difficulties of identifying exactly how costs fall between schools <e> <s> i think it was the noble baroness lady david who referred to the greatly increased expenses in a sixth form where there would be small teaching groups with one teacher and the costs would rise proportionately <e> <s> we might just as well argue that it is much more expensive to teach a-level physics than a-level greek because it is necessary to have a laboratory in one case but not in the other or that it is much more expensive to have a well-equipped technical studies room in a secondary modern school than it would be to have merely a classroom for english in a grammar school <e> <s> so quantifying the resources exactly is a very difficult exercise indeed <e> <s> when i said that it would mean much more administration that was in no sense a frivolous remark <e>", "<cs> i am sure that we should all have sympathy with the point made by the noble baroness lady david about the importance of consultation on the curriculum and the syllabus between <e>", "<cs> i must reply to the noble lord lord parry because we have not mentioned wales at all <e> <s> this bill applies to wales though the particular authorities involved are not so far as i know in wales but are in england <e> <s> i should like to assure him that we believe that the education system for all our children is very important <e> <s> we should not as a country be spending currently million upon it if we did not believe that to be so <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness lady david has said quite correctly when we bring in our second education bill we shall be dealing with the very important problem which she has identified that of falling rolls and the problem of keeping up the numbers of pupils adequately in a given number of the authorities schools <e> <s> i cannot say more at this stage of the detail of our proposals but it will include giving powers to local <e>", "<cs> my lords i have every sympathy with the wish of the noble baroness lady david to facilitate the transfer of pupils from secondary modern schools to grammar schools during their school career where this would be right and to ensure that full information about the admission arrangements to secondary schools is published <e> <s> i think however that it would only be right for me to explain at the outset that this new clause is not germane to the bill because the sole purpose of the bill is to restore to local education authorities and to governors of voluntary schools where appropriate their right to initiate proposals relating to secondary school organisation and to repeal the powers of the secretary of state to require such proposals under duress <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the noble viscount lord simon speaking on this amendment said that i had changed my ground from the time that we debated this subject at the committee stage <e> <s> although it may well be that i do not have all the evil thoughts that the noble lord lord beaumont has attributed to me in my first reply on this particular amendment i do i hope always look at amendments <e> <s> if the amendment is different from the one previously moved i like to give a different reply in answering a second point <e> <s> it does seem to me that one owes it in courtesy not only to your lordships house but to the mover of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e> <s> we have spent some considerable time discussing with great care and attention the purposes of this short bill <e> <s> several of my noble friends and here i should like particularly to refer to my noble friend lord swinton have said that if the bill were against comprehensive schools they would not be supporting it <e> <s> if that were so we would not have introduced it <e> <s> conservative secretaries of state have approved the establishment of many comprehensive schools and i fully expect my right honourable and learned friend to approve further proposals for comprehensive reorganisation during his period of office <e> <s> what we are against is the principle of compulsion <e> <s> we do not believe in imposing comprehensive schools everywhere that is to say we do not believe that all schools must be comprehensive if any school is to be comprehensive <e>", "<cs> my lords on a point of information for the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead to whom i always enjoy listening it is not the governments <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be helpful if at this point i were to say that it is not our intention to include in the forthcoming education bill a pro vision to allow local education authorities to charge for nursery education <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord continues i am sure that he will appreciate the fact that total government expenditure this year is the same as last year <e> <s> there is no diminution in the total sum being spent <e> <s> this is a fact and we all have to face it <e>", "<cs> my lords i would make two points <e> <s> there is no vat on either books or childrens clothes <e> <s> that is one point <e> <s> secondly total government expenditure in real terms is as great this year as last year <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has asked me a direct question i will give him a direct answer to that <e> <s> i think the most important thing that the educational system can do for all the nations children is to equip them to face life as it is to have good standards to have good academic standards to have good moral standards and standards of discipline and to train them for the jobs which are going to be available in the world <e> <s> that should be of first and prime importance and it should not be side-tracked by all sorts of statements which are really almost incomprehensible in their vagueness <e> <s> i think we want to do something for children and that if i may say so is what parents really want for their children in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad the noble lord agrees <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord wells-pestell said at the opening of this debate this is the third debate that we have had on the family in three years <e> <s> in we discussed the family on a motion by the most reverend primate the archbishop of canterbury and again in on a motion introduced by the noble baroness lady phillips which i recall very well <e>", "<cs> my lords i will say now to the noble lord lord mccarthy that i did appreciate a number of his statements and that if he will contain himself in patience i shall come to them later on in my remarks <e> <s> we as a country are in a very serious economic condition living comfortably only by the accident of north sea oil <e> <s> we are now with the exception of italy and ireland the poorest country in western europe and no wonder that there are so many poor people in this country i find it quite as deplorable as anybody else who has spoken today whereas years ago we were the richest <e> <s> our economic growth is stagnant and worse still our factories today produce about the same amount as they did during the three-day week <e> <s> nobody can rejoice at this situation and nobody can want to do anything else but try to improve it <e> <s> that is why we have made the revitalisation of the economy our over-riding priority and in order to achieve this enterprise must be encouraged and rewarded by the reduction of direct taxation <e> <s> to meet this there must be cuts in government expenditure <e> <s> for the truth is that if only we could get economic growth in the economy then we would have the money for all the desirable projects that have been debated today <e> <s> as it is if the opposition really want to help the poor and the needy they should not be complaining about the present economies many of which they themselves would have introduced had they won the election but encouraging both sides of industry to produce more <e> <s> that is the only way to achieve better services <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may say oh dear dear <e> <s> i have listened with great patience to what has been said this afternoon and i would say to him and to his colleagues that if they really think that by taking every last halfpenny away from every rich person in this country they will pay for the services they are under a misapprehension because what the may election showed was that in fact in order to pay for the services income tax had to be very high for a number of what i think they and i would call working people and those working people did not like the high taxes <e> <s> that was one of the reasons why the conservatives won the election in may <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not be so sure that we would not win it now because i believe in the common sense of the british people <e>", "<cs> my lords i am never certain about elections but i am sure about the common sense of the british people and they know perfectly well how serious the situation is <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether five authorities have closed all their nursery schools or are thinking about this as one option <e> <s> so much discussion nowadays concerns people thinking about what they might do but they have not yet done so <e> <s> i would hope that this is an area where authorities would look closely at the possibilities that the noble baroness lady david herself mentioned of using empty primary school classrooms and of making use of volunteers to help <e> <s> i believe people should ask themselves how they can meet this need and i believe that with goodwill a great many of these difficulties could in fact be overcome <e> <s> it is enormously encouraging how successful the whole of the pre-school play group movement has been <e> <s> i believe there are now some children <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i am in a position to give <e>", "<cs> my lords the basis of the million that i have indicated is that the fees currently paid by overseas students in will amount only to some per cent <e> <s> of the costs of their courses <e> <s> the balance of per cent <e> <s> is currently provided through public funds and that is the basis of the figure to which i have just referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i have of course read the report to which the noble lord refers but the fact is that that is based on using marginal costs whereas for other purposes of public funding of institutions the basis is unit costs <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have of course discussed the matter of overseas students with the committee of vice-chancellors and it is our proposal that we shall be entering into detailed discussions with them for some means particularly of helping postgraduates <e> <s> the fact is that every time the charges to overseas students have gone up so the number of overseas students in this country has increased <e> <s> it is perfectly clear that the numbers overall have increased from in to today so we have to remember that in the background to our thinking <e> <s> the government have looked at all these matters in the context of their need to look at the costs of the total education budget and we believe although we should prefer not to do many things that in this context this is an appropriate saving that we can make to balance the budget in other respects <e>", "<cs> there will be special arrangements for eec students my lords but the way in which many commonwealth students are currently looked after through oda will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble lord says undoubtedly has some truth in it and there are those links but it is very difficult to quantify in exact terms what the gains are <e> <s> the figures i have given are the figures which apply to the education budget and it is very difficult to offset those against other figures which may be true but which are quite unquantifiable and would not in any event affect the need to cut government expenditure <e>", "<cs> that would be an extremely difficult question to answer my lords because one would have to look at the complete budgets of government spending <e> <s> what i and my colleagues are concerned with is the education budget and we have had to look at all aspects of it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a statement i am not prepared to accept <e> <s> i have read the article to which the noble lord referred and if one tries to balance <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to assure the noble lord lord robbins that this matter had not been gone into without very careful consideration of all the facts regarding it but as an economist he will know better than i that the rate of the fees at universities that home students now pay is to a certain extent an artificial figure <e> <s> when we are talking about students from overseas we should remember that they are now paying more nearly the true cost and this has therefore put us into a particularly difficult situation <e> <s> we have looked at this as one aspect in a very difficult exercise that we have had to carry out <e> <s> the government have been committed to cutting public expenditure and the education budget has had to take its share of it and this is one way in which it is happening <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to assure the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead that our proposals include as before the arrangements which have been made particularly i think for students from former british colonies to come and study through the overseas development agency and that is a separate exercise from the one that i am describing <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way for one moment i think if he looks at the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i do not think i can give an answer to that question at this time of night <e> <s> may i write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords these schemes the commonwealth scholarship and fellowship schemes cover both the old and the new commonwealth developed and developing countries <e> <s> for a non-commonwealth advanced country the usa there is the marshall scholarship scheme <e> <s> under this scheme american graduates are brought to this country annually for a minimum of two years to read for first or higher degrees at british universities <e> <s> the draft estimates of the marshall aid commemoration commission provide for the support of marshall scholars in the academic year at a cost of on tuition fees and maintenance out of a total expenditure of <e>", "<cs> i think my lords that the facts of the situation are that local education authorities can recoup per cent <e> <s> of the cost of providing free school milk by claiming the eec subsidy but they will still have to meet the other per cent <e> <s> of the cost which we estimate to be approximately million <e> <s> it is in relation to this charge that they will be free either to recoup or indeed not to provide milk at all <e>", "<cs> my lords there are local education authorities <e> <s> i have not available the figures to provide a breakdown in relation to each authority but if they decline to take the subsidy of course they will not in those circumstances provide the other part of the cost of the milk <e> <s> therefore although they would lose the subsidy they would not have to pay the per cent <e> <s> of the cost which they have to do at present <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not yet received final figures from local authorities <e> <s> it is true that a great many are contemplating abandoning free school milk except for those children who have a medical certificate <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the breakdown of the administration of the service authority by authority but we estimate that the average cost of administration works out at about per cent <e> <s> of the cost of the milk <e>", "<cs> my lords the gross expenditure on milk is about million in round figures <e> <s> the subsidy is approximately million <e> <s> it is true that it attracts rate support grant <e> <s> if one breaks it down as it were to pints of milk it works out at p per pint p for the subsidy and to qualify for the subsidy the local authority must pay a minimum of p a pint <e> <s> this could mean that if an authority decided to charge the charge for the pint of milk could go up to p <e> <s> the difference would have to be borne by the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that a lot of the detailed administration within the schools will be done by the teachers <e> <s> i can only give the cost as it has been estimated to us and the cost of the administration is per cent <e> <s> of the cost of the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer to the noble lord is that of course that famous leader said a great many important and wise things <e> <s> the latest information that i have from the department of health and social services is that the only time when milk is essential is for the young infant up to the age of six months and then it is human milk which is essential or a suitable substitute <e>", "<cs> my lords as i hope my original answer made clear the association is of course perfectly free to express what opinion it chooses <e> <s> i merely give our opinion <e> <s> we believe that if parents wish to contribute to school funds it is perfectly right for them to do so <e> <s> indeed it has been a practice that has gone on for many years <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is quite right in saying that the education act lays a duty on local education authorities to make provision for sufficient and efficient education in their areas <e> <s> i should also explain that in the governments financial proposals relating to the rate support grant settlement for they have provided for real standards of provision in the broad expenditure category which includes capitation allowances that is amounts allowable for books and other teaching materials required to be per cent <e> <s> higher than they were in <e> <s> this in no way alters the fact that where parents wish to contribute voluntarily to school funds it is helpful for them to do so <e> <s> i would entirely accept that it would be quite wrong if any pressure were brought on a parent to <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that we have no firm information on what is happening there is quite a bit of impressionistic information around <e> <s> but the truth of the matter is that when having to make economies local authorities find it easier to make them on matters such as capitation grants rather than on other matters which of course would require a much longer period of time <e>", "<cs> my lords i would entirely support the remarks made by my noble friend <e> <s> we believe that the education service and particularly the supply of books is an extremely important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is rather wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the position is that nottinghamshire local education authority plan to use a college which is at present a college of education where initial teacher training is due to end this year for overseas students and also for british firms involved in the export trade <e> <s> the position with regard to the money would be that provided that it is the local education authoritys firm policy to break even within a specified period of time we would have no reason to take exception to the proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has really addressed herself to lady davids second question <e> <s> it will be better if i referred my answers on adult education in that context <e>", "<cs> my lords the general question on overseas matters is outside the terms of the question which <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness knows as i do that this is a matter for the local education authority to determine <e> <s> they will no doubt take account of the economics and what they expect to do at the end of three years as the numbers build up <e> <s> no doubt they will consider these factors when they take their decisions about it <e>", "<cs> my lords my leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable and learned friend the secretary of state for education and science has recently extended the term of office of the advisory council for adult and continuing education whose remit includes both the review of current practice and the development of future policies and priorities for the education of adults <e> <s> he awaits with interest the reports on these questions due to be presented to him this autumn <e>", "<cs> my lords we have accepted that as there have to be cuts in government expenditure the education service has to bear its share and the adult education service within that has to bear its share <e> <s> however the preliminary returns that we have of the numbers of enrolments of local education authority adult education centres show that there has been an overall reduction of per cent <e> <s> in the november figures compared with <e> <s> nevertheless there is a total increase on the figures for and so there is nothing to suggest that the entire service is crumbling <e> <s> on the second point about the statutory duty section of the education act gives every local education authority the duty of securing in accordance with the schemes of further education or at county colleges the provision for its area and adequate facilities for further education which is defined as <e>", "<cs> the government my lords recognise the great importance of adult education and indeed my right honourable and learned friend the secretary of state has in writing to the chairman of the advisory council asked him to consider the councils future work and particularly how it could best proceed and what its functions should be <e> <s> we believe that this is the right way of proceeding because we like to build on what we have already <e> <s> as i say we have undertaken to do this <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware that in almost every case local education authorities have increased fees for adult education classes <e> <s> this is all part of the economic restraints which we have had to apply to the education service <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should probably ask my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor to reply to this question <e> <s> the fact is that the current enrolments in adult education are estimated for this year at and there are some half a million enrolments for comparable courses at maintained assisted and grant-aided educational establishments <e> <s> this hardly shows that this part of the educational system is collapsing and i hope i have said enough to indicate our great regard for the adult education service and the importance which we attach to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not accept that adult education has not been taken seriously in this country and i should have thought from the number of supplementary questions i have had that all parts of the house would agree with my statement in regard to that <e>", "<cs> my lords we should certainly support any activity such as that <e> <s> these are really matters that are dealt with at local authority level but i am quite certain that we would all support any kind of voluntary activity or activity making use of the talents of people who are not currently in employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it would be impossible to injure the lord chancellor <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it as a great compliment that my colleagues behind me are satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i acknowledge that there is a difference <e> <s> what i am saying is that we are in fact putting the law into what everybody thought it was although in fact it was not <e> <s> we shall have more nursery education when the country is richer and if we all address ourselves to that question then we shall be able to solve the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble viscount lord simon but it is not fair to say that we are abolishing school transport <e> <s> at least million will remain in the form of a subsidy to it and i think it will help if we keep to the facts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble baroness but may i give just one point of clarification <e> <s> the great feature about introducing section proposals on nursery education is that for the very first time they will actually prevent authorities from abolishing a nursery school without going through these procedures <e> <s> until we had this amendment an authority could do just that and there were no means by which statutory objections could be heard by the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to disturb the noble lords train of thought but i did say in my opening remarks that my right honourable friend the secretary of state will be making a statement on the warnock report before we reach the committee stage of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill sits down he said that his economy would be to increase the pupil-teacher ratio in schools because he does not think that it is important or contributes to raising academic standards if one lowers the pupil-teacher ratio <e> <s> would he indicate to the house what he thinks is an acceptable and desirable level of pupil-teacher ratio as that is obviously his alternative given his basic assumption that there must be economies in the education system <e>", "<cs> my lords if i might intervene on that particular point there is nothing to prevent any school governing body including representatives from the tuc or the cbi or anybody else connected with industry or commerce or any activity in the community <e> <s> there is nothing in our proposals to prevent that <e>", "<cs> yes i was <e>", "<cs> my lords we come to the end of a very long debate on <e>", "<cs> my lords i absolutely take the noble baronesss point with which i agree per cent <e> <s> of course there are diseconomies of scale when you have falling rolls <e> <s> the only point i am making is that whereas we are cutting per cent <e> <s> the fall in rolls is in fact per cent <e> <s> and the noble baroness will see that in fact they are not running in parallel entirely because of the point that she has made with which i agree <e> <s> the labour administration indeed was fortunate if that is the correct word to use in that they were able to make a lot of the easier cuts in the education budget very largely on capital expenditure <e> <s> capital expenditure in schools actually fell by per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely accept that <e> <s> i have given the noble baroness the point that it is over the last five years <e> <s> i am not trying to make a party point on this i am merely saying that there have been cuts in administration <e> <s> but she must accept that every time she and her party refer to our economies as if they were the only economies that have been made the economies of the labour administration were greater <e>", "<cs> it is not so my lords <e> <s> the noble lord may not agree with what i say but i hope he will accept that i am not someone who is afraid to say what i think in public or indeed in discussion with anyone else <e> <s> i recognise that the pupil-teacher ratio does matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that the noble and learned lord thinks it is a good gesture <e> <s> there are quite a number of people professionals in the educational world who would think otherwise <e> <s> i have been asked about school milk and it has been said that this is the greatest thing the children could have <e> <s> it is only right to say and this is information i gave to the house when asked a question on this shortly before christmas that the latest view on milk for children in schools is that the only time when milk is essential is for the young infant up to the age of months <e> <s> that is the latest medical opinion <e> <s> i think we can stand on it and say that although it may be desirable and children like drinking milk it is not essential <e>", "<cs> my lords i always agree in thinking that you can get all kinds of medical opinion as you can get all sorts of educational opinion <e> <s> if you search far enough it is surprising what views you can get <e> <s> but when i speak from the dispatch box for the government it is right to put the professional opinion on which i am advised <e> <s> i give it to the house for what it is <e> <s> i shall now move on to the appeals system <e> <s> i listened to the noble baroness lady david with great care <e> <s> i shall read her speech tomorrow in which she explained her appeals committee in cambridge <e> <s> it sounded to me like a model of what we propose in this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall read the speech again and see whether i agree with that statement <e> <s> it seemed to me and her experience is very recent that this was exactly the kind of thing that we are looking for in this matter <e> <s> the noble lord lord stewart of fulham made the point that what we should be doing on appeals is to try to take the example of the best authorities and apply it throughout the country <e> <s> this is what we are trying to do in clauses to <e>", "<cs> my lords that would not be possible <e> <s> if we withdrew clause there would not be a single penny for the education system <e> <s> it comes from a different fund <e> <s> i wish to disillusion noble lords of that idea right at the beginning <e> <s> that is the truth of the matter and noble lords might just as well accept it now <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not dream of speaking for the noble lord lord butler who i am sure can comment on his particular act <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely accept what the noble lord lord butler said <e> <s> i hope the house and the noble lord lord butler will accept the point that i made in my opening remarks <e> <s> no one in could have foreseen the circumstances of the costs going up <e> <s> we are now talking about the real world <e> <s> i am saying to my noble friend the duke of norfolk whose sincerity i absolutely accept in this matter that what is printed in <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable and learned friend the secretary of state for education and science about the warnock report on the special educational needs of handicapped children <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both the noble baroness and the noble lord lord beaumont for the way they have received this statement today <e> <s> not unnaturally both have asked what is going to be the timing of both the white paper and the legislation <e> <s> i think it is only right for me to be quite frank with the house over this matter <e> <s> as noble lords will know and many in this house take a great deal of interest in this subject it is two years since the report of mrs warnock was received <e> <s> we have been carrying out extensive consultations <e> <s> as i indicated we have brought forward the statement particularly so as to have it before the committee stage of the current education bill <e> <s> i cannot anticipate what will be in the next queens speech but i should like to say that the statement refers to early legislation and that means that there will be no unavoidable delay <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord renton for his remarks <e> <s> i can assure him and other noble lords that there is no disagreement between us about the principle that he is evolving <e> <s> we should like to apply as far as possible the principles which are in our current bill to parents of handicapped children <e> <s> there are a number of difficulties of a legal nature in amending our bill to take account of the whole concept of what i would call the warnock framework <e> <s> it is for that reason that we believe that a separate bill is required <e> <s> we will certainly look at the point to see whether it is possible to amend our present bill to go part of the way but i think it would be wrong to say that we could at this stage introduce the whole of the warnock concept into our bill <e> <s> that must wait for later legislation <e> <s> the reason for bringing forward the statement today and indicating our timetable is i hope to assure the house that we have the needs of the handicapped very much in mind and wish to act on the warnock report as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord segal for his support of this statement <e> <s> my colleagues and i recognise the concern of parents of handicapped children <e> <s> it is for this <e>", "<cs> my lords i will note of course certainly what my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls has said on the whole question of tactics <e> <s> my own view about this and that of my colleagues is that this is an extremely important area which is of great concern to a lot of people <e> <s> i believe that it is very necessary to get it right <e> <s> i can assure the house that so faras i and my colleagues are concerned we do not wish for any more delay than the parliamentary timetable would require <e>", "<cs> my lords on this particular point the treasury allowed for additional expenditure on this scheme because it was a commitment in the party manifesto <e>", "<cs> my lords i will tell the noble lord lord davies of leek that in fact we agreed the principle of this scheme in when unfortunately his government decided to phase out the direct grant scheme <e> <s> it was included in our manifestowe included it in the queens speechand we are legislating upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read with great interest everything that has been said in the debate on the second reading of this bill and no doubt we shall have plenty of opportunity to debate it further in the committee proceedings next week <e>", "<cs> i listened with great care to what the noble baroness lady david said on this important matter <e> <s> she rightly said that this amendment and indeed a sequence of amendments has been tabled so this subject will occur from time to time throughout <e>", "<cs> i have been asked a number of very important questions <e> <s> the noble lord lord stewart asked why bring in this part of the bill dealing with school governors <e> <s> as a government we attach very considerable importance to this first part of the bill <e> <s> we are instituting for the first time governing bodies on all secondary and primary schools except that the small ones would be grouped together <e> <s> this seems to me a major advance <e> <s> i served for years on an education committee and i was fortunate to be in a local authority in which all secondary schools had governors and primary schools had managers although the smaller ones were grouped together <e> <s> i therefore grew up in a system in which the importance of school governors was recognised <e>", "<cs> i have not got the information as to whether that school had managers or not but i suspect that it probably did <e>", "<cs> thank you very much i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i believe this is the kind of matter that governors ought to look at <e> <s> we are hoping very much that as we come to discuss the later provisions of school government particularly where we are legislating there will be provision for a minimum of two parents and two teachers and that these people will interlock the local education authority the teachers and the parents in school government and therefore strengthen the situation <e>", "<cs> i agree that in that sense there would be fewer but what the government would be much more inclined to do would be to say that neither should be approved by the secretary of state rather than that both should be approved <e> <s> this would be an alternative which of course is not here <e>", "<cs> i should like to answer the two noble lords in reverse order from that in which they spoke <e> <s> the noble lord lord avebury asked me whether we could not get some kind of parity of treatment between primary and secondary schools and suggested that if we could not get any agreement on the powers of school governing bodies the matter should be left for the local education authorities themselves to decide <e> <s> if in fact that is the wish and it is certainly not a matter which we as a <e>", "<cs> i do not think that there is any disagreement between us on what the noble lords lord parry and lord taylor of blackburn are saying <e> <s> we all know that local government units became larger under the reorganisation of <e> <s> what was pembrokeshire is now known i think as dyfed and it consists of three counties <e> <s> my pronounciation may not be quite correct but i know where the area is <e> <s> the government absolutely accept the importance of the smaller unit the school unit the school governing bodies and that is what all this matter is about and bringing parents and teachers on to governing bodies for the first time <e> <s> i cannot see how government would become less remote if the secretary of state had to approve these articles rather than the local education authority which in this context is of course much nearer than the secretary of state <e> <s> therefore i think that we should all agree on this <e>", "<cs> i should like to say absolutely at the outset how important the government regard the position of special schools to be <e> <s> may i also make it quite clear that clause of course applies the provision of school government to special schools <e> <s> it also includes special schools where possible in a hospital with slightly different provisions because the circumstances are slightly different as everyone who is familiar with these schools will know <e> <s> however we have gone as far as we can <e>", "<cs> i think undoubtedly there was considerable consultation <e> <s> i was not myself a member of the warnock committee but i have no doubt that voluntary bodies gave evidence to that committee and that they were consulted <e> <s> but when the government come to legislate upon an important issue like this i think it would be wrong for us to agree to an amendment which concerns a non-maintained school which is run by an organisation such as doctor barnardos or the national institutes for the blind or the deaf without consulting them <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord lord taylor would accept that <e>", "<cs> may i first apologise to the noble baroness lady masham <e> <s> i am sorry that i did not answer her question <e> <s> the fact is that all non-maintained special schools must have governing bodies as a condition of being recognised as special schools under the handicapped pupils and special schools regulations of <e> <s> so i apologise to her for not giving that information <e> <s> of course i have listened very carefully to what she and the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth have said on this subject <e>", "<cs> and i think if i may say so that this is right <e> <s> we should be greatly criticised for introducing legislation and not having discussions with the bodies concerned which are obviously crucial to these schools <e> <s> we should be legislating upon the schools without discussing with the people most concerned with them <e> <s> but that is in no way to get away from the essential point with which the committee is concerned <e>", "<cs> no we have not had the discussions and i would not wish to pursue this matter further <e> <s> i am most grateful to my noble friend lord vaizey for agreeing to withdraw this amendment and i hope that with those assurances the committee will accept that we shall certainly take these points into consideration on a future bill <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to what the noble lord lord beaumont has said in moving his amendment which i understand is a paving amendment for no <e> <s> <e> <s> as he will know the model instrument of governors for county schools does in fact provide what he would like to achieve and this represents standard practice throughout <e>", "<cs> i intervene in this debate because i should like to make a <e>", "<cs> about speeches ago i was last on my feet arguing a point <e> <s> i will try to pick up where i left off <e> <s> i am perfectly well aware that this section of the bill does not deal with the school curriculum <e> <s> i made the point because it is the other half of the argument and we ought not to lose sight of what is going on and what the staff of the school could do <e> <s> i make it because i do not recognise that this section of the bill is concerned with school governors <e>", "<cs> if that is the case there is nothing in the bill to prevent that from happening <e> <s> what we are arguing for as my noble friend lord bellwin made perfectly clear in his remarks is the least prescription and the maximum flexibility <e> <s> what noble lords opposite are arguing for is a much more prescriptive form of governing body in which there would be less flexibility and in which local authorities would be bound to find these suitable representatives for every single school <e>", "<cs> i entirely understand the view of the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> it is her view that this amendment should be made and if she takes that view she must press it <e> <s> perhaps i used i accept the remarks of the noble viscount lord simon the wrong word when i said that the amendment was prescriptive <e> <s> at the risk of repetition i would say again what my noble friend lord bellwin said that in relation to school governors everybody has ideas as to who would be the right sort of representative person to have on a governing body <e> <s> it is perfectly clear from the later amendments that there are all sorts of other ideas including having a pupil on the governing body <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord beaumont is asking for two parent governors in voluntary aided schools <e> <s> subsection of the bill provides as in the case of county schools that only one of these parents needs to be elected from the body of the parents <e> <s> the noble lord <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to strengthen the point made by lord beaumont on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness lady david will accept that the bill as drafted ensures that there will be two parent governors in voluntary aided schools <e> <s> what she is saying is that the parent governor appointed by the foundation should be able to serve beyond the moment at which his child has left the school but that the length of time beyond which the parent should serve would be limited <e>", "<cs> we intend to see that it will be a short period of time <e> <s> however if we were to accept the amendment as drafted it would mean that a parent with more than one child in the school would have to cease to be a governor not more than months after the eldest child left the school notwithstanding the fact that one or more children were still in the school <e> <s> therefore the amendment as worded would not have the desired effect <e>", "<cs> it would not be done by identifying the particular parent <e> <s> it would be undertaken through the instruments of government which would lay down the period of time <e>", "<cs> i should make clear that in the case of voluntary schools the secretary of state makes the instrument <e> <s> he can lay down the period of time <e> <s> we are arguing a narrow point on which in principle we are agreed <e> <s> perhaps the noble baroness will allow me to write to her setting out how this matter will work <e>", "<cs> the way in which it will work is that the secretary of state will make instruments of government for voluntary schools <e> <s> we are committed to the principle of two parents on these <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether this is a convenient moment as we have just completed this amendment to adjourn the committee stage of the education bill for one hour <e>", "<cs> i can give the noble lord lord stewart of fulham an assurance on this point <e> <s> the amendment is quite unnecessary <e> <s> parent throughout the bill has the meaning ascribed to it by section of the education act which says <e>", "<cs> yes i am glad to give that assurance and i shall cover the matter in my letter <e>", "<cs> the particular point raised in this amendment is i think slightly different from the point upon which i said that i would write to the noble baroness <e> <s> however i can assure her that the amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> the bill as i indicated to the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley earlier provides that the governing body of a voluntary aided or special agreement school must include a parent appointed as a foundation governor under subsection <e>", "<cs> i must confess that when i saw this amendment i did not quite understand the purpose of the noble lord lord stewart in tabling it but i now understand that he wants an explanation as to what this clause really means <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord brooks of tremorfa seems to feel that i am unable to say anything on this amendment <e> <s> it is not that i am unable to say anything but rather than i feel that we have had rather a diffuse discussion <e> <s> it has gone backwards and forwards on a number of issues which are not really relevant to the point at issue <e> <s> the government have designed a bill in order to have by statute school governing bodies and we have decided as a matter of principle that there should be the minimum prescription about them <e> <s> we have proposed to include parents which the noble lord lord james of rusholme may feel is a little trendy but which we believe recognises what is a great social fact of today <e> <s> we have included teachers because we believe in the importance of the teachers as the backbone of the education system and we recognise for all the arguments that have been adduced on this matter the importance of the teachers as part of school life <e>", "<cs> i have of course listened very carefully to all the arguments that have been put up on this amendment <e> <s> may i say right away that the warnock proposals do not in fact apply to this amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth would appreciate when i made this point earlier that in fact we have included maintained special schools in the governing body provisions under this clause <e> <s> what we were talking about before were the non-maintained special schools and that is a quite separate issue one which would come under our proposals that we hope to present to parliament later in the form of a bill concerned with the warnock report <e>", "<cs> that is a very splendid welsh argument <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i would put it in that way <e> <s> however at this time of night i do not intend to debate greek logic <e> <s> in setting out all our proposals about government we have said that there should be two parents and two teachers and this will apply to special schools <e> <s> there would be two parents of children in the school who would obviously have first-hand and close experience of dealing with their own handicapped children who are in the school <e> <s> there would also be two teachers of the special school again two persons with close and very detailed knowledge of the school <e>", "<cs> the answer to that question is that our intention where possible is that there should always be two teachers <e> <s> perhaps i should write to the noble baroness if there were to be special schools of a smaller size than that but it would be our intention that every <e>", "<cs> first i should like to answer the point made by the noble baroness lady masham of ilton <e> <s> in fact i realise of course the question she was asking <e> <s> where it is a small special school under the provisions of clause there would only be one teacher governor because it has fewer than pupils <e> <s> that would be the position <e> <s> i am sorry that i misled her and i wish to correct that right away <e>", "<cs> i shall take it as a compliment that he thinks i am sufficiently clever to think of it but odd as it may seem to him and to other noble lords opposite i and my colleagues frequently listen to what is said in this house <e> <s> we listen particularly to the experts of whom there are a great many and i do not number myself as an expert on this subject but as somebody who is just very interested in it and particularly on the question of handicapped children and handicapped adults <e> <s> there are many people in the house who know a great deal about it and one theme which has run like a common thread throughout it is the idea that everybody should be treated as far as possible in the same way <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what the noble lord lord davies of leek has said on this matter <e> <s> if he looks further down clause he will see that subsection would of course permit the inclusion of a representative of the non-teaching staff or any other person who was thought appropriate to be a member of the school governing body <e> <s> i think that he would find that if the school governors or the local education authority wished to include a representative from the non-teaching staff they could do so under that particular subsection <e>", "<cs> it is very good of the noble lord lord davies of leek to enlarge my vocabulary <e> <s> i shall certainly read <e>", "<cs> in the provisions that we have made on school government there is nothing whatever to prevent any authority that wishes to have pupil governors from putting them on governing bodies <e> <s> the provisions have been so drawn as to allow this <e> <s> it is for the education authority to decide in its own local circumstances whether or not there should be pupil governors on the governing body of a school <e> <s> we left it in this way and i must say that i was surprised when i saw this amendment because it is directly contrary to the view taken by the last administration in the consideration of their education bill in committee last year when they did not support this proposal <e>", "<cs> i think i am quoting the noble lord lord davies exactly when i recall that he said i am dominated by the logic of this amendment and i only wish really that he was <e> <s> the truth is that i am not sure that he is from what he has said <e> <s> it is in fact not a permissive power he is asking for because as the noble baroness lady masham has quite rightly pointed out his amendment says shall include so this is not permissive but obligatory in this sense <e>", "<cs> it seems to me now that we have reached seven minutes to eleven oclock that there is not time to do justice to a further amendment tonight <e> <s> if it is the wish of your lordships therefore i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord stewart of fulham said that he wants to know what are the governments intentions in regard to this particular subsection of the clause <e> <s> the effect of his amendment would be to hasten the implementation of this part of the bill regarding changes in the government of schools <e> <s> if carried the amendment would have the effect of applying this part of the act immediately it is brought into effect <e> <s> in all the matters that we are considering in the bill we arc having regard to the effects of public expenditure and we recognise that there attaches to the school government provisions the possibility of increased expenditure by way of clerking of committees and so on i sec that we have other amendments on this matter <e> <s> it would only be right to draw the committees attention to this point <e>", "<cs> at this stage i would not wish to be drawn into stating a timetable on this <e> <s> we have said that we want to bring this provision into effect as quickly as resources will allow and we certainly would not expect it to drag on for several years with nothing happening <e> <s> clearly we shall move in close consultation with our colleagues with regard to how the local authorities wish to proceed on these matters <e> <s> i should not wish to go beyond what i have said <e> <s> we do not wish this matter to be unduly delayed but on the other hand with regard to all that we are to say on all the subsequent clauses of the bill we recognise the economic constraints under which we are all working <e>", "<cs> i understand perfectly the point the noble baroness lady david is making <e> <s> in inserting this particular subsection we have tried to ensure that governing bodies by having one parent and one teacher from each of a number of grouped schools will not become too large <e> <s> it is our intention eventually to move to the stage at which every school has its own governing body <e> <s> we have had this arrangement whereby two can be grouped together and if more than two are to be grouped together this can be done only with the approval of the secretary of state <e> <s> but it is possible under the proposals <e> <s> if the amendment of the noble baroness were to be carried this would then mean three parents and three teachers on the governing body and we would be getting a much larger governing body <e> <s> while i see the point she is making i hope she will accept that we hope that these are as it were transitional arrangements and that we do not want governing bodies which could become too large <e> <s> i hope that with that explanation the noble baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the position we should like to arrive at is that each school would have its own governing body but we accept that in the meantime there will be cases where it would be more sensible to group <e> <s> local authorities do not have to group <e> <s> there is no compulsion about it but under the bill they are allowed to group two schools together <e> <s> my noble friend lord bellwin identified the sort of situation we were thinking of in regard to an infant and a junior school which would be an obviously sensible grouping <e> <s> many of us can think of instances where it might be sensible to group for example an infant a junior and a primary school together <e> <s> this would be possible but it requires the agreement of the secretary of state because we do not wish to encourage larger grouping <e>", "<cs> under the terms of the bill there would be a governing <e>", "<cs> on this particular point i think the noble lord lord stewart would recognise that on these matters we should consult quite widely about the grounds on which the regulations would be made <e> <s> these would be subject to consultation with those who are concerned <e> <s> i think it would be difficult to lay down in statute form as the noble lord has suggested the list of matters that might have to be considered <e>", "<cs> it may be for the convenience of the committee if i speak <e>", "<cs> i wanted to clear this point with the noble baroness lady stewart but i will answer the point on clause <e> <s> the difficulty that we find ourselves in in this new clause that the noble lord lord mishcon has proposed is that he is laying down the duties in relation to school governors in the six different subsections that he has proposed <e> <s> when we introduced this bill my right honourable friend the secretary of state made it quite clear that we did not intend at this stage to legislate about the powers of governing bodies <e> <s> indeed he may recall that the former secretary of state mrs shirley williams acknowledged the difficulties about legislating on powers when she introduced the education bill in another place <e>", "<cs> i think the first and most important point to remember is that if this amendment were to be accepted it would of course apply both to county and voluntary-aided schools <e> <s> as the noble lord will appreciate the position of governors of county schools is rather different from that of governors of voluntary-aided schools because in particular governors of those schools are in law personally liable for their actions and could be thus held to have a pecuniary interest in almost any matter even though in most cases any cost arising would in practice be met by the maintaining authority or from trust funds or would be covered by insurance <e> <s> there is therefore a difference between the two types of governors <e>", "<cs> of course i am fully aware of the point made by the noble lord lord shinwell both about cases of corruption in local government and the issues that could possibly arise over school governing bodies though it is much less likely than other possibilities <e> <s> perhaps <e>", "<cs> as this discussion has progressed i have become conscious <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is quite right in saying this is an important amendment <e> <s> it does show the divide <e>", "<cs> yes i take that point but what we have done is not only give parents the right to express a choice but in clause we have given the right of automatic recoupment <e> <s> the noble baroness will be familiar enough with the difficulties of recoupment of costs from one education authority to another to realise that clause by itself would be quite ineffective without clause which gives the guarantee of automatic recoupment <e> <s> this will give a great deal of choice of schools to a number of parents <e> <s> that is the first group of parents <e>", "<cs> i am sure it is very unwise of me to embark on an argument about teaching in welsh with the noble lord lord heycock <e> <s> all i am saying is that i believe all parents in wales also ought to be able to express a choice and under our bill they will be able to do so whether in gwynedd or glamorgan <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord had restrained himself until i had finished my argument i would have answered this point and i will answer it now <e> <s> the parents who actually have choice at the moment are those who can afford to pay a point made frequently in your lordships house and one that no doubt will be made at greater length later this evening <e> <s> i have known rich parents sending their children to maintained schools who have decided to buy a house in the catchment area of the most popular school <e> <s> they too are in the fortunate position of exercising choice <e> <s> but a lot of other parents who are not well off and who do not choose to send their children to independent schools and are unable to buy a house and move where they wish surely are entitled to exercise choice <e> <s> i think it is a deplorable attitude to a lot of parents to take the view that they are unable to exercise choice <e> <s> if the noble lord lord brooks looks at clause he will see that subsection is qualified by subsection <e> <s> this answers the point made by the noble lord lord alexander <e> <s> subsection <e>", "<cs> i should be delighted <e>", "<cs> my lords clause the first of this whole sequence of clauses is designed to enable a parent to express a preference <e> <s> i have already indicated that because of the recoupment provisions the parents may express a preference in another authoritys area <e> <s> at the same time clause requires information about schools so that a parent can make an informed choice <e> <s> clause contains the appeal procedures <e> <s> i am very sorry that i have caused the noble lord lord donaldson to lose his temper <e> <s> indeed i hope that he will not do so <e> <s> i can assure him that i shall not lose my temper no matter how cross he becomes <e>", "<cs> first i should like to finish what i was saying to the noble lord lord donaldson <e> <s> i believe that we are fulfilling a commitment <e> <s> i accept and it would not be right for me to say other that we cannot provide complete parental choice for everybody but that does not prevent us from trying to give as much as we can <e> <s> there is no doubt at all that as parents nowadays take a much greater interest in their childrens education in a rather more professional and more sophisticated way than they did in for example it is quite right that they should have these provisions included in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i fully understand the question asked by the noble lord <e> <s> it is an absolute right of a parent to express a prefernce and that stands in clause <e> <s> it is an absolute right to have information about the school in order that the preference shall be an informed preference <e> <s> i have said that one cannot guarantee that every preference will be fulfilled but we are going as far as we can in that regard <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry to interrupt the noble baroness but when we discuss clause which deals with appeals procedure she will see that that is not the provision in the bill <e>", "<cs> the answer is yes because it would be contained under clause and the phrase <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure that i am with the noble lord lord taylor of blackburn over his question <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord taylor is quite right <e> <s> i thank him very much for drawing it to my attention <e>", "<cs> as i understand this amendment and i think there are other amendments linked to it what the noble baroness lady david is asking for is a return to the proposals on planned admission limits which were in her own administrations bill <e> <s> one of the difficulties which we found when looking at these proposals was that once the admission limits had been set to particular schools they were in fact unchallengeable <e> <s> we feel that this is not an acceptable situation for parents to be in <e> <s> we believe this to be arbitrary and contrary to the best interests of the parents <e>", "<cs> among the published provisions on schools which they will have to give will be the numbers of children that they admit and this will be one of the criteria <e> <s> everyone will know that this is one of the criteria to be laid down <e> <s> nobody is arguing that there should be sick schools <e> <s> no one would wish to have that at all <e> <s> but to argue to the contrary of that that every school should have a planned admission limit and that parents will not be able in any way to alter this limit once it is set regardless of any arguments that they may be able to adduce because the number is set is not a satisfactory situation <e> <s> i cannot believe that the noble baroness herself thinks that it is <e>", "<cs> my noble friends amendment is prompted by a concern which i recognise of some members of the local authority associations to ensure that they are fully informed where pupils from their area are being educated in the schools of other authorities <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will accept the explanation that we believe that his amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> authorities will know what their neighbouring authorities are doing because of the information that neighbouring authorities will be required to publish under clause of the bill <e> <s> it has not been a requirement of authorities before this bill and therefore it will be published and each authority will know what its neighbour is doing <e> <s> there is nothing to prevent local education authorities discussing further one with anotherbut <e>", "<cs> it may be for the convenience of the committee if the house do now resume <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i find it very difficult to add anything as regards this amendment to what i said when we discussed amendment no <e> <s> moved by the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> these are a series of linked amendments on planned admission limits <e> <s> i indicated then that our attitude to planned admission limits was not that of the previous government <e> <s> there are only two new points that i can contribute as regards this particular amendment <e> <s> for us there would be two difficult features of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> one is that the limits for aided and special agreement schools will be determined by the local education authority a restriction on their freedom which was rejected last year because of course under the terms of our bill admissions will be determined by the governors <e> <s> we feel that this is a desirable advance on the matter <e> <s> the second feature is that limits would apply <e>", "<cs> i think that there are two answers to the matters raised by the noble baroness <e> <s> the first is that under the provisions of clause dealing with information a school will give the numbers that it expects to admit <e> <s> that will be one of the characteristics of the school so that people would know it <e> <s> it is not an absolute number because a parent would have the right to go to an appeal committee on such a matter <e> <s> the local authority will also have to consider the efficient use of resources and theefficient use of education terms which i am sure will be familiar to the noble baroness and others because they are after all taken from the act <e>", "<cs> exactly but many of these matters are difficult to define <e> <s> i accept the other point that rolls will fall <e> <s> we all know that there will be a million fewer children in the school population between now and <e> <s> one of the consequences of that will be that many schools will have to close simply because the numbers inevitably fall <e> <s> what we are saying as regards this matter is that one cannot say as is sometimes said as regards these difficult decisions that if a school is over-subscribed and very popular we must either close it or split it up and distribute its pupils around a number of other places an argument that i have heard advanced in some of the school closure programmes when obviously these are good schools or schools at any rate that are greatly desired by the parents which suggests that the parents think they are good schools <e> <s> therefore i think that we should look at the whole question of closures and all these other matters on their merits <e> <s> we take into account the official information given about the school and we take into account the authorities efficient use of resources and efficient use of education <e> <s> this is not exactly a jigsaw puzzle that we are spelling out explaining or putting together in a bill but we are allowing a certain amount of flexibility <e>", "<cs> naturally we have given a great deal of attention to this clause and i can assure the noble lord that it has all been discussed with the local authority associations and that they have accepted it and the way in which it will work <e> <s> they think that it will enable local education authorities to plan sensibly <e> <s> it is for that reason that i think it is perfectly possible to give both a chance for a parent to express a preference and for the local authority to plan sensibly <e> <s> i am not at all sure that i followed the point about the comprehensive school in the <e>", "<cs> i understand from what the noble lord lord stewart has <e>", "<cs> having listened to the noble baroness lady david saying that we have gone too far and to the noble lord lord beaumont saying that we have gone nothing like far enough i think we may conclude that somewhere in the centre we have got it about right <e> <s> may i say that when the noble lord lord alexander said and i hope i am quoting him correctly that the main purpose of this bill is economy that is not quite true <e> <s> one of the purposes of this bill is to face the reality of our economic situation as a country <e> <s> to us the most important parts of the bill are those on school government and parental preference <e> <s> these clauses represent clauses and and it would be quite wrong to think that the bill is concerned only with economics <e>", "<cs> the intention regarding the appeals committee which is under schedule is that it will have an independent chairman and that those who serve on it will not be councillors who took the original decision although they could he other members of the education committee or other members of the council <e> <s> we must recognise that the decision of the appeals committee will be binding on the local authority and as in so many of these cases it would he quite wrong we believe to set up a committee with those powers which could override the elected authority in circumstances in which they were not in a position because they had to take ultimate responsibility for the education system to be a party to that decision <e> <s> we hope that in the <e>", "<cs> no it would notit would be a separate committee <e>", "<cs> i would refer the noble lord lord heycock to schedule which we shall be discussing and which sets out the details of this <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley <e> <s> i am very pleased that he and his colleagues recognise that there is a real purpose in this section of the bill <e>", "<cs> i have many more friends than that i am glad to say <e> <s> i hope we are friends but i have other friends as well <e> <s> this appeals procedure <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to hear it <e> <s> it is obviously a very good system <e> <s> when we are talking about large conurbations where there are a great many problems with a great deal of choice of opportunity of different types of school to go to parents feel strongly if they do not get an opportunity to put their case to an appeal committee <e> <s> i appreciate the sincerity of the noble lord lord boyle <e> <s> when he was minister he had to deal with these mattersbut he himself has said that that was in <e> <s> one fact is that as time has gone on more parents have become more involved in the whole question of the schools and when we have the question of a variety of comprehensive schools that in itself makes the whole issue of choice more important <e>", "<cs> if i may clear up a misunderstanding they are committees of the council they are not sub-committees <e>", "<cs> i should like to answer the rather narrower point raised by the noble lord lord davies of leek about the council on tribunals <e> <s> in fact this was added to the bill in another place and as i understand it the council on tribunals which consists only of about people in fact would be looking at the way the system works and would have nothing whatever to say on the particular merits of the case <e> <s> anything that it wished to discuss about any particular appeal committee and system and how it worked it would discuss through the local authority associations <e> <s> the chances that any one of its members would be visiting an appeal committee as there are only about members in all i should think would he very small indeed <e> <s> so i do not think one needs to feel that in any way we are setting up great legalistic committees <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the amendment seeks to require local education authorities and governors to give preference in their published policy to siblings and to those children who can most easily get to the school <e> <s> with reference in particular to the first part of the amendment dealing with siblings as a generality where there is already one child at a school schools tend to look favourably upon other members of the family <e> <s> this is a general rule with which i think we would all agree <e>", "<cs> my advice is that this amendment seeks to require local authorities to give preference <e> <s> they would not in those circumstances be compelled always to do this <e> <s> we are asking schools both county and voluntary to give information about themselves to parents <e> <s> what would be required would be information about their admissions policy <e> <s> it is not for us to lay down in statute what that policy should be <e> <s> this amendment is seeking to give information to the parents <e> <s> clearly the information would be different in the case of county schools and voluntary schools <e> <s> parents are interested in the variety of the schools and in the differences between them <e> <s> it is necessary that there should be a statement about admissions policy although not what that policy should be <e>", "<cs> i always listen with great care to my honourable friend dr boyson <e> <s> i do not think the serious point about this amendment is the drafting and for tonights purposes we could leave that argument aside <e> <s> i put it in because i thought it was only right to give the noble baroness lady stewart all the arguments that we were adducing about this amendment but i do not think the importance is in the drafting <e> <s> the important thing is the matter of principle <e>", "<cs> the amendment is seeking to find out what it is that we are proposing to put in the regulations and to debate generally the whole question of information that schools would produce <e> <s> what we are seeking in this clause is that information will be given to parents as a basis for their choice of schools in which their children will have to be educated and this should not be left entirely to the discretion of leas or governors in the case of voluntary schools <e> <s> at the present time this is in fact the situation <e> <s> the situation is not entirely satisfactory <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> the exact details of how it will be done will be still subject to consultation <e> <s> whether or not it was done by the local education authority or by individual schools i think would be a matter for discussion and the exact form is something we have not yet determined upon <e> <s> clearly we would need to discuss it <e> <s> certainly we have not ruled out that the publication would be by the local education authority <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord lord shinwell <e> <s> in fact what we are discussing is clause of the bill which makes the important proposal that schools must publish information about themselves and the amendment that has just been moved by the noble baroness lady david is asking for information about what will be contained in the regulations which will govern the type of information which the schools must produce about themselves <e>", "<cs> it might be for the convenience of the committee if i answered the point which was raised by the noble lord lord avebury on a former amendment because we did not conclude that discussion as the committee would have wished <e> <s> we are not suggesting the term raw results a term which was used by the noble lord lord stewart of fulham and the noble lord lord james of rusholme <e> <s> we have not yet reached any final conclusion on the form which the publication will take <e> <s> however we should like to do two things <e> <s> i entirely agree with the point which has been made on all sides of the committee that parents need to be informed about the staff of a school and the things which it feels it does well <e> <s> a school may have a member of staff who is particularly good at music or at drama or at sports <e> <s> if that is so it should say so <e> <s> that is the sort of information that parents like to have <e> <s> it should certainly provide information about the staffand we are over-emphasising examination results <e> <s> that is just a part of the whole and it would be quite wrong to think that that is the one thing that will be decisive <e>", "<cs> much of this information is in fact already published <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that the building would be a capital cost <e> <s> the capitation allowance is an annual sum which is allowable through the rate-support grant and partly through the rates for books and equipmentequipment is quite widely defined as the sort of <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lady faithfull for making this point because i entirely accept from the noble baroness lady david that it does seem unexpected that having asked for the publication of information about other schools we should have excluded nursery schools <e> <s> we have clone so because we have considered whether information about nursery schools should be published in some different form <e> <s> however we concluded after considering the matter that the balance of advantage would lie in not requiring local authorities to publish this information and we would take that view precisely for the reasons given by my noble friend lady faithfull <e>", "<cs> i must say that i had not noticed that the clock had not moved <e> <s> no doubt time has stood still during the committee proceedings on this bill <e> <s> we have all been so engrossed in what we are doing that at least we have not been watching the clock <e>", "<cs> may i say at the outset of my reply that i feel a great <e>", "<cs> i absolutely take that point <e> <s> i will try to explain in as much detail as i can why it is that we are in this particular position <e> <s> there are three parts of the education act which apply to special schools and special education <e> <s> they are sections <e>", "<cs> my understanding and again i must be very frank with the committee over this matter is that section of the act was inserted into that bill at precisely this kind of stage of the proceedings of the act <e> <s> it has led to a number of complications and as the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth rightly says it has not been implemented <e> <s> that is because the warnock committee has been sitting and furthermore as it stands it raises the legal complications i have outlined <e> <s> those remain with us and in fact putting that into the bill has not had the effect that was desired <e> <s> now that we have had this debate and everyone recognises the strength of feeling here and the points that have been made these will all be taken into consideration and i hope it will not be too long before the house is able to debate a white paper on the warnock report <e> <s> but the section proposals show the kind of difficulties one gets into by taking an amendment at a particular stage without going into all the consequences of it <e> <s> it is for that reason that i have tried to explain as fully as i can to the committee the situation as i understand it <e>", "<cs> it is not as easy as that <e> <s> it sounds as though it should be straightforward but if we took that course we would ignore entirely the conceptual framework of the warnock report <e>", "<cs> of course not <e> <s> it is quite possible for the local authority in the area of my noble friend lord swinton to undertake all these matters <e> <s> it is possible for an authority to produce information and to have the non-statutory appeals system <e> <s> that is permissible <e> <s> we <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry it i have not made myself clear to the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> what i am saying is that if this amendment is carried we shall he placing on local education authorities the requirements under clauses to in this bill at the same time as they also have a statutory requirement under the education act <e> <s> if <e>", "<cs> it is not at all surprising that the report of mrs warnock did not include the proposals that we have put into our bill in clauses to <e> <s> mrs warnocks report was concerned with the provision for handicapped children but she could not possibly have anticipated what we were going to put into our bill <e>", "<cs> and if i may say so to noble lords opposite they have just been very critical of them <e> <s> so i really do not think that they are in a position to criticise what i am saying at the moment <e> <s> in what i have called the warnock bill we shall be talking about the new conceptual framework of mrs warnock and we shall as i have already indicated in the statement that <e>", "<cs> may i say two things to the noble lord lord vaizey <e> <s> so far as the introduction is concerned he said that one could solve the problem of the contradictions by the date upon which the bill is introduced <e> <s> the fact is that so long as there are two contradictory requirements on local education authorities no one will benefit from clauses to whether in ordinary schools or in special schools <e> <s> that will be the effect of pressing this amendment <e> <s> i have given as much of an assurance to the committee on the warnock proposals as i can and i have said that i will look <e>", "<cs> this amendment which has been moved by my noble friend lord ridley would provide that the process of publishing proposals <e>", "<cs> we accept that there is a great divide between both sides of the committee on the assisted places scheme <e> <s> perhaps i may correct what i think are clearly two misunderstandings about the scheme <e> <s> it is not that i expect to convince the noble lord lord donaldson but i think it is right that it should go down on the record <e> <s> he first asked how this scheme would apply <e> <s> we have in fact published our proposals on the income scale and assisted places will be available only to parents who qualify for the income scale and there can be no question of anybody who does not qualify on the income scale having an assisted place <e>", "<cs> i am sorry for not giving the noble lord that information but it was not clear from his amendment that that was what he required <e> <s> we see the scheme working in this way at present a number of schools have applied to join the schemethey will be subject to approval by the inspectorate as having the right facilities and able to offer the kind of education we are talking about <e> <s> we expect the parents will apply when the schools are approved the list is published and the information is knownthat they will be subject to an income scalethat they will be subject to the test applied by the school to make sure we are talking about academically qualified children <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has asked me how we see children being selected for this scheme and how it would be known whether they were academically suitable <e> <s> we see the selection taking place through the school itself and its selection procedures <e> <s> we would recognise that its selection procedures were of a sufficiently rigorous standard because for the purposes of the scheme the school itself would have had to be approved by the department and in that sense it would mean the inspectorate <e> <s> clearly if for example a school did not have a sixth form it would not qualify <e> <s> similarly it might not have a good academic record it might not offer a good spread of subjects at a level it might not be the kind of school that offered what would be accepted as a high academic standard as measured by its examination results the a level subjects that it could teach and its record <e> <s> all these facts are available and can be sought <e> <s> attributes along those lines would be the kind we would he looking for <e>", "<cs> i do not think that we see there being in any sense a kind of national plus in this instance <e> <s> i think it would he found that the schools we are thinking of are not schools which are scratching around for pupils to go to them <e> <s> on the whole they are schools which are already well subscribedpeople think highly of them and they are therefore in a position to command a reasonably high entrance requirement <e> <s> we would see them as setting their own entrance requirementsand in this way we see the entrants being taken at the level of the school <e>", "<cs> i see the scheme working in the following way <e> <s> the schools will be selected and a very large proportion of those that have expressed an <e>", "<cs> we really ought to get the financing of this scheme straight <e> <s> the proposal under the bill is that it will start not before september which would he the earliest possible time at a level of million <e> <s> within the whole of the context of the public expenditure we have been discussing and within the whole of the context of the public expenditure in the bill this scheme is not operating at all <e> <s> i quoted in my second reading speech that this year we are spending million on those pupils who are still in the sixth form of the direct grant schools i am not sure that i understood the noble lord lord parrys last question but it is important to recognise that while we still have pupils in the sixth forms of direct grant schools no maintained school is currently being affected in any way by the fact that those pupils are still there and are being paid for <e> <s> therefore the whole question of whether or not these schools can exist side by side does not arise <e> <s> they are existing side by side perfectly happily <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure what the noble lord lord parry means by a school being enriched by the scheme <e> <s> the most the school would gain by the scheme would be to have one pupil or more pupils as the case might he <e> <s> suppose for the sake of argument the school decided and it would he for the school to determine how many places it would take up that it would take up pupils it would then have pupils paid for as assisted places <e> <s> the sort of schools which would he considered under <e>", "<cs> almost certainly the child who is going to be eligible for the assisted place will be in a primary school <e> <s> it could well be as the noble viscount lord simon has suggested that the school itself might suggest that the child should qualify for one or it could be the parent <e> <s> either route would be perfectly acceptable under the scheme <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord stewart is clearly determined to bring us back to the central matter of principle about the assisted places scheme <e> <s> he has explained why he dislikes it <e> <s> may i illustrate from my personal experience one reason why i think we should support it <e> <s> he will perhaps know that i indicated earlier that my husband was a don <e> <s> recently his college has spent a lot of time meeting heads of comprehensive schools in order to attract more children from comprehensive schools to his college <e> <s> at a recent meeting one head teacher said i am sorrywe cannot teach the children to the entrance requirements <e> <s> in order for them to be sent there you must lower your standards <e> <s> the outcome is of no concern to us <e> <s> i am saying that there are comprehensive schools which cannot meet these kinds of standards <e> <s> it does not matterwe are not concerned about the schools but about the opportunities for the child <e> <s> this does not happen all over the country <e> <s> i do not tell this to score points off comprehensive schools <e> <s> they have great difficulties which i am prepared to accept <e> <s> we are concerned about able children who are not getting always the opportunities that they should get <e> <s> i think it right at a time when we need to develop the best brains of our country that we should give everybody these kinds of opportunity <e>", "<cs> i have never denied it <e> <s> we have said consistently that when the scheme is fully operational we expect it will cost something like that <e> <s> but i was not prepared to accept from the noble lord lord parry that it was going to cost million next year <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> the point that was being made was that the school was unable to teach up to the standard that was required <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should say to the noble lord lord parry that i have not those figures with me <e> <s> there are two separate figures he is asking for one is what the government paid to the direct grant schools and the other is what the local authorities paid through the pooling arrangements for the take-up <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be for the convenience of the <e>", "<cs> yes i do apologise <e> <s> the answer is that we have not yet fixed an upper limit for the fee per year <e> <s> i hope the noble baroness will understand when i say that of course the amount which would have to be paid for an assisted place would depend upon the income of the parents <e>", "<cs> so it would not he the poorest who would have to pay the full fee <e> <s> but the answer is no we have not yet settled it <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord spens has said he was good enough to write to me on this subject and tell me that he would in fact be raising this matter on this clause in the bill <e> <s> the difficulty about this proposal is that the scheme that we have in mind is for children of high academic ability who would in fact benefit from the sort of academic education which the former direct grant grammar schools and other good non-maintained schools could provide <e> <s> the fact is that the direct grant scheme did not provide for pupils receiving primary education and much as i sympathise with the aims and achievements particularly of choir schools without which the whole country would be greatly impoverished i am afraid that i cannot hold out any hope of the scheme at this point being extended to choir schools <e> <s> i am quite sure that the noble lord lord donaldson does not support this in principle because of course his government have kept the direct grant scheme for the yehudi menuhin school and the royal ballet school <e> <s> so it is not in fact that he disapproves of it in principle but that he does not agree with applying it for academic talentsonly for music and dancing <e>", "<cs> wish to make it clear that boarding fees are not included in the scheme at all <e>", "<cs> i see that it would be difficult in these circumstances because the assisted place would be paid for on the day fees it would only be paid for a person who had qualified on the incomes scale and it would seem to be difficult for a person qualifying on the incomes scale to afford the boarding fees <e>", "<cs> no we have not said that <e>", "<cs> i feel that we have had one of these debates calculated even at am to stimulate the entire committee <e> <s> it is something about which we all feel strongly <e> <s> the assisted places scheme to which as i indicated at second reading we attach great importance was a commitment in our manifesto was repeated in the queens speech and is now translated into legislation <e> <s> i have listened with interest to all the speeches made about it <e> <s> i am very grateful for the remarks of the noble lord lord morison and grateful too for the remarks by the right reverend prelate the bishop of norwich who speaks from a great deal of experience in these matters and is very knowledgeable from his own personal experience of the maintained system the direct grant system and the independent schools <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i have not quite answered the noble viscount precisely <e> <s> at this hour it is sometimes a little difficult to have all the points correctly <e> <s> however what he is saying which i am sure is true is that whereas some inevitably do very well others do not do as well <e> <s> what we are attempting to do in this scheme is in fact to extend opportunity <e> <s> it is completely ironic when the noble lord wedderburn talks about class distinctions and divisive monopoly and all this particularly in the house of lords <e> <s> after all both he and i are life peers and no doubt some years ago never expected to find ourselves in this circumstance at all <e>", "<cs> as the scheme becomes known we shall of course publish the list of schools so the noble lord will be able to sec where they all are

my colleagues and it would not be right for me to pretend to the committee that i could take this back and bring something forward on report <e> <s> i regret it for the <e>", "<cs> i must begin by

preparing for the legislation that might come <e> <s> if the legislation does not come and your lordships are perfectly entitled to vote as you think to be right in the course of dealing with this legislation then i recognise that it would be wasted <e> <s> we have said to local authorities that we are asking for economies this year and at their request giving them these powers over the non-educational parts of the budgetthat is school meals milk and transport <e> <s> so far as school meals are concerned which was the point of the circular which the noble baroness mentioned parents would rightly complain if they had not been warned that the price of the school dinner <e>", "<cs> i would have been prepared to answer the point <e> <s> but the amendment that covered this point was not moved and i thought there was an anxiety to get on so it would be right to leave it <e> <s> i will let the noble lord know privately before report stage <e>", "<cs> perhaps it will be the wish of your lordships today to debate the principle of clause and i should like to suggest to my noble friend lord morris that at this time he should not press his amendment and that other noble lords might agree not to move their amendments in detail this afternoon but of course to speak to them and then we can move immediately to the principle of clause and take this on the clause stand part debate <e>", "<cs> it may be for the convenience of the committee if i intervene at this point to explain at the start of this debate the governments proposals on transport and the reasons for them <e> <s> as there are many of your lordships in the committee today who were not in the chamber when we had a debate on the bill at second reading i will briefly set out the present position on school transport <e> <s> under the present law a local education authority in effect need provide transport only between home and school for a pupil of compulsory school age who attends the nearest available school and whose journey exceeds the statutory walking distance defined as two miles for the child under years of age and three miles for the older child <e> <s> it is a <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble baroness <e> <s> would she not agree that that is precisely the position as it is now <e> <s> children living in towns within the -mile limit have in some cases to pay or pence a day to get to school whereas others go free <e>", "<cs> this is such an important matter of principle that perhaps your lordships will forgive me for raising it again <e> <s> the noble viscount lord simon says that there is not much inequity in towns and that the schools are quite close that there are many schools in towns and it is not very far to go <e> <s> the fact is that an enormous number of children living in towns today have to travel two miles or more and the full economic cost of town transport is very great <e> <s> it can be p p or p a day for a two-mile journey <e>", "<cs> i did not like to <e>", "<cs> we have had a long and very important debate this afternoon and i wish to say at the outset how greatly i have appreciated the sincerity of everybody who has spoken particularly my noble friend the duke of norfolk and the noble lord lord butler of saffron walden and i accept too that others feel very deeply about this matter <e> <s> i will deal immediately with two points <e> <s> first the noble baroness lady trumping-ton asked me whether if there are transport charges that will lead to more administrators <e> <s> clearly if transport charges are imposed there will have to be somebody to administer them but we should keep the facts straight <e> <s> the noble lord lord butler has not told me from where he got the figure of but we have no evidence of any local education authority contemplating employing that number of people <e> <s> if it was cumbria which was referred to in the <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> i am saying that by the time the local authorities have paid the extra administrative charges which i accept they will still make a saving and i believe one must accept that <e>", "<cs> yes to special schools because they have a discretion and they can be trusted to use that discretion which they have always used <e> <s> there is nothing whatever in the act which compels them to take children to special schools except over the three-mile limit and they have always done so and i have no reason for thinking they will not do so in future <e>", "<cs> i imagine they would take handicapped children to ordinary schools as well <e>", "<cs> we are now getting rather wide of the mark i really just wanted to talk about handicapped children <e> <s> i would commend to your lordships the very important speeches made by my noble friend lord ridley and the noble viscount lord amory <e> <s> all that the local authorities have asked for is power to make a charge if they believe in their local area that this is the right place in which to make the savings <e> <s> that is what we are talking about <e> <s> it is not a duty to charge it is giving local authorities the option to charge if they believe it is the right thing to do in their authority <e>", "<cs> so you left it out <e> <s> yes you may well laugh now <e> <s> you criticised me at second reading and said how much the country had had to save on education under the conservatives and i was able to show <e>", "<cs> no you may not at the moment and i was able to show that the labour government cut far more in than the conservative government are contemplating doing in the two years between and <e> <s> we are back again <e> <s> i say to noble lords opposite you may vote against us because that is your political decision but do not pretend to us that it is because you are supporting the rural lobbies or the churches <e> <s> when you were in power you would have done it had you had the courage but you lacked the courage and it is always the case when the chips are down you will fight us when we are left to clear up the mess <e>", "<cs> goodness me <e> <s> i have upset the noble lord lord davies of leek because the truth of the matter is that no one has an alternative policy to this <e>", "<cs> i quite agree i shall take the noble lords advice and leave it alone except in this context it would not reach million for five or six years and it would not even reach that it could be brought in by order of the secretary of state <e> <s> we would not get the savings that we are looking for in which is what we are discussing by abolishing the assisted places scheme <e> <s> another noble lord i think it was the noble lord lord stewart of fulham said that we would do better to save on the national health service <e> <s> as he probably knows my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services is in fact expecting to reorganise it to get rid of one tier <e> <s> so the savings will be made <e> <s> however we are not in any event discussing that budget but rather the education budget <e>", "<cs> is not the correct procedure now for the deputy chairman to put the next amendment <e>", "<cs> may i repeat the decisions that were taken at the beginning <e>", "<cs> i ought to make it clear that the government cannot accept this amendment <e> <s> what the noble duke is proposing goes far beyond what the education act says is required <e> <s> he is also committing the government to further expenditure which for the reasons i have already enumerated we are unlikely to acquiesce in nor could we do so <e> <s> the terms of the noble dukes amendment include the words <e>", "<cs> if it would be for the convenience of the committee as it is now five minutes to seven oclock before we start on another subject perhaps the house might be resumed during the committees dinner break <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i must first of all apologise to the noble baroness lady david for not being in my place when she began her opening remarks on this amendment <e> <s> the purpose of her amendment is to oppose changing the current duty on local authorities to provide nursery education into a power to do so <e> <s> let me say at the start that i am one who believes very firmly in nursery education <e> <s> i have myself brought up three children and they all went to nursery schools and i believe they all benefited from it <e> <s> i believe in nursery education from the point of view of education not because mothers need to go to work <e> <s> it stands or falls on the educational issue and to be perfectly frank i think those who argue that we need nursery schools to allow women to go out to work have not always benefited the cause of nursery education <e> <s> indeed my record will show that when i was in local government i cannot remember whether it was or years on an education committee that authority provided six purpose-built nursery schools which admitted rising-fives and which did a great deal for the under-five provision <e> <s> so i hope that my record both as an individual as a mother and as a local councillor will show that i am someone who believes in nursery education <e>", "<cs> they were not being used by the local authority because of the economic situation in the country <e> <s> the reality of the situation was that they went down <e> <s> let me give the noble lord lord donaldson some comfort in this respect <e> <s> in they actually went up to million <e> <s> in the course of the last year money for new nursery school places has been provided and are expected to be provided in the year <e>", "<cs> i always enjoy the remarks of the noble lord lord parry and i hope that he will show me the letter after the debate <e> <s> the answer to the noble baroness lady seear is not that i believe there is an alternative namely transport or nursery schools but that local education authorities will now have to reexamine all their budgets <e> <s> many authorities which have hovered over the question of nursery education will decide that this is an area because it is outside compulsory school ages in which they can economise <e> <s> i deeply regret that <e> <s> that is one reason why i have fought over these painful decisions <e> <s> however i accept the will of the committee the matter has been decided <e> <s> but i am merely saying that having decided such a thing it is no use thinking that one can ask for a great deal more expenditure <e>", "<cs> i see the point which has been put to me but the fact is that it has been a duty since <e> <s> it has not operated in that way because <e>", "<cs> yes but if i may say so the noble baroness lady bacon has missed the point <e> <s> the proposals under clause must be read in conjunction with our proposals under clause <e> <s> under our proposals local authorities cannot just close nursery schools <e> <s> they can no more close nursery schools and we have passed clause so i hope we are all agreed that it is in the bill than they <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge that the position has been misunderstood <e> <s> everyone outside has assumed that we now think that nursery <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may return the compliment i am pleased the noble lord lord ross of marnock feels i have some redeeming features <e>", "<cs> my lords when i first saw this amendment i was slightly puzzled that the noble baroness should have put it down because as she said clause is a copy of the clause in her governments bill of <e> <s> therefore it seemed to me that it would be unexceptionable <e> <s> but i now recognise there is a further point that she is trying to make <e>", "<cs> this is a very good example of where there has been a general power before and now that that general power will be repealed by the local government and planning bill now in another place the government arc seeking to put back the powers in a rather narrower form <e> <s> this raises a lot of issues including the one that we have just discussed and the one raised by the noble baroness <e> <s> the answer is that there will be consultation on all these matters with the relevant bodies before the regulations are laid <e> <s> i do not think there is any cause for the committee to be suspicious in any way <e> <s> the powers have existed before for a very long time as i understand it and because they are being repealed by another act they are coming back in this bill in a more restrictive form <e> <s> in a sense this has given your lordships the opportunity to raise detailed points which have probably passed unnoticed in the past under a more general power <e>", "<cs> we are dealing with two situations which i shall attempt to explain <e> <s> the first relates to amendment no <e> <s> which seeks to apply the recoupment proposals to further education <e> <s> the second relates to the situaton in london <e> <s> to deal first with the amendment clause applies automatic recoupment for students at primary and secondary schools <e> <s> it is part and parcel of our arrangements under clause for allowing parental preferences <e> <s> therefore if parental preference is for a child to attend a school in another authority and all the conditions have been agreed and accepted there is automatic recoupment instead of the rather complicated difficulties that one can encounter if this is not automatically the case <e> <s> clause is essentially to be taken with clause <e> <s> it will extend parental preference <e>", "<cs> the position is that the government do not have in mind another bill on further education <e> <s> the misunderstanding arises because clause is taking account of the new provisions for the sharing or pooling of expenditure by local education authorities on advanced further education <e> <s> these provisions are made in clause <e> <s> this is one of the provisions which comes out of the capping the pool a shorthand expression procedures <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can show to the noble viscount lord simon that in fact his amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> the effect of it would be that as adult education is part of further education whatever recoupment provisions apply to further education automatically apply to adult education <e> <s> in this sense therefore his amendment does not add anything to the present situation <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just say to the noble baroness lady david that we are of course looking at this matter <e> <s> that is exactly what the working party under my honourable friend mr macfarlane is doing <e> <s> they are looking at the whole question along with other matters in connection with the to year-olds <e> <s> we recognise that it is a prob <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord morris has said this in fact is a rather technical drafting amendment but i understand that although the noble lord is perfectly correct that the independent schools whose exemption from the requirement to register is being ended will be added to the register of independent schools kept by the registrar under section of the act there is nothing to be gained by specifying the subsection as well as the parent clause <e> <s> there is no other register mentioned elsewhere under section and therefore there cannot possibly be any confusion as to what is meant <e> <s> i am not a lawyer <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will accept this <e> <s> however if there is anything further perhaps he would like to talk to me about it before the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might deal first with the second question asked by the noble baroness <e> <s> i understand that because of technical difficulties it was not possible to amend the standards for school premises regulations and the further education regulations in the way envisaged by the then government <e> <s> however my department has issued guidance on the access of disabled people to educational buildings and i shall write to the noble baroness about thisshould we wish to discuss this before the report stage there will be an opportunity to do so <e>", "<cs> the whole committee will be very grateful to the noble viscount lord ingleby for putting down this amendment and giving the committee an opportunity to discuss this subject <e> <s> it is clearly one of great importance <e> <s> may i say right at the beginning that i have very great sympathy with the aims of his amendment <e> <s> i share the views which have been expressed on all sides of the house about the importance of the right kind of sex education <e> <s> by that i mean that the matter should be treated sensitively <e> <s> i believe that it should be discussed within a moral code and those of us who are blessed with a happy family life have so much to be thankful for that the experience of it is something that we ought to pass on to children <e> <s> i share very much the view of the noble viscount lord ingleby that the book that he described is deplorable and i do not think it helps children at all <e> <s> this is my personal view about it and i think it right to say this right away to the committee <e>", "<cs> the government accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to comment on the two points that the noble baroness lady david and the noble viscount lord simon have made about the consequences of the decision that was taken last week <e> <s> i have been asked whether the government think it is fair to ask local authorities to find the money <e> <s> i think it is important to remind the house that the request originally came from the association of county councils and it came about because the local authorities had been asked to make savings and the local education authorities asked whether they might be allowed to have a power to charge in these particular circumstances <e> <s> one of the reasons for introducing the clauses into the bill was to try to carry out that wish and grant them the power <e> <s> i should make it quite clear that the cash limit for the whole year has now been set and that the concluding part of my statement must stand <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may reply to the point raised by the noble lord lord taylor i am perfectly aware that there is an association of metropolitan authorities with which i have personally been connected both when i was in local government and as a vice-president when we were in opposition <e> <s> therefore i am well aware that they have expressed views the london boroughs and the scottish authorities <e> <s> there are other associations <e> <s> the association of county councils clearly asked for this particular power because they are the most directly affected by the open-ended subsidy <e> <s> they asked for the power the house has now taken a decision on this matter <e> <s> it is only right that i should say what they had asked us to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i have never sought to say anything other than that it was the association of county councils in england and wales and i repeat that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if the noble lord lord somers did not hear what i said <e> <s> i said it was a non-educational part of the education budget not a non-essential part of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to hear that the noble lord lord alexander accepts the last part of the statement but he will recall that at second reading he suggested that alternative economies might be made in respect of teachers <e> <s> it may be helpful to remind the house of the figures that i gave at second reading that is that the local education authorities spent only per cent <e> <s> of their budgets on administration in education and that over the last five years the cost of educational administration has fallen in real terms by million or nearly per cent <e> <s> it would therefore be difficult for them to find a great deal of extra money exclusively from savings in administration <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord lord nugent for his remarks and say to the noble lord lord leatherland that of course it is open to local authorities that have balances to use them <e> <s> what he and other members of the house have to remember is that we are talking about million this year <e> <s> it is of course cumulative over the years and there is a limit to how far even if one has balances one can use them <e> <s> that is one of the effects of the cut-backs and the squeeze on government and local government expenditure local authorities have been using their balances <e> <s> no doubt they can continue to do so but they cannot live in that way and it is not really a course to be recommended in deciding public policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord lord leatherland would agree with me that rates are not a buoyant tax like income tax <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will know very well no one can <e>", "<cs> my lords the latest number of teachers that i have is approximately <e> <s> i think it will drop slightly this year although i have not the figure in my head but there are more than the noble lord has said <e> <s> of those that the noble lord has classed as non-teachers of course there are included many people that he would regard as being essential to the education service such as laboratory technicians other people who help as assistants to teachers in the classrooms and such people as school secretaries without whom many schools would find it difficult to manage <e>", "<cs> i apologise my lords i should have made that clear <e> <s> they are for england and wales only <e> <s> i am sorry but i do not have the scottish figures <e> <s> what the figures show for england and wales is that the rate of decline of village schools is levelling off and that there is an increase in the coming closures of schools in urban areas and i think the reason for the decline in the population of urban areas is not only the general fall in the school population but the movement of the population out of the inner cities into the suburbs which compounds the fall in the school population <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the school is still open <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that it was during the statutory period of objection that this information came to the department <e>", "<cs> my lords in answering these two paving amendments for the principal amendment that the noble baroness lady david is moving i am very conscious that this is a most ingenious argument based on what i said at the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> having re-read my remarks and indeed hers i see why she is doing it <e>", "<cs> my lords we considered this same amendment in committee and at that stage i explained there was no question of putting off a decision on what the powers of governing bodies should be <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord mishcon has now argued that local education authorities should not be in any doubt about what the powers of governing bodies should be <e> <s> both my government and the previous labour administration have considered the matter of the powers of governing bodies carefully and we have both come to the same conclusion namely that there should be no fundamental change in the existing provision and we believe there is no need to write something into the bill for the present position to be quite clear <e> <s> all the matters listed in the amendment from <e>", "<cs> we have not yet considered in detail what guidance we shall be sending out <e> <s> obviously we shall be considering very carefully the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not surprised that the noble baroness lady david has presented this amendment again because as she rightly says it illustrates a division between each side of the house on this matter <e> <s> i understand that the former labour governments bill of provided for the determining of admission limits which did not have to be based on any particular considerations and which once determined were unchallengeable <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady david has made clear her group of amendments are in fact designed to establish within the bill these planned admission limits <e> <s> what is contained in clause of this bill is not the same as that principle and we have rejected that approach which we believe was arbitrary and was contrary to parental interests <e> <s> we believe that if an authority wishes to refuse a child admission the authority must justify that refusal not merely by reference to a number but by reference also to the criteria that we have set out in the bill relating to the provision of efficient education or the efficient use of resources <e> <s> i accept that amendment no <e> <s> would qualify that situation yet there would still be set an arbitrary number against which the other matters would be measured <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the whole house listened with great interest to the lecture by the noble lord lord stewart on grammar schools secondary modern schools and the education act <e> <s> if i took a correct note of his remarks he said that we are inscribing the eleven-plus into the law <e> <s> i think the house at this stage needs to look at this clause and at what it is trying to achieve <e> <s> we need to address ourselves to the real problems that are involved <e> <s> we had very long debates in this chamber on our first education act and we believe as a consequence of that that it should be possible for local education authorities to decide for themselves what sort of education provision they wish to make within their areas <e> <s> that is why we put through our first education bill <e> <s> if parents in particular areas wish to continue sending their children to selective schools we on this side of the house believe that they should be able to do so and we will safeguard their ability to do so <e> <s> in fact as my noble friend lord belstead said on a similar amendment at committee stage the effect of this amendment if it were passed would be to do away with selective schools altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house as we have already noted many times in education debates there are more comprehensive schools than other types of schools <e> <s> that being the case there is still a very large opportunity for parents to express a preference <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i can answer the question of the noble lord lord stewart quite briefly <e> <s> we believe that parents should be able to express a preference for a school in the area of a neighbouring authority <e> <s> there are many children for whom the school across the boundary is the one to which they should logically go because it is the closest to them because it is easiest to <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with great care to what the noble baroness lady bacon said in moving this amendment <e> <s> nobody could argue that the points she has put down in this amendment the five different needs which a local authority should consider in its allocations to schools are not ones which are very important <e> <s> but the fact is that different local authorities may perfectly reasonably give different weight to different items and might not accept that some needs are overriding <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will remember that on an earlier amendment local authorities were asked to indicate the type of person who should be chosen as school governor <e> <s> on this amendment i take note of the noble baronesss comments there is general agreement about the importance of the various points <e> <s> however i do not wish to leave with the house the impression that i thought the five points which she made are the most important or are in any kind of rank order <e> <s> i hope that i have left her with the statement that they are important but that there are other matters which are also important <e> <s> should we send out a circular or if we seek to advise local authorities we shall take into account the statements made in this house and the importance which the house attaches to provisions of this kind <e> <s> however i do not believe it would be appropriate to write them into the bill certainly not without consultation with local authorities who would resent them if they were included in the bill at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i can give the noble lord lord stewart an assurance on the point he has made <e> <s> in the first place the decision of the appeal committee is binding on the parent as it is on the authority <e> <s> if the parent is displeased that parent can try another school <e> <s> but that is a very different proposition from saying that the original decision on that school is not binding <e>", "<cs> my lords i am reluctant to say that i will bring any amendments to the bill at third reading for a variety of reasons not least of which is the parliamentary timetable <e> <s> what i will say to the noble baroness is that the point has been noted i can see that there appears to be confusion on this matter and i will certainly think about it but i could not give a promise <e> <s> this again might well be something that one should consider in the course of a circular or something like that <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has paid me the compliment and i take it as a compliment of being very ingenious about arguments may i say that this is a matter that we have looked at but we believe that at the end of the day it is unrealistic to require authorities to nominate a parent to each individual appeal committee <e> <s> after all we are going to consider the occasions on which we are going to ask for parents to be involved in the education system <e> <s> we are going to require two parents on every governing body and we believe that in many areas it will be quite difficult to find enough parents to fill the role on appeal committees <e> <s> only a limited number of parents will have sufficient interest in <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may speak again by leave of the house what the noble baroness suggests is not precluded by schedule <e> <s> indeed if i may say so the noble baroness herself was a very good example no doubt being a member of the appeal committee and also a parent at the same time <e> <s> that is all possible under what we are allowing but it is not prescribed under schedule <e> <s> if they so wish local authorities can always have a parent on the appeal committee <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady david my noble friend lord swinton and the noble lord lord ross of marnock all asked me the meaning of or to be represented <e> <s> that term does not just narrowly mean to be represented by a lawyer <e> <s> a parent who lodged an appeal might well be represented by his or her spouse if one reads the provisions on procedure one will see that the apeal must be in writing setting out the grounds on which it is made or by a friend by his local councillor or by anyone else who knew about the particular case <e>", "<cs> my lords with the <e>", "<cs> my lords it is only right to say immediately that as the bill stands it provides that all appeal committee hearings are to be held in <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the intentions of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords if we are concerned with the arrangements relating to the content of education and the curriculum this is not the right place to try to deal with the matter <e> <s> information of that kind will be published under the terms of subsection <e> <s> it remains to be settled how much of such information should be specified in regulations made by the secretary of state and how much left to the discretion of local authorities and governors <e> <s> but i am sure that it would be inappropriate to specify that now <e> <s> in saying that i recognise as indeed does anybody who is familiar with the education system it is important that information about schools should be passed to parents and that information should be passed from one school to another about what the child has done in order that the full records of the child and the education authority may be kept up to date but i hope the noble baroness will agree that the way we are proposing to meet this is better than prescribing it in the bill in the way she proposes <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be for the convenience of the house if we discussed all my amendments the amendment to which the noble lord lord renton referred and of course the one which the noble baroness lady david mentioned <e> <s> they must of course be moved separately afterwards but it may be for the convenience of the house to debate all these matters together <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to those noble lords who have welcomed these amendments that the government are putting forward <e> <s> i recognise that it does not go and indeed i have never pretended to them or to the house that it does go as far as those who take this great interest in the handicapped would like it to go and that is why i prefaced my remarks by saying that these amendments are as it were a first instalment and i recognise that what is required is a new bill <e> <s> i have said enough on that matter at this stage i hope to assure the house that i certainly and the government will work for this <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> when we discussed this at committee i explained that we could not apply clauses and to special education because it would put on to local education authorities two contradictory requirements <e> <s> it therefore requires new legislation in order to apply the kind of provisions we have in clauses and to parents of children in special schools <e> <s> i said that i would bring forward amendments to clause and that is what i am doing but the amendments do not apply to clauses and for the reasons which i gave earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e> <s> i thought that the noble baroness would move it again later <e> <s> the point that she was making is a rather separate one from that of special schools <e> <s> it deals with voluntary-aided schools <e> <s> it was because i knew it was a separate point that i did not answer it <e> <s> we discussed a similar amendment on the committee stage and i think it right to say that we on this side believe that governors of aided schools should retain their responsibility for running their own affairs <e> <s> this amendment would have the effect that governors of such voluntary-aided schools were <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether it would be for the convenience of the house if we break off this stage for <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry if my explanation of the governments intentions under clause which <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to give an assurance to the noble baroness that of course it is very important that we should consult very fully with our partners in the education service with the local education authorities in this matter and that we should i hope reach agreement on all the points <e> <s> we accept that this is not an altogether straightforward matter on which to devise regulations and that is why we accept that there must be full consultations before agreement is reached on this <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened very carefully to what has been <e>", "<cs> my lords i think perhaps it might be for the convenience of the house if i said something at this stage <e> <s> i recognise we have had a long and very serious discussion on this subject <e> <s> i have listened very carefully to what has been said this evening and i have also read again the account of our debate on the amendment moved by the noble viscount lord ingleby in committee <e> <s> despite what the noble lord lord houghton has said i believe that the discussion in this house both in committee and again this evening has clearly indicated the concern that many people feel about whether or not the arrangements within our schools for the treatment of a subject which is so sensitive and personal as sex education are fully satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords when we were debating my amendments which my noble friend lord renton agreed met the point he raised or part of it he asked whether one could trust the government or the minister <e> <s> there is one general rule to which i have always subscribed and that is i never give promises which i know i cannot fulfil and i must tell him quite honestly as i must tell the house that at this stage it would not be possible to redraft clauses and to iron out all the difficulties in them and bring the whole matter together on third reading <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to assure all noble lords who have spoken and the noble baroness lady birk that i spent quite a lot of time thinking about nursery schools and how we can do better with the resources that are available and make the best use of those resources <e> <s> i have looked again at the debate in committee and i hope i can assure the house that we have gone as far as we can with regard to the application of section to nursery schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to correct something the noble lord lord mishcon said because it was not true <e> <s> i think he said the bill would permit the closing down of nursery classes <e> <s> in fact the bill does not say that <e> <s> it says in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept the amendment for the reasons i have given and i do not think now is the time to repeat the arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords we all listened with great interest to the speech of the noble baroness lady birk which was of course a second reading speech on the assisted places scheme <e> <s> i do not wish to rehearse all the arguments that we have already heard not only at second reading but also on committee a third time round on report <e> <s> i should simply like to make three points about the assisted places scheme <e> <s> the first is that it is intended to replace the old direct grant schools scheme <e> <s> whatever the feelings of the house may be about the assisted places scheme and i have every reason to suppose that a majority of your lordships support it when the old direct grant scheme was phased out by the former labour government and i remember the debate well there were very few noble lords who did not express their very great regret at the ending of the direct grant schools which had made such a notable contribution to the educational system of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to have that point cleared up <e> <s> the point i want to make is that there are thousands of parents who send their children to the maintained system who care deeply <e> <s> the provisions in the bill that we are making both on school governors and on the right of parents to express a choice and the appeal system which has been so greatly criticised by noble lords opposite are designed to give some of the opportunities to parents who send their children to maintained schools that are currently enjoyed only by those who can afford to send their children to independent schools <e> <s> it is very important to see the assisted places scheme in relation to other proposals <e> <s> i have been asked for a great deal of information and i shall give all the information i can this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords the particular question is of course totally irrelevant to the amendment before us <e> <s> however i assume as the noble baroness lady bacon has not named the report to which she is referring that she is referring to the report of the national childrens bureau <e> <s> i would refer her to the answer that my right honourable and learned friend gave in another place on th march at column of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not at all clear what figures the noble lord lord parry wants <e> <s> we have given the cost assuming that the assisted places scheme starts in september of million <e> <s> i gave him the current cost of sixth-form pupils in direct grant schools and all these are figures which are known <e> <s> i am not clear what other figure he wishes to have which is relevant to the assisted places scheme <e>", "<cs> the amount that has been put into the financial memorandum at the start of the bill million <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i think we should remind ourselves that we are on report and that this is not the committee stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i have i hope already given an assurance to my noble friend viscount eccles and to the house that when the secretary of states <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i can give the house the assurances that are required on all the points that have been raised over this amendment <e> <s> i understood that the noble lord lord stewart was also speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> en selecting schools for the scheme the secretary of state will certainly seek and have regard to the advice of her majestys inspectorate <e> <s> but in general we should be able to rely on the detailed information given by schools in support of their applications and on what her majestys inspectorate know of them already <e>", "<cs> by the leave of the house my lords i thank my noble friend lord eccles for the point he made <e> <s> clearly the assisted places scheme would be valuable in circumstances where for one reason or another a particular course was not available in the maintained system and we have always accepted that this is one reason for the assisted places scheme <e> <s> i would say to the noble viscount lord simon that clearly a school would not be chosen just because there was one good teacher <e> <s> i hope i have said enough to indicate that in order to be registered it would have to be a school inspected by the inspectors that it would need to have a full range of courses on offer including a sixth form that it would need to have enough pupils in the sixth form courses so there would be the correct stimulus for them and that it would need to have a whole range of academic attributes before it would be considered <e> <s> as for a pupil who is unable for one reason or another to keep up clearly the scheme must be flexible as regards arrangements if the child is unhappy at a particular school no one would wish the child to continue at that school <e> <s> this must be a matter which can be dealt with by the head of the school and the parents in the way that is regarded appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness lady david has said this amendment repeats the last administrations scheme for a system of mandatory awards for - to -year-olds continuing in full-time education <e> <s> clauses to this effect were included in their education bill of <e> <s> the mandatory awards would apply to pupils either at school or at college <e> <s> this would be in addition to the discretionary powers which local authorities already have to pay grants <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the very great interest and knowledge that my noble friend lord vaizey has in this subject and as he has quite rightly said the present situation is that awards should be mandatory for students taking full-time courses of first degree or equivalent level or initial teacher training courses whatever the subject of study <e> <s> nevertheless a number of degree and degree equivalent courses in music attract mandatory awards <e> <s> i realise that many courses in drama and dance in particular are designed for performers and in consequence do not require the achievement of an academic level which can be regarded as comparable to degree <e>", "<cs> my lords i did take that point <e> <s> but even if my noble friend is right in saying that the total number of students within the particular areas that he is talking about would be reduced the point which has been made by the local authorities and others is that once we extended the scheme of mandatory awards to one group we would in fairness have to look at other groups which would mean at the end of the day that the total number would inevitably be increased <e> <s> it is because i think it would be so difficult once this was on the statute book for the secretary of state to resist its implementation because naturally the pressure for it would be very great that i am unable to accept it this afternoon <e> <s> i hope therefore that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it might be for the convenience of the house if i intervened at this stage <e> <s> i am sure that i should take lord shinwells advice <e> <s> i am not sure whether his education for politicians was directed at me or not but i shall carefully read what he has said in <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might correct two mis-statements of fact <e> <s> the history of this matter is that no government have as yet agreed a mandatory award for these particular courses <e> <s> all governments have made it possible for local education authorities to give discretionary awards <e> <s> so there can be no question of a clear cut-off between those who can afford to pay and those who cannot discretionary awards are available <e>", "<cs> my lords i well understand both the point that the noble lord lord evans of claughton makes and his concern that young people over the age of who remain in full-time education at school continue to be regarded as dependent upon their families whereas those who have left school either to enter employment or to continue their full-time education at a college of further education may be eligible for benefits in their own right <e> <s> i am also aware that some more mature people may return to school and that these too may not be given grants except to prevent or relieve hardship and then only if their parents means are taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with interest to noble lords who have spoken and i should like to say that i too am a supporter of the open university and recognise the great and important work that it is doing <e> <s> i recognise immediately the same kind of difficulties that we have had over the amendments that we were debating earlier on <e> <s> for the open university students may receive relief from their employers or they may receive discretionary awards from local education authorities but as the noble and learned lord lord gardiner pointed out there are many people who do not receive awards at all and this is the point that the noble viscount lord simon was making and for them the position <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i think he might say that if it was right in the first place it is right now <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords i very by the noble lord lord avebury by the noble lord lord taylor of blackburn and the noble lord lord rochester about the importance of strengthening the links between education and industry and of producing the numbers of technically qualified people that we need in support of manufacturing industry and the wealth-creating sectors of our society <e> <s> the amendments before the house are concerned with educational and training opportunities and financial support for those who are unfortunate enough to have been made redundant and who may wish or indeed need to retrain for a new occupation <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it may be for the convenience of the house if i intervene at this point <e> <s> i should like to say at the start that i do very much appreciate the valuable work undertaken by social workers and the points that were so well made by my noble friend lady faithfull <e> <s> we have heard a number of experts including of course the noble lord lord wells-pestell who speaks from long experience on this subject <e> <s> the present position about awards for social workers is that students who obtain places on degree courses in social studies and these course may lead to a certificate of qualification in social work as well as to a degree are eligible for mandatory awards on exactly the same conditions as students reading for a first degree in other subjects <e> <s> there is no age barrier for the receipt of a mandatory award and in fact the award regulations make special provision to pay a higher rate of grant for students who are over years of age and who have been in full-time employment for three to six years immediately preceding the first year of the course <e> <s> it is true that courses for the non-graduate diploma in social work do not qualify for mandatory awards but students taking a two-year certificate course may be released on salary if they are already employed by a local authority <e> <s> otherwise they may apply for a discretionary award from their local education authority <e>", "<cs> my lords for the convenience of the house may i suggest that we speak also to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord mountgarret in moving his amendment said i think i am quoting <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house my reference was that if all these amendments taken together were passed this would be the effect <e> <s> they are interleaved amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord mottistone for that argument which i find really most useful at this moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady david has read out the very sad case of the child who has been identified as one who received free school meals under the present arrangements <e> <s> with her i regret it very much when these incidents happen <e> <s> it is difficult and embarrassing for the children <e> <s> it is not a new situation and she must have been as familiar with it in her time in local government as i was in mine <e> <s> it has been difficult to find any complete solution to this <e> <s> i believe that most local authorities try hard to keep confidentiality about the children who receive free school meals now <e> <s> i think that frequently if there is a difficulty it is perhaps with somebody new and inexperienced who does not realise the problems that can arise when a child is identified in this way <e> <s> i do not think there is any simple solution to this <e> <s> i do not believe it can be solved by legislation <e> <s> it is a matter of good practice <e> <s> i think it is something of which most people in the education service are well aware <e> <s> we would not feel it right to legislate and for that reason i cannot accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> by leave of the house what i said was that i agreed with the noble baroness lady david i am sure the noble lord lord underhill feels the same that anybody who has had any experience of this matter knows that it is very undesirable for children who receive free school meals to be identified in any way <e> <s> good practice in schools ensures that this does not take place <e> <s> it is a different proposition to legislate upon this and make it a duty <e> <s> it is very difficult to legislate for good practice and that is why we are not legislating for it <e> <s> the noble baroness lady david asked whether we would give any guidance <e> <s> clearly this is one among many matters that we shall consider if we issue a circular which i believe we shall have to do and this is the type of issue that we can consider in that circular <e>", "<cs> my lords under amendment no <e> <s> and the other amendments to which the noble baroness lady david has spoken authorities would not only continue to be required to provide education for the under-fives but for the first time would be under a duty to provide nursery schools and nursery classes regardless of resources <e> <s> at this late hour i shall not detain your lordships by rehearsing yet again the governments reasons for deciding that the duty imposed on local education authorities by section <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very important amendment <e> <s> i was very glad to have the opportunity of discussing between the committee stage of the bill and report with the noble lord lord stewart of fulham and the noble baroness lady david the various issues which arise from it and i hope very much that we might be able to reach agreement upon it <e> <s> as i explained during the committee stage this clause appears in the bill because there is a clause in the local government and planning bill going through another place which repeals certain general provisions <e> <s> we are re-enacting them in a new form under this bill <e> <s> we are all agreed about the importance of making regulations on educational records for all the arguments that the noble lord lord stewart of fulham has set out <e> <s> i do not believe that there is any disagreement in the house about this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this is a matter that we shall want to consider very carefully and i should like to reflect again over the discussion that we had the other day and the letter that <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter which we debated in committee <e> <s> i recognise that there is an anomaly in that there is automatic recoupment for to year-olds who are in school and who choose to go to a school in another authority and for to year-olds who may be adjacent to a college of further education <e> <s> but i said in committee that although we recognise that there is an anomaly we do not believe that this is the right place to deal with it for two reasons <e> <s> the first is that the bill has not altered significantly the position on recoupment for further education because the bill does not lay on authorities new obligations with regard to parental preference as is the case with primary and secondary pupils <e> <s> it would not be satisfatory in the light of the lack of agreement between local education authorities about the rights and wrongs of automatic recoupment for further education to which i referred in committee to impose an arrangement upon them in respect of some further education students but not others <e> <s> at the end of the day if the amendment were agreed to although we have anomalies which i accept in the bill it would create almost as many anomalies as it would solve <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a short and useful debate this after <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for those words <e> <s> the clauses in the bill relating to the establishment closure and alteration of schools will i think both clarify the procedures which schools and authorities have to go through in these matters while reducing the degree of detailed control exercised by the secretary of state <e> <s> clause establishes a new procedure designed to provide for public consultation where authorities wish to reduce admissions to schools as part of their planning for the fall in the school population <e> <s> these clauses have i think been usefully clarified and amended by your lordships and i hope that the amendment first proposed by my noble friend lord ridley taking very smal schools out of clause will have the effect of further reducing the administrative burden on authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as there is such public worry we have in the genetic manipulation advisory group an expert body which is particularly <e>", "<cs> my lords yes the government recognise the points which the noble lord lord avebury has made on this matter <e> <s> as regards consideration of the matter within the european communities the economic and social committee at a meeting in july considered that in general compulsory notification of experiments that is without prior authorisation would be sufficient <e> <s> the committee is likely to look at the commissions proposals again particularly if they are substantially revised <e> <s> the european parliament has not yet considered the draft directive but is due to do so <e> <s> following representations from member states not least from ourselves we understand that the commission of the european communities is reconsidering its proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will certainly take note of the important points which the noble lord lord ashby has made <e> <s> as he will know the draft directive which originated from within the commission has not yet been submitted to the council of ministers <e> <s> it is due for discussion in the european parliament and until that discussion has taken place it is unlikely to go before the council <e> <s> the government believe that it would be premature to raise this matter in the council of ministers yet but we are in close touch with her majestys governments permanent representative in brussels and he will give us adequate warning of any impending submission to the council <e> <s> we shall consider what further action to take in the light of the situation at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords yes we are aware of the importance of this <e> <s> whatever might come out of all these discussions we accept that it is a matter of worldwide interest and it may well be that whatever is decided within the community may be a first step in getting some kind of international policy on this matter <e>", "<cs> i am perfectly agreeable to the suggestion that the noble lord has made and we shall certainly take the amendments in the way that he wishes <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wells-pestell in speaking to both amendments nos <e> <s> and has made it quite clear that the intention of amendment no <e> <s> is to preserve the existing formula on retirement pensions <e> <s> in effect it would be a wrecking amendment to this <e>", "<cs> i did not answer that point which is an important one because i thought it was a rather separate one which we shall come to when we debate a later amendment <e> <s> i thought i would deal with it then because other matters will arise on it <e>", "<cs> i wish to thank my noble friend lord drumalbyn for his most helpful intervention in explaining what <e>", "<cs> if the present formula were always to be kept because of the ratchet effect it is true that pensioners would always be protected against prices and would get an automatic increase when earnings were greater than prices <e> <s> however if ultimately we as a country do not get our economy on a sound footing then in comparable terms with other countries our average standard of living will decline and pensioners will do worse <e> <s> it is in the interests of retirement pensioners as of everybody else that we should get the economy right <e> <s> it would be very unfair to pretend to one group of people that somehow they can indefinitely receive a rise as it were as one can with other people which is unrelated to the basic increase in productivity in the country as a whole <e> <s> in a sense it is a short-term delusion it does not last very long and we believe that it does not put right the basic difficulties in the country as a whole <e>", "<cs> i hope that i am honest with the committee because i consider this a very serious matter <e> <s> i take the view that it is the governments job to look after retirement pensioners as well as all vulnerable groups within the population <e> <s> as we have made perfectly clear our first priority as a government is that somehow we must try to live within our means and get ourselves out of the economic difficulties in which we currently find ourselves <e> <s> it does not help retirement pensioners or anyone else to pretend that as a country we have unlimited sums of money to spend on all sorts of things <e> <s> what we must do is look after these groups within the population and that we are doing in this proposal <e> <s> they are intelligent people perfectly capable of knowing what is going on and we cannot pretend to them that we can do a great many things and improve the standard of living of all kinds of people when as we all know productivity is not rising and we are not <e>", "<cs> certainly i do not intend to pick an argument with the noble lord lord banks on this point to do so would be most unwise <e> <s> i shall read very carefully in tomorrows <e>", "<cs> i will speak only briefly on this point because we discussed it earlier <e> <s> i recognise that in the longterm the proposal which the noble lord is setting out would avoid the ratchet problem but that really is not the only purpose of subsection i of clause <e> <s> the subsection is also intended to give the government flexibility to determine when the economy is able to afford real improvements in pensions over and above the minimum laid down in this clause <e> <s> therefore i am afraid i am unable to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wells-pestell has explained very clearly the problems about the fact that the date for up-rating has moved forward progressively each year normally by one day only and two days in a leap year <e> <s> this gradual creeping forward has both procedural and financial implications <e> <s> the amendment which he has proposed and which has been supported by the noble lord lord banks would mean that the up-rating had to take place by the st day of the month in which the first anniversary of the previous up-rating falls instead of the last day of that month as the subsection provides <e> <s> the choice of the st of the month i assume was made to take account of the fact that different benefits are uprated from different days of the week in which the up-rating takes place to take account of the spread <e> <s> the final date referred to in an amendment of this sort has to he later than the monday of the week in which the up <e>", "<cs> i have been asked two questions why we cannot fix the date of the st and the point that the noble baroness lady phillips made <e> <s> i am not by any means a tax expert but she said that income tax all had to be paid on a certain date <e> <s> one pays ones income tax if on paye automatically through ones salary or wages <e> <s> it is an automatic deduction so that it is not in quite the same sense as that <e> <s> the reason why we are involved is that as the noble lord lord wells-pestell has explained quite rightly the date has crept forward each year and so one would get to the stage when there were a leap year when the date would have crept forward about two weeks <e>", "<cs> there is a great deal i could say on this amendment but i will restrain myself in the interests of getting on <e> <s> i am afraid i cannot accept the strictures of the noble baroness lady gaitskell that the government are blundering around <e> <s> we have had to make a lot of very difficult and painful decisions which i do not like very much <e> <s> i could if i so wished remind her of all the painful decisions which her government took under the strictures of the imf and as i indicated in the course of some of our discussions on the education bill the consequences were very fortunate for the last labour administration because we as an opposition did not go round telling everybody at every possible opportunity how terrible everything was and that the whole of society was going to fall apart as a consequence of all those decisions <e> <s> i could quote to your lordships all the figures to show in fact that the last labour government cut far more under the imf than we are proposing to do in two or three years <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wells-pestell is of course always very persuasive on these matters when he raises them in these terms but i think that i must be quite honest with the committee <e> <s> i do not think that this is a matter <e>", "<cs> the present statutory provision is quite clear <e> <s> the courts ruled in that the governments duty is to base an up-rating on the best estimates available at the appropriate time of likely movements between upratings currently movement of prices or earnings but prices only under the provisions of clause but there is no legal obligation to make up any shortfall <e> <s> the fact is that the expenditure implications of making good shortfalls are very considerable <e> <s> this was the main reason why we decided that we could not make good the shortfall in relation to earnings in last years up-rating although noble lords will be aware that the increase in the retirement pension was more than the rise in prices <e> <s> that shortfall affected retirement pensions and other long-term benefits and the estimated cost of making it good would have been a further million in a full year <e> <s> this amendment would require any shortfall in all benefits to be made good <e>", "<cs> i never commit myself by predicting what will happen all through a committee stage when we are only on the fourth amendment <e>", "<cs> would it be convenient to the committee to take the other amendments on the subject at the same time amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> if this was not such an extremely serious subject i should be tempted to say that the debate we are now having would make a fitting final episode for that splendid bbc series yes minister <e> <s> my only regret is that the noble lord lord wells-pestell has not joined in the fray <e> <s> i feel certain i shall be able to bring him to his feet <e> <s> he could have made my speech in opposition i could have made his speech in office and it would have completed the picture <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the reason for having an earnings rule at all is that the pension is a retirement pension <e> <s> it was in support of the requirement that a person has to be retired in order to get a pension that the earnings rule came into being <e> <s> it is not enough therefore to remove the earnings rule while leaving retirement as a condition to be satisfied before pension can be awarded <e> <s> to complete the job it is also necessary to reconstruct section of the social security act and other related provisions <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady phillips has made a statement about costs and i can only return to the point that i made at the beginning of my remarks and say that we are still looking at this whole question because there is some evidence that because increasing numbers of people are retiring earlier which may continue costs would be somewhat lower than had at first been thought <e> <s> that is a review that is not yet complete and so we do not in fact have the evidence before us <e>", "<cs> i cannot go beyond saying what i said originally namely that the government are committed to phasing-out the earnings rule as circumstances allow <e> <s> ways of achieving this and the costs involved are currently being studied and the government will announce the outcome of this consideration in due course <e> <s> i cannot go beyond that at this stage <e>", "<cs> i am not prepared to say more than i have already indicated that is as far as i can go this afternoon <e>", "<cs> i am of course familiar with the arguments <e> <s> i only have to read <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has made clear the purpose of this amendment is to prevent the provisions of clause of the social security no <e> <s> bill which is having its second reading in another place today and which will be considered by your lordships in due course from having the effect they are designed to have <e> <s> clause offsets the proposed limitation in the up-rating of certain short-term benefits such as sickness and unemployment benefit and of invalidity benefit provided in that bill by adding on in this bill increases of per cent <e> <s> of course it is open to your lordships to debate these provisions but we shall have the opportunity to do so when the social security no <e> <s> bill comes before the house as it will before too long <e> <s> perhaps in the meantime i should explain that the proposals in clause of the no <e> <s> bill are an interim step towards the taxation of those benefits <e> <s> at present they are not taxable as are retirement pensions and other long-term benefits although it has been common ground between the parties that they should be taxable <e> <s> the chancellor of the exchequer has made it clear that it is intended to introduce proposals to treat these benefits as part of taxable income from or as soon as possible thereafter <e> <s> we believe that this will restore a fairer balance between incomes in work and incomes out of work <e> <s> pending the introduction of these proposals it is intended that these non-taxed benefits shall go up by per cent <e> <s> less than is necessary to restore their value <e>", "<cs> i will take note of the point that the noble lord has made and the other points that have been made <e> <s> there will be an opportunity to debate this on the no <e> <s> bill <e>", "<cs> the bill provides paragraph of schedule that a married woman receiving unemployment or sickness benefit or maternity allowance will be able to claim an increase of that benefit for her husband provided that he is not earning more than the amount of the increase which is <e> <s> this is precisely the same basis on which a husband can claim art increase of one of these benefits for his wife and it meets the requirements of the eec directive <e> <s> although the directive does not require it the bill goes on to allow a woman who is sick for some time and who then receives invalidity benefit to carry on claiming for her husband provided his earnings are not more than the amount of increase of that benefit which is <e> <s> the noble lord lord wells-pestell himself said that this is an improvement on the present position under which a wife can only claim for her husband if he is incapable of self-support but i recognise it does not give complete equality since a male invalidity pensioner can claim a full increase of benefit for his wife provided her earnings are less than and a tapered increase if they are not much above that level <e> <s> when however the invalidity pensioner wife retires and receives her retirement pension she can no longer receive an increase of benefit for her husband <e>", "<cs> this might be a convenient moment to break now for dinner <e> <s> it has been agreed that we should break now for three-quarters of an hour <e> <s> we will resume therefore at five minutes to eight <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord wells-pestell has quite rightly said earnings-related supplement is payable on top of the short-term flat-rate benefits unemployment sickness and injury benefits and maternity allowance <e> <s> it goes to employed people whose earnings in the relevant income tax year were above a specified level <e> <s> the rate of supplement paid at present will usually be based on earnings in the tax year and is one-third of weekly earnings from to and per cent <e> <s> of earnings between and <e> <s> the lower and upper earnings limits are linked to the lower and upper earnings limits for contributions in the relevant tax year <e> <s> both these limits are increased each year but the figure has remained unchanged for a number of years <e> <s> so that the one-third rate of earnings-related supplement is gradually becoming a smaller and smaller earnings band <e> <s> as the noble lord quite rightly said the numbers are declining <e>", "<cs> the amendment which the noble lord lord wallace of coslany has moved as it stands is superfluous because section of the pensions act already provides that the basic invalidity pension will be at the same rate as the basic category a retirement pension <e> <s> that is the position therefore there is no need even if the government were moved to accept this amendment to write it into the bill because section stands until it is repealed <e> <s> once again this is a matter which will come up on the social security no <e> <s> bill <e> <s> we shall then have an opportunity to return to the issue <e> <s> it does not arise under this bill because as i have said the position remains as it is <e>", "<cs> yes certainly <e> <s> it is section of that act which provides for the basic invalidity pension to be at the same rate as the basic category a retirement pension <e> <s> if i am wrong about that i will write to the noble lord but that is my understanding of the position <e>", "<cs> the point i was trying to make is that it would not be right to introduce a new system without a safeguard because of the possible effect of overpayments things would be automatically paid by a computer and there would not be the regular check that people now have of collecting something from a post office or wherever it may be clearly it would be a different system <e> <s> the idea of the new system is to provide a service for which many people have wished <e> <s> therefore if we do have the new system we are taking the opportunity of having the safeguard against overpayments built into it <e> <s> clearly there would he some administrative costs but we believe that they would certainly be no greater than they are at present <e> <s> one has to strike a balance between what is right and that must be made clear to the beneficiaries who choose to do this and the clear advantage of having something coming through ones bank account and the dangers of the computer getting it wrong <e> <s> there are a number of interests to be considered but we are not preventing this because we think that there would be large administrative costs on the contrary we think that it will be administratively better but we must close this loophole <e>", "<cs> the whole issue of child benefit is important and i have listened with care to what has been said in this debate <e> <s> the present position is that from next november child benefit will be increased by p an increase of per cent <e> <s> since the last increase in april <e> <s> this is equal to an annual rate of increase of per cent <e> <s> after allowing for the withdrawal of the per cent <e> <s> tax rate the personal allowance for a married couple will also go up by per cent <e> <s> for the year <e> <s> therefore families with children are not falling behind other families <e>", "<cs> there is i think one point that i should like to make on all this <e> <s> of course we should all like to do more for families with children we should like to do more for the pensioners we should like to do more for all the good causes that we have been discussing this evening <e> <s> i have not totalled up what the actual cost would be but i think it is worth the committee bearing in mind that at the end of the day one of the effects of the budget is that social security benefits will actually be increased by more than billion in the next financial year under improvements and upratings <e> <s> we may think it ought to be more but i really think we need to keep the costs of this in proportion and to recognise the sort of costs that we are talking about <e> <s> we are making an improvement <e> <s> we should all i am sure like to do more but as i have said on other occasions one cannot simply be ruled by ones heart <e> <s> one has to be ruled by ones head as well as by ones heart and we are trying to help the poorest of families in the way that i have described <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to what the noble baroness lady jeger has said on this amendment <e> <s> i accept that the maternity grant of is much less valuable today than it was when it was up-rated to that figure in <e> <s> the reason for this is that despite continuing inflation no government neither of the noble baronesss party nor of my own since has felt able to accord priority to increasing the amount of the grant <e>", "<cs> both <e> <s> the introduction of the non-contributory grant will not come in until and for the reasons that i have given namely because it will cost more and because there will be more beneficiaries <e> <s> everybody who is currently entitled to it will of course continue to have it <e> <s> it is those who will benefit when it becomes non-contributory who will start to benefit in and because we can make the administrative savings by putting this on the computers in the child benefit centre in washington and this can only be done by the savings that we shall make from this will enable us to pay the maternity grant to the estimated extra girls and women who will qualify for it <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that it is really for the convenience of the committee that we sit until roughly ten minutes to <e>", "<cs> it is five to eleven and i think it would be the wish of the committee that the house should now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords on the specific points raised by the noble baroness the premises of wreahead college near scarborough which is administered by the north yorkshire authority are to be sold although the local education authority also own grantley hall adult college <e> <s> also woodlands park cobham in surrey administered by haringey is to be closed <e> <s> on the second point with regard to des support the des does in fact grant-aid five long-term adult residential colleges which fulfil a national need and the courses carried out there are not similar to those of the short-term residential colleges <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state has agreed in principle to resume grant to a further long-term college from autumn but we could not undertake to do more than that at this juncture <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the five colleges are concerned three of which the noble baroness referred to which are long-term residential colleges it is the governments policy to continue to grant-aid these on a deficiency basis and at the moment the cost is per year <e> <s> as i indicated we are adding a further college to these <e> <s> there is a difference between these colleges and the others about short-term residential colleges in that the long-term college courses last a year sometimes two years whereas in talking about the short-term colleges we are normally talking about a weekend course <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i find it very difficult to believe it is not <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the importance of the short-term colleges <e> <s> what i hope will happen is that local authorities in looking at the provision will seek to rationalise the provision in their areas <e> <s> it is of course still open to the colleges to increase their fees it is a question of cost in many cases <e> <s> there are institutions private institutions which run courses fully costed which do manage to pay <e> <s> so one needs to look at the financing of these colleges <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not the particular details of every college but i imagine this could well be the case <e> <s> it must be remembered that on the figures we have for last year the average fee charged for the average adult education class was p <e> <s> it will of course be increased this year <e> <s> but it has to be compared with the price of a pint of beer at p or a packet of cigarettes at p <e> <s> adults taking these classes have to decide where their priorities lie <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the point that the noble lord lord janner has made is of course that he is concerned that the government are hoping to shift the responsibility from the social security system on to local authorities and i should like to make it quite clear immediately that the aim of the regulations is to codify practice <e> <s> it is not to introduce a new practice but to codify what it is and it may be helpful to the committee to remind them that the annexe to the notes on clauses beginning on page do in fact set out the general line of the recommendations so that they can be looked at now before they are published later on in an order <e> <s> i think this perhaps answers the point that the noble lord lord wells-pestell made in moving his amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sure that we have all listened with great interest to what the noble lord lord janner has had to say and let me say right away that the government are very much in favour of fostering arrangements for all the reasons that the noble lord has enumerated with which i agree entirely <e> <s> as a government we have repeatedly emphasised our commitment to the promotion of family life in the belief that the family provides the best environment for the healthy development of children <e> <s> what we are talking about in this particular amendment is how fostering arrangements should be funded <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may answer the noble baroness lady jeger because i think we are talking at cross-purposes on this matter <e> <s> she has said that it is quite wrong to suggest that somebody who is fostering children is capable of work <e> <s> the point i was making is that there are two quite separate sets of circumstances <e> <s> the present situation as i understand it is that a person who is now a local authority foster parent and has been for some time before claiming benefit would not be regarded as available for other work because of course she is a foster mother and therefore would not be required to register for employment as a condition of receiving benefit <e> <s> so that case is met which i think is the case which the noble baroness lady jeger raised <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could intervene at this moment because i think the noble and learned lord has raised an important point and i would not wish your lordships to feel that any discourtesy was intended in the arrangements which have been made <e> <s> in making my remarks i would say that i do not in any way set myself up as an expert on procedure but i would hope that we could accept the reasons why this has come about <e> <s> i shall not attempt to follow my noble friend in his quotations from <e>", "<cs> the committee will have listened with great interest to what the noble lord lord underhill has said on this amendment <e> <s> i suggest that the position is not quite as vague and indefinite as he has suggested <e> <s> i recognise that of course the definition of what constitutes an unmarried couple in this sense is important but a considerable amount of case law has been built up and i do not think that the government are being inconsistent in this matter in suggesting that we need a degree of flexibility <e> <s> it is not our view that it would be desirable to put a more specific <e>", "<cs> i very much take the noble baronesss point <e> <s> there have been hard cases in the past but my understanding of the position is that in fact particularly under the new guidelines that have been in operation now for just over two years there is a degree of case law which is building up and the rules are much more flexibly applied <e> <s> so i hope we do not have a repetition of the hard cases to which the noble baroness referred and which we would ail regret <e>", "<cs> the answer to the question of the noble lord is that the guidelines will remain the same as they are now and those under which supplementary benefits officers will operate will <e>", "<cs> in regard to these amendments i have been asked a number of questions which i shall do my best to answer with regard to both the appointment of a chief benefits officer and the question of an annual report <e> <s> my noble friend lord drumalbyn has asked me to say something more about the general background regarding benefits officers <e> <s> the bill provides for <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has made an important point <e> <s> as i understand the situation the advisory committee will not in fact make the rules <e> <s> as its name implies it will be there to advise <e> <s> the rules are set down in regulations and that makes the position quite clear <e>", "<cs> precisely yes <e> <s> the advisory committee gives advice but it does not make the rules <e> <s> the question has been asked as to whether there is a gap in these arrangements <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord wells-pestell raised this point as well as the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> what happens if for example a member of another place or of your lordships house or indeed anybody else has something to say on these matters <e> <s> how do they get it discussed and debated <e> <s> how do they get the rules altered <e> <s> i would suggest to the committee that there would be a number of ways open to anybody in those circumstances <e> <s> they can approach the advisory committee or they can as now write to the secretary of state whoever he may be <e> <s> after all the rules would be altered because for example a member of another place would say at my constituency surgery i was very worried because the following cases were brought to me or something that he or she knows from their own personal experience <e> <s> this is how these things generally arise <e> <s> or some specialist organisation became very concerned that the rules were not working properly and wished to draw it to the attention of the chief benefits officer to see whether the rules might be altered <e>", "<cs> precisely but there is no point in publishing an annual report unless there is something <e> <s> quite specific to report on what the rules ought to say about this matter <e> <s> the noble baroness will know as well as i do indeed anybody who has been in public life will know this that the publication of annual reports is an enormously time-consuming matter taking up the time of a great many people <e> <s> because of the new structure if there is nothing new to say the purpose of an annual report is not as clear as it would have been <e> <s> but i take the noble baronesss point <e> <s> there is a point in being able to publish when there is an alteration and nothing in this bill prevents that happening <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that the chief supplementary benefits officer would be appointed by the secretary of state but the secretary of state wishes to ensure his independence <e> <s> i think this has been a general rule in all these matters which we would all agree would be right <e> <s> if it is thought that he should publish a report or produce this information it would of course be perfectly possible for him to do so <e> <s> indeed the government themselves could publish statistical information <e> <s> they do on a great many matters <e> <s> there is nothing in the bill to prevent this happening <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful if i try to explain these points a little further <e> <s> we are moving into new territory <e> <s> i accept that these are very important points and i should like to feel that the committee is satisfied by the explanations because this concerns everybody who takes an interest in this matter and not least the claimants <e> <s> if i may go through the whole process as i understand it the rules that will replace what have been the decisions by supplementary benefits officers will be in regulations <e> <s> these will be made by the secretary of state and will he subject to parliament in an order <e> <s> they will be published <e> <s> this is the new framework which i think we are all agreed is desirable <e>", "<cs> this will be published by the social security commissioners <e>", "<cs> i will try again on this matter <e> <s> i realise that this is an important point <e> <s> we are moving into new territory and i hope that i have got it right <e> <s> the secretary of state is ultimately responsible for deciding upon regulations which will be laid before parliament and approved <e> <s> the chief benefits officer does not make the regulations <e> <s> he determines the way the rules are interpreted and other benefits officers look to him for advice <e> <s> he will monitor to see where there is a matter for local determination that it is a fairer way and more consistent throughout the country <e> <s> in the case of altering the rules the normal procedures will be open and the advisory committee is there to make recommendations where the rules should be altered <e>", "<cs> on this particular case if the claimant does take up a case and it goes to a tribunal and it is taken up through the court then the courts decision must be the one which would carry <e> <s> there is no point in having a decision by a court unless it carries <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord lord wells-pestell for what he has said <e> <s> i entirely agree that this is a very important matter and i have done my best to answer the questions in a new and complex field <e> <s> i am sorry that i have not made it as clear as i should <e> <s> i have tried to put it in the terms that i understand which i find is sometimes easier than the technical language of the bill over which i struggle and do not find easy <e> <s> i will look at the debate write to the noble lord and copy the letter on the points where i think there is misunderstanding <e>", "<cs> they have not disappeared because they are not important <e> <s> this is a serious point <e> <s> when i looked at this matter i found it difficult to understand <e> <s> i often think it is easier if one looks at a parallel instance and the closest parallel is the national insurance scheme <e> <s> the more one looks at the national insurance scheme the closer the parallel becomes <e> <s> they are not precisely the same but the same principles apply <e> <s> looking at that is helpful <e> <s> it is not strictly relevant to the amendments because we are not dealing with that act but with something else <e>", "<cs> at this stage i think it might be convenient to the committee to have a break for dinner <e> <s> i would hope that we might break until oclock if that is convenient to the committee <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord banks has said the purpose of his amendments would be to repeal the power in the revised schedule to the supplementary benefits act whereby the table setting out the amounts for normal requirements for supplementary benefit may be modified by means of regulations <e> <s> he himself has identified one reason for our pursuing this course which i accept <e> <s> it is true and noble lords will be aware of this that the table in sub-paragraph does provide for the alignment of supplementary benefit rates with national insurance rates <e> <s> in november this will be the result for long-term benefits but as we have already discussed in this committee my right honourable friend the secretary of state announced on the th march that that will not be the case for ordinary benefits <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can go any further this evening and add to what has already been said on this matter <e> <s> it is the intention that by the benefits will be subject to tax and therefore this will be a short-term measure in the interim <e> <s> i think there has been no further pronouncement than that and i feel unable to make a further statement on that matter to the committee this evening <e>", "<cs> i think this might be a convenient moment to conclude the committees proceedings for today <e> <s> i would therefore propose that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am glad to have the recognition from the noble baroness lady phillips <e> <s> the government are in effect undertaking the review of the inner london education service which the london government act said should be put before parliament in <e> <s> in fact this provision was repealed by the labour government in but it was clearly intended by the legislators in <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the first part of the noble baronesss supplementary question the government have already received a great many representations on this matter <e> <s> naturally we shall be willing to look at any further written expression of views from interested parties whoever may submit them <e> <s> we shall take full account of these and the earlier representations in the course of the present study <e>", "<cs> my lords this will be a government examination of the matter and plainly it concerns a number of other ministers as well as my right honourable friend <e> <s> the examination will be done in a way which involves them all <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not feel it appropriate at this moment to comment on the costs of other services because the question is concerned with education in london <e> <s> however we shall of course be looking at all aspects of this problem and we recognise that the alteration of administrative arrangements for education in inner london would have wide financial and educational implications <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the points that the noble lord has made on this matter <e> <s> the government have concluded that it would be right particularly in view of the undertaking that was given in the act and which has never for the reasons that i have already indicated been fulfilled to look at this matter <e> <s> we are setting up a government committee to do so and we shall of course take into account all the points that have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords the way that the government propose to conduct the inquiry is i think a normally accepted way of conducting inquiries of this nature <e> <s> as i said in my original reply we shall be publishing the result but since we have reached no conclusions at all on the matter i cannot say precisely what form that might take <e> <s> but of course we shall be very happy to receive evidence on this matter from anyone who cares to submit it <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness is referring in her remarks to the baker report i should make it clear that this report was not commissioned by the government and therefore it is not for me to comment upon it <e> <s> if the governments own examination of the issues leads us to conclude that a major change is necessary that would of course require legislation <e> <s> thus naturally there would be opportunity for consultation and public debate on any changes proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords this was not a government report in the sense of the government review that i have been speaking about in my answers to questions <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is quoting from a report in a newspaper <e> <s> i should like to give an assurance <e>", "<cs> well my lords the noble baroness may be quoting from ilea <e> <s> i should like to say so far as the baker report is concerned that it was not a government report and that what we are proposing to set up here is a government committee to look at the whole question <e>", "<cs> my lords by the leave of the house we are of course on report so that this is the last time that i may speak on this matter pensions in november not only kept up with prices but also made up the shortfall from the preceding year <e> <s> so retirement pensions kept up with prices and did something more <e> <s> what we have said is that in november there will be a further increase of per cent <e> <s> and we have as yet taken no decision about what may happen in because it is too difficult at this point to predict exactly what may happen <e> <s> but i say this to indicate that our record has shown that we have managed so far to keep up the standard of living of retirement pensioners <e> <s> of course it is our wish that as the economy improves because they are a large number of people in the population whose needs we are very well aware of and who need to be looked after we shall be able to do more <e> <s> but it would be wrong at this stage to make promises which it would not be possible to fulfil <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wells-pestell said that we debated a very similar amendment to this on the committee stage of this bill <e> <s> during the intervening period i have looked again at what was then said and have considered it in relation to the amendment that he has tabled this afternoon <e> <s> i am sorry that he feels that i have misunderstood his original amendment <e> <s> i recognise that his original amendment did not propose a fixed date it proposed a date not later than st november but of course as the noble lord himself has explained there are consequences which would follow from the acceptance of that original proposal which i think i made clear in my reply <e> <s> but in case there is any misunderstanding about this matter perhaps i may go through the argument again <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house we are not discussing the following year <e> <s> we are discussing the year and we have given an undertaking that it will be up-rated on st november and that guarantee has to be seen in connection with the other guarantee that it will be up-rated annually in the same month <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords who have taken part in debating this amendment have recognised that we are in fact debating the point that was debated at length in committee namely whether retirement pensions should as the bill proposes have regard to prices or should have regard to prices or earnings whichever is the greater <e> <s> i recognise that those are not the precise terms of the amendment before the house but i think that is the principle behind it <e> <s> i would say at the outset that if all old-age pensioners did as well as the noble lord lord shinwell none of them would need to worry at all because to have the capacity to speak as fluently as he does is an object lesson to us all <e> <s> the noble lord was kind about me but he does very well on his own without my help if i may tell him that without any disrespect <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness lady fisher in moving this amendment also spoke to amendments nos <e> <s> and i think it will be for the convenience of the house if i reply to all four amendments at the same time <e> <s> i was glad that the noble baroness made it clear that she was grateful for the steps that we have been able to take under this bill to give equal treatment for men and women <e> <s> we are doing so under the eec directive <e> <s> but we are going slightly further than the directive requires us to do <e> <s> in fact just to reassure myself and to remind myself of what the noble baroness lady lockwood said on this matter on second reading i looked up col of <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to what the noble baroness lady fisher has said and in the interests of historical accuracy i should say that we are not doing away with any measures of equality that may formerly have existed <e> <s> there has always been i regret to say this inequality between the sexes <e> <s> we have improved the situation in regard to a great deal of what is in this bill <e> <s> we have not gone so far as the noble baroness would like or as many of us would like but that is for the reasons i have given <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady seear is quite right in saying that this is an amendment which does not cost more money and i am sorry that as the proceedings continue i shall be sounding increasingly like scrooge <e> <s> the fact however is that we have to look at all these matters very carefully in the present economic climate <e>", "<cs> my lords the same kind of principle as the one that the noble lord lord wells-pestell has been arguing for in this amendment was of course raised in the committee proceedings in another place and in fact arose in our committee proceedings on the bill in this house <e> <s> i hope i can show to the noble lord lord wells-pestell that in fact it is not necessary to add these further words to this particular clause because throughout the proceedings on this bill both in another place and here in your lordships house the government have stressed that the new committee will be free to decide activities which it might undertake in addition to considering matters which will be referred to it by the secretary of state and the northern ireland department <e> <s> the phrase in brackets which occurs in both clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether this might be a convenient moment to break for dinner <e> <s> i believe that there is quite a lot of discussion to come on further amendments and it might be more convenient to break now than to start another amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i and my colleagues have listened with great interest to the speeches that have been made <e> <s> we very much respect the views that have been put forward and the sincerity with which they are held <e> <s> i make no apology at all for the fact that many of those who sit on this side of the house support this amendment a point that was made as though somehow this was a rather improper use of the houses time <e> <s> but this is not a narrow party political point it is a matter which affects members of the house wherever they may sit <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house may i make one point about the expense because the noble lord said that i had not fully answered this matter and i did not go into it in great detail <e> <s> it is said that if people took advantage of the scheme the cost would be between million and million <e> <s> what we do not know and what the proposers do not know is how many people might take an advantage of it <e> <s> the difficulty is that it is an open-ended commitment it is another open-ended commitment that the house is looking at <e> <s> the governments estimate is based on an assumption that perhaps per cent <e> <s> of the people eligible might take it up <e> <s> this is where we think that it would be a minimum of million <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the position is that the new arrangements will not apply to pupils at denominational schools until the end of the summer term but that pupils already attending such schools by the end of the summer term will continue to benefit while they remain in attendance at those schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the government have made their position on this matter very clear indeed <e> <s> i do not wish to repeat the discussions that we had at an earlier stage upon which this house took a decision and upon which the government took a <e>", "<cs> my lords the words of my right honourable friend the secretary of state must be read in full <e> <s> the noble baroness should refer to all his remarks not to part of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> when i moved the second reading of the bill on st april i said that it was one of the most wide-ranging and complex social security measures of recent years <e> <s> its scope has been very evident from the amendments which noble lords have felt able to put down in committee and on report ranging from entitlement to invalid care allowance to the possible extention of the option mortgage scheme <e> <s> however as your lordships will be aware clause provides that the basic retirement pension and other long-term benefits should be up-rated according to the estimated movement of prices rather than the better of prices or earnings as at present <e> <s> the clause gives statutory form to the governments commitment to protect pensioners against inflation <e> <s> this is one of the most important guarantees for them and the government have made it quite clear to pensioners that they regard this guarantee only as a minimum <e> <s> as and when the economy improves pensioners and others will share in the rising prosperity <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to try to answer the various points that have been raised at this stage <e> <s> first i should like to say to the noble lord lord wells-pestell how much i appreciated the fact that he had taken the trouble to read my comments during the third reading of the health services bill four years ago <e> <s> i must remember to re-read his comments on a similar occasion i think it would be very useful for us all <e>", "<cs> my lords we come to the end of a most interesting debate on this bill and i should like to begin by thanking my noble friends who have spoken in my support and particularly the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter the noble baroness lady vickers and the noble baroness lady macleod of borve for giving such vigorous and effective support <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i misunderstood what the noble lord said <e> <s> i will certainly read his remarks and see if there are other matters to which i should refer when we come to this in committee <e> <s> he also said that it might be better to place the obligation on the unions to pay the strike pay because the individual cannot determine whether or not the strike pay is to be given <e> <s> i think the answer to this is that the only practical way to enforce such an obligation would be to legislate for recovery of part of the supplementary benefit from the union <e> <s> this would be cumbersome and administratively very costly and would i believe be very bad for industrial relations <e> <s> it does seem to us far better to leave it to individual trade unionists to influence unions democratically to pay a proper level of strike pay rather than to intervene in this particular way <e>", "<cs> my lords tuition fees are fixed for a full academic year and it is not regarded as appropriate to make this distinction in the first year <e> <s> they will be on home fees as from september <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a government decision that the home fee will be charged after the accession of greece to the eec which takes place in january <e> <s> from september for the next academic year they will be treated as home fee payers but for this year it has been decided that they must pay the full overseas fee <e>", "<cs> my lords the latest retuns from ucca show that there has been a drop of per cent <e> <s> compared with the number of applications for march but the drop is only one of per cent <e> <s> compared with the number of applications in <e> <s> i think that it reflects the statement of the noble lord that university education in this country is of excellent value <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that the cost of a concession to greek students in would be million and this is a matter which we have decided we cannot accept this coming year <e>", "<cs> my lords i have noted what the noble lord has said <e> <s> it is of course true that all other eec students will pay the home fees as from this september but we have taken a decision on the greek students <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we shall deal with the problem better by not using exaggerated adjectives in connection with it <e> <s> the fact is that tuition fees are fixed from the beginning of the academic year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very well aware of the strong feelings of this house on the whole subject of overseas students <e> <s> we had a major debate on this matter before christmas in which the governments policy was set out <e> <s> as i have already indicated we have gone into this matter very thoroughly <e> <s> we have come to a decision that we can offer the home fees to greek students once greece is a member of the eec which will be in january <e> <s> we have looked at the financing of this and have come to <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the most encouraging sign about our present policy is the number of applications that we still receive from overseas students <e> <s> perhaps i might remind the noble baroness that if the numbers of overseas students dropped considerably more than they have done they would only then reach the number of overseas students that the former administration expected to have in our universities next year <e>", "<cs> my lords i can answer questions only on the basis of the facts as we know them but we have no reason for thinking that the position this year is other than as i have described it <e>", "<cs> my lords as if have indicated the figure on which the two sides in the burnham negotiating body are going to arbitration has been reduced by the amount of the clegg error <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that in any future negotiations the points that the noble lord has made will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will know in their report the standing commission have indicated that they took into account such items as pensions company cars hours of work and holidays but they considered that <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i take the point <e> <s> settlement on the basis of the standing commissions original recommendations was arrived at by normal and open negotiation <e> <s> on learning subsequently of the error the management side in england and wales invited the teachers to agree to reopen the negotiations <e> <s> this the teachers declined to do and the management side in england and wales therefore announced that they would take the error into account in re-expressing their offer for a settlement <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be for the convenience of your lordships at this moment to have the statement from my noble friend the foreign secretary <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> there is no doubt that we have had a tough opening to the bill and i must say that on listening to the speeches of noble lords opposite i did not feel that they bore very much relevance to the amendment that is before the committee <e> <s> we have had in effect a clause stand part debate and we have ranged over almost all the issues of the first six clauses of the bill quite apart from the central issue of clause <e>", "<cs> it was million billion yes <e> <s> it is so large that i find it rather difficult to imagine and if it sounded a bit smaller then that is perhaps because we all find it rather easier to comprehend figures which are a hit smaller <e> <s> but no the social security budget is million annually <e> <s> i should like to thank my noble friend lady macleod for her intervention because of course everybody is getting an increased benefit the situation is that some are not getting an increase as big as others <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can come on to the point about numbers that was raised by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> there is in fact no contradiction between the two lots of numbers that have been given <e> <s> the figures that i gave at second reading that is to say the are the figures of long-term invalidity pensioners and they are the group that we have been talking about under clause <e> <s> of those it is estimated as i said before that approximately either would not pay tax or would be unaffected <e> <s> the figure which was referred to is in fact the number of both the short-and the long-term beneficiaries and some of those may be getting benefit for only as little as a week <e> <s> this of course has produced different figures because we are using different numbers <e> <s> i think it is just as well to be quite clear on that particular point <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly look at the point which the noble baroness makes <e> <s> i have not got the particular question and answer before me but i shall certainly make a note of that and let her know the answer to the point she makes <e> <s> but i can assure her that i have taken advice from the treasury on this matter and i have every reason to think that the principles i have outlined are government policy and are correct <e> <s> i therefore think it is just pretending to people pretending to ourselves to suggest that somehow there is a way to get more for people at a moment when the country is not producing more and it is not kind to them <e> <s> it is deluding ourselves when we at least ought to know better and it certainly is not kind to others to pretend that we can get a lot more in these very difficult times <e>", "<cs> the point i was trying to make was in answer to one from the noble friend of the noble lord lord pitt that had we not reduced direct taxes there would have been a great deal more money to pay for social security benefits <e> <s> as i was trying to indicate we have reduced a number of direct taxes part of our manifesto commitment and most of the benefit has gone to those paying at the standard rate or below and has taken a great many people out of direct taxation altogether <e> <s> but that has been countered by indirect taxes the increase in vat in the first budget and the increase in the other indirect taxes which i have mentioned in the second <e> <s> in this way it indicates that the overall level of tax has remained relatively in balance and there is therefore not a great deal to give away for extra benefits <e>", "<cs> may i say before the noble lord sits down that so far as the governments economic policies are concerned it is perfectly true that on coming into office we faced a very serious situation including a number of postdated cheques from the previous government which we had to pick up and to meet by way of public sector pay settlements <e> <s> could i say that over the whole consideration of the abatement of the up-rating the fact is that the benefits which are concerned in this are benefits which are not taxed at present and which we hope will be brought into taxation <e> <s> it may be helpful to the committee if i repeat the words of my right honourable friend the secretary of state in another place on april th when he said <e>", "<cs> the intention of this amendment is to prevent the per cent <e> <s> abatement of the increase in short-term and invalidity benefits unless the up-rating of these benefits takes place by thursday th november <e> <s> in so far as it limits the abatement to it would also prevent the abatement in future years even if the secretary of state were to make an order under clause <e> <s> this amendment would require us to do one of two things <e> <s> either we would have <e>", "<cs> when savings in social security expenditure have to be made it seems right that part of those savings should fall on those benefits which ought to be taxable but which in fact are not <e> <s> the benefits which it is generally agreed should be taxable are the benefits which replace earnings <e> <s> unemployment benefit sickness benefit and maternity allowance all fall into this category and therefore they should be included in the abatement proposals in clause <e> <s> the clause as a whole is designed to save around million net in a full year <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord wells-pestell sits down may i clear up one point <e> <s> he asked if i had said that unemployment benefit sickness benefit and maternity allowances were all designed to replace earnings and i said the answer was yes <e> <s> the fact is that these are short-term benefits and they come to people who for one reason or another either because of short-term unemployment or sickness or in the case of a woman because she is having a baby do not have the earnings <e> <s> they may not fully replace the earnings but they do replace earnings <e> <s> they are therefore part of an income and it is expected in every case that the person who has these particular benefits will go back into work again and will pick up his salary or wage or whatever it may be <e> <s> i think therefore it is perfectly correct to describe them as replacing earnings <e>", "<cs> we shall be able to bring these benefits into taxation in that is to say in two years time <e>", "<cs> i think the noble baroness lady wootton would agree with me that her party thinks in principle that these benefits ought to be taxed <e> <s> enough of her friends in another place have gone on record as saying that as a principle it is desirable that the benefits should be taxed because the tax system should adjust for those who have the benefit and some other form of income and those who simply have the benefit and so on so that the system could be seen to be fair <e>", "<cs> i am very glad the noble baroness lady wootton prefaced her remarks by saying that she had been a magistrate for years <e> <s> may i make it quite clear that there is nothing illegal in this <e> <s> we may disagree as to whether or not this is something we should have done <e> <s> her government found themselves faced by very difficult issues and i am quite certain that many of her noble friends and her friends in another place thought it immoral when they had to make very substantial cuts in government expenditure in reply to the international monetary fund <e> <s> we did not go around saying to them at that stage that they were acting immorally <e> <s> they were faced with a difficult situation which they tried to meet <e> <s> we are doing the same <e>", "<cs> the effect of these amendments would be that the adult dependency increases would go up by per cent <e> <s> more than the personal benefit <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord lord banks but i gave a reply to that <e> <s> the figures i gave apply to those receiving invalidity benefit in the long-term <e> <s> the figures that were given in another place apply to all those receiving invalidity benefit whether in the short or long term <e> <s> therefore there is not a fundamental discrepancy they are different sets of figures <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord banks when introducing the amend <e>", "<cs> under clause the limited up-rating of short-term benefits invalidity pension and their adult dependency increases may be <e>", "<cs> i think that perhaps this would be a convenient moment to break this committee stage for the dinner hour <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that the house be now resumed <e>", "<cs> let us consider the circumstances <e> <s> it is just possible to be ill in these circumstances for six days out of seven but it is rather unlikely <e> <s> suppose someone fails to go to work on monday and is away for three days <e> <s> the point of the clause is that he would not qualify for the benefit <e> <s> he then goes back for one day which would be thursday and he then has to be off for the next three days <e> <s> of course i accept that it is possible to have a job that takes one over seven days or one goes off <e> <s> i suppose for the friday followed by the monday and tuesday and then goes back for one more day and has to do it again <e> <s> as i understand it if it is a consecutive period of time after the first three days one would get something <e> <s> so it would have to be broken employment <e> <s> i agree that it is possible but i think that if the noble lord considers the matter he will agree that it is unlikely <e> <s> to advance his whole case on something which is possible but unlikely is not very satisfactory <e>", "<cs> before we conclude the proceedings on this and i am not going to repeat all the arguments that we have had before because i accept that we will disagree about this i think it very important while recognising the complexities and difficulties of the bill to see all this in proportion <e> <s> as i and my colleagues made clear at second reading although we are introducing these measures specifically to save money and we shall save money by them there is a safety net on it <e> <s> it is really a complete exaggeration to suggest that the whole of the welfare state is being disbanded <e>", "<cs> we have made very good progress on the bill and i think it would be the wish of noble lords that we should conclude the committee proceedings for today now that we have got nearly halfway through the bill <e> <s> i beg to move that the house be now resumed <e>", "<cs> i was not intending to comment on what the noble lord lord ross is saying but there are two statements to be made and when he has completed his remarks i think we ought to resume the house to hear the statements <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord lord wells-pestell was speaking before i thought that we were going to conclude the business and divide the committee <e> <s> then the noble lord lord ross started to speak and i thought that noble lords wished to continue with the debate <e> <s> we are in committee and we could conclude discussion on the amendment at any time <e> <s> but certainly we will divide the committee at this stage if that is the wish of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord ross also wished to say something further <e>", "<cs> i think we are in a difficulty <e> <s> we are in committee <e> <s> we can go on with this debate and of course we can divide the committee at any stage the noble lord lord wells-pestell or his colleagues wish <e> <s> but i think we should now resume the house in order to take the statements <e>", "<cs> may i just explain the position <e> <s> the noble lord lord wells-pestell made a speech <e> <s> i thought he was concluding the debate on the amendment <e> <s> when he sat down the noble lord lord ross rose to speak <e> <s> at that stage we <e>", "<cs> as i understand it it will be governed by regulations <e>", "<cs> we on this side of course have a great deal of sympathy with what the noble lord lord wells-pestell and my noble friend have been saying particularly because my noble friend speaks with a wealth of experience and represents an organisation of widows and therefore has a great deal of knowledge of these matters <e> <s> the fact is that we are not in a position to be able to accept this amendment but i will of course draw the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state to the remarks that have been made in the course of this discussion <e> <s> but it would be quite wrong of me to pretend to your lordships that we are in a position to take this back and look at it again when i know in fact what the answer to that particular question is <e>", "<cs> perhaps we could take ourselves away from that point <e> <s> it would be a great mistake if the committee believed that clause had been inserted to cater for something that might be <e>", "<cs> the way in which i couched my remarks on that occasion indicates that i do not regard that as a principal reason for the bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord wallace of coslany has said often enough that he is bored hearing us say it is a bill to save money but i indicated in my opening remarks that that was indeed the purpose of the bill <e> <s> in fact the principal purpose of this clause and we have not pretended about this fact is another way of saving money <e> <s> we have said that this is a group of people who have retired and who have an occupational pension and we have chosen the figure of as a cut-off point for those who would not be eligible for this unemployment benefit <e>", "<cs> i beg the committees pardon <e> <s> i accept that the cost of this amendment is not as great as the cost of other amendments <e> <s> the point that my noble friend lord sandys made was that it would distinguish between those who <e>", "<cs> i can certainly give the noble lord the precise figure <e>", "<cs> at the beginning of his remarks the noble lord lord wellspestell said that we should get this amendment in perspective and i hope that in the course of this debate we can do so <e> <s> first i should like to confirm what indeed the noble lord lord underhill said that this clause is not about saving money <e> <s> i said in my opening speech at second reading that unlike the first five clauses of the bill this clause is not about saving money <e>", "<cs> i would not agree that we are penalising the striker in this <e> <s> the striker has his right to strike <e> <s> that is right <e> <s> that is all part of the law of the land <e> <s> it is not the responsibility of the state in those circumstances to take care of all the costs of the strike that is what we are saying in this regard <e> <s> i do not see that that is anything other than asking the trade unions to accept their fair share of responsibility in this matter and of course the fair share of the responsibility of the striker himself not only for himself but for his family <e>", "<cs> clause <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might take the opportunity to answer the point raised by my noble friend lord drumalbyn as well as that raised by the noble viscount lord simon on this matter <e> <s> may i say that the regulations to which i referred in my remarks to help meet urgent needs for losses of essential items and i listed them will be made before the clause comes into force <e> <s> i cannot say definitely that they will be available before the summer recess but they will definitely be made before november when part of the bill would come into force <e> <s> may i <e>", "<cs> this is a matter which we have not considered in this connection <e> <s> if i may i will write to my noble friend on that point but i think the answer will be that it would be very complicated to pay a benefit and then ask the person who had received it to repay it when he went back to work <e> <s> i understand that this is something which is sometimes done in other connections in continental countries but it would be a new departure in our country and would be very difficult although i understand the reasons why my noble friend put it forward <e>", "<cs> yes i appreciate the difference <e> <s> the fact is that it would be a payment of money which if i correctly understood the point would have to be repaid <e> <s> however i will write to my noble friend about this matter <e> <s> but it would be very difficult to introduce what would be an entirely new principle into our whole benefit payments and it would therefore create a number of difficulties <e> <s> however i hope with what i have said <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord banks argued his case cogently as he always does and he expressed similar views during the proceedings on the first social security bill <e> <s> unfortunately as he will appreciate the difference between us remains the same <e> <s> the amendment concentrates on one aspect of possible future provision for disabled people namely a cash benefit to compensate for the extra costs of disablement and reflects the conviction that a consultative document would bring us nearer to the position we would all like to reach on this matter <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the position is that the flowers working party reported to the university and that the university will have a view on medical education <e> <s> the overall provision of hospital services is of course another question altogether and the final decision will be for the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the work of the london health planning consortium but the noble lord lord reigate will be aware of the answer that was given in another place on this matter in which my colleague sir george young made clear that the london health planning consortium is a body consisting of representatives of the university grants committee the department of health and social security london university the four thames regional hospital authorities and the boards of governors of the postgraduate teaching hospitals <e> <s> it is submitting evidence to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services but before he takes a decision upon this matter he himself will take the advice of the advisory committee which will be looking at the recommendations <e> <s> it will therefore be some considerable time before any decisions at all are taken upon this matter <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the government are aware of the strength of feeling and i have no doubt at all that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services will take note of all that has been said in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the london school of tropical medicine is another issue <e> <s> if the noble lord will put down a question on the subject i shall try to answer it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords am aware of this fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly draw my right honourable friends attention to the remarks which have been made <e> <s> as i have already indicated the working party under lord flowers was established by the university and it will be reporting to the university of london <e>", "<cs> my lords the london health planning consortiums document <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will be aware that the british antarctic survey is one of several component bodies of the natural environment research council which receives a grant-in-aid from the science budget of the department of education and science <e> <s> i assume that his question refers to a <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend will recognise from the answer which i have already given him that we do realise the importance of the work of the british antarctic survey not only for scientific research but in our standing in the world <e> <s> we do not believe that the scale of the reductions which the council are considering will be such as seriously to weaken the united kingdoms leading position in the antarctic <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend would recognise that at a time of financial stringency it would be wrong to exempt totally any one sector of publicly-funded scientific research from bearing its share of the reductions <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that the uniqueness of the ambience for the development of creative artists provided by the current premises of the bath academy of art is very important <e> <s> but at a time of economic restraint that factor must be weighed against those of the capital and running costs and the rational distribution of educational provision generally within an area <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly draw the attention of the avon education authority to the remarks made in your lordships house as regards this question <e> <s> my understanding is that the present bath academy of art is situated on three sites <e> <s> the court to which the noble lord lord strabolgi made reference is one site and it is in a very good condition indeed <e> <s> but there are two other sites one of which as i understand it is in very poor physical condition and adverse comments about the standards of accommodation have been made by the council for national academic awards <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i should make it clear that this is in no way a move to close the academy of art <e> <s> the government recognise its importance in the national life and there is no suggestion at all of closure <e> <s> it is simply a question that the avon local education authority is still considering no decisions have been made whether or not in view of the poor nature of some of the present accommodation there should be a move to the bath college of higher education in bath itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the whole question of the standard of the teaching of art is really quite wide of this question and i could not comment on it <e> <s> if the noble lord lord feversham would like to put down a question on this subject i should be glad to try to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords to the best of my knowledge they must wait until this bill goes on to the statute book but if i am wrong in the information that i am giving the noble lord my noble friend lord cullen of ashbourne will correct the point when he winds up <e> <s> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware of all the circumstances that the noble baroness has outlined <e> <s> i should like to assure the house that there will be no unnecessary delay in bringing this matter to a satisfactory conclusion and indeed we expect this to be before the end of next month <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we very much appreciate the position that the noble lord has outlined <e> <s> i cannot go further than what i have said in my answers to questions this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very well aware of the view of the house on the matter of overseas students fees and the difficulties that have arisen from it <e> <s> like other members of the government i wish that it was not necessary to embark on these kinds of economy but the fact is that it is <e> <s> we have taken this decision which we believe to be a fair one because it will mean a saving of about l million <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for that intervention because of course once greece becomes a full member of the eec then the home rate of fees will apply <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that tuition fees are normally fixed in advance for a full academic year <e> <s> that is why the concession to greek students will be given in the first full academic year after the accession of greece to the eec <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is another question and if the noble lord would put down a question on that point i should he happy to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that this precise point was raised when this matter was discussed on an earlier occasion and i accept that some tuition fees are sometimes collected in termly instalments <e> <s> however there is an increasing tendency to collect them in advance for the very practical reason that sometimes there is the non-payment of fees by some students and it is extremely difficult to collect them later on <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an agreement that we have reached in regard to students coming from the eec and of course it would be quite wrong in those circumstances to discriminate against greek students in respect of arrangements that have been made for students from other members of the eec <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord wallace of coslany has explained this amendment would ensure that no further abatements could be applied to a benefit once it is brought into taxation <e> <s> in discussing this matter we are going over fairly well-trodden ground <e> <s> i hesitate to say to the noble lord lord wallace who was so concerned at the committee stage that we constantly referred to the need to make reductions in public expenditure that that is the reason for the first five clauses of this bill <e> <s> they are reductions which we believe are an essential part of the governments economic strategy <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by agreeing with the noble baroness lady phillips that there is a great deal of difficulty in understanding the terminology of this bill <e> <s> i find it difficult myself <e> <s> one can indeed describe the effects of clause <e> <s> one might say of course that everyone will get an increase although some peoples increase will not be as large as others <e> <s> that is perhaps not a way that the noble baroness would agree with but it is at least one way of describing it <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that this is a short-term benefit and these are short-term benefits that are not taxed <e> <s> if i am wrong about that i will certainly let the noble baroness know later on in the proceedings but that is my understanding of the position <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house the noble lord lord banks asked whether there were any lengths to which the government would not go to save money <e> <s> when we were looking for savings in government expenditure we had to look at all aspects of government policy <e> <s> as i indicated in my answer to the first amendment the social security budget stands now at billion annually <e> <s> we believe that it was right that this should not be exempt but should be looked at <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services has in an area where there will always be difficulties looked at those parts which he believes will cause the least harm <e>", "<cs> my lords the government believe that in fact this amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> the noble lord lord wells-pestell referred to the provisions of section of the social security act which mean that when my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services lays a draft up-rating order following upon a review setting out the new benefit rates for the approval of both houses of parliament he has to satisfy himself that the order increases the existing rates at least to such an extent as is necessary to restore their value in relation to the general level of prices subject of course to the abatement of up to per cent <e> <s> in the increase of certain benefits tinder the provisions of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i think there is confusion here on the part of the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> there are two matters at <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great care to what the noble lord lord wallace of coslany has said in moving this amendment and i must apologise to the house if i did not answer the questions to his satisfaction on committee <e> <s> i must clearly try again this time round <e> <s> as indeed has been explained this same amendment was discussed in committee <e> <s> the per cent <e> <s> abatement in is an integral part of the governments overall strategy to achieve savings in public expenditure <e> <s> it is essential that the government have the power to put to parliament proposals for a future abatement should the necessity arise <e> <s> but i should like to emphasise yet again that the government have at present no intention of repeating the abatement in either or <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to correct one point <e> <s> we are not making cuts of per cent <e> <s> as i have indicated but it is an important point and i should like to emphasise it again under clause the up-rating is per cent <e> <s> less for those to whom clause i applies <e> <s> the abatement cannot be applied in or in without an order being laid <e> <s> it is therefore not correct to say that the abatement is per cent <e> <s> it is per cent <e> <s> that is an important matter of fact <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord banks said this amendment is similar to amendments proposed by the noble lords lord wells-pestell and lord banks in committee <e> <s> i accept that it differs from earlier amendments in important respects <e> <s> in committee we were discussing an amendment intended to ensure that the value of all the benefits affected by clause of the bill would be restored when they were brought into taxation <e> <s> this amendment seeks to restore the value of only <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the very strong feeling of the house on these questions <e> <s> this is not an easy matter for any of us and we have previously been over the ground in regard to the governments reasons for introducing this legislation at all <e> <s> i also take the other point of the noble lord about difficulties that arise in local authority social services departments but in this connection i should point out that invalidity benefit was after all introduced by a conservative government in <e> <s> we also introduced the attendance allowance which was increased by nearly per cent <e> <s> last year and will be raised again this year in line with the expected increase in prices <e> <s> supplementary benefits and the noncontributory invalidity pension have similarly been protected against inflation while the mobility allowance was raised from to last november and this november will go up to a week <e> <s> fifteen thousand disabled people aged between and were phased into the mobility allowance last november sooner than the labour government had intended and from november the disabled will be able to claim the longer-term rate of supplementary benefit after one year instead of two years <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may answer that point from the noble viscount lord simon <e> <s> it is perfectly true that we have already debated issues in which there are statutory obligations for example looking at the whole question of the movement of prices in relation to retirement pensions <e> <s> these matters already appear in legislation <e> <s> but of course the difficulties that we have got ourselves into and one of the reasons why we have to have this bill is that these matters are in legislation and they are now having to be repealed and we have written clause i into this bill <e> <s> it surely would not he wise therefore to accept a situation in which we would be writing into this bill something which was a commitment for the future which we could not fulfil <e>", "<cs> my lords i think if the noble lord lord wallace reads very carefully what my noble friend lord cullen has said i am sure he will read it tomorrow in <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this is outside the terms of this bill but if i can i shall get an answer to the noble lord and let him know <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of this amendment would be to exclude strikers over pensionable age that is for men or for women from the reduction in supplementary benefit <e> <s> the effect of it would be to put these strikers in a special privileged category and to ensure that they received a week more supplementary benefit than their fellow strikers who had not yet reached the ages of or of <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this might be a convenient moment to break for dinner <e> <s> i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned until eight oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of this amendment would be to remove the proposed deduction of a week from the supplementary benefit now payable to a striker for his family and would substitute instead a new rule whereby benefit would be paid only if it exceeded p a week <e> <s> there is no getting away from the fact that this is a wrecking amendment <e> <s> i should like to make it clear at the outset that this clause which is a commitment in our manifesto is not aimed against trade unions at all <e> <s> but one of its purposes is to ensure that trade unions contribute when their members are on strike <e> <s> the whole purpose of this clause is to enable us to fulfil our election promise to ensure that the trade unions pay a fair share of the cost of supporting

of this clause <e> <s> i was also very pleased to hear what my noble friend lord mottistone said about it because this has set out the governments view very clearly <e> <s> but i think it would be helpful to the house if i answered the various points which have arisen about it <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the position is that they would be entitled to all the supplementary benefits to which they would have been entitled with the exception of the <e> <s> that is what this clause sets out to do <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord wells-pestell has said the effect of this

part of his supplementary question <e> <s> on the second part of course the monitoring process is entirely to take account of the kind of facts that he has elucidated and <e>", "<cs> i think that the whole committee will be grateful to the noble lord lord wells-pestell for giving us an opportunity to look in some detail at clause and for the way in which he <e>", "<cs> i and my colleagues are grateful for the general welcome that has been given to this clause and the very helpful and constructive suggestions that have been made by all those who have spoken <e> <s> the noble baroness lady robson raised a very important point about not allowing the reorganisation to go on too long <e> <s> can i reiterate what i said at the beginning in answering the noble lord lord wells-pestell about

information that i can give i will of course come back at a later stage <e> <s> when i was asked by the noble lord lord wells-pestell how many jobs i thought might be lost i said that we cannot give an exact figure but what we can say is that at present there are separate area and district headquarters organisations and as we believe that after our proposals there will be between and district health authorities this means that there will be a reduction of between and headquarters organisations and it is on that estimate that the figure of per cent <e> <s> is based <e>", "<cs> i should like to confirm again that the object of this bill certainly this clause is not to save money <e> <s> i was grateful that the noble baroness lady robson made this point quite clear because our whole objective in this connection is to get a simplified management structure with better accountability <e> <s> we believe this is something which will be welcomed by the public and it comes about as a result of our consultative document <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the whole committee has listened with great care to what the noble baroness lady robson has said in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> and to the series of amendments <e> <s> i am glad of the general welcome that she has given to clause on the joint financing arrangments <e> <s> the amendment that she has proposed would have the effect of extending the scope of joint finance beyond the personal social services to a broad range of functions some aspects of which lie outside the responsibilities of local government <e> <s> indeed she herself argued her case on extending the area for joint financing schemes <e> <s> however the intention behind clause is to give legislative expression to the present well-established arrangements known as joint financing <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but that is not true <e> <s> the government are going to increase child benefit from next november <e>", "<cs> if i may return to the question of child benefit which is rather wide of the bill it was increased in the april immediately preceding the time when we came to office in the succeeding may and the increase in child benefit of per cent <e> <s> will keep up with the rise in prices <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord lord wells-pestell should feel that this is a very unsatisfactory clause but i can assure him that in this we are not seeking any new draconian powers <e> <s> health authorities have always been expected to conduct their business within the financial resources allocated to them and the introduction of cash limits on public expenditure required us to change our methods of financial management <e> <s> it might be helpful if i explained in a little more detail why the new procedure is necessary <e>", "<cs> i shall try to give a more detailed answer and then if it is not as full as the noble lord would like i will of course write to him further <e> <s> he is probably thinking how the new powers that we have in this bill would have avoided the situation last year when a health authority overspent its money <e> <s> there is a power for the secretary of state in the proposed section a to issue directions to ensure that authorities comply with their new duty <e> <s> we anticipate making general dirctions under these powers <e> <s> one such direction will specify that area health authorities should submit to regions a profile of their expenditure for the forthcoming year showing how much they expect to spend each month and in total <e> <s> if the profile submitted is more than the sum allotted plus other income then if reason does not prevail the region can ask the secretary of state to issue a specific direction to the area health authorities seeking a reduction in forecast expenditure to the required level <e> <s> similarly general directions will provide for actual spending to be reported and compared with the profile <e> <s> if the trend of actual expenditure exceeds that forecast on the profile then failing reasonable explanations the regional health authority may wish to ask the secretary of state for a specific direction requiring the rate of expenditure to be reduced <e>", "<cs> i recognise the strength of the feeling of the committee and it is an issue as the noble baroness quite rightly said which she raised during the second reading debate <e> <s> i say right away that the government recognise the case which has been put most forcefully this evening that many gps are assisted in their practice by their relatives particularly by their wives and that some are employed in this way on a regular basis <e> <s> there is no legal impediment to this <e> <s> the government are also keenly aware of the strength of feeling among gps and relatives working with them about their exclusion from the reimbursement arrangements for non-related ancillary staff employed by gps <e> <s> this exclusion is of long standing it goes back to the start of the ancillary staff reimbursement scheme in which was agreed at that time with the representatives of the medical profession <e>", "<cs> the difficulty is that at the present time a general practitioner who employs someone who is not his wife is reimbursed by per cent <e> <s> and there is this per cent <e> <s> because of this contractual relationship with somebody outside who is his employee it is much easier to keep a check on what is <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i may not have fully understood the point made by the noble lord <e> <s> the problem is that it would involve increased expenditure <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i will try to explain it again <e> <s> as i understand the position a gp can employ someone as his secretary and claim per cent <e> <s> of the cost <e> <s> what such a person pays for his help will vary inevitably from one part of the country to another <e> <s> that is quite unlike the mps secretarial allowance which i believe is related to what is as it were the going rate in london which he would have to pay <e> <s> therefore as i say there would be variations between one part of the country and another <e> <s> there is no ceiling on this because clearly what is required in one part is different from what is required in another part but it is perfectly possible to keep a check on the total <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i did not wish in any way to mislead the committee <e> <s> the noble lord lord donaldson practically suggests that i was pulling a fast one to mislead the committee about this <e> <s> i was asked why we could not do what is done for mps wives <e> <s> in that case there is a ceiling on what can be spent because the amount of money given is related to secretarial allowances in london <e> <s> there are two issues here <e> <s> there is the question of a ceiling and the accountability because as i understand it the amount of money varies from one part of the country to another and it would inevitably involve more expenditure <e> <s> therefore the two things are different but the whole case does not rest on the analogy with mps wives <e> <s> in fact in the case of the scheme that we recently brought in and it could apply i think to the case raised by the noble baroness lady masham under the related ancillary staffs scheme there is a ceiling because there is an allowance system but we cannot widen that scheme right away for financial reasons <e> <s> that is ultimately the difficulty about accepting the amendment <e>", "<cs> i would agree with the noble lord lord pitt that there is a discrimination against wives and that they have a legitimate grievance about it but as i understand it what has happened is that gradually the amount of money that has been allowed for people employed by gps has been increased <e> <s> the noble lord lord winstanley took us through this step by step <e> <s> first certain categories of people were allowed for quite specific elements of help <e> <s> then the provisions were extended to allow a wife who is a qualified nurse to receive the benefit <e> <s> what has not happened and i quite see that it may sound very odd to my noble friend lord mottistone but i think there is a difference is that the wife who is not a qualified nurse but who helps her <e>", "<cs> i do not think i am going to follow my noble friend down that line of argument <e> <s> however i will take note of the point which the noble lord lord winstanley and the noble lord lord pitt have made <e> <s> i will certainly draw it to my right honourable friends attention and consider this matter between now and the next stage <e>", "<cs> i beg t the house be now resumed <e>", "<cs> i wonder if the lord chairman could help us <e> <s> this is really a procedural point to know how we should best proceed <e> <s> we have not yet had the motion that clause stand part and the amendment would be to take out clause and put a new one in <e> <s> i think it would be helpful to know how we should proceed on this <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way for a moment <e> <s> on the first point of the six principles that have been agreed i believe that we are talking somewhat at cross purposes because the first is in fact a statutory safeguard <e> <s> the statutory safeguard in the bill is that the bill retains the legislative provision that pay beds will be authorised only where this does not significantly prejudice national health service services <e> <s> that is the reference in the first of the principles and this is provided under clause which links the sections in the act referred to which provide for authorisation of facilities for private patient use with section which contains this restriction on the use of the power <e> <s> we shall discuss this matter under clause <e> <s> but that is the reference and it is a legislative one <e>", "<cs> to the best of my knowledge the amenity beds will remain as they are now within the national health service <e> <s> if i should add something further to that i shall let the noble lord know later in the proceedings or write to him <e>", "<cs> the effects of this amendment would be to provide for statutory common waiting lists for all national health service and private patients and for local monitoring of the arrangements <e> <s> the secretary of state would be required to direct a health authority that private patients could be admitted only if he was satisfied that the authority were operating on this basis <e> <s> i assume that the amendment is designed to instigate a debate on the whole question of queue-jumping and common waiting lists and the governments own six principles which we have already discussed <e>", "<cs> so far as the question of monitoring is concerned <e>", "<cs> it is very helpful that the noble baroness lady robson of kiddington has raised this matter so that we can discuss it fully in the committee <e> <s> the question of the private medical sectors contribution to staff training has been discussed both in our house and in another place on a number of occasions in the past months <e> <s> it was raised during our own debate in march <e> <s> it was first raised by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services during the second reading debate last december in another place <e> <s> the secretary of state said then that although the state trained many people who then went to work in the private sector and there was an argument that there was no reason why the private medical sector should make a contribution to training there was a good case for saying that in the case of health personnel the position was different <e> <s> where the nhs was short of qualified staff and where the training was expensive then the private sector should help by training more of its staff to meet its own needs <e> <s> the secretary of state mentioned that there already was some private sector staff training the government thought there could be more and their policy was to help the private sector increase its contribution <e> <s> this was in effect a challenge to the private sector to do more <e>", "<cs> no we do not rule that out as a possibility <e> <s> i hope i made that clear this is one of the things that are being discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to both the noble lord lord wells-pestell and the noble lord lord winstanley for their general welcome of this statement <e> <s> may i begin my reply by assuring the noble lord lord wellspestell that paragraph of the circular clearly states <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it rather difficult to comment on what the noble lord lord wells-pestell has in his hand <e> <s> perhaps this is a matter we might resolve another time <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the decision by the east midlands regional council reflects the decision taken by the constituent local authorities to reduce greatly their support for the council but this will affect only the training programme for tutors of the adult literacy and basic skills unit and not the other activities <e> <s> while we do not welcome the decision by the local authorities in the east midlands we accept that it is a matter which they are entitled to determine in the light of their own priorities and of the resources available to them <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lords first question is that the spread of the funds of the adult literacy and basic skills unit will depend on the proposals that come forward or can be developed by the unit itself <e> <s> a major part of the units funds are to be used for support of special development projects and that includes <e>", "<cs> i must apologise to the noble baroness because i could not fully hear all her question <e> <s> the question of how the funds will be used and their spread will be a matter of course for the adult literacy unit to determine itself <e> <s> but we do believe that local authorities should be responsible for local provision in their areas and in other areas of adult education <e> <s> we very much recognise that the work on literacy and numeracy is relatively expensive in terms of resources but we hope very much that local authorities will bear in mind the priority which the government attach to work with the disadvantaged <e> <s> in the course of the normal discussions with the local authorities about expenditure on education we will explore with them their ability to maintain and even increase in provision of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i have indicated in my earlier answers to the other questions which have been asked the importance the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope my noble friend will agree with me that his question is rather wide of the question which is down on the order paper <e> <s> but if he would like to put down a question on that subject i will do my best to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house as we are on report the point that i was trying to make about the chc observers at family practitioner committees was that what family practitioner committees would object to was the fact that they would be compelled to admit as observers people from community health councils <e> <s> it would not necessarily be an objection to the community health councils themselves <e> <s> there is a difference and it is a question of whether or not they should be compelled to admit them <e> <s> i think all of us recognise today that the climate of opinion is for more open government is to have observers in places and committees where this is possible <e> <s> i fully recognise that the noble lords amendment does say that when confidential matters are to be discussed the observers would not be there the observers would be there only for general health matters <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to thank all those who have taken part in this short debate <e> <s> at the outset i should say that the noble baroness lady masham of ilton has written to me to give her apologies for not being here this afternoon but she is unable to be present <e> <s> she sent me copies of samples of a great deal of the correspondence that she has had so even if i was not aware from people who have brought it directly to my attention i would have had it from the letters which she has sent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord wells-pestell and to the noble lord lord sandford for raising this important aspect of local authority membership of health authorities <e> <s> the amendments already made by the bill to schedule to the national health service act merely apply the existing provisions concerning local authority membership to district health authorities <e> <s> that means that only non-metropolitan county councils metropolitan district councils and london boroughs can appoint members directly to health authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the important matter before the house is that the noble lord should move the amendment so that it can be agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already indicated the government are prepared to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lords lord wells-pestell and lord wallace for what they have said about the arrangements as this bill has proceeded through the house <e> <s> i would as a new issue has been raised like to reply briefly to the noble lord lord wells-pestell on what he has said <e> <s> to myself and my noble friends it is a matter of regret that he should continue to feel that anything that we may have said about private patients is in any way designed to take away our support for what is done in the national health service <e> <s> this is clearly the most important part of the health services of our country and we stand by it we support it and we are great respecters and admirers of what it does <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to interrupt anybody because i know there are a number of noble lords who want to speak but an enormous number of questions have been asked and i wonder whether it would be for the convenience of the house if some of them were answered at this point before my noble friend lord cullen winds up at the end <e> <s> if this is agreeable i suggest that my noble friend lord sandys should speak now and then the noble lord on the liberal benches and any other noble lord who wants to speak <e> <s> otherwise we are accumulating rather a lot of questions to be answered at the end <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure of the procedure at this point but i felt that it might be for the convenience of the house if i move one by one the regulations in case there are further points anyone wishes to raise on them <e> <s> in moving the first regulation i should like to mention the work that has been done by the joint committee on statutory instruments in reviewing each order and reporting on it <e> <s> in the case of these orders they drew special attention only to the no <e> <s> supplementary benefit requirements regulations but i know that the committee has done a great deal of valuable work and i am sure that it would be the wish of us all that this should be placed on the record <e> <s> i beg to move the first order the social security benefits up-rating order standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the family income supplements computation regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the child benefit up-rating regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the pensioners lump sum payments order <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the social security benefit married women and widows special provisions amendment regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the supplementary benefit resources regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the supplementary benefit requirements regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords the joint proposals of the association of university teachers and the university authorities were received on th may <e> <s> the relationship of the cost of the universities existing cash limits is of course only one factor in this whole question and other factors to be considered would include the general economic situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot comment on the first part of the noble lords supplementary because it is hypothetical <e> <s> in reply to the second part in which he spoke of fears of another pay anomaly the government have no plans at present to introduce a statutory wage freeze but the general level of pay increases must be lowered to what can be afforded <e>", "<cs> my lords again that is a hypothetical question on which i cannot comment at this stage <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that comment my lords which i am sure will be noted by the negotiating parties <e>", "<cs> my lords the reference must be taken in conjunction with the reply i gave to the noble lord lord wynne-jones who was referring to what happened in and i wish to indicate that the situation is different now <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept any of the points the noble lord made <e> <s> the noble lord may like to know that the secretary of state received letters and petitions signed by people in support of the proposal and by against it <e> <s> secondly the church of england has church schools both for the first and middle school in ealing but not a high school for pupils over the age of <e> <s> the need is quite clear because about children leave the borough each year to go to church of england schools in other authorities <e> <s> the church of england made a canvass of parents in the borough and the returns showed that parents of children would make a church of england school their first choice <e>", "<cs> my lords the london diocesan board of education will pay the ealing authority million for twyford school and will be eligible for a grant of per cent <e> <s> of the purchase price of the school from the department <e> <s> they will pay the remaining per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the right reverend prelate very much for his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the admissions policy of the school is concerned as the noble baroness will know that it is a matter in a voluntary-aided school for the governors of the school and i understand that it was originally the diocesan boards intention that admissions to the new school would be arranged so as to reflect the social and ethnic composition of the borough <e> <s> no doubt the noble baroness will be aware that the commission for racial equality advised them that any arrangements on those lines could be regarded as illegal under the race relations act <e> <s> my information is that on the basis of the statement made by the london diocesan board in november they have suggested that applications for admission to the school would be open to all children in the borough in the event of over-subscription preference would be given to the children of anglican parents <e> <s> i cannot however accept that this school could be regarded as being in any way against the interests of ethnic minorities in the borough <e>", "<cs> my lords the particular arrangements that have been agreed in this specific case in ealing are so far as i know the only ones of this exact kind <e> <s> there are however other instances in which the church of england has bought county schools and i should <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite prepared to accept that this school has been a good school in the past and i have every confidence that it will remain a very good school in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the worry and anxiety that uncertainty causes in a situation like this but perhaps i should make clear that there has never been any suggestion that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord has said on this matter and i understand that the senate of the university is considering the matter now and that the court will consider it next week <e> <s> in the meantime i am sure the noble lord will be the first to appreciate that a teaching hospital and a medical school are closely interdependent and that if one changes character so must the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely recognise the importance of my noble friends remarks but the fact is that the flowers working party which is making recommendations about medical schools in the university of london is an internal working party of london university and decisions on its recommendations are essentially a matter for the university which is responsible for its own internal organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish entirely to confirm what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i shall of course draw the remarks that have been made this afternoon to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services <e>", "<cs> my lords while noting what the noble lord has said perhaps i may make it quite clear that before a decision is taken on the westminster hospital a decision must first of all be reached on the question of the medical school the matter will then be referred to the london advisory group and will then be considered by my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> so there are a number of stages before the decision will be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the position is that the committee under the chairmanship of sir john habakkuk will be reviewed and the continuing need for the group will be considered again in mid- <e>", "<cs> my lords as always we have had a very strenuous and interesting debate on this scheme <e> <s> it has reminded me very much of the hours and the days that we spent in discussing the education act <e> <s> first i should like to thank in particular the noble lord lord james of rusholme for as always a most thoughtful speech based on a lifetime of experience of teaching in the type of school that we are talking about <e> <s> i should also like to thank my noble friend lord eccles for his most helpful remarks based on his long experience of education and in particular on the fact that he is a former minister of education <e> <s> i wish to thank too the noble lord lord garner who spoke most thoughtfully and referred to some of the hesitations felt by those schools that have decided to join the scheme <e>", "<cs> i am sure that noble lords are not really going to be upset by remarks of this nature and as i say i am in a very forgiving mood this afternoon <e> <s> i shall of course return later in my remarks to the detailed points made by the noble lords <e> <s> as for the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley i must say to him that i really was surprised that he should have made such an illiberal speech <e> <s> i should have thought that above all the liberal party recognises the right of parents having paid their rates and taxes to pay for their childrens education should they so wish <e> <s> the implication that there was something <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it will apply both at years old and at years old <e> <s> the schools will select <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the position is that the requirement for our children of course is that they should have been born to united kingdom nationals and in the case of people who come to this country they must be resident here for three years before they qualify either for this scheme or for student awards as the noble lord will be aware <e> <s> we are bringing our scheme very much into line with the award scheme for higher education <e>", "<cs> my lords may i answer the second point about that <e> <s> the position about eec nationals is that this comes under the treaty of rome and they automatically qualify immediately for the same kind of treatment as those born here <e> <s> there is this distinction between the children of eec nationals employed here and those coming in from other parts of the world <e> <s> if i have not made myself quite clear i shall be very happy to write to the noble lord but i can assure him that we are not doing more than we should for the eec <e> <s> we are bringing our law into line with what is required by the treaty of rome and the general principle in the scheme is the same as that which applies to student awards <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly write to the noble lord once again setting out the position and if i <e>", "<cs> my lords i will cretainly copy the letter to the noble lord <e> <s> lord davies there is no question about that <e> <s> i can assure him that we are bringing our legislation into line with the requirements of article of the eec regulations which covers this matter as we must do <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a short and i think useful debate on these regulations <e> <s> i should like to begin by thanking my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for his intervention and for explaining very fully to the house why all regulations of this sort need to be as complicated as they are <e> <s> that is not to say that one should not attempt to <e>", "<cs> at the end of his remarks the noble lord argued very strongly and quite seriously that we should not accept these regulations today <e> <s> i would urge him to consider just where we would be if i agreed to withdraw the regulations as he recognised that there would not be time to rewrite them and therefore their effects would not come into force on th november <e> <s> after all many of the regulations are those that he and his colleagues would wish to see put into practice <e> <s> i really do not think it would be in the best interests of the beneficiaries to withdraw them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that that is just the kind of point that will have to be answered in future regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make it quite clear that what we are attempting to do is to bring all the regulations together so that there will be the minimum of discretion for supplementary benefit officers <e> <s> it has not been the practice to place such information in the printed paper office <e> <s> these types of book are often quite expensive but a copy of the handbook will be available in the library for any noble lord who wants to find out about the particular regulations <e> <s> there will also be available leaflets giving explanations of particular parts of the regulations because after all most claimants will not want to look at all the regulations <e> <s> we are to state in writing to claimants what their assessment will be so that they can see it which i think will be an advantage to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones heard the remarks of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter on this aspect <e> <s> the regulations are to a certain extent historical and they have been evolved over a long period of time <e> <s> as the noble lord said quite rightly the more we try to find regulations to meet various different aspects the more complicated the regulations become <e> <s> one of the difficulties has arisen because considerable discretion has been given to supplementary benefit officers in their interpretation of the regulations with the result that so far as the beneficiary was concerned the amounts of money and so on the rules have varied from place to place <e> <s> it is in an attempt to get rid of this inequity and differing treatment in one part of the country as compared with another that we have brought the supplementary benefit regulations together and tried to eliminate virtually all the discriminatory possibilities on the part of supplementary benefit officers <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both the noble lord lord wells-pestell and the noble lord lord winstanley for welcoming this report and particularly for their congratulations to sir john boynton in which i think we all share <e> <s> in answer to the questions the noble lord lord wells-pestell asked quite particularly about finance <e> <s> perhaps i could say that it is not proposed that there will be any addition to total public expenditure arising from this report but the secretary of state will be considering whether he can find savings from elsewhere <e> <s> i think i should say that the review team pointed out that shortage of funds was not in fact an important factor in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement is concerned with the boynton report on rampton but as i said at the end of the statement my right honourable friend the secretary of state hopes that we shall be able to involve people from outside in the work of the four special hospitals of which broadmoor is one <e> <s> there will be the review board in the case of rampton and in the case of moss side and park lane there will <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord auckland for what he has said about the staffing problem <e> <s> we all recognise that they have a difficult job to do and i am sure that it would be the wish of the whole house that we should recognise this <e> <s> none the less we must recognise the public anxiety caused by the revelations of the television programme <e> <s> on his last point i do not wish to comment on what may have appeared in the press <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point i should like to reiterate that the expenditure on the youth service generally is not being cut and our current plans for public expenditure assume that it will continue at the same rate <e> <s> on the point about specific earmarking through the rate support grant i should like to explain that the proposals that have been made are a logical extension of the step taken some years ago when local authorities were made responsible for the selection of projects for support the des has simply supported those projects which the local authorities themselves have chosen to support from the voluntary organisations <e> <s> on the last point i should like to confirm that of course i and my colleagues recognise the importance of village halls and the importance of village life in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords the amount of money that is being spent on local youth and community projects in the current year that is to say is million <e> <s> i cannot say whether all that is going on village halls but it is on those projects for which specific grant would be paid <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already indicated this is a logical extension of what has been happening for some time and it follows that it is our policy to reduce the central influence in matters which we believe to be essentially for local decision <e> <s> it is true that there will be some saving of staff in the des as a result of this <e> <s> it is as i say a logical extension of policies which have been initiated in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always very grateful to my noble friend lord nugent for his kindly interventions <e>", "<cs> my lords the two particular points mentioned by the noble lord were similar to proposals put to my right honourable friend the secretary of state by the national council of voluntary organisations and the national council for voluntary youth services a short time ago <e> <s> my right honourable friend is considering these two matters and i will draw to his attention the points made by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both the noble lords lord wells-pestell and lord banks for their welcome of the statement <e> <s> with regard to the first point raised by the noble lord lord wells-pestell regarding consultation i should like to make it clear that this is a consultation document and we welcome the views of all those who are interested in the matter <e> <s> the views should be sent to the dhss by the end of february <e> <s> this is an important matter and in every sense this is a consultation document <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has misunderstood what i said <e> <s> i said that the amount of social security expenditure which is non-contributory has increased to per cent <e> <s> this part of the bill has nothing to do with cutting expenditure in order to make up the fall in what the treasury will contribute a larger proportion will be paid for by higher contributions <e> <s> that will be half of the per cent increase that employees will take <e>", "<cs> what i said my lords and i believe it to be true was that the amount of money that the local authorities were spending on social services was higher in real terms than that spent by the last administration <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is one issue on which i think we can all agree it is that we have had a good debate <e> <s> we have had an outstanding maiden speech from the noble viscount lord mersey who spoke so very knowledgeably about the dreaded disease of leprosy <e> <s> i think that the whole house was riveted while he spoke and i hope that we shall hear from him many times in the future <e> <s> he was as well with the exception of the noble baroness lady ryder the only noble lord who referred at all to the international dimension of the international year of disabled people <e> <s> at the same time we have heard a great number of positive suggestions for action and have listened to many moving speeches based on personal experiences of disablement <e>", "<cs> i assure the noble lord lord shinwell that i was not reluctant to intervene <e> <s> i was trying to intervene but there has been such a tremendous amount of interest expressed in the amendment and now on the constitutional points about your lordships proceedings that it has been difficult to intervene at all <e> <s> i shall not go far down the constitutional path today this is not a money bill and it is quite proper for your lordships to discuss it although i shall ask the committee to resist the amendment and therefore i do not wish it to be pressed to a division i understand that that would be possible if your lordships wished to do so <e> <s> the house of lords has implicitly accepted the commons financial privileges for a long time and does not seek to amend bills of aids and supplies or money bills under the parliament acts <e> <s> however as has been pointed out this bill is concerned with a fund so it is technically possible for us to amend it <e> <s> i feel however that all that has been said means that we should not put ourselves in a very good stance <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord wells-pestell has said the effect of this amendment would be to increase the primary that is the employees share class contribution rate from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> instead of to per cent <e> <s> as under the bill that is a per cent <e> <s> increase instead of a per cent <e> <s> increase <e> <s> as the committee will be aware the per cent <e> <s> increase under the bill is the sum of three elements per cent <e> <s> is to offset the reduction in the treasury supplement per cent <e> <s> is to provide for the increases in the national health service contribution and per cent <e> <s> is to ensure that the national insurance fund will be kept in broad balance <e>", "<cs> may i answer directly the noble lord on that point <e> <s> i think there is some misunderstanding about this clause <e> <s> in clause <e>", "<cs> it is clear that the noble lord lord wells-pestell sees the bill as a temporary expedient a measure devised by the government to overcome immediate economic problems <e> <s> that is not the case <e> <s> the bill is an essential feature of the governments medium-term economic strategy and it achieves what we regard as these desirable effects first it helps to reduce government spending and eases the pressure on the public sector borrowing requirement secondly it collects the balance of responsibility for financing the social security system as between the contributor and the general taxpayer something to which we attach great importance and thirdly it restores the value of the national health service contributions <e>", "<cs> i have no reason to think that has ever been done before but if that information is not correct i will write to the noble lord <e> <s> my understanding is that it would be quite exceptional if the amendment were carried <e>", "<cs> our devolved system may at first appear to be more confused but i believe that it is an extremely good system <e> <s> it is a national system locally administered in which responsibility is shared between local government and the teachers and governors of a school <e>", "<cs> my lords i will be very brief because i think the points that have been raised in the course of this third reading were those which were thrashed out very fully at the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> in particular i am grateful to my noble friend lord drumalbyn for his intervention on this <e> <s> i should like to say to the noble lord lord spens that we on this side of the house are very conscious of the importance of the self-employed and the contribution which they make to our economy and we should like to do what we can to help them <e> <s> it is precisely for that reason that we issued the consultation document in the autumn we have invited comments by the end of march and they are canvassing certain possibilities such as changing the balance between the class and class contributions making the self-employed eligible for an increased range of benefits and making national insurance for the self-employed voluntary <e> <s> we are asking for comments by the end of march of this year and as obviously the noble lord is very knowledgeable on this matter i hope that he and those he is working with and for will comment so that we may take their views into consideration when this matter is reviewed by my right honourable friend in the spring <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that of course is perfectly true <e> <s> but that is the point of having the upper earnings limit <e> <s> i think the noble lord has made a great confusion about all this matter by describing the national insurance contribution as a tax <e> <s> it is not it is a contribution towards a benefit which is quite different <e>", "<cs> my lords the inspectorates <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a matter of great concern that children in school whatever authority or school they are in should learn to look after the books and equipment in their school and that the teachers should be encouraged to make the best use of the resources available <e> <s> the concern in this particular case was about the very considerable resources available to ilea and i will give the figures the capitation allowance in primary schools in ilea is per head per year and in secondary schools whereas the average for england and wales is in primary schools and in secondary schools <e> <s> not always in every school is it used to the best advantage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am prepared to agree that the inspectorate report indicated that parts of the ilea service were satisfactory but it was very critical of the secondary schools a most important area of school education <e> <s> it is therefore only right that these matters should be discussed with the authority which is the usual way of proceeding on an inspectors report either in the case of an individual school or in this case of an authority <e> <s> the point at issue is not whether <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to explain why ilea should have the capitation allowances it has but in fairness to them there are considerable problems in london <e> <s> they are however better off than other authorities which also have major inner city problems and the capitation allowances in london are considerably above those of metropolitan districts which average for primary schools and for secondary schools <e>", "<cs> my lords we all wish there was more money for education than there is <e> <s> the government have made allowances within the amount of money the government have agreed within the block grant arrangements for there to be an increase in the amount of money for capitation allowances of per cent <e> <s> in real terms for this year <e> <s> how that money is distributed is of course a matter for the local education authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that this is the first occasion in this house in which we have considered any part of the education programme of the european community and we are all very grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness will know it was the intention of the government that the bulk of the economies to be made in the education budget should come on the not strictly educational parts of that budget but she will be pleased to know that two-thirds of the authorities in england have adopted criteria of entitlement to free school meals more generous than the statutory minimum the statutory minimum being those families on supplementary benefit and family income supplement <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure of million is the latest available figure we have taken last october <e>", "<cs> my lords under the education act it is for local education authorities to determine the type of meal provided and the charge that will be made for it <e>", "<cs> my lords the act is quite clear <e> <s> those children who are from families on supplementary benefit or family income supplement are entitled to a free school meal <e> <s> the local education authority is under a duty to make arrangements for such a meal <e> <s> there can be no question of their avoiding that duty <e> <s> whether or not an authority decides as indeed dorset has decided to give up school meals for primary schools is a matter for them <e> <s> they must make arrangements for those for whom they must provide a meal <e> <s> they must also provide facilities for the children to eat sandwiches at school <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may answer those questions first i am glad of the welcome the noble baroness lady david and the noble lord lord beaumont have given to the statement <e> <s> i deeply <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad of the welcome that the noble lord lord alexander has given to this statement particularly in view of his long connections with the education service <e> <s> he asked two questions about future financing <e> <s> one of the possibilities that has been considered is the question of direct elections <e> <s> certainly this is a matter which has attracted a lot of interest <e> <s> the fact is that if one had a single authority only concerned with education directly elected with the right to precept it would never have to measure its expenditure on education against other services expenditure which other local authorities have to do and there is no evidence that it would be less extravagant in its behaviour than ilea is <e> <s> one of the difficulties of ilea is its right to precept and the fact that the electorate does not always recognise that those who are elected to it the glc members are not only glc members but also members of the inner london education authority the direct relationship which occurs in other county councils does not always occur in ilea <e>", "<cs> my lords the inspectorates report was of course sent to the ilea as indeed is always the case with inspectorate reports <e> <s> however a copy of it was placed in the library of another place and in the library of your lordships house <e> <s> it is available for people to read who would like to do so and i have no doubt that it has been distributed to the schools in the ilea <e>", "<cs> my lords in that connection i should like to point out that one of the aspects of the inspectorates report which paid tribute to the ilea was its higher and further education where it was generally regarded as satisfactory <e> <s> and although the particular point that the noble lord raises is somewhat wide of the statement nevertheless it reflects the services which are provided in the capital city in this particular way <e>", "<cs> my lords as the statement indicates this would be primarily a matter for my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment to look at in the context of a review generally of these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord marshall of leeds for his kind remarks about myself <e> <s> first as the statement indicates we hope that the ilea will put its own house in order <e> <s> it has an opportunity to do so and if it reduces its expenditure it will of course gain through the block grant mechanism and receive more government grant <e> <s> we hope very much that before it takes any irrevocable decisions it will consider what it does in the light of the statement that has been made and in the hope that it will be able to achieve the educational improvements that we should all like to see in the interests of the children of london and in the interests of a great many ratepayers on whom the very high ilea rate bears very heavily <e> <s> i think particularly not just of the domestic ratepayer but of the industries in london which of course have to contribute very heavily towards this end <e> <s> the statement makes it clear that we believe that the right way to proceed is <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wells-pestell is not entirely accurate in what he says for the timing of the recent review of contingency planning is in fact entirely fortuitous <e> <s> work on it started as long ago as following upon the industrial action in the early part of that year and the planning is continuing <e> <s> it would not be proper for me to comment on the details but this is not a new situation <e>", "<cs> my lords the letter to which the noble lord refers is of course new but the contingency planning has been going on since the former administration of which he was a member was in office and in principle there is nothing new in what is happening now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not prepared to comment on what might or might not be in a confidential letter but may i say categorically that the use of servicemen is a serious matter and their deployment must remain under ministerial control <e> <s> only in the event that health authorities could not maintain essential services through any other means and when all other means of settling an industrial dispute had been tried and had failed would troops be used as a final resort and f might remind the noble lord that very unfortunately they had to be used in the winter of as he will recall <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord should have had any delay in getting a copy of the circular which of course was sent to the appropriate health authorities <e> <s> should any noble lord wish to have a copy there are some available in the house today and i will certainly send one to anyone who would like a copy <e> <s> on the other two points raised there is no discrepancy between the information that was given when the bill was debated and the circular that has been sent out <e> <s> it is i think a rather elaborate term to talk about interest-free loans when what is being suggested is that some members of health authorities may be willing to give their time to fund-raising activities <e> <s> there will be no pressure put on anyone who does not want to do so and health authorities may use some of their funds for this purpose provided that they are all replaced at the end of the money-raising activity <e> <s> this is after all what any voluntary organisation would do and it seems to us quite appropriate <e> <s> furthermore if the noble lord looks at the main circular he will see that the point about using professional fund-raisers occurs in the last sentence of paragraph with suitable arrangements for that purpose <e> <s> we see this activity as raising money at the margin of the health service where a relatively small sum can make a lot of difference <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i can confirm that my honourable friend in another place is discussing the effect of this with voluntary organisations <e> <s> of course we will take account of the points that have been raised this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is being rather unrealistic about what will in fact happen on these occasions <e> <s> where an authority decides to use the powers now available no authority has to use them if it does not want to there could well be people who would like to give their services or the authority could decide to make use of some of its money as a pump-priming exercise <e> <s> provided they keep which they must do to the law that the money is put back so that there is no loss of money from public funds for this purpose the effect of the exercise will be that extra money will be available for patients in the national health service <e> <s> this must be a good thing <e> <s> it is worth remembering that in the year as much as million was raised from voluntary sources <e> <s> it is not a new idea <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware this is a highly technical matter <e> <s> i am quite prepared to give him the evidence upon which my answer is based <e> <s> it is based on the most accurate information that we have to date <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have indicated it is sometimes necessary for immigration act purposes to identify an applicants age as accurately as possible and in the course of that <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole question of safety is again a highly technical matter <e> <s> however i understand that calculations by the national radiological <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that the noble lord did put down a question to my noble friend lord cullen of ashbourne and i can assure him that there will be no delay in his getting an answer <e> <s> i hope that he will get it within the next two weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first part of the noble lords supplementary question i point out that the government are naturally studying the report of sir henry yellowlees and of course will take into account the results of the consideration of that report and any other considerations such as questions like the ones which have been raised today <e>", "<cs> my lords once again the whole question of safety is a very technical matter <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes a reply to that specific question he must put down a separate question and i will do my best to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not waiting for an answer from the box but i think that the noble lord will appreciate that questions of safety with regard to <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make it quite clear in any case where a child is going to be subject to an <e>", "<cs> my lords the <e>",

numbers were and respectively <e> <s> in polytechnics the corresponding numbers at undergraduate level were and and at postgraduate level and respectively <e> <s> the polytechnic figures for undergraduate level students are solely in respect of those commencing first degree courses there were an additional students in and students in starting non-advanced or advanced courses other than of first degree level <e> <s> i regret that corresponding <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that the information for is not yet available but as the noble lord lord gladwyn will appreciate it is very difficult to get the information for this current academic year <e> <s> we expect it to be available from the universities within the next few months and from the public sector at the end of the academic year <e> <s> on the noble lords second point we shall of course consider the findings of the conference of commonwealth universities vice-chancellors <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i appreciate that point and my noble friend will recognise the very high numbers of overseas students taking engineering courses <e>", "<cs> my lords the government published a statistical bulletin a copy of which is in your lordships library giving the effects of the figures that we have so far relating to the entry <e> <s> that information is of course available to any noble lord <e> <s> this forms part of our monitoring of the numbers of overseas students which we accepted we would have <e> <s> as for the other statistical information i shall certainly take note of the point raised <e> <s> i think that it will be available as it has been available in the past <e>", "<cs> yes my lords this is of course a matter that we have discussed and debated in your lordships house on many occasions <e> <s> much as we all wish that more money was available for overseas students the fact is that the education budget has to make its share of the economies for which the government have asked and under these circumstances the government believe that it is right that these students from overseas should pay the full cost of their education here <e> <s> the government still believe that it is very good value for money to be able to get a first degree course in three years <e> <s> of course we value and appreciate the need to have internationally recognised universities and the advantage of overseas students being educated in this country but we are still educating many thousands of them more this year than were proposed under the former labour governments scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that my right honourable friend will be happy to look at any constructive proposals about this problem but the noble lord must recognise that the governments commitments to making the savings are not something on which we can go back <e>", "<cs> my lords no the home rates of tuition fees apply to students from the eec <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that question <e> <s> the fees of many students from the developing countries of the commonwealth are in <e>", "<cs> my lords the information for for universities will be available in two or three months and for public sector institutions this summer <e> <s> as i indicated in my reply to the noble lord on a similar question yesterday the government are monitoring the effects of the policies on overseas students <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord will find that students particularly students from overseas register during quite a period of time after the beginning of the academic year and the fact is that this information is not available today <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have already published a <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept that <e> <s> the tentative figures that have been published through the universities have been published at intervals since the start of the academic year <e> <s> the particular figures for which the noble lord lord gladwyn asked are not yet available <e> <s> however as the noble lord who asked this supplementary question will know we have already published figures which show that compared with the numbers of first-year students that is all first-year students from overseas have fallen by around per cent <e> <s> in the universities and per cent <e> <s> in the polytechnics and other public sector institutions <e> <s> these figures were published some time ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already indicated in answers that i have given to similar questions that we wish that more money was available for overseas students <e> <s> but it is right that as a government we should give priority to the importance of getting our economy right and that is what we are doing <e> <s> as regards the countries of origin of overseas students money is still available through the overseas development organisation to help students from the developing countries of the commonwealth <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a statement which the government are not able to accept <e>", "<cs> my lords the department of education and science has published all the figures that have been available since the start of the academic year <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will table a question on that i shall supply the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as the first part of the noble lords supplementary question is concerned the arrangements for authorisation were set out in the act passed by the former labour administration in and amended by the act <e> <s> this means that the secretary of state has to be satisfied that there is a <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the figures that the noble lord has given about this particular area of london and as he will know the london advisory group report and of course he was a member of that group recognised that difficulty is being experienced in the national health service in london both in recruiting and in retaining trained nurses and other staff <e> <s> indeed the question whether private development would aggravate any such difficulties is one of the matters which can be looked at when an area seeks designation or when an individual development comes up for authorisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is another question <e> <s> in fact i believe the noble lord has a question on that subject set down for answer later on and i shall be very happy to answer it then <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already indicated the organisation of the medical schools is essentially a matter for the university but i understand that a working party under professor lequesne has been considering the costs of various options for reorganising the schools and that the senate and court of the university will be considering any recommendations arising from its report at the end of march <e> <s> it is for the university to reach its own decisions in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services has no status in this matter <e> <s> this is a matter for the medical schools and for london university <e>", "<cs> my lords i have every confidence that the noble lord lord annan and his colleagues will come to the right conclusion on this difficult matter <e>", "<cs> my lords we recognise that educational institutions have a very important contribution to make in providing adults with the skills necessary to meet the needs of industry and commerce <e> <s> we also recognise that sometimes they have not responded as quickly or as effectively as they might <e> <s> we therefore issued for discussion last october a paper which sought to identify the problems and to suggest solutions with a possible programme of action for improving the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the points that the noble baroness made about the universities <e> <s> i can confirm that we have maintained in real terms the level of direct funding to the wea to the extramural departments of universities to the national associations of the national federation of womens institutes and the national union of townswomens guilds and to the long-term residential colleges all of which contribute to adult education <e>", "<cs> yes of course my lords we shall take note of the debate which took place yesterday in your lordships house <e> <s> we are very well aware of the need for institutions to respond more readily to the demands of employers and also employees to update their skills and to retrain <e> <s> it is partly to identify the best way forward that we have issued our consultative document <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the open university is used and is a valuable contributor <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> no my lords the formal programmes which are offered on behalf of the manpower services commission are provided free of charge to the student who also receives a significant allowance for undertaking the course <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware many of these courses take place in educational establishments <e> <s> it is for authorities to determine the level of the fee that is charged for the general non-vocational courses that are provided for adults <e> <s> some courses are free particularly those in basic skills such as literacy but qualification-bearing courses such as o- and a-level courses have to charge a small fee as also do courses with a direct vocational relevance <e> <s> other authorities charge what they believe to be appropriate for other non-vocational courses and those charges can vary <e> <s> but the average cost to the individual remains in the current year p per hour <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like at the start of my reply to this short debate on an important order to say that of course i and my colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already indicated at the moment the number of nurses who cannot speak english coming to this country from the countries of the european economic community is quite small <e> <s> my understanding is that area health authorities will be required to satisfy themselves that doctors in the national health service have competence in english and that the same will apply to nurses <e> <s> if i am in any way inaccurate about that i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i can reassure the noble baroness on her last point <e> <s> the position at present is that eec nationals who come here to register do not have to take a linguistic test for six months <e> <s> that will end <e> <s> this is an improvement <e> <s> not only will an eec national who is a qualified doctor and who wishes to come and practise in the national health service have to register the area health authority which employs him will also have to satisfy itself that he can speak english or can communicate in english <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very glad to hear the welcome which the noble lord lord wells-pestell gave to the fact that the pension increase is to be paid after exactly weeks <e> <s> but i really cannot accept that we are not helping the poorest members of the community <e> <s> indeed we have laid particular emphasis on helping those who are least well-off <e> <s> if the noble lord studies the statement i think he will see that the selective use of the money that we have available has been used to this effect <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will appreciate that this new rule has only been in operation since last november <e> <s> i would like to confirm that the <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of rent allowances which assumes of course that the person in question does not own the property is a matter about which i think that i must write to the noble lord <e> <s> the point of this question is that the ownership of a house does not count as capital for which the is taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is quite another question <e> <s> however i would not accept under any circumstances that the owner of a house is in an unhappy position <e> <s> in fact as my answer to the first question made perfectly clear the value of the house is excluded from consideration as regards capital assets for someone who finds himself on supplementary benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first part of the noble baronesss question is yes that is what i said <e> <s> as regards the second part of the question i point out that redundancy payments do count as capital for supplementary benefit purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords that i think is really the same question as the noble lord lord monson asked at the beginning <e> <s> we believe that how people spend their capital is largely a matter for them <e> <s> however there are of course two provisions of the resources regulation which i described in a previous answer and the interpretation of those two provisions would be a matter for the independent adjudicating authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that what i have just said to the noble baroness lady wootton of abinger indicates that we are aware of the problem <e> <s> i should make it plain that the new rule was introduced only last november and the two reasons for introducing it were that in fact more beneficiaries gained from the change than lost from it and the new rule had the advantage of saving staff <e>", "<cs> my lords claims from nationals of member states of the european community are subject to the same rules as claims from british nationals <e> <s> all claimants are asked about their resources including their capital assets <e> <s> if there is reason to doubt the claimants statement further documentary evidence can be requested <e> <s> failure to provide relevant informa <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i entirely agree with the purport of the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> there is action that we can and do take <e> <s> it is accepted that community nationals seeking work in another country should not become dependent on public funds and if they do they can be asked to leave <e> <s> there are standard arrangements for notifying the home office when a national of a member state gets benefit <e> <s> in the past those operated after benefit had been in payment for eight weeks <e> <s> we have reviewed the arrangements and reduced the period to two weeks and we believe that that will help to speed up action and discourage abuse <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clearly difficult to ascertain accurately what assets a person holds whether he lives in this country or indeed anywhere else <e> <s> but the experience i am advised is that the type of people who seek to abuse our benefits are on the whole a group of people who are unlikely to possess capital of more than <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated last week in answer to a similar supplementary question on the question of the noble lord lord monson how people spend their capital is a matter for them <e> <s> but if they want to claim supplementary benefit they need to take account of the two provisions in the resource regulations the interpretation of which is a matter for the independent adjudicating authorities <e> <s> the department of health and social security does not give advice on what to do with redundancy money and i would have to write to my noble friend lady vickers on the question of what in fact individual firms might do <e>", "<cs> my lords the schools regulations as amended include provision for a local education authority to terminate a teachers employment on medical grounds <e> <s> but in other cases it will of course be necessary for the local authority if they wish compulsorily to retire a teacher to do so subject to the rights of appeal against unfair dismissal <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the government are concerned to maintain and improve the quality of the teacher force and there is no doubt that in-service training is one way to improve that quality <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of a general teaching council is of course quite wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> naturally my answers referred to england and of course there is a procedure for cases of misconduct of teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been possible to improve the entry requirements for entry into teacher training and this is one way in which undoubtedly we shall in the future reap the benefits of having better teachers <e> <s> but i think it is important to recognise that local education authorities at a time of falling school rolls and a contracting teacher force will as a rule use the methods of reducing recruitment of teachers or redeployment or early retirement in order to manage the total teaching force to the best effect <e>", "<cs> my lords neither i nor my noble friend lord orr-ewing are setting ourselves up in judgment on this <e> <s> my noble friend asked a question and i hope i gave the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to be able to tell the noble lord that at the present time we have in this country the lowest ever pupil-teacher ratio <e>", "<cs> my lords the survey conducted by the inspectorate into secondary schools did show that for the most part most schools are orderly and hard working places <e> <s> there are of course weaknesses in the school system and i share with other noble lords the wish to maintain and improve the standards of the teachers <e> <s> there are of course some teachers who lack commitment or who are personally unsuited to teaching but the kind of problems the local education authorities are facing at the moment are those which are concerned with falling rolls and the need to preserve curricula opportunities for all the pupils in the schools <e>", "<cs> my lords of the school closure proposals made by local education authorities between march and december and requiring a decision by my right honourable friend about two-thirds were decided within four months of the date on which notices expired <e> <s> those which took more than four months were normally complex proposals or ones which attracted a large volume of objections and therefore took longer to consider <e> <s> we understand the need to take decisions on all proposals as quickly as possible and every effort is made to avoid unnecessary delay <e>", "<cs> my lords our proposals under the education act were of course designed to speed up the school closure process and therefore those proposals which attract no objection are now dealt with by local authorities themselves unless the secretary of state wishes to intervene and settle the matter himself <e> <s> that has speeded up some proposals <e> <s> we are conscious of the time that is taken but it is very necessary for each to be considered very carefully particularly when they attract a large number of objections and when members of parliament wish to bring deputations it does take more than two months after the expiry of the notices before the matter can be settled <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not give an absolute assurance on that because clearly if a deputation comes to see a minister and raises new points those must be considered because otherwise there would be no point in seeing the deputation <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give an assurance that in every case of a school closure whether it is in a country area or in a town the matter is considered very carefully and all the relevant information is taken into account before a decision is taken <e>", "<cs> my lords with the expected fall in the school population of about million and the governments expenditure proposals assuming a closing of about school places there will inevitably be an increase in the number of proposals coming before the secretary of state <e> <s> it is for these reasons that we have not only amended the arrangements by our new procedures in the education act but are looking at our own internal procedures to ensure that we can deal with the proposals efficiently and at the same time give full consideration to the many points of view that are expressed upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords examination certificates do not of course record the full range of pupils achievements at school even for those who get high grades in a substantial number of subjects <e> <s> we have invited the schools council to undertake additional work on the development of records of achievement which would include examination results as well as a range of other information helpful to employers <e>", "<cs> my lords i made it quite clear in my main answer that we are committed to a system of examinations at plus and there is no question of substituting anything else for an examination system <e> <s> we are looking at a system of records of achievement and we have asked the schools council to do some research on that <e>", "<cs> my lords this is of course a matter of the target group at whom the plus examinations will be aimed and there is not at present a single system of examining which could be extended to cover the whole ability range and at the same time maintain standards <e> <s> however we are concerned that many school-leavers leave without any written state <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not doubt that an employer after an interview can have a clear idea of the applicants ability <e> <s> it is often very important for the applicant to get to the interview in the first place and therefore a record of achievement is important <e>", "<cs> the noble lords observations are rather wide of the question my lords but i assure him that we are not going into any system of a record of achievement without looking very carefully at it and that is why we are still doing research on it <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first part of that supplementary is that my right honourable friend the secretary of state believes that there should be four groups of examining boards in england and one in wales and i believe we are close to the point when their detailed composition can be finally settled <e> <s> on the second point the noble baroness raised <e> <s> i have no information at present <e>", "<cs> my lords the government deplore the introduction of politically extremist literature into <e>", "<cs> yes it is my lords and i think local education authorities and head teachers are aware that it is an offence to publish or distribute written matter which is threatening abusive insulting or likely to stir up hatred against any racial group in great britain <e> <s> where a teacher or local education authority has reason to believe that the material offends against that provision they should report the matter to the police <e>", "<cs> my lords if the material offends in the way that i have described it is of course a matter for the police <e> <s> although the promotion of an extreme political opinion itself does not constitute an offence people engaged in political activities outside a school might none the less be guilty of a criminal offence if they are obstructing the highway or acting in a manner conducive to a breach of the peace <e>", "<cs> my lords we have to distinguish between two important aspects of this question <e> <s> the task of political education in schools is not to recommend particular opinions but to describe to pupils and teach them about the workings of a democratic society <e> <s> the distribution of literature of the type that i have described is an offence and falls within a quite different category <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for ministers to make a judgment on what teachers say in schools about their particular opinions <e> <s> however it is vital for us all to acknowledge the importance of professional judgment among teachers and local authority representatives and i believe that the overwhelming majority of them use their professional judgment wisely in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may correct one point that the noble lord has made <e> <s> i feel that he should be aware that in this country at present we have the best ever pupil/teacher ratio at pupils to a teacher nationally <e> <s> this is the best ever we have had and i doubt whether many countries in the world are able to do much better over the whole of their educational services <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has asked a specific question on a most important point to which many speakers have referred perhaps i might intervene now to tell him that local government <e>", "<cs> clearly we do not have information for the current year my lords because it has only just started <e> <s> the figures i gave are the latest ones i have <e>", "<cs> my lords if i were to begin by thanking the noble lord lord wells-pestell for introducing this debate i do not suppose he would really believe me <e> <s> he would feel that i have gone through some terrible kind of masochistic exercise in listening to this <e> <s> but i should like to thank him <e> <s> we have argued a great many times across the dispatch boxes in this house and although i do not agree with him and he knows that i respect his sincerity and i am very glad that so many speakers have taken part in this debate today <e> <s> i should like to pay my own personal <e>", "<cs> my lords that is one of those arguments which are not sound <e> <s> it is always the <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that there has been very considerable delay in the implementation of the programme <e> <s> i understand there has been opposition in many places to the establishment of regional secure units opposition from both staff and members of the public <e> <s> the noble lord may like to know that four regional secure units which will provide places are already under construction and that another two will be by the end of this year and they will provide places <e> <s> the government are still committed to the programme but i cannot comment on when it might be completed <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that there are people in prison who would be better looked after in these units <e> <s> it is precisely for that reason that the government remain committed to this policy <e> <s> however for the reasons i gave to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale there has been a delay in their establishment <e> <s> so far as finance is concerned the money comes from general funds voted to the national health service and regional health authorities have been allowed to spend money which is generally allocated also on the improvement of general psychiatric services <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the noble baroness i will write to her about that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly give an assurance that the proposals cover units in different parts of the country <e> <s> i understand that they will be open to women as well as men <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that there are enough qualified people my lords but if i may i will write to the noble lord on that issue and if he has some particular service in mind perhaps he will let me know and i will look into it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have information about the exact nature of the reasons why people who are currently in either secure or interim units are there <e> <s> we know as i indicated that there are a large number of people currently in prison who should <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the educational aims commended in <e>", "<cs> my lords in our recently published document <e>", "<cs> my lords i would hesitate to make a commitment on sending more circulars to local authorities since that is something which we have set our face against unless it is absolutely necessary <e> <s> i would commend to the noble lord the document on the school curriculum <e> <s> in it he will see that under primary schools we recommend that children should be encouraged to develop an understanding of the world and of their own place in it as well as of how people live and work in other parts of the world <e> <s> as i have already indicated on secondary schools all pupils should undertake some study of the humanities and this could well include history and geography both of which can contribute to the development of international understanding <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely accept that many people in particular members of your lordships house and members of another place believe in the importance of development education <e> <s> one of the problems with the school curriculum is that a number of individuals and groups of people believe that their particular interests ought also to be taught in schools <e> <s> there is indeed an extensive list of subjects which should be taught in schools and the problem is how to fit what must be taught into the time available <e> <s> it is for that reason among many other reasons that we have issued our document giving guidance on the importance of a broad curriculum and including in that up to the age of a study of english mathematics science religious education physical education some study of the humanities some practical and aesthetic studies and a modern language <e> <s> it is in the study of the humanities that development education would come in <e>", "<cs> my lords decisions on what kind of teacher training courses to offer and the content of such courses as are offered are in the first instance a matter for the training institutions themselves <e> <s> the department would be prepared to consider any proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords in primary schools clearly the emphasis is on basic teaching in english and mathematics but the report of the inspectorate shows that there is advantage in not keeping merely to very basic and simple teaching of english and mathematics and that these subjects can be taught in a wider context and it is in that particular connection that other subjects are brought in <e> <s> i entirely take the noble lords point that complicated international affairs are not suitable for being taught to very young children but some understanding of other countries taught through geography would be suitable <e>", "<cs> my lords there were quite a number of points in that supplementary question <e> <s> yes i agree about the importance of the family <e> <s> yes i agree about the importance of the attitudes of the family and of teachers regarding our approach to communities at home as well as our understanding of affairs overseas <e> <s> yes the department does attach great importance to in-service training <e>", "<cs> my lords i have in fact visited schools which take the ib exam which has a very interesting curriculum and i am always glad to consider invitations to visit other schools <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are to issue a circular which is now out for consultation to local education authorities following the publication of the document on the school curriculum <e> <s> we are asking local education authorities to send a copy of the curriculum document to every school <e> <s> we hope that it will be studied not only by every school but by school governing bodies <e> <s> in about two years time the secretary of state will ask local authorities to indicate in what way they have looked at their curricula in the light of the document and made adjustments <e>", "<cs> my lords guidance to local education authorities and schools on the school curriculum was published on th march <e> <s> this recommends a broadly-based curriculum for all pupils up to the age of and emphasises that school education needs to equip young people fully for adult and working life particularly in respect of new technological developments <e> <s> specifically we attach special importance to craft design and technology in the curriculum emphasise the need for pupils to become familiar with the use and application of computers and advise that all pupils should continue with the study of science up to the age of <e>", "<cs> my lords what we have proposed in the document is that most pupils should study a foreign language and we have made it clear that we are proposing some extra research into this matter because this is clearly a question of how many should learn it and for how long in order for it to be effective <e> <s> we still have a shortage of teachers of foreign languages and this is also a matter for concern as is the <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> i am glad to receive that question <e>", "<cs> my lords the department has organised conferences in the course of this year and we have had seven of them already in different parts of the country with members of the teaching profession local industrialists and members of chambers of commerce <e> <s> this is one way of establishing local links and of enabling industrialists to understand what the schools are trying to do and enabling teachers to understand more clearly what industrialists require <e> <s> we attach great importance to this and implicit in the whole curriculum document is the need of the education service to be talking to a wider world <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord has said <e> <s> this is a matter for the local education authorities but i shall draw it to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very concerned about truancy <e> <s> no one in the educational world can be satisfied while those numbers are as high as they are <e> <s> we have also emphasised in the curriculum document that apart from the importance which the schools attach to academic qualifications employers and others look for personal qualities of integrity hard work and the ability to get on with others both for the good of the individual and for their effectiveness in the working world <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to clear up any misunderstanding on this point <e> <s> i should like to give an assurance that there will be full consultation on the publication of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords the working party is a group of officials from the des the welsh office and the local authority associations <e> <s> i have no doubt that they will consult as they regard it to be appropriate <e> <s> what we think is important because there is a certain urgency about this matter is that after they have produced their report there should be the widest possible consultation before any further action is taken <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by thanking the noble earl lord longford for introducing this debate but before going on to answer his argument i should like to pay my tribute to the right reverend prelate the bishop of london who made a most moving and wise speech and gave us all a great deal to think about <e> <s> i know that i speak for all my noble friends in thanking him for his many important contributions in your lordships house and in saying that we wish him well in all that he does <e>", "<cs> my lords the agreement to which my noble friend refers and which was part of an article in <e>", "<cs> no my lords it is not that <e> <s> that is not the reason <e> <s> unfortunately this problem has been with us for a number of years <e> <s> we have no evidence that it is actually getting worse at the present time <e> <s> i think it has a lot of deep-seated causes which it would require much longer than question time to go into <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we would all agree that the responsibility for this action does not exclusively rest with schools it rests very largely with parents as well <e> <s> it is important that society should recognise that the upbringing of children and the responsibility for them is first a matter for parents and that the schools and the parents need to support one another <e>", "<cs> my lords this of course would vary with different local authorities but it is i think essential that there should be co-operation between the education and the social services departments particularly with children who clearly have behavioural problems <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may answer now the two front bench speakers who have already spoken <e> <s> then i will answer the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness lady jeger for her remarks <e> <s> i shall attempt to answer her worries <e> <s> i think she accepts the point about pensioners but she is concerned about child benefit <e> <s> she asked me why the vast majority of people who receive child benefit are not going to get the option <e> <s> the vast majority who receive child benefit will have the option <e> <s> every mother who currently receives child benefit will have the opportunity to choose whether to have it paid monthly or whether to continue to receive it weekly <e> <s> the only people to whom the new system will apply will be mothers who have their first baby in january and from then on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad of the general welcome given to the statement by the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> we have made the distinction between those who are currently in receipt of child benefit and those who will receive child benefit for the first time <e> <s> if it follows that someone receives child benefit for the first time and therefore automatically has the child benefit on a four-weekly basis and through misfortune or otherwise either becomes a single parent or is on supplementary benefit or on family income supplement she will be eligible to apply immediately for weekly payments if she so wishes <e> <s> we should want to see how this system works out before considering any change in it because as i indicated in the statement one of the threads in the argument but by no means the only one is a wish gradually to move over to four-weekly payments for benefits but to do this over a long period of time and in this particular case it is only applying to those who receive child benefit for the first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this must be a matter of seeing how these arrangements work out but if a mother who currently receives child benefit opts to receive it monthly she will again have the opportunity to receive it weekly if she goes on to supplementary benefit or she becomes a lone parent <e> <s> if in fact she decides that it does not work for her to have it as a monthly payment and there are some other circumstances it would be possible for her to switch back <e> <s> she can make the arrangements to do so by going to the social security office otherwise she will continue automatically on a four-weekly basis <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first question is that the automatic monthly payment will apply only to mothers having their first baby in so if you have subsequent babies and you are already in receipt of child benefit the option applies <e> <s> on the second question i understand that it applies to very few people indeed and because it is such a low sum it applies only to certain graduated pension schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that a year is a long time but the sums of money are going to be very small it is going to be less than <e> <s> i will take note of what the noble baroness has said and if there is anything further i can add i will write to her about it <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly if a family gets into difficulties and it is a family which is known to the social services department they would no doubt consider the matter and advise the family as to whether or not they ought to change to weekly payments <e> <s> but in most instances this will be a matter which will have to be resolved within the family because it assumes that there is a husband that they are not on supplementary benefit and therefore he is in work <e> <s> this is a matter which the government would feel would be for the family to resolve rather than asking somebody else to step in and sort out something which might simply be a temporary difficulty which the family could resolve themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not attempt to draw distinctions between families <e> <s> my noble friend lady trumpington was merely drawing attention to what might be one circumstance to which i was trying to give an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that i appreciate very much the very severe handicap that deafness brings and also that i recognise that there is a very real anomaly in the provisions that are made for blind people <e> <s> however i have looked at this carefully and it is the view of the government that it would be wrong to extend the special provisions to different categories of disabled people and better to press for there to be general provisions for all disabled people <e> <s> could i confirm in this connection that there has been over the last years an enormous improvement in the standard range of national health service hearing aids <e> <s> there is also the new worker with the new qualification of a hearing therapist who has special responsibility for helping adults who become deaf and who experience difficulty in adjusting to their impairment <e> <s> the government are giving special grants to mark the international year of disabled people which includes a grant to the royal national institution for the deaf <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to confirm again that there is a wide range of services provided for deaf people by the national health service and also by local social services departments <e> <s> the prime responsibility for the decisions about the development of these services for those for the deaf rests with health authorities and with local authority personal social services <e> <s> i accept as i have already indicated to the noble lord lord clifford of chudleigh that this is a terrible disability <e> <s> but it is encouraging that modern science is developing a number of ways in which deaf people can be helped <e> <s> this is one of the most encouraging developments of our times <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is not quite correct about the television licence fee for blind people <e> <s> the concession is p less than the full licence for either a colour or a black and white set for blind people <e> <s> i recognise as i have already indicated that there are various provisions for the blind which do not apply to other disabled people <e> <s> in a sense although this is very valuable this is an anomaly <e> <s> it is the view of the government that this should not be extended <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i understand that new equipment has been developed for the deaf which will particularly block out background noises so that they hear exclusively the television programme <e> <s> these are available not on the national health service and can be purchased <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> this is one of the many modern scientific developments which are of enormous help to deaf people <e> <s> the point that i am making is that they are available but of course they are not all currently available on the national health service or through the social services department <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding about the position of blind people is that if people are sufficiently badly sighted to qualify as registered blind persons as determined by a local authority or the national health service they are eligible both for tax reliefs and other particular benefits <e> <s> we would in this connection be comparing like with like because we are talking about people who have impaired hearing but who may not be totally deaf <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly take note of the suggestion and i shall refer it to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services because i understand the feeling of the noble lord <e> <s> at this stage it would be wrong for me to suggest that we could extend the social services in this way although this is the kind of desirable move one would like to take were there more money available <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the position is that we cannot discuss the injunction itself but the principle of the student union financing which is another matter can be discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords we have come to the end of a short debate on this bill <e> <s> i should like to begin by thanking my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter very much for speaking in support of the government <e> <s> i am grateful to him for understanding some of the problems that we on the front bench face <e> <s> one of the difficulties that the government encounter is the fact that a lot of people are disinclined to recognise the reality of our situation and to face the very hard and difficult policies that we are asked to carry out <e> <s> i have listened on a number of occasions to the strictures from the opposition front benches particularly in debates like this and have been accused of a great many things <e> <s> i should like to assure the front bench opposite that i understand what it is not to have a lot of money <e> <s> i only wish that i had never had the experience of having a little money but alas <e> <s> that is not the case <e> <s> i have also known a lot of people who have had to struggle on very little money and i am perfectly well aware of the difficulties that people face in these circumstances <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i was just coining to that point because it is an important one which the noble baroness and other people raised <e> <s> the basis is the retail price index <e> <s> i should like to say on this point because it has been raised by a lot of noble lords that the general retail price index is widely accepted as a reliable measure of price increases faced by different types of households to which the index refers <e> <s> it was of course used by the noble baronesss own government when they were in office <e> <s> it includes low income families and the majority of social security beneficiaries including about half of all pensioner households and of course the up-ratings affect many more people than pensioners alone <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the first part of my noble friends supplementary my right honourable friend the home secretary recently announced the setting up of an inquiry into the activities of racialist organisations and incidence of racialist attacks <e> <s> one of the areas to be covered during the course of the inquiry is alleged recruitment and racialist activities by extremist groups in schools and other educational establishments and in that connection my department has recently initiated further inquiries of local education authorities for information on this matter <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i would agree with both parts of that supplementary <e> <s> there is of course a distinction between political education whereby children learn about democratic processes and the type of literature which is circulating which could in effect be a breach of the law <e> <s> the noble baroness is right to say that this is a responsibility of head teachers and local education authorities and as i indicated in my original answer we have reason to think that they act responsibly in this matter so i entirely agree with the points that the noble baroness made <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will wait until i have concluded my remarks i think he may hear what he would like to hear <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i believe that my right honourable friend mr rossi attended the opening of the groomsmobile exhibition <e> <s> it is something which the government welcome <e> <s> it will help to change public attitudes and encourage people to take a positive look at how the disabled can be helped to have access to public and other buildings <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are giving support to the organisation which is sponsoring this particular week <e> <s> i understand that the chairman of the committee on restrictions against disabled people will be writing to all local newspapers encouraging them to include during the week special features on access <e> <s> that would no doubt include the type of access to which the noble baroness has referred <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is why the government are supporting the private members bill of the noble baroness lady masham which is to have its committee stage in your lordships house this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have already given their approval to improvements to access <e> <s> they will be included in the private members bill to which i have just referred <e> <s> the government have also given an undertaking that a circular will be issued which will make the kind of points which my noble friend wishes to have made <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i support that entirely <e> <s> there are many young people who do a great deal of voluntary work and who are only too happy to help the disabled in all these ways <e> <s> i have not seen the newspaper to which the noble baroness has drawn my attention but i shall have a look at it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> this matter is also included in the private members bill <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord is aware of the orange badge scheme and of the symbol for the disabled which often appears not only on public lavatories but also on many other public buildings <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot speak on this particular point for all government departments but those with which i am connected all have access for disabled people <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that this is the kind of matter to which the committee will draw attention in its publicity <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wells-pestell and the noble baroness lady jeger are always very persuasive on these subjects and they make us sound very mean and hard-hearted when we feel that we must resist them <e> <s> we have of course been over this ground many times before and we appreciate their concern and that of the opposition about the two weeks which were lost in the uprating <e> <s> the fact of the matter is if both the noble lord and the noble baroness will reflect on the uprating of pensions over the past six years since that neither political party has an unbroken record of doing in all circumstances the very best that they might have done <e> <s> they have both for a variety of reasons come up against the very painful hut hard economic facts of life as regards cost <e>", "<cs> i appreciate from what the noble lord lord kilmarnock has said that this is a matter which was debated at considerable length in another place and was certainly referred to at quite great length at the second reading of this bill <e> <s> i hope that i can show him in the course of what i have to say that i can give an answer to the particular points that he has raised <e> <s> i think it is better to stand on the principle that he has raised rather than look in detail at actually what his amendment says <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord lord wells-pestell is correct in that what the noble lord lord kilmarnock is arguing for is a duty and not just a power and i recognise the difference <e> <s> i am saying that we have the power and we have given the promise and we feel that is the right way to deal with the matter <e>", "<cs> we have given a pledge that pensions will be kept up with prices <e> <s> the noble lords anxiety is that from november to november the rates of inflation will prove to be higher than the forecast estimate of per dent <e> <s> i believe we should be going back on our pledges to keep over the lifetime of the parliament pensions in line with prices if we did not look at the shortfall because that is what it must mean <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will accept my integrity when i say that the pledge about keeping pensions in line with prices would mean just that <e>", "<cs> i should like to think that perhaps the lifetime of this parliament might last that long <e> <s> if the noble lord considers it he will see that it could not <e>", "<cs> i can quite understand why the noble baroness lady jeger introduced her remarks in the way that she did because if the amendment were to be carried it would of course defeat the entire object of the bill and so it is absolutely essential to the bill as well as to the debate that we are having <e> <s> therefore the noble baroness will not be surprised when i say that i cannot accept the amendment <e> <s> the intention of subsection is to take account at this years uprating of the effect on last years uprating of the per cent <e> <s> overestimate of the -week increase in prices per cent <e> <s> instead of the actual per cent <e>", "<cs> the point is that all individuals will have an increase in pensions of per cent <e> <s> the figure that i have quoted includes that increase and the facts of demography and unemployment <e> <s> but there is at the same time an increase <e> <s> we are not talking about a decrease <e> <s> that is the point that i am trying to make and a very important one it is too <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has moved amendment no <e> <s> and spoken to about six other amendments <e> <s> i hope that it will be convenient if i reply on amendments nos <e> <s> and and ask my noble friend lord cullen to reply on amendment no <e> <s> which quite specifically deals with unemployment <e>", "<cs> on this matter i do not think it is going to be possible to bring invalidity benefit into tax in as was at first thought to be possible <e> <s> i think we would all regret this but i can assure the noble baroness that the abatement will he made good as soon as it is taxable <e> <s> i do not think i can go further than that this afternoon <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has spoken to two amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i think that he has devoted most of his remarks to no <e> <s> so it may be for the convenience of the committee if i deal first with that and then go back to say something about child benefits <e>", "<cs> i must begin by expressing a certain degree of sympathy with the noble lord lord wallace <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble baroness has raised a quite separate point from the one raised in the amendment <e> <s> however this is the committee stage and of course she is perfectly entitled to do so <e> <s> we have been over the fairly well worn ground of the governments decision to link pensions to prices and not to earnings <e> <s> as the noble baroness will be aware it was not always easy for her government to keep up pensions against earnings <e> <s> there was an earnings shortfall which was made good in november and there was a shortfall against prices which was not made good in <e> <s> if one goes back through the years one finds that at different times governments have been faced with difficult economic circumstances and that they have been unable to do as much as they would have wished <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady jeger spoke to amendment no <e> <s> and the precise point in that amendment is in fact a request that the social security advisory committee should report on the adequacy of the current provision for the long-term unemployed <e> <s> the principle here is very similar to the principle which we debated under amendment no <e> <s> which was a request to the advisory committee to consider the adequacy or otherwise of child benefits <e> <s> but in this particular case i do not believe that there is in fact a need for my right honourable friend the secretary of state to ask the social security advisory committee to consider matters because they are already considering them without any prompting from ministers <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i do not have that information before me but if i can let the noble baroness have any information before the next stage of the bill i will do so <e>", "<cs> before answering the amendment moved by the noble lord lord wallace of coslany <e>", "<cs> the reference in relation to clause is that on page lines and should read <e>", "<cs> it may be for the convenience of the committee if i comment on this amendment at this stage <e> <s> we of course accept that ramps should be provided wherever

mentioned <e> <s> the department of transports advice in <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say to the committee that i am reluctant to take something back when i feel i might be misleading the committee and the noble baroness into believing that something could actually be done over this amendment <e> <s> there is no doubt at all that the current advice on this matter is that where possible there should be ramps <e> <s> that is appropriate as i have already indicated and that is the department of transports view on it <e> <s> i am sure it is the sort of thing that local authorities would want to do but it does lead us down a rather difficult way when we are now suggesting the width of the pavement that should be applied before a ramp could or could not be put in <e> <s> if one tries to think about the different widths of pavements for example in old towns and new towns the differences can be very considerable <e>", "<cs> i really feel on rather safer ground when i am talking about prams <e> <s> i have brought up three children and pushed them up and down many kerbs so i feel that i can speak with more confidence on this issue than on some of the others that have to be dealt with <e> <s> i must be honest with the committee and <e>", "<cs> if i may just comment on that the difficulties about this amendment are not in fact to do with what local authority practice is or is not they are actually to do with the advice of the department of transport <e> <s> in fact we would be inserting into a bill the duty to do something with new pedestrian crossings <e> <s> the difficulty is not for once to do with cost but is a technical matter of whether it would be possible to require this in a good many different circumstances rather than relying on a circular <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i did not make the position clear in what i said on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the deletion of the reference to holes recognises the fact that the bill does not affect at all the statutory responsibility of highway authorities for the repair and maintenance of highways and footways <e> <s> they cannot be expected to protect minor holes which i think we would call potholes as opposed to deliberate openings when a road is dug up in connection with services and when there is a very large hole <e> <s> i think we are clear about the difference between general wear and tear or an accident and works which are being carried out and which mean that a hole is being dug <e> <s> this does not cover potholes or small holes in the road but only the others <e>", "<cs> i should have understood this to mean that there would be something which would actually prevent a blind person from falling into a hole <e> <s> i quite understand that a blind person will not see it <e> <s> but as i understand it the danger is that some public utility may have dug up a footpath for some very good purpose left the hole unprotected and a blind person could fall into it and have a very serious accident <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to what my noble friend lord chelwood and the noble viscount lord ingleby have said on this matter and it may be helpful if i begin by saying that one of the general principles which we have to bear in mind in deciding what information should be imparted in traffic signs is that they should be immediately intelligible they therefore contain only essential information <e> <s> parking spaces reserved on-street for disabled persons vehicles are indicated by a traffic sign which contains the white p on blue parking symbol the black on orange wheelchair symbol and the legend disabled badge holders only <e> <s> this is one of the signs prescribed in the traffic signs regulations and general directions and any variant to the prescribed traffic sign indicating a parking space reserved for a disabled persons vehicle would need to be specially approved for use <e>", "<cs> i hope that i shall be able to say something about these two amendments which my noble friend lord chelwood and the noble viscount lord ingleby will feel is helpful <e>", "<cs> clearly we have not got as far as considering the circular to follow the bill but in any circular the bill and the new offences will be described and i have no doubt that one of the ways in which the public will be informed is by being affected themselves by the higher penalties when they come into force <e> <s> if i may say so i think that concentrates the mind as nothing else does <e>", "<cs> i can give the noble lord the assurance that we entirely accept the principle of what he is trying to do <e> <s> this is a serious offence and it ought to carry a heavier fine <e> <s> i wonder whether he will accept that perhaps i might get in touch with him before the next stage of the bill about just what is the timing of this <e> <s> i have not got the information on that point this evening and i hope he will accept that we may discuss this matter having accepted the principle of what it is that he wishes to do <e>", "<cs> i am of course very grateful for the welcome that this government amendment has received and i shall try to answer the various points that have been raised during discussion on it <e> <s> the noble lord lord campbell of croy raised six points about the orange badge scheme where he felt that there could be improvement <e> <s> i should like to assure him that i shall draw the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport to the points that he has made <e> <s> all points relating to entitlement to badges concessions the design or types of badge and the withdrawal of badges are matters for the regulations and can be raised by interested bodies when they are consulted on the draft regulations in the near future <e> <s> so it will be very helpful for my right honourable friend to have these points drawn to his attention and i shall certainly see that that is done <e>", "<cs> i do not have either the circulars or the regulations in front of me but i should have thought that all local authorities were aware of the need to provide parking spaces for the disabled <e> <s> i am aware that some do this better than others and certainly where i live my local authority provides a number of spaces for the disabled <e> <s> i would suggest that if that is not so in the area where the noble baroness lives then she would be well advised to take the matter up with them direct <e> <s> no one i am sure could be more persuassive than the noble baroness on these matters <e> <s> i hope very much that when the circular comes out after this bill any reluctant local authorities will make provision if they have not done so in the past <e>", "<cs> i should be very disturbed if it was felt in any way that the government were retracting on any promises that have been made and i should like to give an assurance to the committee that this amendment in no way takes away any of the agreements that have been reached and which we shall debate when we come to amendment no <e>", "<cs> i should be very happy to give that assurance <e> <s> if it would be helpful to the noble baroness i should like to give her an opportunity to discuss with any of the departments advisers on this matter the design note or put any questions that she or her colleagues might have because it would be helpful to clear up any misunderstanding before the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i would find it very difficult to comment on that particular instance that the noble baroness has raised <e> <s> clearly if one is looking at the needs of the disabled in a school it might be necessary to provide lavatories suitable for use for a disabled member of the staff if you are putting up a new <e>", "<cs> no the amendment does not relate to scotland <e> <s> the new clause to be inserted in the bill after clause requires that a notice under section of the local government miscellaneous provisions act should draw the attention of the owner of the building to section of the chronically sick and disabled persons act and to the code of practice <e>", "<cs> i am not a lawyer but i think it is extremely difficult to apply one set of laws to scotland <e>", "<cs> i am glad to accept that suggestion which the government fully support <e>", "<cs> i am sure we all have great sympathy with the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth particularly after the stories that were given on second reading to illustrate the difficulties which the disabled can experience and we can understand therefore why she has tabled the amendment <e> <s> the fact is that at present only two emblematic signs to indicate disabled facilities have been accepted nationally or internationally the wheelchair sign and a newer sign to show equipment for people with defective hearing <e> <s> it may be reasonable and convenient to sign some facilities by name but not all <e> <s> for instance access for some people may be best effected by well designed stairs with a convenient handrail but to show every such route of travel by signs would produce a clutter of signs which might not necessarily inform but could have the effect of confusing and might be regarded by developers as unreasonable <e>", "<cs> as i said at the outset it is not that the government are unsympathetic to the proposal it is the difficulties of definining the different types of disablement by more badges <e> <s> i shall certainly look at the points that have been raised and where it is possible to include something in the circular of course we shall look most sympathetically at doing that <e> <s> after the bill is on the statute book there will be many opportunities to comment on the circular and as has already been indicated that will be an occasion when the government will seek not only comments from local authorities in relation to the circular but comments from other interested bodies particularly those representing the disabled and i hope the kind of point that has been made in this debate will be met by that means <e> <s> i hope the noble baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the question of whether or not a sign is put up would be very much for local discretion <e> <s> so far as i understand it there would be nothing to prevent a local authority from doing precisely what the noble lady lady kinloss suggested <e> <s> but i do not feel that one could legislate in the bill for something of this kind <e> <s> this is not something that i feel the government would wish to oblige local authorities to do if they felt that they had some other and better <e>", "<cs> i would hesitate to pronounce off the cuff on the trade descriptions act though i doubt whether the matter to which the noble baroness refers would apply because in many instances it is not a question of trade that is involved <e> <s> if i may say so to the noble baroness this is raising a point that is somewhat separate from that covered in the amendment which in itself covers two points <e>", "<cs> first of all i should like to thank all those noble lords who have so kindly commended this amendment and have said how glad they are to have it in the bill <e> <s> i should like to try to answer the particular points raised by the noble viscount lord ingleby <e> <s> he asked why there was this difference in the wording in subsection <e>", "<cs> again i am glad of the welcome that this clause has received <e> <s> i will try to answer the questions <e> <s> the noble baroness lady masham asked four separate questions <e> <s> may i say to her that these matters the prescribed body and the appeals procedures are not yet resolved <e> <s> they are important questions and they will all be the subject of consultation <e> <s> the government have not yet taken decisions and we have no view as to how the provisions under this clause should be implemented <e> <s> it is our intention to consult with all interested parties including local authorities and representatives of disabled people <e> <s> my honourable friend in another place mentioned various possibilities for the prescribed bodies that is local authorities independent bodies such as the institute of arbitrators specially-established bodies or voluntary organisations <e> <s> but i should like to say that we have not taken any decisions on these or any other possibilities and will be seeking views <e>", "<cs> i should like to say as i indicated on second reading that the government fully support this amendment and are happy that the bill should extend to northern ireland and that this will meet the point that was raised <e>", "<cs> my lords the government fully recognise the important role which the ambulance service plays as part of the national health service accident and emergency service <e> <s> the fact is that the clegg commission considered the ambulancemen unions claim for pay to be settled in relation to the pay of police and firemen but concluded that emergency work was only a part and by no means the most time-consuming part of the job of each of the three services <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as ambulancemen are concerned which is the point at issue in this question the others are wide of the question the negotiation of pay and conditions of service is still the responsibility of the whitley council which includes representatives of the four relevant trade unions the national health service employing authorities and the three health departments <e> <s> in this particular intance the management side have responded to an invitation to exploratory talks at acas on th june with a view to settling the dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have said enough to indicate that if you try to compare like with like under the new proposals ambulancemen will receive more or less the same rates of pay for the same amount of work as do firemen <e> <s> i think all noble lords will recognise that the police are a different service in that there are various restrictions which apply to them which do not apply to the other services <e> <s> the latest evidence which i have is that on the new rates of pay which have been offered assuming the sum expected for overtime shift work and weekend work a leading ambulanceman in london could expect to earn about a week and a qualified ambulanceman in london about a week <e> <s> the rates of pay are somewhat lower outside london <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated earlier the government recognise the important work which ambulancemen and ambulancewomen do but all the evidence is that only about per cent <e> <s> of their time is spent on emergencies <e> <s> their other work which is extremely valuable is not in precisely the same category of difficulty and danger as is emergency work <e> <s> this is the difference between the ambulance service and the other services <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the government are aware of those facts and recognise the difficulties they can cause for certain people <e> <s> the fact that the death grant has not been reviewed since indicates how difficult it is to balance the various pressures towards reform which have built up over the years against the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the right reverend prelate for the point he made about the proposals of the church and i would reassure him that as my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services has indicated this matter is still under discussion <e> <s> there are no definite proposals at present because there are of course various ways if it were regarded as right of providing selective help which would not involve means testing as it is usually understood <e> <s> all the different propositions are still under consideration but no decision has yet been taken <e>", "<cs> yes my lords people whose resources with or without the death grant are insufficient to meet funeral costs can apply for help by way of supplementary benefit <e> <s> the noble lord may like to know that out of about deaths each year during we believe that between and such payments were made <e>", "<cs> i do not have those figures with me my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill now be read a second time <e> <s> it gives me particular pleasure to move the second reading of this education bill because i am acutely aware of the interest and knowledge many of your lordships have in those <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to interrupt the noble baroness but as she was not here when i made my opening remarks it would be helpful for her if she takes advantage of looking at the document the <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an important debate today and i very much appreciate the most constructive way in which the whole of the discussion has taken place <e> <s> the house will i am sure understand if i do not answer all the points although i hope to touch on many of the most important <e> <s> i am particularly glad of the welcome that has been given by almost every member of your lordships house who has spoken some more warmly than others but everyone giving it a welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords not in school-leavers but in the total school population <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an interesting and stimulating debate this afternoon <e> <s> i think it was most useful that the noble lord lord crowther-hunt introduced his debate in a very frank way and raised discussion about educational points and not as so many educational debates seem to do about points entirely devoted to various aspects of finance <e> <s> for this i am personally grateful <e> <s> i think that it added interest and purpose to the debate and it has been helpful for the whole tenor in which it has been conducted <e> <s> i will draw the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state and the parliamentary under-secretary to everything that has been said today and i am sure that they will read the proceedings with great interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that point and i recognise that not everyone is going to be covered by these schemes and that some people will be affected <e> <s> but we have to look at our own economies and as the noble lord lord robbins will know we are not unique in having to look at the fees charged to overseas students <e> <s> indeed the australian government have decided to charge overseas students and new zealand and canada have also put up their fees <e> <s> this is something which is happening because a great many countries are having to look at the costs of all these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i said i think what the background to the whole question about overseas students fees is <e> <s> one of the important things is that the universities should have overseas students because then they will have the fees <e> <s> the important matter is that the total numbers have not fallen as dramatically as once was supposed <e> <s> in fact we have slightly more than the numbers which had the noble lords government been in office they would have achieved <e> <s> the important matter about the fee income is that the numbers should keep up <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be happy to write to the noble baroness <e> <s> i will read her speech tomorrow and if there are specific points on which i think it would be helpful to write to her i will certainly put them in a letter <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the government support the principle behind this question and this recommendation <e> <s> as the noble viscount lord lngleby will know under the disabled persons no <e> <s> bill local planning authorities will be under a new duty and will have to have someone who will be able to consider this duty <e> <s> the point is that we think it would be unsuitable to require them to appoint a named officer in that respect <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i know what the environmental health officers have said on this question and i should like to assure the noble lord that this is a matter which the government understand and accept in principle <e> <s> however it is not for me to say whether or not we should accept this suggestion <e> <s> local authorities have responsibilities and it is right for them to determine how this new duty should be met <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am aware of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i can answer that point <e> <s> i think that we are talking about two quite separate things <e> <s> the point that i was answering from the noble lord lord banks and the noble lord lord kilmarnock was a reference to the shortfall that we made good in november <e> <s> that was a shortfall on prices which we promised to make good and we did make good <e> <s> the noble baroness identified a shortfall in november which i accept is a shortfall <e> <s> it was a shortfall on earnings <e> <s> the whole point about the pledge that my right honourable friend has given and that we have repeated is that long-term benefits will keep up with prices and i have identified these <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we have <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that question <e> <s> i shall certainly draw it to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services <e> <s> we are of course aware that often we are talking of extremely complicated legal provisions and we try so far as possible to translate them into somewhat simpler language in order that those who have to make use of them can understand them <e>", "<cs> my lords we look at all possible ways of getting these leaflets distributed and all places from which people can make inquiries <e> <s> they can do this at dhss offices in local authority social services departments in citizens advice bureaux and doctors surgeries <e> <s> leaflets and booklets about the way to make claims are frequently available in post offices <e> <s> one is aware that there are still some people who are unaware of their entitlement but we have constantly under review the different methods of publicising the benefits to which people are entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly draw that suggestion about probation officers to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble earl has raised a particular case i hope he will accept that it would be better if i wrote to him about the circumstances <e> <s> on the point of people being entitled to supplementary benefits i can say that one of the difficulties at present is that a person who receives invalidity benefit may well have an income which is above the supplementary benefit level and therefore would not be entitled to this <e> <s> there is this poverty trap which comes into these particular cases <e> <s> it may well be that these are the circumstances in which this particular person finds himself but i will if i may write to the noble earl about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly note the point made by the noble baroness <e> <s> i think that people going to supplementary benefit offices can always get the information they want but if this is not clearly indicated <e>", "<cs> if this is not clearly indicated it would be a matter for local decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords that is really very wide of the original question but i should like to say to the noble lord that over the whole area of social welfare the system of child benefits has reached a state which is intelligible and on which i think there is a great deal of agreement the second-tier pensions system is very clear and of course as that comes into full effect so we hope that less supplementary benefit will be necessary <e> <s> we therefore believe that there will gradually be a simplification of the system in this particular way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to say that excellent progress is being made <e> <s> the main building works for the odstock unit are expected to start in august and will take two years to complete <e> <s> preparatory work is already under way <e> <s> building at stanmore should start in november and be completed by may <e> <s> a temporary unit will be opening later this year to provide a service until the work is completed <e>", "<cs> my lords i deeply regret that there should have been any difficulties but my information is that no formal complaints about difficulties of the recall system have been received either from individual patients at stoke mandeville hospital or from the spinal injuries association <e> <s> may i suggest to the noble baroness that if difficulties have arisen this is very much a matter to be resolved locally and i know that the health authority would be very willing to discuss these matters and look into individual cases where there are problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble baroness will write to me with her complaint in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords under the present arrangements where the operation of checks on eligibility has been left very largely to local discretion there have been a number of incidents reported in the press and possibly others which have not attracted publicity in which members of ethnic minorities have been asked to produce their passports merely because they have had foreign names <e> <s> i do not for one moment condone this <e> <s> i believe our new proposals will reduce that sort of thing <e> <s> regarding the other point raised by the noble lord which may well have been about complaints of discrimination at st stephens hospital i should like to say that inquiries into these cases are still proceeding <e> <s> i understand that the procedures at that hospital are under review <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first place the operation of what has been called the good samaritan treatment is still in force <e> <s> in the second place my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services made it clear last week that after this period of consultation on his new proposals about charging those who are not resident for the national health service he will not lay regulations until november when there will have been an opportunity to consider the evidence and the views of the working party who will be looking at the detail of how the scheme will work <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm now that the working party will be under a departmental chairman and will consist mainly of nhs representatives of various disciplines <e> <s> we shall also invite the medical profession the commission for racial equality and the joint council for the welfare of immigrants to participate <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank both the noble baroness lady jeger and the noble lord lord banks for their comments <e> <s> i recognise that we cannot expect all-party support for clause <e> <s> however i was very glad that the noble baroness commented on two provisions which i think have received a great deal of support first clause which provides for a relaxation of the qualifying conditions for incapacity benefit payable to certain haemo-dialysis patients and secondly clause which extends the statutory war pension appeal rights to british officers serving with the former indian and burmese armed forces <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house because we are on report stage of course we want the circular which accompanies this bill for england and wales and for northern ireland to be similar to the provisions in the scottish circular and i hope that will be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i of course appreciate the motives and the reasons which have led the noble viscount to put down this amendment <e> <s> the body which is to adjudicate in cases where the developer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that the bill has now reached its third reading in your lordships house and that it seems virtually certain to reach the statute book by the end of this parliamentary session <e> <s> when it was first brought to your lordships house it was a useful and worthwhile bill but there is no doubt that it has been strengthened during its passage through your lordships house and i think it makes a real contribution to the international year of disabled people <e>", "<cs> i very much appreciate the point that the noble earl lord radnor is seeking to make by this particular amendment <e> <s> i should like to assure him that the government have given a great deal of thought to the definition clause in this bill <e> <s> as he will see the definition oflearning difficultyhas three parts to it <e> <s> i have also very much sympathy with children who suffer difficulties in reading and writing although they have ability that is just as good <e>", "<cs> i have of course listened with great interest to what my noble friend lady faithfull has had to say in speaking to her amendment because i know that her views are based on her very considerable experience in the social services <e> <s> however i hope that i can show once again that in fact her amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> the definition in clause is based on the perceived needs of the child and therefore the definition in clause is concerned with special educational <e>", "<cs> let me say straight away that i very much welcome the fact that the noble baroness has said that this is a probing amendment <e> <s> she is right in saying that this is an important matter and one which was discussed at considerable length in another place <e> <s> i should like to explain as fully as i can the kind of problems that one faces in definitions under the bill because the government are in fact faced with a choice of either including or excluding problems deriving from language of the home within the scope of the bill <e> <s> one simply must face the fact that whichever way the decision is taken there will inevitably be some criticism <e> <s> if for example we had included some definition that involved language we might well be accused of calling all children who do not speak the language of instructionhandicapped children and we should then further be accused of adopting an approach which might be racialist to their educational problems <e> <s> on the other hand if as in this case we have excluded them we can be equally well accused of ignoring their educational needs <e>", "<cs> i listened with very great care to what was said about this amendment by the noble <e>", "<cs> if a child has a hearing impairment he may have learning difficulties because if you are born slightly deaf of course it is difficult to learn as quickly as others how to speak and therefore it is more difficult to learn to read and write although the child may be just as intelligent as his contemporaries <e> <s> under the bill before the child reaches the age of two the parents could if they so wished ask for an assessment to be made of him and his special educational needs <e> <s> at any rate by the time he got to school an assessment would be made <e> <s> if it was decided that a statement should be made about him which is what we are talking about in regard to some of these children then that statement might say that the child should go to a special school or it might say that he could be educated in an ordinary school with special help or perhaps in a deaf unit attached to an ordinary school <e> <s> there might be a whole variety of arrangements that could be made for the child <e> <s> the bill does not say what they would be <e> <s> it simply says that it is important at this stage to identify what is causing the learning difficulty without necessarily giving a kind of blueprint <e>", "<cs> i have listened with very great care to the many speakers in support of this amendment <e> <s> of course i looked at it very carefully when considering what the governments response to it should be <e> <s> i do not want to go over what i said on amendment no <e> <s> which in a sense is linked to it when i explained why clause has been drawn in the way that it has <e> <s> i must tell the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth and other noble lords who have spoken in support of this amendment that although the government accept the principle and indeed the bill makes the principle clear that children with special educational needs should wherever possible be educated in ordinary schools the actual effect of this particular amendment is to have identified a group of children with special educational needs and to have said the local authority must have a duty to establish a school to meet those particular needs <e>", "<cs> i must apologise to the noble baroness if i misunderstood her remarks <e> <s> i did not intend to do that i was trying to explain some of the difficulties about this <e> <s> regarding the point raised by the noble lord lord alexander i think we are going back to the confusion that we had on amendment no <e> <s> concerning the definition of special educational need in clause <e>", "<cs> the improvement of the facilities for training teachers <e>", "<cs> i think that it would be helpful to the committee if once again i attempted to explain what it is that the government are trying to do in clause <e> <s> the importance of clause is that this is a statement a central statement of intent about integration <e> <s> it makes it clear that provided certain conditions are met children with statements must be educated in ordinary schools <e> <s> this as i have understood it is a point that i thought would have been welcomed by all noble lords from all parts of the committee particularly the noble baroness lady darcy and others who have taken an interest in this matter <e> <s> after all it goes some way towards section of the act which is repealed by this bill but it gives this central statement of intent which mrs warnock and her committee recommended on special education <e> <s> it refers of course only to children with statements because other children with special educational needs will be educated in ordinary schools as a matter of course <e> <s> by and large if the ordinary school can cope with a childs needs there will be no point in conducting a full-scale assessment and making a statement for that child <e>", "<cs> i listened very carefully to what was said by the noble lord lord banks but i am not at all sure how one would test reasonableness in the context of this amendment <e> <s> if the provision in an ordinary school meets the requirement set out in this <e>", "<cs> i believe it is always a most dangerous thing to answer a question on a hypothetical situation <e> <s> if i may say so to the noble lord lord banks i am too old a debater to be caught quite so easily although because of the way that the noble lord puts his argument it all sounds very convincing <e> <s> if the noble lord looks at this clause and considers his amendment as it would read if written into the bill and addresses himself to the situation as it would be in a local education authority he will see that his amendment is actually unnecessary <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness has said this amendment in effect works on the same principle <e>", "<cs> one of the facts that mrs warnock identified is that we are talking about perhaps one in six children about per cent <e> <s> of children who may at some stage or other have special educational needs <e> <s> we are also talking about those children who are currently in special education and who under this bill would be subject to a statement and that is about per cent <e> <s> of the school population <e> <s> it is very much smaller <e> <s> so there are quite a number of children whose parents will state a preference for a school and will therefore although those children have special educational needs be able to choose from a number of schools <e>", "<cs> it is difficult to make a generalisation about all children with physical disabilities <e> <s> i have seen a child in a wheelchair in a primary school and clearly in those circumstances the local education authority was able to make completely adequate arrangements for that child <e> <s> i should like to see more children so educated <e> <s> indeed it is probably rather easier in primary schools which are nearly always one-storey buildings in any event <e> <s> i cannot possibly speak for all local education authorities but it may well be that there will be others where such suitable arrangements can be made <e> <s> what i think we cannot write into the bill is the compulsion to say that all this must be done as soon as the bill is passed <e> <s> we must work towards this aim <e>", "<cs> the difficulty with this amendment is that so many factors would have to be taken into account that it would be very difficult for regulations to cover all eventualities <e> <s> i believe that local education authorities will understand the term efficient education in subsection <e>", "<cs> i understand that following the measure becoming law there would be a circular and as the noble baroness will be aware these matters are always discussed with local authorities so i would imagine as one would be explaining things in much more detail than the primary legislation can give that these would be the sort of things that would be discussed with local authorities as we are doing with a whole variety of matters all the time <e>", "<cs> i can understand why the noble baroness put down the amendment since as she quite rightly said mrs warnock and her committee made this point very firmly in their report <e> <s> i appreciate that the objective of the noble baroness in the amendment is to secure not only effective advisory staff but also a special school which might be a resource centre <e> <s> however there is a difficulty about the amendment <e> <s> if it so wishes the local education authority can employ advisory staff with experience and qualifications in special education and i have no doubt that most if not all local education authorities do so <e> <s> the local education authority also has power to designate a special school as a resource centre and equally i have no doubt that many do that too <e> <s> however it would be going very much against our devolved system of education if in primary legislation we were to lay down that local education authorities must have such an officer on their advisory staff and that they must designate a special school as a resource centre <e> <s> i feel that it would very much go against the basis of our relationship with our partners in the education service the local education authorities if we attempted to lay down in legislation detailed descriptions as to how leas should develop their services <e>", "<cs> before turning to the amendment moved by the noble baroness lady faithfull it might be helpful if i explained a little more what clause means <e> <s> the committee will see that as the bill stands it places local education authorities under a duty to keep under review their arrangements for special educational provision <e> <s> that duty cannot be discharged without positive action somewhere in the authority <e> <s> as i see it local education authorities will have special education sub-committees which from time to time will consider aspects of special educational provision and all authorities will conduct an annual appraisal of their provision in the context of their estimates <e>", "<cs> i always listen carefully to what is said in these debates and particularly so on this bill because we are not talking here about major party political matters <e> <s> these are discussions on the best way to implement a bill that we all wish to see on the statute book <e> <s> clearly the committee is divided upon this particular amendment <e> <s> i was very interested in what my noble friend lady faithfull had to say about plans generally because when i first became a member <e>", "<cs> i think perhaps it may be for the convenience of the committee if we take other business now <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i think that we could all agree certainly the government do about the need to issue very comprehensive guidance to local education authorities in order as it were to put flesh on the legislative skeleton which we have before us <e> <s> circulars of guidance will be issued after the enactment of this bill and consideration has already begun on the necessary scope and content of the guidance which will be required <e> <s> i think that goes quite a long way towards meeting the point made in this amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can answer the question posed by the noble baroness <e> <s> as she will know the respective duties of local education authorities and governors in relation to county schools is a complicated issue <e> <s> it becomes even more complicated so far as voluntary schools are concerned <e> <s> when we were looking at the bill it seemed to us important to ensure that those nearest to the day-to-day running of the school should be aware of their responsibilities for meeting the special educational needs of registered pupils at that school <e> <s> we therefore concluded that while overall responsibility for meeting special educational needs generally clearly rests with the lea a point which i think the association of metropolitan authorities is making and they do so under the duty imposed on them by section of the act nevertheless some specific duties could and should be placed on governors of maintained schools <e> <s> governing bodies with their parent-teacher representatives have we believe a real role in respect of their schools and it is important that this embraces pupils at the schools who have special educational needs <e> <s> in imposing the duties in subsection in the way we did we had it very much in mind that this was yet another way of encouraging a better awareness of the needs of a wider group of children identified by this legislation among all concerned with their education <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness withdraws it may i add one other point <e> <s> one of the things which i believe will be paramount here is the attitude of the teachers and of course the attitude of the pupils themselves in the schools where there is integration <e> <s> that is a matter to which governors could well turn their attention and could have some really helpful and positive things to say <e>", "<cs> i can understand noble lords reaction to the use of the words to use their best endeavours <e> <s> i think the noble baroness lady jeger was very forceful on the subject <e> <s> i should like to ask her to consider the practicalities of the situation we are talking about in clause <e> <s> we are talking about securing education for children with special educational needs in ordinary schools <e> <s> if we are referring to the duty of the governors in the case of a county or voluntary school or indeed of the local education authority what we are saying is that short of sitting in on every lesson attended by every child at the school with special educational needs neither the lea nor the governors can secure absolutely that a childs special educational needs are being met <e> <s> they cannot be a kind of inspectorate <e> <s> we have no wish to place duties on people that cannot realistically be met <e> <s> i am sure that any duties imposed by this bill must be dischargeable if the bill is to meet the goals we all wish to see <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether i can give a complete assurance to the noble baroness but if she looks at clause she will see in subsection that there is the absolute duty on the local education authority to keep under review its arrangements <e> <s> i did say under subsection that thought that probably local authorities would review their arrangements at the annual budget-making time or as appropriate if some provision became available or on some such occasion <e> <s> so there is this absolute duty on the local education authority <e>", "<cs> i have already answered one question like that for the noble lord lord banks and it really is pushing his luck to ask me to answer it a second time round <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble baroness may have misunderstood the role of the responsible person as set out in clause of the bill <e> <s> the purpose of subsection <e>", "<cs> the main point to which the noble lord lord vaizey is drawing attention is very important and i am sure that every member of the committee would agree with it <e> <s> it is the need for good communications between the social services committee the education committee and of course the hospital service <e> <s> it was a point to which the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill drew particular attention on second reading and it is one on which we would all agree <e> <s> however as he will know with the single exception of the inner london education authority social services and education departments form part of the same local authority <e> <s> the actual effect therefore of this amendment would be to require a local authority which includes a local education authority to inform the local education authority of the existence of a child with special educational needs if that child happens to be in hospital or indeed elsewhere <e> <s> it is very difficult to say that by writing such a provision into legislation it would have real meaning except of course in inner london <e>", "<cs> in speaking to this amendment i think it might be helpful if i went over the powers that are given to local education authorities in this clause and which may be exercised in respect of any child with special educational needs whether or not that child has the protection of a statement under clause of the bill <e> <s> most usually these powers will be used to provide education to children who are in hospital or at home during a period of convalescence or at home waiting a placement in a special school <e> <s> occasionally they will also be used to provide home tuition for a child who may suffer from school phobia <e>", "<cs> i am glad that my noble friend lady faithfull said in her opening remarks that this was a probing amendment <e> <s> i share her concern while acknowledging the difficult circumstances in which local authorities are sometimes placed <e> <s> i do not think we can tackle the deficiencies in the level of provision in this area by means of legislation <e> <s> home tuition is provided to cover a vast range of different circumstances and it is often these circumstances which ultimately govern how much or how little provision there will be this was the point that the noble baroness lady jeger was making <e> <s> for example if a child has just left hospital and is convalescing at home before returning to school the amount of tuition that he can receive will be governed by his state of health <e> <s> similarly if a child is awaiting placement in a special school there might be a limit to the amount of tuition which the child is either able or willing to receive <e> <s> we see this very much as an area where the local education authority must for good reasons be allowed flexibility over the kind of provision to be made <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth has moved an amendment on one of the most important aspects of this whole area of the bill it is one amendment but there are half a dozen down dealing with various aspects of the major issue of confidentiality <e> <s> i wish to make it clear at the start that this is a matter which has exercised the mind of the government more than almost any other as a general principle in the bill and i believe it exercised the mind of the former administration when they were considering the education act <e> <s> it is one on <e>", "<cs> i can answer my noble friends question straight away <e> <s> the answer is that the amendment would be to clause <e> <s> it would follow the making of a statement <e> <s> it would be yet another <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness lady david has said amendment no <e> <s> requires the secretary of state to prescribe by regulations the factors that are to be taken into account by a local education authority in deciding that they are not required to determine the special educational provision that should be made for a child while amendment no <e> <s> does this the other way round and the secretary of state would be required to make regulations stating the factors that are to be taken into account in deciding whether to assess and maintain statements for individual children <e>", "<cs> this amendment is i think based on a misunderstanding <e> <s> its effect would be that if a local education authority after serving notice on a parent decided not to proceed with an assessment the parent would have the right of appeal to the secretary of state <e> <s> if in fact a local education authority decided not to proceed with an assessment this would normally be because it had been persuaded by the representations of the parents <e> <s> in that situation it is unrealistic to have a right of appeal for the parent because the parent would not have wanted the assessment in the first instance <e> <s> in the rare cases where a local authority decides for some other reason to leave off the assessment the parents have the right to ask for an assessment under clause <e> <s> in those circumstances an appeal to the secretary of state would be unnecessary <e> <s> so the point which the noble baroness is making has been met either in this part of the bill or under clause <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that the noble baroness lady jeger is moving a probing amendment really to get an explanation of this clause <e> <s> as the committee knows this is a new departure in education to give a power to local education authorities to make provision for children under the age of two <e> <s> what the noble baroness is trying to achieve in her amendment is i think an explanation as to how this will work <e> <s> if the family doctor suggests that a child under five has special educational needs and i think she is quite right that this will probably be how a parent will first become aware of this he should be able to alert the local education authority so that they can assess the need <e> <s> this is in fact already possible under the bill <e> <s> it does not require the amendment for the family doctor to do so <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> what would happen would be that the family doctor would tell the parents of his suspicion that the child has some special needs and the parents would trigger off the mechanism for assessment they could ask for an assessment <e> <s> the family doctor or it might be the health authority it might come through a health clinic would say that the child had a special need <e> <s> the noble baroness suggested <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness very much <e> <s> i am glad she appreciates that we have made major amendments to meet points that have been raised by the all-party disablement group in another place <e> <s> as she said clause has been written in as a result of that and of course clause has been extensively amended i am sure for the better <e> <s> the government have gladly accepted these amendments <e>", "<cs> here again i think that there is a misunderstanding <e> <s> the purpose of this amendment would place local education authorities under a duty to make special educational provision included in any statement they made in respect of a child aged under two <e> <s> the argument that i advanced on the preceding amendment namely that local education authorities must have a flexibility to decide whether or not this is appropriate applies in this case as well <e>", "<cs> throughout the bill we have tried to strike a balance between what is a reasonable time in which parents can place information before local education authorities and what becomes an unreasonable length of time when one considers that the child might not be receiving the education that it ought to be receiving during the period of the various procedures which have to take place <e> <s> i hope that we have struck the right balance <e> <s> one has to remember that before the point is reached where there is a draft statement the parent will have been involved throughout the assessment procedures and the contents of the statement will not come to him as something completely new which he has not had an opportunity to think about before <e> <s> what we are really talking about here is the actual period during which the parent has a chance to read the draft statement and make any further representations that he may want to make <e> <s> no local authority will take action on the statement when the parent has said that he is seeking a second opinion on some element of the assessment <e> <s> and at the end of the day the parent still has the right to take his case to the local appeal committee <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i could give an off-the-cuff answer to that <e> <s> what might be helpful would be if i wrote to the noble baroness on that point <e> <s> i think we are getting into a great deal of detail and i cannot answer that question <e> <s> before i do answer it i hope that she will consider the whole long period of assessment which precedes these dates <e> <s> these are not just beyond it it precedes them probably by a matter of weeks so that by the time the parents receive the draft statement they have had full consultations they are aware of what is going on and they have an opportunity to comment <e> <s> what is important is that if the parents are really dissatisfied they can go to appeal <e> <s> one would want to avoid doing that because it is far better that there should be discussion and if the parents should want a second opinion they can ask for it <e> <s> i think that in those circumstances this is reasonable <e> <s> but on the particular point i think i had better write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> yes i will consider this point and i will certainly consider it before the next stage of the bill <e> <s> i should not like to give a promise that i can meet it because there is a real point on the other side that one must not let too much time elapse <e> <s> i think it would be unreasonable not to look at it and i will certainly give that assurance <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should explain that while it is not specifically set out in the bill that parents will be given a copy of the statement once made under clause and informed of their right of appeal under clause it is implicit in these provisions that those steps must take place <e> <s> parents will under clause see a copy of the proposed statement and be notified in writing of the leas decision in the light of any representations they may make <e> <s> they will thus be aware of the final contents of the statement and i am sure the lea would find it appropriate to signify their decision by making a copy of the statement available to the parents <e> <s> whatever practise leas adopt parents will be in no doubt about the exact contents of a childs statement <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness has said this is a matter which was discussed at very considerable length in another place and it is a matter to which we have given a great deal of thought the whole question of the appeal procedures and whether the appeal procedures can be precisely the same as they are for other children under the education act <e> <s> i will not go over the arguments which the noble baroness summarised that were used in another place because i think this would not be necessary at this late hour but i might perhaps take her through some of the thinking of the government on this matter and the kind of problems that arose when we were considering drafting the legislation <e>", "<cs> i am tempted to say that i do not feel that i have been unreasonable today <e> <s> the govern <e>", "<cs> i really cannot accept that statement <e> <s> we have debated this principle as to whether or not parents would have an absolute right to demand an assessment of their child when in clause it was a question of children under the age of two <e> <s> the noble baroness herself will know that this is the first time in law that we have given the power to education authorities to make educational provision for children under the age of two and a right for parents to request an assessment and if the authority think it suitable to make a statement and to make educational provision for such a child under the age of two <e> <s> to say that in doing this we are tilting the bill against the parents seems to me to be unfair because here we are giving the parent a new right and we are conferring a new power on local authorities by way of their provision <e> <s> again we are making it possible in clause for parents who wish the authority to make an assessment of their childs educational needs to have the opportunity for this to be done <e> <s> we have qualified it only because as the noble baroness has said there will inevitably i regret to say be some vexatious parents and it would be quite unsuitable to put a duty on a local education authority to make a statement simply because a parent said so <e>", "<cs> i have not the slightest doubt that if a parent requests the local education authority for an assessment and there is evidence that the child has learning difficulties or has some disability the authority will make that assessment and if it is appropriate make a statement on it <e> <s> that is not being unreasonable where there is a clear case <e> <s> i am quite certain that the noble baroness can think of examples indeed we all can of cases where a parent perhaps from over <e>", "<cs> if i may just answer the point of my noble friend lord renwick the local education authority has a duty under the education acts to provide for the education of all the children under its authority <e> <s> there will be no question about what i might describe as ordinary children going to an ordinary school <e> <s> what we are talking about here is a duty to make a statement because a parent has requested it <e> <s> all i am saying is that although the authority will have a duty to provide an education for it it may not necessarily have an absolute duty to make an assessment of its needs because it may not believe that it has a special educational need <e> <s> there is therefore a difference between that duty to provide an assessment and an absolute duty to provide for its education <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady david has moved amendment no <e> <s> and spoken to a number of other amendments all of which cover the -to- year olds <e> <s> she is quite right in saying that is an important part of their lives <e> <s> it is a matter to which of course the warnock committee drew attention and i understand and respect her views and those of my noble friend lord renton on these matters <e> <s> i was very glad she said that in fact these were probing amendments to obtain the governments intention on this because as she will know it is a matter which was very fully discussed in another place <e> <s> however it is right that we should look at this in this chamber <e>", "<cs> it would not be right for me to give any kind of undertakings about when legislation might occur <e> <s> but i can assure my noble friend lord <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness lady david has said this amendment was tabled in another place and was discussed there <e> <s> i am glad that it has been retabled because it provides me with an opportunity to place on record what is a rather complicated legal point <e> <s> i think it needs to be understood in this house as well as in another place and outside parliament <e> <s> i am grateful for the support of my noble friend lord renton <e>", "<cs> clause covers provision otherwise than at schools <e> <s> the noble baronesss point which i think is directed particularly at adult training centres is a matter which she raised i think i am right in saying in the original debate which we had last january <e> <s> at that stage i was unable to give an answer because we had not got information about the other relevant acts of parliament <e> <s> it is a separate point from clause which is concerned with education at home and with education in hospitals <e> <s> it is an important point but i believe that the present law allows it to be met <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord renton in moving the original amendment has drawn attention to what i think we would all agree is a very important point namely the need for co-operation between local authority services <e> <s> i would like at the outset to give an assurance that this is a matter that we believe is best dealt with in post legislative guidance and a matter to which we will draw everyones attention <e> <s> however as my noble friend lord ridley quite rightly said with the single exception of the ilea social service and education departments form part of the same local authority <e> <s> the effect therefore of this amendment would be to require a local authority which includes the local education authority to inform the local education authority of the existence of a child with special educational needs <e> <s> as my noble friend lord ridley said outside of inner london this amendment would not have any meaning <e>", "<cs> i think we must remember that at this stage we are talking about primary legislation <e> <s> this clause has been written into the bill since the bill was originally published following upon debate in another place <e> <s> we think it is an important new clause covering very important new principles <e> <s> i think we have to allow in primary legislation for the judgment of those in the hospital services local authority services and social services to allow them to use their judgment about the appropriate person <e> <s> i am quite sure that the effect of this would be that the information would be passed on by someone who was responsible for the assessment not somebody who may perhaps have typed the letter <e> <s> i think that is a very important distinction and i am quite sure the hospital authority would regard it as inappropriate for other than a properly qualified person to pass on the information <e>", "<cs> i hope very much that i can give the noble baroness lady jeger the assurances for which she has asked <e> <s> i should like to say on this matter that district health authorities will be asked in guidance to ensure that general practitioners in their districts are aware of the importance of informing parents of their right to request an assessment <e> <s> we cannot in any case place doctors under duties which <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down i should like to make two points because i think that there is a basic misunderstanding about this amendment <e> <s> if she reads clause she will see that it is designed to identify children under the age of five who might have special educational needs <e> <s> she says how will the parents know <e> <s> she is right in saying that almost certainly the first person to tell the parents will be the family doctor <e> <s> the family doctor will be informed because the district health authority will draw his attention to the need to inform the parents <e> <s> but in an education bill it is not right to put an explicit obligation on family doctors which of course is a matter for the health service <e> <s> i think that this is an important point to recognise <e>", "<cs> the government brought forward this amendment as i promised at second reading following an undertaking that we gave in another place that we would table an amendment in these terms and that we have done <e> <s> i must confess that i was hoping that it would have received a welcome on all <e>", "<cs> in all this i think it is a point that will come up when we discuss the amendment of the noble baroness lady darcy i entirely see lord banks point that parents may be so unhappy at the stage when they first hear this that they may not fully understand it and may wish to come back <e> <s> that is why we think the very formal approach of putting all this in writing and then repeating it in writing at a later stage is not really as satisfactory as someone speaking to them and discussing it with the necessary information <e> <s> i hope in that way that we would in fact meet lord bankss point which i do take <e>", "<cs> i can clear up that point immediately it may be that there is not a local branch of a particular national organisation and therefore it would be right to refer the parents to the national body itself <e> <s> the amendment has been drawn in these terms for there to be a degree of flexibility <e> <s> it would be difficult to ensure that every health authority would keep a comprehensive library up-to-date of every voluntary organisation and all its local branches <e> <s> that is the sort of practical difficulty of which one must take account when drafting legislation and that is one reason why our amendment is drawn in the terms it is <e> <s> it would enable the health authority to put the parents either in touch with the local branch where appropriate or the national branch or if there did not appear to be an appropriate organisation at all then following the discussion with one of the members of the district team or with the health visitor the parents may be given some other advice so the amendment has been drawn in these terms to be as flexible and we hope as useful as possible <e>", "<cs> i have no reason for supposing that there will not be <e> <s> the suggestion is for some reason that i do not quite know of that the health authorities will take the narrowest possible interpretation of their duty and make for the maximum difficulty with the parents <e> <s> i ask the committee to consider the reality of the situation <e> <s> after all we are discussing what is a very distressing position <e> <s> we are discussing parents who are very distressed because their child has been born with a handicap and i am quite sure that the health authorities will want to do their best for the parents in relation to this bill as they do in other matters <e> <s> why should the health authorities not do that <e> <s> what they cannot do is to put the parents in touch with the local branch of an organisation when in fact it does not exist <e> <s> that is the reality of the situation regarding voluntary organisations <e> <s> they do not necessarily have branches in every part <e>", "<cs> i fully understand the point that the noble baroness has raised <e> <s> where a child has been admitted to hospital for treatment and is then discharged in order to receive further treatment at home or to convalesce before returning to school it is important that he should receive education if he is well enough to receive it and as a matter of good practice the school at which the child is registered should establish links with the child and the hospital staff and also with the parents and should be made aware of his discharge <e> <s> it is then the reponsibility of the school to inform the lea of the childs position if indeed he is expected to be at home for any length of time and not simply a matter of days in order that the lea may exercise their power under clause of the bill to provide home tuition in conjunction with the school <e>", "<cs> subsection is a re-enactment of section of the act <e> <s> the point that the noble baroness has raised is that we are making an unacceptable distinction between the parents of children at special schools and other parents <e> <s> i deeply regret that anyone should believe this is so and hope i can persuade noble lords that our reasons for including this provision in the bill are solely in the interests of the child and to protect the continuity of his special educational provision <e>", "<cs> of course i recognise and i hope the noble baroness does that this bill is a great advance or the legislation <e> <s> we have done everything that we can to ensure that the parents are involved at each stage in all these procedures including the appeal to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i am sure the whole committee has listened with very great interest to what the noble lord lord beaumont has said in speaking to both these amendments <e> <s> he has quite properly outlined the legal position concerning the use of corporal punishment and indeed the view that has been taken by the government in this matter <e>", "<cs> this is a matter which raises a great many issues both in special schools and in ordinary schools <e> <s> it would be difficult to single out special schools because the whole object of this bill is to have integration wherever possible <e> <s> as the noble lord lord alexander said the warnock committee has indicated that up to one in five may have special educational needs at some time and therefore for ever more we should be isolating special schools from the others <e> <s> it is a very big matter for debate <e> <s> i recognise that corporal punishment is something on which people have very strong views both for and against but it would be quite wrong for me to give an assurance that the government would look at this matter at a later stage <e>", "<cs> as your lordships will be aware the government are in full agreement with the principles of this amendment <e> <s> during debates on what became the act and during the committee stage of this bill in another place we have made it clear that we want parents and teachers involved with non-maintained special schools to have as far as possible the same rights as their counterparts in the maintained sector <e>", "<cs> i would not like the noble baroness to think that i am going back on what i said <e> <s> it is our intention to make these provisions under regulations <e> <s> i went into some detail because this is a very complicated matter <e> <s> i am afraid it would be impossible to show her draft regulations before the report stage because we are still consulting and they still have to be drawn up <e> <s> there is no disagreement in principle between us but we believe that we could not achieve this in primary legislation but only under regulations <e> <s> i would ask the noble baroness to wait for the regulations <e> <s> there will be no delay because no one wants delay in this matter <e>", "<cs> i would give a guarantee that if they are available i would certainly show them to the noble baroness <e> <s> however as she will know it is an unusual procedure to have all the regulations in draft while the primary legislation is still going through parliament <e> <s> regulations follow the primary legislation <e> <s> i do not think that there is anything unusual about that <e> <s> if the noble baroness reads what i have said and if she considers the matter she will see that there really are some very complicated legal matters to be examined and it really would be inappropriate to write something into the bill which does not make legal sense <e>", "<cs> maintained special schools non-maintained special schools and independent schools will be required to publish information annually as a condition of their approval and i think that it is important to recognise that <e> <s> the regulations made under the act cover the publication of information by local education authorities on their special educational provision and by individual maintained schools on the provision they offer <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the speech of my noble friend lord renton who summed up the situation very well and i am sure that it will pay re-reading in <e>", "<cs> i felt in a sense that the noble baroness had answered the question that she had posed by quoting from the notes on clauses and i do not want to sound repetitive at this stage of the <e>", "<cs> we all want to see this bill brought into effect and i hope we have all said enough during these proceedings in order for that to happen <e> <s> one reason why i cannot accept the amendment is that we do not wish to be tied to a date on the face of the bill and i am already exploring the possibility of bringing in some provisions into force earlier than september which seems to me a most desirable outcome <e>", "<cs> schedule is deliberately worded in its present form once again to deal with the case of bad parents <e> <s> leas must be able to demand the attendance of children for examination otherwise they cannot discharge their duties and identify and assess children with special educational needs as they must under other provisions of the bill <e> <s> it is as it were the other side of the coin of clause to which the noble baroness made reference <e>", "<cs> once again this is a re-enactment of the existing provision in the education act which relates to medical examinations <e> <s> the only change which has been made is that the amount of the fine has been increased in line with penalties for comparable offences <e> <s> again it is a provision which is rarely used but we believe it to be necessary because there will inevitably be some bad parents <e> <s> indeed we have frequently seen in the sunday newspapers examples of such cases of abuse or bad parents <e> <s> when leas encounter this type of parent who is preventing the assessment of his child with special educational needs they must have a power of enforcement unless we are prepared to see such children deprived of the help they may need <e> <s> such a power would not of course be used unless it was necessary but it must be backed up by the possibility of a penalty for noncompliance <e> <s> this is the justification for the subparagraph which i accept may at first sight appear harsh but which is necessary in the interests of the child <e>", "<cs> we are not discussing scottish legislation <e> <s> we are discussing a bill which applies to england and wales <e> <s> the noble baroness is as well aware as i am that the law in scotland varies somewhat from the law in england and wales <e> <s> the noble baroness has been as anxious as anybody for parents to have the right to an assessment and for local education authorities to have their notice drawn to <e>", "<cs> that is exactly what paragraph says <e>", "<cs> i agree entirely with the remarks of my noble friend lord ridley <e> <s> we think that it would be inappropriate for the secretary of state to determine whether or not a notice should be enforced <e> <s> this must involve him in disputes as to whether or not a child should be required to attend an examination for the purposes of assessment <e> <s> this is a matter which should be decided at the local level and by way of explanation as to how these procedures will work i do not think that i can add anything further to what i said on the previous amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has moved one amendment and spoken to a second one <e> <s> i will try to reply to both <e> <s> it is common practice in legislation for governments to take power to make regulations on several specific topics while retaining discretion about the extent to which they are used <e> <s> it is not always desirable to be required to make them as this amendment would have it <e> <s> while it is our intention to make some regulations in this area we have not as yet decided on how far they should deal with each of the three heads of keeping and disclosure and transfer or the balance between what is best covered in guidance <e>", "<cs> yes we are talking about the statement on the child <e>", "<cs> my understanding as regards that matter is that they would be covered by the general terms of the regulations which would and do apply under the act <e> <s> they would apply in these cases as well <e> <s> if i am not right about that i shall of course write to the noble baroness but that is my understanding <e>", "<cs> it is on the subject of the keeping disclosure and transfer of educational records <e>", "<cs> not as i understand it no <e>", "<cs> this was a matter that we looked at on the first day of the committee procedings and i should like because i think that this amendment is based on a misunderstanding to explain the circumstances in which local education authorities might propose to amend or cease to maintain a statement <e> <s> we should bear in mind that many such proposals will be made with the consent of parents or perhaps at the request of parents <e> <s> if the parents do not dispute the proposal clearly days is adequate for making any representations because the chances are that they will not have any representations to make <e>", "<cs> i have said that i shall look at all this <e> <s> at this stage i cannot give an absolute undertaking that the guidance will contain an answer to every point that the noble baroness has raised <e> <s> clearly if the parents want a second opinion and they say to the lea we are worried <e> <s> clearly there is something wrong <e> <s> we know that your doctor has suggested one diagnosis <e> <s> we are not satisfied <e> <s> we wish to seek a second opinion it would be totally unreasonable of the local education authority not to allow time for that second opinion <e> <s> as i said to the noble baroness when we had our meeting earlier if it behaved in this way it would be seen by the public at large to be behaving in a totally unreasonable way and i do not believe knowing as i do those administering local education authorities that they would do so <e>", "<cs> i think the bill has met the point that the noble baroness has asked <e> <s> in effect leas will be given months after the coming into force of clause of the bill in which to compile statements in respect of some children in england and wales currently ascertained as handicapped <e> <s> local education authorities will clearly need some time in which to undertake this task and months seems to me to be a reasonable time to allow for this <e>", "<cs> that was a point which we considered when we were looking at the framing of the bill because as the appeal committees decisions will not be binding on the local education authority we wondered whether it would be appropriate to include on the appeal committee people with specialised knowledge in order of course that we could make the same provisions in this bill apply as apply under the act <e>", "<cs> that is certainly a matter i should be happy to look at and that may be something we should do <e>", "<cs> as i have indicated this is certainly a matter that i shall look at <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe there is any contradiction in the two answers that i have given to the noble lord either my earlier answer or the one today <e> <s> i would confirm that the deployment of individual inspectors is a matter for the senior chief inspector <e> <s> on the noble lords second point it is true that since last summer the staff inspector with general oversight of international relations in education no longer holds this as his sole responsibility <e> <s> but he continues to devote part of his time to it and as i have already indicated other specialist hmis continue as before to take on <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baronesss question is very much wide of the original question that i was asked <e> <s> but hmi staffing matters are considered in the overall complement within the des <e>", "<cs> my lords the hmis interests cover a wide range <e> <s> these include education for international understanding and relevant academic subjects such as languages history geography and politics all of which are subjects which are taken in some schools <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated to the noble lord when he asked a question about education for international understanding some weeks ago the government do see that this has a part to play in the curriculum and have said so in their curriculum document <e> <s> we believe that this is an important part of the curriculum <e> <s> the noble lord needs to read the curriculum document in its entirety to see the role which we have attached to it <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter of great concern to the government who have made clear their <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are aware of precisely the points which the noble baroness has identified <e> <s> my honourable friend dr vaughan the minister for health has expressed his misgivings about what happens <e> <s> on th july the government announced the establishment of the maternity services advisory committee which was recommended by the social services committee in their report on peri-natal and neo-natal mortality <e> <s> this will be of importance to the government in their sustained campaign to achieve further reductions in peri-natal death and handicap which are often a consequence of mothers not attending ante-natal clinics <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are supporting the health education mother and baby campaign which is designed to encourage women to make use of ante-natal facilities <e> <s> in was allocated to the campaign and in a further <e> <s> they have also agreed to fund for six months a project by the national council for voluntary organisations to explore further the role of voluntary bodies in ante-natal care <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody who has ever attended any kind of an outpatients clinic can be aware of other than the long wait whatever the circumstances <e> <s> however the government feel that health authorities are best placed to consider what steps are needed locally in the light of local circumstances <e> <s> some area health authorities are managing to effect better im <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly draw the attention of my honourable friend in another place to the remarks which have been made on this matter <e> <s> i feel certain that he will have the means of passing it on to those in the authorities who have responsibility for this <e> <s> i am sure that we all share the noble baronesss concern <e> <s> i do myself <e> <s> the consequences of mothers not attending ante-natal clinics are very serious <e> <s> it is a most serious problem which we all need to consider carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords in an ideal world the government would not have wished to reduce expenditure for the universities either so soon or so sharply <e> <s> however in the world in which we live the over-whelming need was action to bring public expenditure within the scope of what the country could afford and higher education including the universities could not be exempt from that policy <e> <s> we recognise that rationalisation is bound to lead to redundancies of academic and non-academic staff but we believe that it is still too early to say to what extent these reductions can be achieved by early retirement or redeployment as opposed to compulsory redundancies <e> <s> the matter is being discussed both with the university grants committee and the committee of vice-chancellors and principals <e>", "<cs> it does not mean either of those things my lords <e> <s> the government believed as i indicated that higher education could not be exempt from the public expenditure economies that needed to be made <e> <s> they have as always turned to the university grants committee to determine how the allocation of the money should be made between the universities <e> <s> the ugc believed that they had to be selective in their allocation of recurrent grant not only to protect the wellbeing of the university system as a whole but also by rationalising to enable support to be given to new developments <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware that in <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be the first to applaud the employment record of some of our technological universities but we do rely on the ugc whose advice successive governments have taken for many years now on the distribution of the grant to look at the overall distribution of courses within the university system as a whole <e> <s> the noble baroness who i am sure has studied these matters will recognise that the ugcs proposals in fact indicate a slight shift away from money going into the arts-based subjects towards the sciences and technological subjects as well as medicine <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm the first part of the question asked by the noble lord lord annan that is that the million has been set aside for this year and that the universities have been asked by the ugc to make proposals by the end of january <e> <s> i shall certainly draw the point that the noble lord has made to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> i am sure that it would be useful for this to be done what we cannot be sure of is the cost of redundancies until this matter has been tested in the courts <e> <s> that is the difficulty <e>", "<cs> no my lords i did not say that <e> <s> i have indicated that what the government have said is the total reduction that they have proposed for the universities as a whole <e> <s> what of course we do not know is how much will come about by early retirements and redeployment <e> <s> there are a lot of imponderables in this matter and i cannot answer a question on tenure until this matter has been tested in the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated at the beginning in an ideal world we should all like to have more money going to the universities and the rate of contraction to be slower but this is not the situation in which we find ourselves <e> <s> i do not think it is in any way true to draw parallels between our success as a country and the expansion of the universities as these universities have expanded many times over since the end of the war <e> <s> unfortunately our economy cannot be said to have expanded at the same rate <e> <s> i do not think that the analogy is a proper one <e>", "<cs> my lords for the reduction in expenditure in respect of home students in polytechnics and in the non-university sector of higher education will generally be comparable with that of the universities <e>", "<cs> my lords in answering the various important speeches that have been made on the amendment moved by the noble baroness lady david it may be helpful if i explain how we see the bill being implemented <e> <s> once its provisions and in some cases the transitional provisions have been brought into force local education authorities will be under a duty to implement them <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> i recognise that as in the case of the first amendment she has looked at the debate which we had at committee stage and has altered her amendment in order to take account of some of the points of difficulty that were raised on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords as we are on report i speak by leave of the house for the second time <e> <s> there is no doubt at all that subsection is beyond the scope of the bill and therefore could not be accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house perhaps i could just say in answer to the point raised by the noble lord lord harris of greenwich that of course i understand it is perfectly possible for this house to amend the long title of the bill but as he will see the long title of the bill refers to making provision in respect of children with special educational needs with which the whole bill is concerned <e> <s> if he looks at this amendment new clause <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord banks was quite right in saying when he moved this amendment that we debated a very similar one in the committee stage and the committee voted upon the matter <e> <s> so we are looking again at an amendment on which your lordships have already expressed a view <e> <s> one of the difficulties is that there really is a misunderstanding about what the bill says and a misunderstanding if i may suggest it to the noble lord lord banks and those who have supported him over what his amendment says <e> <s> i was very grateful for the intervention of my noble friend lady faithfull with her experience as a local authority officer <e> <s> she made clear that when she was director of social services she had to plan just as local education authorities will undoubtedly have to plan their provision for children with special educational needs <e> <s> nobody is going to argue against that certainly i am not going to argue against it on this occasion or indeed on any other occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all noble lords will know that local education authorities are very much aware of the need for parents who do not understand english or welsh to be properly informed about what is happening to their child <e> <s> indeed in principle i accept what the noble baroness lady jeger has said in speaking to the amendment because i am sure that what she is enunciating and indeed what the noble baroness lady fisher is saying are examples of the very best of good practice <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will not be surprised to hear that i view with some regret that my noble friend lord renton has put down this amendment before the house today <e> <s> it is true that we did not debate this amendment at the committee stage but this amendment is concerned with the whole issue of confidentiality and there are a number of other amendments before the house on this same principle <e> <s> we debated that principle at committee stage and the committee divided upon it <e> <s> because i gave an undertaking that the government would bring forward an amendment the committee did not support the amendment before it <e>", "<cs> no my lords i shall move amendment no <e> <s> at the appropriate time <e>", "<cs> my lords in preparing for the discussion on the amendment i too reread the discussion that we had on a similar amendment at the committee stage <e> <s> the noble baroness is quite right in saying that there are two circumstances where the right of appeal might appear to be necessary <e> <s> as she quite rightly says the first circumstance is if after serving notice of assessment under clause the lea decides not to proceed and that would normally be because it has been persuaded by the representations of the parents <e> <s> therefore it is unnecessary to think of a right of appeal for the parents in that case <e> <s> i then went on to say that if the lea having embarked on the assessment decides for some other reason not to continue it the parents have the right to ask for an assessment under clause <e> <s> as the noble baroness has said both in committee and now under clause the lea has the opportunity to say that the request for an assessment is unreasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a long debate on the principle of confidentiality so i shall confine my remarks to speaking quite precisely to this amendment which has been moved by the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth <e> <s> i should like to say at the outset that i see that the proposed new clause is an attempt to recognise some but not all of the dangers which might arise in some cases if parents were given an absolute right of access to professional reports <e> <s> i think it is worth asking ourselves what in practical terms would be achieved by this clause which is not achieved by the governments own amendment to clause which we shall debate as amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house as i hope i indicated in my earlier remarks we have given to parents the right to discuss the statement with one of the professionals involved so to that extent subsection is met <e> <s> as far as subsection of this new clause is concerned i have just moved an amendment to apply the new government provision to clause as well as to clause in order to extend its procedures so i think that to a certain extent subsection of this new clause is met <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house to answer the point which has been made by the noble lord lord renton and the noble baroness lady masham i recognise that the amendment of lady darcy is one in which she has tried to meet some of the governments concerns <e> <s> i would be wrong not to say to the house that the government have considered this matter and have gone through a long consultative period over this amendment no <e> <s> which we have put down to meet the anxieties of the house and the other place about the issue of confidentiality <e> <s> i cannot at this stage undertake to consider the amendment of the noble baroness <e> <s> if she presses it i advise my noble friends to vote against it <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to answer the two questions which have been raised <e> <s> before doing so i should like to thank my noble friend lord renton for the welcome he gave to this amendment <e> <s> i recognise that the amendment does not go as far as he and some other noble lords would like but i believe it goes a very long way towards meeting the points concerning parents <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank the noble lord lord winstanley for the welcome that he has given to this amendment <e> <s> in reply to the noble baroness lady jeger we take her point about the language problem <e> <s> throughout the guidance which we shall issue on the act we shall emphasise the need to ensure that parents understand what is going on if necessary by arranging an oral explanation to back up the letter <e> <s> this is essential to the working of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand very well the sincerity of my noble friend lord renton on this matter of confidentiality but i very much hope that he will not feel at any stage that i or any of my colleagues in another place who have been concerned with this bill have ever taken the attitude towards parents of not treating them like adults <e> <s> it would be most unfortunate if anybody believed that that was our attitude it certainly is not <e> <s> i think it is very important for parents to understand that one of the underlying principles of this bill is parental inolvement at every stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with care to what the noble baroness lady david has said about the powers of appeal committees <e> <s> i cannot pretend that this is an easy area to deal with in legislation <e> <s> on the one hand proper weight must be given to the detailed assessment that will have been carried out by a team of professionals and on the other we are anxious to give parents a right of appeal which is real and not just cosmetic <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will know that we have already debated at length the question of extending the bill to cover further education <e> <s> i am very well aware of the concern which has been felt about this <e> <s> i have of course read the warnock report <e> <s> i recognise as my noble friend lord renton said that mrs warnock and her committee felt that this was a priority area <e> <s> it is an area to which as the noble baroness lady david quite rightly said the government attach great importance <e> <s> however as the noble baroness will know at present the government are consulting on the legal basis of further education <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it has often been my experience in speaking either for the government or indeed for the opposition on legislation that the government have actually brought forward an amendment to meet the concerns expressed in another place and in this house to find that the house is dissatisfied with it and wishes to rewrite the amendment rather on the basis which i thought was well put by the noble lord lord winstanley that three-quarters of a loaf is usually better than no bread <e> <s> in this particular case i think the way that clause has been drafted does actually meet the point that was made certainly to me and certainly as a result of discussions in another place about the role of the voluntary organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to try and clear up any misunderstandings that there may be on this part of schedule <e> <s> it might be helpful if i explain again the circumstances in which a local education authority will cease to maintain a statement <e> <s> this may happen if the child goes to live outside the area of the authority which made the statement <e> <s> in that case the child ceases to be the responsibility of that authority and the statement ceases to have any effect because the original authority will no longer be responsible for the childs education <e> <s> if the child has moved into the area of another local education authority which is the most likely circumstance then the original authority may pass on his records but there will be power under paragraph to make regulations about this and it will be for the new authority to decide whether to make the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house has listened with great feeling to the points which have been made <e> <s> i think that it was right to have a statement at this moment and i think that the house has appreciated it <e> <s> i will see that all the points that have been made and the way that they have been expressed are passed on appropriately <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first and third point that the noble lord lord winstanley has made i shall of course take every opportunity to remind members of the public of the work that the house of lords is currently doing and continues to do throughout the year <e> <s> i believe that to be important <e> <s> on the specific point that he has raised he will know that when the bill was going through another place this matter was raised on an amendment and was defeated <e> <s> when it has subsequently been looked at it has always been the view that the object of this is to enable a member of parliament to perform his duties more effectively particularly where the operations of the executive affect his constituents <e> <s> i see no reason for altering that at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that this is quite the same parallel <e> <s> it is very important to emphasise that regarding the raising of questions by members of the public they do not necessarily have to do this through their own member of parliament <e> <s> they can go to any member of parliament if they believe they have a point which they wish to put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point of my noble friend but as i indicated in an earlier reply this matter was raised during the passage of the bill in and it was then turned down <e> <s> i do not think that the particular reason that was given has been invalidated because it rests on the basis of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly note all that the noble lord lord molloy said and i am very glad to feel that he thinks that this house has such a useful role to play <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that the act allows complaint to be made to any member of the house of commons and that if an individual cannot persuade his own member to take up his case or if the <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point that the noble baroness has made which has been raised by other members of your lordships house <e> <s> i note the strength of the feeling on the subject <e> <s> i can only reiterate that when this matter has been looked at on other occasions it has always been felt that the primary responsibility for defending the citizen against the executive does rest with the member of the house of commons and the government share these views <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not feel that i can usefully add anything to what i have already said <e> <s> i will of course look carefully at all the points that have been raised <e> <s> i feel that it would serve no purpose to reiterate the argument that i have already made to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to what my noble friend lord renton has said and i hope that i can give him the assurances that he requires about both these amendments <e> <s> i will speak to both of them now which i think will be for the convenience of the house <e> <s> we have sought in clause to reflect the reality of the circumstances which will arise when parents apply to their local education authority for meetings in connection with any part of the assessment as set out in their childs draft statement <e> <s> in the majority of cases i have no doubt that parents will be able to specify exactly in what respect they disagree with the assessment and the leas will have little difficulty in deciding what the relevant advice is which the parent should be discussing with the provider of that advice or another appropriate person <e> <s> that is a point which i think the noble lord lord renton has accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i reply with the leave of the house <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has asked two questions <e> <s> i am sorry if i did not answer the first one as fully as i perhaps should have done <e> <s> i must emphasise that this is at the end of a very long process from the time when the child is first identified as a child having special educational needs the parent being brought in at the first stages and taking part in the multi-disciplinary assessment the parent being involved with the assessment that is made the parent being involved with the draft statement <e>", "<cs> my lords as this amendment is concerned with voluntary bodies i should like to offer my congratulations to my noble friend lord renton and to the national society for mentally handicapped children and adults <e> <s> i was delighted to hear that the society had received the gracious permission of her majesty to add royal to its full title <e> <s> i am sure that this recognition of the work of the society will be greatly acclaimed and that all parts of the house will be pleased to endorse it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest to the debate we have had on to year-olds <e> <s> i believe that what the noble baroness lady jeger has said is true that my noble friends <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i can set at rest the fears that have been expressed this afternoon and i should very much like to thank my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> at this stage it would be wrong of me not to acknowledge the care and concern that has been shown on all sides of your lordships house during our debates on this important measure <e> <s> our debates have taken place against a non-political background and across party lines and i should like to thank your lordships for the co-operative way in which <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had in effect a second reading debate and i should like to correct one slight misunderstanding <e> <s> i am sure the house will understand that i would not in any way wish to mislead anybody at any stage of the bill on the american experience <e> <s> i think it is always rather difficult to compare different systems <e> <s> i took the best advice that i could and i should like to absolve my advisers from any intention to mislead anyone <e> <s> what is important is that in the important area of confidentiality i believe we have gone as far as we can to meet what we recognise to be the concerns of parents <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are aware of the undertakings that were given to the public service pensioners at the time of the last election <e> <s> my noble friend will be aware that we set up the scott inquiry into this matter and we hope that the governments conclusions on it will not now be too long delayed <e> <s> we have also instituted another inquiry to look at civil service pay and i have no doubt the points my noble friend has raised will be included in the discussions on that <e>", "<cs> my lords the short answer to the noble lord is that about a quarter of the working population is covered by index-linked pension schemes <e> <s> although i would not like to say that this applies in the case of the noble lord himself i believe members of another place are also covered by such schemes <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> we are of course aware that public sector pensioners are generally better protected than those in the private sector <e> <s> the government have in mind the points that my noble friend has made and will certainly bear them in mind in the current review of the arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not got the information available on private sector schemes <e> <s> i recognise that there are private sector schemes which give a high degree of protection to their pensioners but one must recognise that not all of them do <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly take note of that suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords the first point the noble lord made is of course quite correct <e> <s> pensions will of course be subject to tax <e> <s> on the noble lords second point it is true that the average weekly pension after the november increase will be a week and that the average extra pension increase will be just about a week <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i certainly take note of that point <e> <s> as i indicated earlier the government have not yet reached their conclusions on the scott report <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not recognised that in any of the remarks i have made i was anything other than compassionate about both groups those who are indexed and those who are not <e> <s> what we are trying to elucidate in this question is the facts of the case <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another suggestion of which i will take note <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a major objective of this government <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i will follow the noble lord down that line of argument <e> <s> i think it important to recognise that the taxpayer cannot afford to pay an unreasonable share of the cost of public service pensions and that is why the government set up the scott inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that really is very wide of the question raised by the noble baroness lady burton <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i said enough in answer to the original question

lords i beg to move that the lord aberdare be nominated to take the chair in all committees for this session <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the baroness white be appointed principal deputy

immunity from prosecution and to allow forfeiture to be imposed without prosecution and conviction in the courts would be to raise another issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords to reiterate what i said originally where there is a conviction in a case involving treachery or the official secrets acts a pension right can be forfeited <e> <s> but we are talking about cases where there is not a conviction and as the act stands the pension rights cannot be forfeited under those circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend no doubt has some specific case in mind and if we have some specific case to consider i think one must give the facts which relate to that case <e> <s> in answer to the question which has been asked i can only state the position as it stands under the law <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is the turn of my noble friend lord derwent <e> <s> we should have a question from this side of the house <e> <s> then it will be the turn of the noble lord lord kennet <e> <s> afterwards i suggest that we should move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords it really is time that we moved on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords three minutes ago i indicated that after we had taken the question from the noble lord lord derwent as we had had few questions from the conservative side and after we had had the question from the noble lord lord kennet i thought it was right that we should move on as we had then spent between six and seven minutes on this question <e> <s> i think it is the wish of the house that we should now take the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make it quite clear that it is not a convention of the house that the noble lord who has a question down on the order paper has any right of reply at the end of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the answer to that question is that it is a very unusual event <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a most interesting and important debate <e> <s> i too should like to begin by thanking the noble lord lord sherfield who introduced the motion and who chaired the select committee which has produced such a very valuable report on <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the noble lord that i should always be delighted to have a talk with him on any subject but he is far too clever a man to need my advice on how to form a party <e>", "<cs> i should have thought the noble lord had already made a very good start my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the house did agree that after we had taken the last three questions we should move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> the agreement is being critically looked at in order to give greater control and accountability <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure that i fully understand the import of the noble lords question <e> <s> i cannot comment on industrial relations in other industries <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that this would depend on the circumstances <e> <s> different departments would of course have different arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i would entirely agree with what the noble lord has said <e> <s> indeed it is our wish to have good industrial relations <e> <s> in fact our agreement gives more than that which would be essential under the terms of the trade union legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to that question of course the circumstances in each department of the civil service would vary but it is generally estimated that per cent <e> <s> of the time that is taken up in these discussions is on matters related to industrial relations and about per cent <e> <s> of the time is spent on trade union activities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but could he put his points in the form of a question and not make a speech <e> <s> it is a statement which we have just had <e>", "<cs> my lords we have now spent more than half an hour on this matter <e> <s> i should like to suggest that the noble lord lord hill-norton who has been trying to speak since the very start of these proceedings might now put his question and that we should then return to the local government miscellaneous provisions bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hill-norton has been trying to ask a question from the very moment that the statement was concluded <e>", "<cs> my lords i of course will be guided by the house in this matter <e> <s> we could of course go on taking a great many more questions and i recognise that this is a most important statement but we do have a great deal of other business to do this afternoon <e> <s> i would have thought that now that we have been very nearly minutes on this statement it is time to move on to the next business <e> <s> i would hope that that would be the view of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords of course it is a very big subject <e> <s> there are a great many facets that cannot possibly be covered in the course of a statement or in questions following upon a statement <e> <s> i recognise <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is not asking a question he is now on a second statement <e> <s> i think we had concluded that the house now wished to return to other business <e> <s> i think we should do that <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lord lord shinwell is that everybody in your lord-ships house would view it as appalling if the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not accept that remark <e> <s> i think that the house of lords does work effectively <e> <s> the proof of this is the number of amendments which are made in this chamber and which are accepted by governments and the number of times we have been instrumental in making improvements to legislation promoting legislation and airing subjects of national importance <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is referring to the publication that was issued by labour peers some years ago i have read it but i shall be very happy to read it again <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord and his colleagues will draw it to the attention of their colleagues in the house of commons <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot go beyond the statement i made in my original answer to this question <e> <s> what is important is that all members of your lordships house should be talking to their colleagues in another place and persuading them towards this point of view <e>", "<cs> what i think is true my lords is that there have been a number of very successful reforms since the second world war which have been of a relatively minor nature or were so regarded when they were introduced but have altered the house of lords <e> <s> these are the sort of matters noble lords are thinking of when they talk of reform <e>", "<cs> my lords i come from a party that is completely committed to having a second chamber and i have said so frequently <e> <s> i would like to think that the party to which the noble lord lord jenkins of putney belongs said the same thing in such vigorous terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i should describe the members of the other place quite in those terms <e> <s> however it illustrates the difficulties of reform at a time when there was a very large measure of agreement that there should be reform and even on the terms of that reform still it was not possible to bring that reform about <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly note that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware that the noble lord lord shinwell has spoken up for the house of lords on many occasions and we are always very glad when he does so <e> <s> i will of course look carefully at what he has said and the suggestions which he has made <e>", "<cs> my lords the payment of increments where these are due is not affected by the current pay offer to the non-industrial civil service <e> <s> in just under half of all staff received increments <e> <s> the average value of these increments to those who received them was about per cent <e> <s> of salary though the net additional cost of the incremental pay system to the wage bill was only per cent <e> <s> as in a wide range of other employments the pay for the grade in the civil service is the scale taken as a whole together with rules for progression through it <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> many of those who are getting a pay award will not in fact be receiving an increment at all <e> <s> some of those who will receive an increment will get a nil pay award this year <e> <s> the two things ought not to be confused <e> <s> the increments are part of the accepted range of pay scales <e> <s> the pay award is something quite separate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to try to clarify the point on which i think there has been some confusion <e> <s> the incremental pay scale represents the rate of pay for the employee concerned <e> <s> if we followed the line of reasoning in the question and included it as part of the pay award we would have to add the value of increments made to pay offers for a whole range of people including nurses local government employees the services and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am really not in a position to comment on the top salaries review body which is quite wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> no my lords my noble friend lord mottistone is not correct in that <e> <s> it is very important for the house and the public to understand that incremental increases are a separate issue <e> <s> the incremental pay scale represents the rate of pay for an employee <e> <s> the pay award is something quite separate <e>", "<cs> my lords the short answer to the noble lord lord leatherland is that it is neither <e> <s> i think he would find that it was concerned with the claiming of expenses in your lordships house and was not an increment or a pay award <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the whole house will wish to thank the noble lord lord aberdare for making his statement <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble earl lord listowel for agreeing to act on behalf of the chairman of committees <e> <s> he has done this with the customary willingness which we have all come to expect from him over the years and i too would join in paying tribute to the many years he has served this house both in and out of government and as chairman of committees <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be only right that i should draw the attention of the noble earl to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord morris wishes to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that i must interrupt my noble friend lord morris to say that although we are on third reading and he is perfectly entitled to make a speech it would be quite wrong to leave the impression that something was improperly or incorrectly done at the committee stage <e> <s> there was agreement in committee on the advice we received that amendments would be inappropriate and there was only one issue before the house and i would draw <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord should ask that question after my noble friend has made the statement that he will be making at about <e> <s> that will be the appropriate time to put it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both noble lords for their very warm congratulations to our armed forces on what they have achieved <e> <s> as the noble lord lord shackleton quite rightly said it was a remarkable achievement on the part of both the planners and the forces themselves who took part in the operation <e> <s> i am glad too to have had the recognition of the importance that we all attach to south georgia a point which i believe has been brought out very much in debates in this house <e> <s> as both noble lords have said we had a right to take this robust stand under article of the united nations charter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord aylestone for his remarks <e> <s> i shall take note of them but as he will appreciate the government are keeping parliament informed of developments as they unfold over the present situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it would be appropriate for me to comment on affairs in another place <e> <s> i hope that as i have indicated when speaking to the responses to the statement today my colleagues and i in this house have been grateful for the debates that we have had in this house which i think have been very responsible and helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord soames for his intervention which is very important <e> <s> he himself has had much experience of diplomatic negotiations <e> <s> as he rightly says secret diplomacy is probably the way of making most progress at the present time <e> <s> what has been encouraging is the support that we have had from the rest of the world and notably from our friends in the eec and from other countries in the commonwealth <e> <s> i take his point and i think it is only right that i should reiterate that it is our hope still that we shall be able to be reach a diplomatic solution to this <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that that was the point that i made clear we are negotiating but we believe that the argentines should withdraw their forces from the islands <e> <s> that is part of the security council resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords i have noted what the noble lord has said <e> <s> he is repeating the argument that he used in the debate the other day <e> <s> i should remind him and the house that there have been two basic principles in this dispute <e> <s> one is that aggressors should be deterred and the other is the right of self-determination of peoples and those are two principles on which we have stood <e>", "<cs> my lords we are always glad to have support for our policies even from so unexpected a source if i may say so as the noble lord lord jenkins and i thank him for it <e> <s> regarding a united nations peace-keeping force i cannot at this stage go into any details about anything which is being discussed <e> <s> it would he quite inappropriate to comment while diplomacy is still operating <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that one can always learn lessons from the past <e> <s> i have no doubt that notice has been taken over this particular matter <e> <s> so far as military actions are concerned again the house will not expect me to comment but i have no doubt that the point that the noble lord lord hankey has made about the weather has been taken into consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords throughout this very difficult situation in the falkland islands i hope that i have correctly interpreted the wishes of the house and that on each occasion when another place has been recalled we too have met for a debate <e> <s> all statements have been repeated in this house and of course it is always open if the house would like another full-scale debate on the falkland islands for one to be arranged through the usual channels <e> <s> i am sure that it will be the wish of the house that it should be kept fully informed of the situation as it develops <e> <s> that is the wish that i have tried to interpret at each stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly take note of what the noble lord lord harris has said on the subject as of course i said i would in the case of the remarks of the noble lord lord aylestone <e> <s> the noble lord and i hope all noble lords will appreciate that while these very difficult negotiations are proceeding and while we are in a very serious situation it is most unwise to say publicly anything further than need be said <e> <s> i am not declining to say anything for any other reason <e> <s> of course i shall take note of the points that have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of what my noble friend lord buxton has said on this matter and i will see that it is conveyed to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for that intervention from my noble friend lord forester <e> <s> i am sure that the whole house is glad to hear it <e> <s> i shall certainly pass that on too <e>", "<cs> my lords we have a list of speakers <e> <s> it is now the turn of the noble lord lord stewart to speak and i think it is the wish of the house that we should hear him <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course open to any member of your lordships house to put his name down to speak and he will be included on the list of speakers <e> <s> it is also possible to speak at the end of the list of speakers in the gap <e> <s> but we have now passed that point and it is indeed the time for the noble lord lord stewart to speak <e> <s> it would be breaking with all conventions of the house not to apply the accepted practice of the house on this particular occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i much regret it if there has been any misunderstanding but we really are at this particular point of todays proceedings and i think it is the wish of the house that we hear the noble lord lord stewart <e>", "<cs> my lords i did in fact suggest that <e> <s> there are so many noble lords who wish to intervene in this debate but if the noble lord lord davies of leek who i believe was next will give way to the noble lord lord hill-norton and i know that the noble lord lord shackleton also wants to get in i think there will be time for everyone else provided they confine their remarks to question form <e>", "<cs> my lords there are so many noble lords who wish to ask questions may i suggest that we take my noble friend lord glenkinglas who has <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we have had a very long time on both statements <e> <s> we are also conducting an important debate this afternoon so perhaps it would be right just to take the noble lord lord kaldor but after his question to move on and for lord tordoff to continue with the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it might be better for the house if i continued my speech because it has a thread of argument running through it <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will put his question later so that he may receive an answer to it <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the first objectives of the government is to bring down the rate of inflation <e> <s> we think that following upon that we shall see an ending of the recession and then a decline in the total numbers of the unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that the rate of inflation was per cent <e> <s> when we as a government came to office <e> <s> but i hope that the noble lord will be pleased that the average level of inflation will be lower under this government than it was under our predecessor which is the first time that this has happened since the war <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter is of course absolutely correct <e>", "<cs> my lords we all agree that the level of unemployment is a tragedy and is far too high but as the noble lord lord paget knows the underlying trends have shown an increase of unemployment throughout the last government and this too was something which we have inherited <e> <s> we believe that through our policies we are creating real jobs and that the long-term future of people of this country is better <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> yes my lords what the noble lord says is true and it is important that everyone in this country should understand that we shall create real jobs when people produce goods at the price other people are prepared to pay at the time that they want them and of the kind that they want <e> <s> that is how real jobs could be created and that is our determination <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have misinformed the house on that matter i apologise and i would certainly withdraw it <e> <s> the point that i was making is that each time there has been a rise in inflation so unemployment has increased and the total numbers of unemployed have increased at each stage and that is <e>", "<cs> my lords the government believe that the increases that were recently awarded as a result of the top salaries review boards recommendations are fully justified <e> <s> we believe they were essential to ensure an adequate supply of candidates of sufficient calibre for the bench and to provide adequate career structures and differentials for the higher levels of the civil service and the armed forces <e> <s> furthermore the tsrb group are the only group whose present salaries are below those recommended for april <e> <s> it was for these reasons that the awards were given <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house and i am sure everybody else appreciate the great value of the work that the nurses do <e> <s> i should like to make it clear that extra provision has been made to help finance higher pay increases for the nurses doctors and dentists and this has been found partly from other savings on programmes and partly from the contingency reserve <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot possibly speak for other authorities whoever those other authorities may be <e> <s> i am simply speaking for the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord lord paget has been trying to get in for a long time and then i suggest the noble lord lord blyton might put his point <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the prime minister about the economic summit at versailles which she and my right honourable friends the foreign secretary and the chancellor of the exchequer attended from th to th june <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank both noble lords lord peart and lord gladwyn for their comments on the statement <e> <s> they asked a number of questions dealing with a wide range of subjects and i shall do my best to answer them <e> <s> the first question to which they both referred was the whole sphere of unemployment which we all recognise as being a serious matter there are now approximately million unemployed in the european economic community but the number of course is higher for the seven summit nations <e> <s> we have accepted that todays unemployment deeply regrettable though it is is the price we have to pay for allowing inflation to continue for so long in the past <e> <s> we are glad to note that most forecasters expect resumed growth in activity in summit countries later this year and next and that at least should help to halt the rise in unemployment <e> <s> we therefore regard attempts to bring down inflation as most important and it is therefore good news that inflation has been reduced to single figures on average in the summit countries that there has been realism which is growing in wage settlements that the united states germany japan and the united kingdom all have settlements in single figures and that our inflation rate is now down to single figures <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first part of that supplementary is yes <e> <s> the answer to the second part is that i should prefer not to comment <e> <s> i would only say that it is our intention to repossess the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the first point raised in what i think the noble lord lord boothby intended to be a question we are all agreed that the rate of inflation should be brought down <e> <s> to answer his second point his view that we should return if i understood him correctly either to the dollar being a major currency or go back on to some form of the gold standard i do not think we could put the clock back <e> <s> what the economic summit did in the last few days was set out in the statement on the international monetary undertakings <e>", "<cs> my lords the summit was primarily an economic conference but of course political issues were raised as well <e> <s> clearly one of these was <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i did not quite hear the end of lord baloghs question <e> <s> however i hope that i understood him correctly and that he was asking whether the economic summit endorsed a continuation of policies that had given rise to unemployment <e> <s> we believe and i think that this was recognised by all other countries that the very regrettable level of unemployment has been the price that we have had to pay for a long period of inflation in the past and it is the getting down of inflation which should be our first concern <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i should like to reply to the questions of the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe in the reverse order to that in which he asked them <e> <s> on the question of new technology it is true that president mitterrand stressed the important role of new technology and said that a working group will prepare a report for consideration at the next economic summit <e> <s> we have welcomed the initiatives taken by president mitterrand in this field which we believe is a very important one in generating both growth and new employment <e> <s> however we believe that the industrial structures of our country must in the last resort be those which will be determined by industrialists and by the demands of the market <e> <s> they cannot in fact be determined by a committee <e> <s> on the question of export credit to the ussr inevitably there are some differences of emphasis between the different countries but there has now been broad agreement and there is to be further discussion with the united states on the whole question of credit to eastern europe and to russia <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the noble lord lord gladwyn if i did not answer his question about the third world and i will try to answer it in my answer to the noble lord lord hatch <e> <s> on the question of third world countries yes of course this was a matter which was discussed and it is in fact important to see what the seven countries can do to help them <e> <s> i have already drawn attention to <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i reassure the noble lord lord shinwell that the debate which is to take place this afternoon is not a short debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i do appreciate that the noble lord feels very strongly about this matter <e> <s> could he ask one very short question not make a point but ask one short supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both noble lords for their very kind remarks <e> <s> i think that we all recognise with great pride the achievement of our servicemen <e> <s> it has been a quite remarkable exercise and i am sure that all members of the house and the country send their deepest sympathies to those families who have suffered the loss of relatives in the fighting <e> <s> i should also like to say that i think it has been important that we all have been agreed on the principle for which we have been fighting namely that aggressors must be deterred <e> <s> this has been a fundamental point in the whole of the crisis over the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord home for his very kind and helpful remarks <e> <s> i am sure that his advice on the next steps is very wise <e> <s> indeed there is now a tremendous amount of work to be done in the falkland islands on clearing up the effects of the argentine occupation and the fighting which has taken place on the east falklands <e> <s> our first need is to restore as quickly as possible a normal way of life for the islanders and then i think it is right that we should consult them about their wishes for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the right reverend prelate for his kind remarks <e> <s> we shall never know what direct influence the popes visit had in these particular matters <e> <s> but it is something to give us all cause for thought that the visits both here and to argentina took place and were so much appreciated by our population <e> <s> i am quite sure that the right reverend prelate is right in saying not only that aggressors should be deterred but that the principles of rights of self-determination have been upheld in this whole conflict and it is very important and gratifying that we have brought it to a successful conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that what the noble lord lord wallace said is very important and it follows very much what my right honourable friend the prime minister said earlier on in another place when answering questions which clearly are of great concern to families who have lost relatives <e> <s> may i confirm what the noble lord has said and make it quite clear that what was shown on television last night was a military burial <e> <s> however of course it will be followed by a burial in a cemetery and indeed the war graves commission have long experience of looking after in perfect condition the cemeteries of those who have died overseas in battle <e> <s> relatives can be assured that their loved ones will be looked after in perpetuity in a very satisfactory way <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that suggestion which i shall certainly pass on to my noble friend the secretary of state for defence <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to determine what the press release from the select committee should say <e> <s> i think it only right that i should make it quite clear that the press release was the responsibility of the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not myself had an opportunity to read the report but judging by the reports that i have seen in the press i do not think that all of us will agree with everything that has been said in the report <e>", "<cs> my lords in these matters i am guided entirely by the procedures that are laid down in <e>", "<cs> my lords i much regret the tone of the observations of my noble friend because i have given a reply to his questions <e> <s> i have given him a factual answer as leader of the house having taken advice upon the points that he has raised <e> <s> he has asked me three questions <e> <s> may i make it quite clear that judgments from the law lords contain the speeches of the law lords and they are not a report from the committee <e> <s> therefore it is not the same point at all <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones has of course set out the position on select committees in this house <e> <s> as i have tried to indicate there is an opportunity for individual members to express a view in the minutes of the committees proceedings and that is the right way to do so in those particular circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords as leader of the house i have followed what has been the practice of the house based on the advice i have received on matters to do with select committees <e> <s> this report will be published in three volumes the other two volumes will be published on th july <e> <s> i personally think it is a matter for regret that the three volumes were not published at the same time but the decision about publication was a decision of the committee and i am content to abide by their decision <e> <s> there are opportunities if the question is not to do with select committees <e> <s> the noble lord lord shinwell is worried about the practice of the house <e> <s> other practices of the house can of course be raised and debated in the appropriate committees of the house and i hope i am always available to noble lords who wish to raise points that should be discussed for the better working of the house <e>", "<cs> my understanding of the position my lords of course the minutes of the proceedings have not yet been published is that there was one division on a new clause which was moved by my noble friend but was disagreed to <e>", "<cs> the answer to that point my lords is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i should regret it if any members views had been distorted in any way <e> <s> as i have indicated and as the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones made clear earlier when there is a select committee what the house asks for are the opinions of the committee which are published in the form of a report <e> <s> it is always open to any member of your lordships house to write to the press explaining his views if that is what he wishes to do but that is a separate matter from the proceedings of the committee <e>", "<cs> i am sure there will be a debate on the report my lords and the arrangements for that will be made through the usual channels in the usual way <e> <s> i should like to say that i have made my remarks as leader of the house and that my noble friend lord vaizey is of course perfectly entitled to his point of view and he has a long and distinguished career as an academic <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to thank both the noble lord lord cledwyn and the noble lord lord gladwyn for their response to the statement <e> <s> they have asked a number of questions on different matters and i will do my best to answer them <e> <s> the noble lord lord cledwyn asked a number of questions on the luxembourg compromise <e> <s> i would like to say that five member states agreed that the community should continue the practice of deferring majority voting when member states consider that major national interests are at stake <e> <s> we can therefore expect that the community will continue to operate on a basis which will enable us to safeguard our important national interests <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kennet has raised three further points <e> <s> the first concerns the luxembourg compromise <e> <s> i think that i can only say further on this matter that on the question of whether or not it enables us still to have a veto it was accepted by the six nations that it did enable us to do so and the agreement to disagree has worked for nearly years among the nine and the ten <e> <s> as regards the question of giving our reasons in writing that certainly is an idea which was included in the genscher/colombo proposals but there was no decision reached about the texts of this matter at the meeting which concluded on th june <e> <s> i really cannot add anything further to what i have already said about the genscher/colombo discussions and certainly if i may say so not about the tone of voice <e> <s> i have tried to indicate that the discussions are continuing and i think that that is where the matter must rest <e> <s> i have no doubt that when it says that the report makes this quite plain that is what is happening and it is continuing its work under the danish presidency at present and will of course continue should it not be concluded before then under the next presidency <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i made clear in what i said earlier that as regards the question of whether the luxembourg compromise is still valid and when it would be used from discussion it is quite clear that five member states including ourselves took the view that the practice of deferring decisions by majority voting where a member state considers that important national interests are at stake should be continued <e> <s> the operative words are important national interests i think that this is the matter upon which we should concentrate <e> <s> it provides a basis for the communitys decision-taking procedures which will enable important national interests in the future to continue to be safeguarded <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of the accession of spain to the community i should like to confirm what i think has already been said namely that although we have supported spains application to join the community it is inconceivable that there should be a closed frontier between the territories of two members of the community and we have made this point clear to the spaniards <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt at all that when the governor comes to london all these many issues will be discussed <e> <s> they are of course material to all the reasons for wanting the frontier to be reopened <e> <s> but as i have already indicated it is an unhappy situation that spain has not reopened the frontier as we hoped she would <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble earl but after a statement it is proper to ask a question rather than make a speech <e> <s> if the noble earl could put his point in the form of a question then others would have an opportunity to raise questions on the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement that is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the prime minister on her visit to new york and washington yesterday <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can start by saying i am grateful for all the remarks that the noble lord lord peart and the noble lord lord gladwyn have made on the statement <e> <s> i regret that the noble lord lord peart did not feel that what my right honourable friend the prime minister said at the united nations went far enough on the question of disarmament <e> <s> i hope that the statement has made clear that she took a very realistic look at the whole question of disarmament <e> <s> as the statement makes clear she called for a number of proposals and commended a number of proposals which are currently being discussed particularly the reduction in conventional weapons and the fresh proposals that have been made in vienna on mutual and balanced force reduction on chemical weapons and so on <e> <s> what my right honourable friend has made quite clear is that unilateral disarmament and disarmament by itself will not simply bring us peace <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the noble lords pardon he asked what we were going to do about it <e> <s> we have of course asked other countries to intervene because we would like to he able to get a cessation of hostilities and the argentine to agree to a cessation of hostilities in the south atlantic <e> <s> we have asked other countries about this <e> <s> we have to face the fact that there is a very unsettled political situation in argentine at the present time <e> <s> the noble lord also asked me again about the united nation peacekeeping role <e> <s> i believe the important point at the moment as i have already indicated is that we should have this period of rehabilitation in the falkland islands before considering any future arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole question of any future debate on the falkland isalnds would of course be a matter for the usual channels and i am sure that the suggestion of the noble lord lord aylestone has been noted <e> <s> he will appreciate that we already have an extremely busy programme of work between now and the time when the house rises but i am sure that this is a matter that will be noted <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord shinwell has raised a number of speculative questions concerning the future situation in the south atlantic <e> <s> i should like to make two points <e> <s> first as i have already indicated we are still in the situation of rehabilitating the falkland islands <e> <s> secondly we are very keen to improve our relations with the countries of latin america <e> <s> it is not a monolithic bloc <e> <s> it is encouraging that in the dispute which we have had with argentina none has broken off diplomatic relations with us and we shall be very keen to keep our good relations with the other countries in latin america <e> <s> this is a factor which must be taken account of in any consideration of the future in the south atlantic <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have information on the point which the noble lord has raised but both we and the americans are very anxious to do all we can to promote a lasting cease-fire in the lebanon <e> <s> we are very concerned about this most serious situation <e> <s> however i do not think that there was any discussion of the particular point which the noble lord raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that in the discussion of the whole future of the falkland islands such matters will be among the things which will be considered <e>", "<cs> i think it really would be appropriate now to move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has clearly read the white paper well it has indeed been identified that there are something like million forms <e> <s> this includes not only forms sent out to be filled in for particular information but of course follow-up letters as well <e> <s> it is an enormous task and departments are now making arrangements to review all their forms to see which ones can be dropped and to give priority to those forms which have the widest distribution and are the most important <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear it might be replaced by another even if it was a simpler one <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree with the noble lord lord bruce that it is the complexity of some legislation which makes the design of forms most difficult but the house may like to know that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be happy to send the noble and learned lord one of the forms <e>", "<cs> my lords in fact we are consulting businesses on the type of form and depending on the particular business and the particular form we would of course consult appropriate representatives of that business in order to obtain their advice on the form in regard to both its intelligibility and its ease of completion <e>", "<cs> a very great deal my lords <e> <s> from to there have been departmental scrutinies and three large service-wide reviews <e> <s> last year we published a white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords potential savings of around million a year and million once-and <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend in his question is referring to what we are doing on succession planning i should like to say that the new arrangements that have been made should ensure that those who are going to the top of the civil service get experience of managing both people and money and i believe that within the civil service we are fortunate in having very many very able people indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend is referring to applicants for administrative trainees this year i think i am right in saying we are taking in about administrative trainees and indeed we may not be able to fill all the posts <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble and learned lord will appreciate the government are still considering their response to this important report <e> <s> it is another question but i hope that at an appropriate moment the noble and learned lord will put down a question on that subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to assure the noble lord that it is the intention of the government that the number of accountants in the civil service will be doubled over the next years <e> <s> we are <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are spending a very long time on this question too <e> <s> we have been on it for just over seven minutes and i think we ought to move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords we have now spent minutes on this question and i think it would be the wish of the house to move on to the next <e>", "<cs> my lords we have now spent minutes on questions <e> <s> will the noble lord lord winstanley ask just a short question <e>", "<cs> my lords may i suggest that we now take the question of the noble lord lord annan who has been trying to get in for a long time and that we then move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and the noble lord lord gladwyn for the way that they have received the statement <e> <s> with regard to the two questions that the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones asked me i would say that i think it is not wise to comment on newspaper reports that have appeared on this case <e> <s> but i should like to say that if any former employee has specific evidence of inadequate security he should of course draw it to the attention of gchq <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to assure the whole house that the government are in no way complacent about security matters <e> <s> indeed it is only last may that the white paper on the security commission was published and the government have accepted all its recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this is a matter upon which i would not wish to comment at all at this stage <e> <s> i think that what is important is that we have recently had the white paper on the security commission <e> <s> other matters and other publications by private individuals or indeed programmes from the bbc are not matters on which i should like to comment at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should confirm that no county council has declined to carry out its minimum statutory duties those are the duties as prescribed by planning regulations made under the civil defence act <e> <s> my right honourable friend the home secretary has said recently that he is considering urgently whether there is a need to amend those regulations <e> <s> but i accept the point of my noble friend that we would wish that all county councils would do as much as the best are doing <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> no one can predict what might happen but we believe that in a war there would be many millions of survivors <e> <s> there would certainly be more survivors if both government and individuals took sensible precautions <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i thank my noble friend for that question <e> <s> it would of course be used in a conventional war should there be such an occurrence as well as in civil emergencies <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the first part of the noble lords question in no way invalidates what i have already said about the need to take sensible precautions <e> <s> of course the government are committed along with all other western nations to try to get multilateral disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords civil defence is a matter of emergency planning <e> <s> such planning involves being prepared to deal with the effects of major emergencies accidents and natural disasters in peace and war <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i would agree with what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> in peacetime certainly voluntary organisations participate in training exercises and to some extent in planning in civil defence <e> <s> this applies particularly to volunteer scientific advisers and members of the royal observer corps <e> <s> established organisations such as the british red cross the st john ambulance brigade and the womens royal voluntary service have all made valuable contributions to civil defence planning and training in their areas and i would like to pay tribute to all the work they do <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that not only this question and answer session but the debate initiated by my noble friend a short time ago on civil defence will help to draw to the attention of the country the importance of civil defence <e> <s> i think that it is a matter of responsibility for all of us in public life to try to explain to people the value of civil defence and the good effects of taking sensible precautions both by the government and by individuals <e>", "<cs> my lords the metaphor of my noble friend may not have been exact <e> <s> however i really do think that if we are talking about a serious subject there is a lot to be said for encouraging individual responsibility in matters of civil defence precautions as in other matters <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the whole house will be most encouraged to hear what the noble lord the leader of the opposition has said on this matter and i hope that he will bring his great influence to bear on some of the labour-controlled local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i recognise that we are discussing a question that is of great interest to your lordships but i think that it would be the wish of everyone that we should move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that your lordships very much want to know what is in the statement which will be given by way of a written answer tomorrow <e> <s> as has already been indicated the house does not rise until tuesday and there will of course be other opportunities to pursue the matter <e> <s> may i suggest that we take one more supplementary question and then move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords as the house knows it is quite common practice to have statements by way of written answer <e> <s> i have used this means myself already in the course of the last year and i think all ministers do at some stage or another <e> <s> it is really a decision which would usually rest with the minister responsible for the department <e> <s> it is a matter i recognise about which the house feels very strongly indeed and we all know of the noble baronesss interest in this matter <e> <s> i will of course reflect on what has been said in your lordships house today but i hope that both the noble baroness and the house will feel that my noble friend in giving the reply that he did today has actually followed what is quite normal practice <e> <s> the house will have an opportunity when the statement is published tomorrow to see what it is that the government have in mind on this particular matter and i hope noble lords will feel that that is not in any sense an unusual procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords we all recognise the great interest the noble and learned lord lord gardiner has in this bill but if he looks at the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble and learned lord once again <e> <s> i recognise that he has been in the house longer than i have and i also recognise that this is a very unusual matter that we are discussing <e> <s> but if i may draw his attention to the <e>", "<cs> my lords now that we have heard the point which the noble and learned lord is making <e> <s> i understand that this is a matter which is coming up on one of the amendments and i think it is not a general point to be raised on each single issue <e> <s> it is a matter which we shall have a chance of discussing and that would be the time to do it <e> <s> alternatively it seems to me that the point could be raised on the question that the bill do now pass <e> <s> in either case he would have an opportunity to raise it at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i saw that the noble lord lord brockway had given way to the noble viscount <e> <s> but there was quite a long pause before the next question was called and i really think that it would be right to move on to it now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in the hands of the house <e> <s> i am not a speaker of the house and i try to interpret as best i can the wishes of the house <e> <s> we have had many discussions about the length of question time and there are many opportunities to put down questions in this house far greater opportunities i believe than there are in another place <e> <s> but as was agreed yesterday it was agreed when i spoke and when the noble baroness lady llewelyn-davies spoke it is very necessary for the house to regulate itself and keep itself in order and i really think that we should move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to detain the house long at this time this evening <e> <s> the purpose of the duchy of cornwall management bill is to make certain alterations to the existing statutory constitution of the duchy in order to bring the powers of management into line with modern conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the speech of the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos <e> <s> i think that we are in entire agreement about the principles of the bill and i am grateful to him for the way in which he has framed his remarks and for what he has said about the bill generally <e> <s> i am sure that we are all agreed that the bill is important because it does permit of the possibility for the duchy to bring its estate management up to date and so to bring about all the things which we would all like to see which must be in the best interests of the estate of his royal highness the prince of wales and of course all those who live and work on the estate <e> <s> so i thank the noble lord very much for his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to confirm both to the noble lord lord wells-pestell and to the house what my right honourable friend the prime minister and my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services said last week that the government have no plans to change the present system of financing the national health service that it remains as it is that it is safe in our hands and that it will be financed as now largely from taxation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have of course seen the opinion poll to which the noble lord lord harris of high cross refers and i should like to confirm that we as a government welcome the growth in private health insurance <e> <s> but there is no contradictiion between that statement and our support of the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that it is not necessary for me to refer the noble baroness to the words of her right honourable friend in another place the then prime minister who said on nd january <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord lord wallace of coslany that no government like to see confidential documents leaked <e> <s> on the noble lords second point i should like him to accept my word and that of my right honourable friend the prime minister and as i have said my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services that the national health service will continue as now to be largely financed out of taxation <e>", "<cs> my lords the record of this government speaks for itself <e> <s> spending on the national health service has grown each year in real terms under this government <e> <s> we now employ thousands more doctors and nurses in the national health service than under the former government and there is no suggestion that we will do other than stand by the statements we have already made about the future of the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords the government certainly do not accept that leaks are to the advantage of good government at all <e> <s> at the same time i would like to make quite clear that our policy on open government has been to make publicly available as much as possible <e> <s> indeed the whole development of the select committee system in another place has been proof of this and we have taken the opportunity to publish a great deal of information not previously <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to thank the noble lord lord annan for that question which i consider to be a very constructive contribution to this discussion and it does represent the governments thinking on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am sure the noble lord lord kaldor knows well discussions of economic problems facing this country have continued for a very long time and no doubt will continue long into the future <e> <s> this discussion proceeds in a great many ways <e> <s> for example my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer discusssed these problems in his weekend world interview last sunday <e> <s> but no decision has been taken about the publication of any further documents <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords we are participating fully in the current round of diplomacy <e> <s> on lebanon we are working for the withdrawal of all foreign forces which is an essential step in the restoration of the lebanese governments authority <e> <s> recent developments on the arab/israel problem particularly president reagans initiative which brings united states and european positions closer together offer an important opportunity to make progress <e> <s> we shall continue to urge all the parties concerned to respond as constructively as they can <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the first part of that supplementary question i share my noble friends hope that progress in bringing the two parties together in the middle east will be possible and i assure him that we shall be working to keep up the momentum <e> <s> we share the objective of president reagans initiative but the fact is that our policies are identical and we believe that an independent european community role can make a useful contribution to efforts to bring the parties together to negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer to the noble baroness is that we recognise that the israelis have instituted an inquiry into what happened in beirut <e> <s> we believe as a government that the best chance for peace in the middle east is to continue to work for the implementation of the proposals by president reagan <e>", "<cs> my lords the british government have of course condemned what happened in beirut which we feel was an appalling affair and i would like to confirm that we have given to aid victims of the conflict <e> <s> this is being channelled through the international red cross the lebanese red cross oxfam and other relief organisations <e> <s> we have also contributed million through the european community to a red cross appeal as well as a further million as food aid to the united nations relief and works agency <e>", "<cs> we recognise my lords that part of the proposals that have been put by president reagan depend on both an acceptance of israels right to exist as well as the other proposals of israeli withdrawal from occupied territories <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mayhew asked a question in somewhat similar terms to that of my noble friend lord chelwood in one of his supplementaries <e> <s> i do not think i could at this stage go any further than the answer i gave to the original supplementary <e>", "<cs> my lords it is important that both sides to this dispute should realise that we very much support president reagans initiative and we have given support to his proposals <e> <s> it is another matter whether or not we should intervene to send forces into beirut and for the reasons i gave earlier we have not been asked to do so and it is not really a practicable proposition <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should take the supplementary question of the noble lord lord gladwyn and then we might move on to the next business <e>", "<cs> my lords we consistently support the withdrawal of all foreign forces from the lebanon and in the meantime the peace-keeping troops that are in beirut will remain where they are <e> <s> the united nations forces in unifil will remain in the lebanon as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i have it in command from her majesty the queen and his royal highness the prince of wales to acquaint the house that they having been informed of the purport of the duchy of cornwall management bill have consented to place their prerogative and interests so far as they are concerned on behalf of the crown and the duchy of cornwall at the disposal of parliament for the purposes of the bill <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the lord aberdare be nominated to take the chair in all committees for this session <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the baroness llewelyn-davies of hastoe be appointed principal deputy chairman of committees for this session <e>", "<cs> at the general election three years ago the conservative party set out clearly the aims and purposes which it would pursue in government <e> <s> we spoke then of our determination to bring to an end the long decline which our country had suffered at home and abroad in both material and moral terms <e> <s> attitudes particularly and values had to be reappraised and reshaped not just on the factory floor and in the boardroom but in the home and in school <e> <s> our economic policy plays a very large part in providing a basis for recovery <e> <s> but the fresh spirit of endeavour responsibility and initiative that this policy is designed to encourage is by no means limited to that one department of our domestic affairs <e> <s> it forms a common thread running through all our policies at home <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both the noble lord lord cledwyn and the noble lord lord wigoder for their response to this very serious statement <e> <s> in answer to both noble lords who are naturally as are all noble lords very concerned about the positive vetting process i would say that this is a matter on which we shall have to await the advice of the security commission in the light of its investigation <e> <s> that answers the various detailed points that the noble lord lord wigoder put to me about looking to see whether the procedures are adequate or whether they need improvement <e> <s> the commission has already considered the positive vetting process in the course of its review of security procedures last year and it made a number of recommendations which have been put into effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point of the question of the noble lord lord shinwell when he says it is not just a question of the procedures for positive vetting but whether the procedures are adequately followed through <e> <s> i think this is the sort of issue which the security commission will look at because it is clearly necessary to follow up what are quite naturally very real anxieties not only in this house but outside that there is something further which could or should have been done <e> <s> it is very necessary that all the procedures should be thoroughly looked at and this is what the terms of reference will enable the security commission to do <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lord lord beloff is yes <e> <s> this is the kind of issue which can be and i have no doubt will be looked at by the security commission <e> <s> it has been raised obviously not only by my learned friend in his statement but also in other reports that we have had <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not in any way attempted to minimise the seriousness of this statement or of what has happened <e> <s> i think that view is shared by all my colleagues in government <e> <s> in answer to the question put by the noble lord lord harris about our relationship with the united states the americans do not regard this speech as catastrophic <e> <s> they in common with most other democratic countries have had their own security problems in the past and i have no doubt that the present close co-operation in intelligence and security matters will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i have of course noted very carefully what the noble lord lord hankey has said on these matters <e> <s> clearly the terms of reference have been drawn in order that the circumstances arising out of the conviction of prime will be fully investigated <e> <s> if it is possible to improve the circumstances there it will be found that it will make it more difficult for others to find out security material but i think it is very important in the first instance that we should look at the security system and at how the particular circumstances in which prime was able to reveal this information arose so that we can deal with them <e> <s> then the other matters would follow <e> <s> the answer to the noble lord would be that we would not enlarge the terms of reference <e> <s> i am sure that the commission will note the questions which have been asked following this statement in your lordships house and i am sure they will bear in mind what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can say anything further to the noble baroness lady gaitskell than i said in my answer to the original question about the whole process of positive vetting <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed the behaviour of mrs prime has been very commendable <e> <s> i have no doubt that she has been through a very difficult and upsetting time <e> <s> i will certainly note the points that he has made and will pass them on <e>", "<cs> my lords on the point about primes visits abroad his visits to his russian controller while he was employed in gchq all seem to have been to vienna and the fact is that vienna is not behind the iron curtain <e> <s> however i have no doubt that it is something which will be examined by the commission <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i am sure that we have all noted that important point raised by the noble lord lord greenhill and it is something which not only we should note but which i am sure the security commission will recognise <e>", "<cs> i hope so <e>", "<cs> my lords i have seen a press report of what is stated to be the views of the outgoing president of the assistant masters and mistresses association <e> <s> i would say to the noble lord lord hatch that any contentious area of the curriculum must always be taught in an accurate and balanced way and that in our devolved system of education it is to local education authorities and to head teachers that the decisions fall as to how the time of the curriculum is used <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree with much of what my noble friend lord beloff has said <e> <s> i think the most important thing is that the valuable time that children spend in schools should be used so that they are well educated and therefore able to get jobs in future life <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord beswick for his intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the national union of teachers suggested to the foreign office ministers that there was a need in the schools for balanced factual information about disarmament and after giving notice to the local education authorities the foreign office has distributed just such material linking it to the recent united nations special session on disarmament so that both sides of the case are put <e>", "<cs> my lords there are schools where political studies are taught and i have no doubt there are many instances in the teaching of history geography and english where political matters are raised <e> <s> what is important in all this is that children should not be used by adults in this matter and should not be subject to any form of indoctrination <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is an important point <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole question of peace and disarmament is a delicate sensitive issue <e> <s> many children are far too young to understand it to make any reasonable comment about these matters at all <e> <s> a tremendous responsibility therefore rests with adults in the teaching profession and others who subject them to indoctrination and that is a responsibility not only to the children but to the country <e>", "<cs> i am sure that what the noble lord lord alexander says about the act may be true my lords but there is no doubt that political studies take place in some schools and come up in other subjects of the curriculum <e>", "<cs> my lords in our devolved system of education what is said by leading members of the educational world is naturally of interest <e> <s> however as the noble lord lord hatch put down an almost identical question last july i hope he will feel after this question that it is not necessary to table another one on the same subject for a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords everybody in this country is concerned about the issues of war and peace but on the question of the school curriculum i have nothing further to add to the answers i have already given to other noble lords <e> <s> perhaps i might suggest that now that we have spent nine minutes on this question it would be an appropriate time to move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords we have spent a very long time on this question and i think it is the wish of the house as supplementary questions have been taken from all parts that we should now move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord hatch has another question to ask he would have an opportunity to put down another question on the order paper on a future occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased to speak for the government this afternoon immediately after the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> i have to apologise to the house at the outset because as i have already explained to the noble baroness i am commanded to be elsewhere later this evening

is in the name of my noble friend lord orr-ewing will be a successful one <e> <s> if however the list of speakers grows substantially before next tuesday i am sure that my noble friends and the usual channels will consider the matter <e> <s> in the meantime in the light of what i have said i suggest that it would be sensible to agree to this motion <e>", "<cs> my lords there is to be no change in the act <e> <s> the children in fact will remain in school though they will take courses possibly in colleges of further education and the powers used will be those of section and section of the employment and training act <e> <s> the government felt it was important to go ahead with the scheme in and i am glad to confirm that the secretary of state for education and science the secretary of state for wales and the chairman of the manpower services commission have met representatives of the local education authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to have that response from the noble lord lord byers <e> <s> it was of course a point that was raised in a recent debate in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness is aware the proposal is for pilot schemes <e> <s> these are to be set up in consultation with local education authorities the details of which have still to be worked out <e> <s> i confirm what the noble baroness said that it is intended that they will lead to specific qualifications such as the craft and technician awards of the cgli and the general and national certificates and diplomas of the business and technical education councils <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to confirm that a national steering group is being set up on which educational interests will be well represented and this organisation will agree guidelines and criteria for submission of bids on this scheme <e> <s> the chairman and director of the manpower services commission in consultation with the des will be having further discussions with the various parties concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to hear what the noble lord has said <e> <s> we believe that this is an important new initiative and the response of the local education authorities has been encouraging <e> <s> some authorities have already expressed interest in it so in fact it looks as though the scheme will be oversubscribed <e>", "<cs> my lords there was nothing wrong with the question which the noble lord lord jenkins asked <e> <s> he was completely entitled to ask it <e> <s> other noble lords may ask questions of a contrary view <e> <s> it is all part of question time in your lordships house <e> <s> i think it would now be the wish of the house that we take the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank both noble lords lord cledwyn and lord banks for their response to this important statement <e> <s> both raised the question of the economy and attached particular importance to what the statement said about the problem of unemployment and training <e> <s> one of the conclusions of the summit conference was the concern expressed about the depth and length of the recession and the difficulty of finding enough lasting jobs particularly for young people <e> <s> it was important that there was a welcome degree of agreement that the only way to tackle these problems is to get inflation and interest rates down and in addition a sensible package of measures to ease the social and economic difficulties which this structural adjustment is causing and both noble lords commented on the fact that training measures are proposed <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord lord kennet my lords that the statement covers a great many issues but when heads of state meet together it is an opportunity to review policies on a great number of important and urgent matters which are concerning the world <e> <s> i would have hoped that having read the statement he would have agreed that it has a number of very positive things to say on the economy where most countries are now accepting a need for more restrained economic policies <e> <s> it suggests i think accurately that relations with the united states are better it describes the problems of trade with japan and the far east and it has something positive to say about the common fisheries policy <e> <s> i accept as the noble lord said that these are all very big issues and that each one would be the subject of a major debate <e> <s> nevertheless it is encouraging that these issues should be discussed in europe and that we can in that forum play a major part in the outcome of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can go further than what i have said in the statement <e> <s> we hope the danish government will indicate at the next fisheries council which will take place on st december their acceptance of the package of measures <e> <s> if not and one does not wish to pursue this further the nine would then expect to decide on national measures in consultation with the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given the reason which was well expressed by my right honourable friend the prime minister at her press conference following the european summit <e> <s> she has said and she confirmed that she does not feel it would be right to receive representatives of an organisation which has not denounced terrorism <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that supplementary question <e> <s> it is true to say that the countries of europe are coming increasingly to recognise that there is no easy way out of the recession for any country and that many of the policies which we in this country have been pursuing over the past few years are indeed policies that they too will have to pursue <e> <s> i think it is encouraging that there is this measure of agreement <e> <s> as i understand it the whole question of joining the ems was not one that was discussed in copenhagen <e> <s> but i believe that arising from the statement and the results of the conference there are areas where there has been a positive move on co-operation and that must be good <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord taylor for that question <e> <s> i think that that is another piece of good news that is included in the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i did in fact read the exchange between the noble lord lord hatch of lusby and myself at question time a short while ago <e> <s> i do not in any way retract anything that i said about indoctrination in schools because i and i believe all noble lords believe that sensitive subjects must be presented in a balanced way for children in schools <e> <s> on the question of peace studies i have taken the <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness lady david knows well political studies take place in many schools <e> <s> many issues such as the issues of war and peace form part of history or geography teaching possibly or even of english <e> <s> provided that they are taught in a balanced way this is quite a proper part of the school curriculum <e> <s> what we were discussing earlier was a different issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that is a question of which i would require quite long notice <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord is <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is the subject of another question <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many occasions under the school curriculum when pupils have to solve problems and study them <e> <s> i have no doubt that in the course of some history and english lessons they look at the issues of war and peace <e> <s> may i say that the noble lord is quite wrong about what has happened with regard to material sent from the foreign office <e> <s> what happened was that the national union of teachers suggested to foreign office ministers that there was a need in schools for balanced factual material about disarmament <e> <s> after giving notice to the local education authorities the foreign office distributed such material linking it to the recent united nations special session on disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had nineteen minutes on two questions <e> <s> i think it would be the wish of the house that we should move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be helpful if i say this to the noble lord lord hatch <e> <s> he prefaced his first supplementary question by saying that i had refused him a question before <e> <s> that was not the case it is not in my power to refuse him a question <e> <s> when i suggest that we move on i hope he will understand that i am trying to take into account the wishes of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to have to speak to the noble lord again <e> <s> i am most grateful for the support of the noble lord the leader of the opposition and i am sure that both he and noble lords feel that we should move to the next question now <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both the noble lord lord cledwyn and the noble viscount lord thurso for their response to this statement <e> <s> i should also like to add my own thanks to those expressed to the noble lord lord shackleton for his report which the government have found most valuable <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first of the three questions that the noble lord lord kennet has asked me so far as the falkland islands company is concerned we believe that it can play a valuable role in the agriculture and trade of the islands and in their economic diversification and development <e> <s> i believe it has been acknowledged that the falkland islands company has indeed a somewhat better investment record in the recent past than other companies in the islands <e> <s> in they sold the farm at green patch to the government for the purpose of sub-division into six smaller units and have agreed to give up their basic banking services to the standard chartered bank <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the second question that the noble lord lord stewart put to me is that of course this would be a matter for the usual channels <e> <s> however i am sure that they will have noted the point that has been made and i shall certainly pass it on <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to reiterate that anything i have said in trying to answer questions this afternoon and in the statement has been designed to indicate that it is the governments wish to preserve the way of life of the islanders as far as possible and that we believe that the mainstay of this will continue to be sheep ranching but that the programme will also allow new sectors to be developed including the possibility at some future time of tourism <e> <s> any remarks that my right honourable friend the secretary of state may have made about the islands and defence should not in any way be taken as running contrary to the commitment that we have to do our best to make the islands economically viable in their traditional way and in other ways that may be developed <e>", "<cs> my lords at present we are not conducting negotiations with argentina for reasons of which the noble viscount lord montgomery will be aware but of course we hope that our relations with other countries of south america will continue to improve and that they will come to understand our position over the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be right for me to write to the noble lord on that point but as i understand it it would be quite difficult at the moment when the airport is in the condition that it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i think your lordships will see that the full costs of defence expenditure and in particular of the matter which will be covered by this extra experience will be set out when the government publish their proposals <e> <s> furthermore i can provide the figures but i shall ask my noble friend lord belstead to do so when he comes to wind up <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house <e> <s> i should like to repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both the noble lord lord cledwyn and the noble lord lord gladwyn for what they have said about this statement and particularly to reiterate what we have said about our appreciation of the work of the noble lord lord franks and his committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot go any further than i have already indicated of which i think all members of your lordships house are aware that copies of the report have been available to members of your lordships house this afternoon <e> <s> i would not wish to comment on press comments at the weekend or indeed at any time leading up to the publication of this report <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord diamond for what he has said and i think that he has made some very important general comments on the report <e> <s> i should like to emphasise to the house that the government set up the inquiry on the terms of reference which of course were agreed with the opposition parties and which include the background to the particular dispute <e> <s> i should also like to emphasise that it is a unanimous report and i am quite certain that my right honourable friend the prime minister who has had such great responsibilities over this whole crisis and borne them so well must feel a great sense of satisfaction with the conclusion as it is set out in paragraph which is quoted in full in the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall of course read the report of the statement and the questions and discussion which have taken place upon it but i think it would be completely inappropriate to comment on leaks or comments which have appeared in the press at any time because i do not think that this is in any sense relevant to the debate which must take place in the proper forum which is parliament when everyone has had time to study the report itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this is one of those occasions when you are getting very good value for money <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i rise as the leader of the house to say that i agree with my noble friend lord nugent of guildford that the question which stands in the name of the noble lord lord jenkins of putney does breach the spirit of the standing order and the guidance in the <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not the committee stage of a bill if i may put it like that <e> <s> i hope very much that my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls will feel able to withdraw his proposal <e> <s> we have already taken up minutes of the afternoon on a very busy day <e> <s> i think i am representing the views of the house when i say that there is a concern about the question <e> <s> in order that this might be properly decided i think that it should go to the procedure committee <e> <s> it seems to me that that is the wish of the house <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have taken steps to strengthen their graduate liaison arrangements to publicise the competition more widely and to accelerate the selection process and they are considering other ways of ensuring an adequate flow of top quality administration trainee entrants <e>", "<cs> my lords we are of course glad to receive suggestions but i can tell my noble friend that the universities are visited in order to describe what is required by the civil service and to attract some of the most able graduates <e> <s> as my noble friend will doubtless know we have asked sir alec atkinson to review the procedures for selecting fast-stream graduate entrants <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm both points <e> <s> recruits are looked for in all universities and institutions of higher education <e> <s> at the same time serving civil servants also have an opportunity to advance to the highest posts so advancement to the highest posts comes not only as a result of recruitment through the administration trainee scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that even the noble lord lord plant will accept that pay negotiations are wide of the question concerned <e> <s> i should like to confirm to him that we do recognise that in a contracting service there may be some who feel that promotion opportunities are not as great as they once were and that this might be one of the causes for the shortfall in recruitment numbers <e> <s> i should like to take this opportunity of saying that i and my colleagues very much appreciate how fortunate we are in the very high calibre of the british civil service and the impartiality with which it does its work <e>", "<cs> my lords there is some evidence that industrialists as well as those looking for recruits <e>", "<cs> my lords before turning to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already said a great deal about the numbers who are going into higher education <e> <s> the noble lord lord glenamara is too old a hand in politics to expect me to be drawn into <e>", "<cs> if the country is taking that great an interest in this exchange of questions on the subject my lords it will realise that it is very dangerous to answer such very generalised questions on the spur of the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a wide-ranging and immensely valuable debate on a matter of great importance to the country as a whole <e> <s> it has been primarily concerned with the past the causes of and the build-up to the invasion last april of british territory and with the determined successful but costly action undertaken for its recovery <e> <s> it is absolutely right that these events should be the subject of exhaustive examination and of the widest possible debate <e> <s> many of your lordships tonight have looked towards the future and that too is right and welcome <e> <s> this house today paid warm tribute to the noble lord lord franks and his right honourable colleagues for the admirable thoroughness and clarity of the report which they produced <e> <s> i should like once more to report the governments recognition of what particularly in view of the complexity of the issues and volume of material and the relatively short time available has been an impressive achievement and a model of its kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree it was in the letter from the ambassador in buenos aires <e> <s> if i might return to the policy options in they were essentially those available to successive governments during periods of either greater or lesser tension negotiation or confrontation <e> <s> the government could have concluded that negotiations were useless and by reinforcing the islands have brought the dialogue to an end <e> <s> we could deliberately have incurred the costs and penalties of what is described as a fortress falklands policy <e> <s> but would it have been right to do so or in the interests of britain or the islanders <e> <s> we could have chosen to disregard the wishes of the islanders and to impose on them whatever solution was agreed with argentina <e> <s> that was not a course which this <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation is as i have described it and it is i believe as set out in the report of the franks committee <e> <s> i do not think there is any discrepancy between those two descriptions and i do not think that it is a valuable contribution at this late hour to go back once again on to further hypotheses <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not said that someone in this house had made that particular point <e> <s> but it has been suggested that there was a signal to the argentines that we were no longer prepared to defend the islands or to have a presence in the south atlantic and i was clearing that point <e> <s> in fact as we know the ship was not withdrawn but there has been discussion of the effect that this matter had on the argentine junta <e> <s> as i have indicated it was indeed a matter of judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend that he did table his question before the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord shinwell is quite right in saying that we do not have a speaker in this house but he has been a member long enough to know that it is the house itself which regulates these matters <e> <s> it is the duty of every member of the house to look at the <e>", "<cs> it is true my lords that we have in this house as in another place the opportunity to put down questions for written answer and i notice that noble lords make great use of that facility which i believe is of great benefit <e> <s> but there are matters which should quite properly be asked by means of starred questions <e> <s> indeed it is as i have indicated a matter of <e>", "<cs> i think that is often true of politicians my lords but there are some members of your lordships house who put a special self-denying ordinance on themselves not to ask those sort of questions and others who genuinely seek information <e>", "<cs> my lords i have noted the point my noble friend has made and will confirm that it is discouraging to ministers winding up debates to find that although they have prepared an answer to a point which has been raised in the course of the debate the noble lord who raised the point is not present in the chamber <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords will have noted what my noble friend has said on this point <e> <s> but at the end of the day one must remember that this is a self-regulatory chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords it is precisely because my noble friend lord derwent is aware of the fact that sometimes at the end of a debate very few members are in the house and this is discourteous to both the noble lord who introduced the debate as well as the minister who is responding that he put down this question <e> <s> to have debates regularly spilling over into two days would be a very time-consuming business and i do not believe that any government of any complexion would wish to encourage that habit <e> <s> there are occasions when this is necessary but not i think as a general practice <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord wells-pestell for giving me notice of that question <e> <s> it is of course another question and he will be glad to know that the noble lord <e> <s> lord airedale has made precisely that point in a question put down for th february <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with my noble friend that it is discourteous if knowing that they have an engagement peers still put their name down to speak <e> <s> but one must accept that there will always be exceptional cases <e> <s> noble lords are busy people who have many commitments outside the house many entered into a long time prior to the notice of the debate being given <e> <s> so although i agree that there can always be exceptions i hope very much that the fact that this point has been raised will draw the attention of noble lords to this matter and that they will consider it on future occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend lord orr-ewing for that question <e> <s> i am sure that he regularly reads the <e>", "<cs> no my lords i hope that i made it absolutely clear that there will always be occasions and exceptions to the rule on noble lords being able to stay until the end of a debate because there are some particular circumstances <e> <s> the important thing is that noble lords should not make a habit of leaving before the end of a debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house will have noted the important point raised by the noble lord lord hooson <e> <s> once again we have to remember that ours is a self-regulatory chamber and that does imply a responsibility on each and every member of your lordships house to consider the length of a speech and whether or not the remarks he wishes to make can be made in some shorter form rather than making a very long speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that is one of the exceptions to which i have already referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> before proceeding further on a measure of particular significance in wales <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships house would wish me to pay tribute to mr michael roberts the under-secretary of state for wales who was so sadly taken ill in another place last thursday and died later <e> <s> i grew to know him very well when i was at the department of education and science and was only too well aware of how much good work he did not only for wales as a whole but for education in particular <e> <s> he was a notable minister and he will be sorely missed <e> <s> he had taken the conwy tunnel bill through all its stages in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the warm welcome the bill has received in all parts of the house <e> <s> indeed it is unusual to note such unanimity of opinion and i am pleased that there should have been this response <e> <s> although i am not so familiar with the <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is always a danger but as always in your lordships house it is a matter for each individual peer to do as he thinks right <e> <s> i felt it right to quote in full what the <e>", "<cs> my lords of course there is nothing to prevent any noble lord doing exactly as my noble friend has suggested and there may indeed be a great many special reasons why subsequent speakers wish to congratulate a maiden speaker <e> <s> but what is important is that it should not be regarded as a discourtesy if a subsequent peer does not make these remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that precisely the same kind of considerations would apply in that case <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that i speak for all my noble friends when i say that we have greatly welcomed the speech of my noble friend lord carrington who has introduced a subject of the utmost importance to this nation and indeed to all nations <e> <s> we have been greatly encouraged by what he has said <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the treasury and bank of england have agreed to ensure that communication between them must never again break down in the way described in the report and in particular it has been agreed that communication on questions where public funds are potentially or actually at risk should be in writing or if initially made in discussion subsequently confirmed in writing <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to take this opportunity to thank the members of the tribunal for their very comprehensive and thorough report and to confirm what i said in my original answer that the government have accepted the conclusions of the committees report <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that what i said in my very full original answer which i gave in considerable detail in view of the interest which has been expressed in your lordships house will have been enough to satisfy the noble lord lord cledwyn that the government have taken all effective steps to try to prevent such an occurrence as the tribunal of inquiry has elicited <e> <s> naturally we all hope that there will not be such an occurrence at a future date <e> <s> it would be quite wrong of anybody to say that it could never occur but certainly we believe that in the particular circumstances surrounding the crown agents we have taken all the reasonable steps that we can <e>", "<cs> not so far as i am aware my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not myself listen to any part of the tribunals proceedings and while i cannot speak for any other member of your lordships house i am sure that nonetheless it is valuable that they should have been held in public and that it should have been possible for people to attend had they wished to do so <e> <s> to answer the second part of the noble lords supplementary i recognise as do my colleagues that the tribunal took a very long time and i wish to repeat the governments gratitude to the members of the tribunal for their very thorough report and the time they gave up to it <e>", "<cs> my lords the timetable has always been quite clear <e> <s> the consultation paper setting out the new regulations was issued early in october and on rd december the draft of the general regulations became available and comments were asked for by st january <e> <s> these comments are still being considered and ministers agreed to receive deputations from the local authority associations about the regulations <e> <s> i hope that it will not be too long before the regulations themselves can be laid <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the purposes of the regulations will be to increase grant aid from per <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it is difficult for anybody in your lordships house to speculate on what areas might or might not be subject to some future emergency <e> <s> what is important is that every area of great britain should have plans for civil defence and the new regulations will build on those plans <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i am sure that the highlands are not only vulnerable but are also important <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and i hope that the noble lord lord paget of northampton will pass on that view to some of his colleagues <e> <s> the government hope very much that local authorities will implement the regulations it will be very unfortunate indeed if any of them are thought to be breaking the law <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that the security commission takes note of this question and what lies behind it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to confirm that the government cannot and would not wish to interfere with the internal affairs of independent trade unions <e> <s> but where those officials are identified as having communist views then the procedures which i have identified will apply <e>", "<cs> my lords one must draw a distinction between civil servants who are thought to hold communist views <e> <s> no one who is thought to hold communist views or indeed to be a member of a fascist organisation would be employed on work that is vital to the security of the state <e> <s> in the case of the official of a union the procedures identified and which were proposed by the radcliffe committee and accepted by the government will come into play <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first question asked by the noble lord lord molloy is that <e>", "<cs> my lords when we come to read <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady wootton of abinger is quite right on a narrow definition of the question but i thought it was appropriate in these circumstances to make clear that there is a distinction between those who are officials of a trade union and other civil servants <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number both of gce and cse boards <e> <s> the object of this exercise is that national criteria will be agreed <e> <s> on each new regional examining board there will be representatives both of the gce and cse boards <e> <s> the object of this exercise is to agree national criteria which will help to eliminate variations of syllabuses from one board to another where those exist <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first half of the noble baronesss question i can confirm that so far proposals for subjects have been submitted to the secretaries of state <e> <s> this is on the subject of national <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> my noble friend makes a very important point <e> <s> one of the objectives of course of the national criteria is to eliminate some of the differences in the syllabuses as they occur today <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a separate point and if the noble lord would care to put down a question on it i would be glad to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords to the best of my knowledge there is no restriction on the age at which a child can take the examination <e> <s> it would of course depend on the child following the complete course before sitting the examination <e>", "<cs> my lords the total saving in the civil service pay bill achieved since we came to office is about billion at present prices <e> <s> there are now on-going savings in pay costs of million each year <e>", "<cs> my lords the savings have been achieved in a number of ways <e> <s> there have been savings by what is called natural wastage and there have been savings by privatisation including contracting out and hiving off <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the precise breakdown of figures between the industrial and non-industrial civil servants but i can tell the noble lord lord shackleton that an overall total was agreed at the beginning of the lifetime of this government and each department has contributed towards it <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly see whether i can let the noble lord have it <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been real savings in the civil service and they have been achieved by civil servants <e> <s> indeed it is a very great achievement on their part and one which the government acknowledge <e> <s> of course there are arguments in favour of the simplification of legislation and i take the point made by the noble viscount on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to assure the noble lord lord rochester that there has been considerable flexibility within the overall target and the number of civil servants in both the department of employment and the department of health and social security has in fact increased <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already indicated in answer to a previous question the government are the first to acknowledge that the reduction in numbers in the civil service has been brought about by civil servants themselves and that they have in fact been willing for the publication of the scrutinies many of which have shown up areas where savings can be made <e> <s> all this has been open to public inspection <e> <s> it is a tribute to their work that they have agreed both to the reductions in numbers and to this matter of open government <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to confirm the savings that have been made <e> <s> most of the savings in numbers have come about for the reasons that i have described and there have been only a very few redundancies <e>", "<cs> my lords my information is that as far as the inland revenue is concerned the number of people engaged in identifying fraud has been increased <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot do so without notice <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that where the savings have been made they have always been made in the <e>", "<cs> my lords that of course is quite another question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that to be precise the motion should probably read <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the noble lord lord brockway if i did not speak clearly enough <e> <s> i hope that he will hear my answer <e> <s> i should like to make it quite clear that the draft proposals put by the neutral and non-aligned countries have features which her majestys government welcome but as has been reported in the press it does not include western proposals concerning for example the helsinki monitoring groups the expulsion of journalists and radio jamming <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to my noble friend who has raised a point which has been of concern to many people is that we believe that if we were to abandon this process we should forgo the opportunity to draw attention to soviet and eastern european failure to fulfil their commitments undertaken at helsinki and give up the attempt to build constructively on those commitments <e>", "<cs> my lords i acknowledge that there are many outstanding very difficult cases and her majestys government acknowledge that point <e> <s> we are of course pleased at the release of the siberian seven though this of course is just a step one instance <e> <s> but that does not in any way mean that we should give up the attempts to build on an agreement that has already been signed <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we hope that there will be a settlement and as i indicated in an earlier answer to the noble lord lord brockway the draft from the neutral and non-aligned nations has indeed features which we welcome <e> <s> but the proposals which i think the west have put forward have been very much designed to strengthen the commitments of the participants in all areas that were covered by the helsinki final act and they include not only monitoring groups but trade union rights human contacts the working conditions of journalists and indeed a conference on disarmament in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have indicated our government and the western governments hope that when the conference resumes we shall reach an agreement on a substantial and balanced concluding document <e> <s> i do not think that there is anything further that i can add on those other matters at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i welcome what my noble friend has said about the attitude that her majestys government are taking over this matter <e> <s> he may like to know that the leader of the british delegation has indeed repeatedly described the plight of certain people in the soviet union for example the helsinki monitoring groups certain religious communities and people in both penal and psychiatric institutions <e> <s> he has also referred to the soviet jamming of radio broadcasts and measures to inhibit the export of books to the soviet union <e> <s> the conference has been left in no doubt about our view about all these things <e> <s> of course we cannot at this stage make guarantees about the future but one must try to work to see whether we cannot get some progress on the helsinki final act <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly take the point of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i am quite certain that a parliamentary question such as this gives an opportunity to give answers to some of the points that are of most concern and to indicate exactly where we are at this particular time <e> <s> however i shall indeed draw to the attention of my right honourable friend the foreign secretary the point that has been raised because although i understand that the foreign office does in fact publish information at regular intervals it may well be that something more could be done <e>", "<cs> my lords on that particular point we of course support the idea of the conference on disarmament <e> <s> its purpose would be to negotiate in the first phase confidence-building measures which are militarily significant politically binding verifiable and of course applicable to the whole of europe east and west <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot add anything to what i have said in my original answer and i do not believe that it would be right for me to add any further comment on leak inquiries <e>", "<cs> my lords every effort is made to keep classified information secure <e> <s> the arrangements are kept under review and changed as necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have indicated the arrangements are kept under review and it has to be remembered that in a free society a balance has to be <e>", "<cs> my lords on the point which the noble lord lord cledwyn has raised inquiries were made and the investigators reports are being studied <e> <s> but it is not the practice to disclose any of the information or the result of the investigation <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to sound unhelpful on this matter but i think it would be right for me to say that it is not the practice to disclose any information about leak investigations <e> <s> but i should like to say on the second part of the noble lords question that the unauthorised disclosure of official information is regarded as a very serious breach of the civil service code of conduct <e> <s> an offender would normally be dealt with under the civil service disciplinary procedures the penalties under which include dismissal <e> <s> my right honourable and learned friend the attorney-general or my noble and learned friend the lord advocate as appropriate would also consider whether to institute criminal proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords something positive comes out of any investigation if only an opportunity to review the procedures and to draw the attention of those involved to the importance of confidentiality and of the procedures which are adopted in the civil service <e> <s> but i really do not think it would be right for any results of inquiries to be published in this way <e> <s> as your lordships will know some of the serious matters for example the results of positive vetting are in fact being looked at now by the security commission which is a rather different issue in regard to the cases which have been referred to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it would be for me to decide at this stage what was or was not said before the budget <e> <s> i think that the question which is down on the order paper refers to other matters and i answered it as i believe was appropriate in the circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the first part of the noble lords supplementary question i should like to make it quite clear that the greater part of time off is for industrial relations duties and not in fact trade union activities <e> <s> but i should also say that the new national framework agreement provides for greater control of facility time through increased accountability for individuals time off and through provision for a review at least annually of the facility time allowances <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord brockway has made an allegation about what might be going on in civil service departments on which i would rather not comment <e> <s> the object of this particular exercise is to negotiate not only the new national framework agreement as has been agreed but also agreements within departments and this is intended to encourage both responsible activities of trade unions and responsible debate on industrial relations matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that industrial relations in the civil service are good <e> <s> the national framework agreement has been agreed <e> <s> it is now being discussed with departments <e> <s> over per cent <e> <s> of non-industrial civil servants have now reached agreements with departments and as i indicated in my original answer we expect the rest to be completed later on in the summer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that the proper manner of doing this is for the leader of the house to table a motion recording the houses appreciation of sir peter hendersons services but happily he will be with us until the house rises in the first session of the next parliament for the summer recess and that motion will not therefore be tabled until nearer the summer recess when sir peter will hand over and the new clerk will be sworn in <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be the wish of the house that the noble lord lord jenkins should ask his supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot comment without notice on that particular newspaper report <e> <s> but on the question of land holdings in the falklands i should like to make it quite clear that as was said in another place by my right honourable friend the then foreign and commonwealth secretary the government favour a gradualist approach to land redistribution under the auspices of the falkland islands development corporation <e> <s> in fact if demand for land exceeded the amount offered for sale on the open market the islands legislative council would have to reconsider the position and would be in a position to make a compulsory purchase if it were required <e>", "<cs> my lords i will look very carefully in <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord lord bishopston that i take this matter very seriously indeed <e> <s> as i have already indicated we believe in a gradualist approach to land distribution <e> <s> the civil commissioner of the falklands in his address to the islands legislative council in december explained that we considered that this was the best course <e> <s> sir rex hunt also went on to say that if the results of the questionnaire of which the noble lord lord bishopston will be aware showed that the demand for land exceeded the amount offered for sale on the open market the council would have to reconsider its position <e> <s> this statement was endorsed unanimously by the islands council <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said to the noble lord that i shall look at the point which he raised in his first supplementary question <e> <s> however i should like to confirm that the governments policy is very much in line with what was proposed in the shackleton report <e>", "<cs> my lords the first intimation that the government had of the existence of any proposals from the president of peru came in a series of conversations between the then foreign secretary mr pym and mr haig in washington on nd may <e> <s> after necessary clarification of mr haigs ideas mr pym telegraphed a report to london at just after five oclock in the afternoon washington time that is gmt <e> <s> the attack on the general belgrano took place over three hours before that <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not agree with what the noble lord lord hatch of lusby has to say <e> <s> i am quite sure that as he has studied the question so carefully he will have read with great care the statement that my right honourable friend mr pym put in a letter to the <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the case that the general belgrano was sunk for military reasons <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i am afraid i cannot accept the statement of the noble lord lord bishopston <e> <s> this ground has been gone over many times before and the facts are perfectly clearly set out <e> <s> furthermore the government see no need for an inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hatch of lusby is making the most absurd allegations <e> <s> the whole of the history of this matter has been set out in parliamentary answers both in your lordships house and in another place <e> <s> i have already given a statement of the facts this afternoon about which there can be no argument <e> <s> the fact of the matter is as i have already indicated that my right honourable friend mr pym was given no impression during his conversation with mr haig that anything approaching an agreement was at hand <e> <s> mr haig himself agreed that more time was needed for detailed work <e> <s> my right honourable friend was therefore in no position to have the ideas transmitted to london before the end of the afternoon of nd may and by that time the general belgrano had been sunk <e>", "<cs> my lords the government view with abhorrence recent reports that bahais from shiraz have been executed in iran <e> <s> the united kingdom has on many occasions made clear to the iranian government its deep concern at continuing reports of persecution of the bahais for their religious beliefs <e> <s> we are in touch with our partners in the ten to determine how best to register our strong views with the iranian authorities and what course of action might best help the considerable bahai community in iran <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot in honesty say that i recall the particular speech to which the noble lord has drawn attention <e> <s> i take note of the suggestion which the noble lord has made on this matter but i believe that it would be unwise of me to say more than that at this juncture because we wish to proceed in the best possible way to further the ends of helping the bahais but at the same time we must be very careful not to make their position more difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords there have at times been suggestions that there should be an envoy sent to investigate these matters but the view of our government is that the best way we can proceed is that which i set out in my answer to the question <e> <s> we believe that that way is in the best interests of the bahais in iran <e>", "<cs> my lords we do of course utterly condemn what has happened to the bahais and other executions in iran <e> <s> at the present time we are represented in iran by a head of mission who looks after our interests and of course there is the opportunity for him too on appropriate occasions to make protests about what is going on <e>", "<cs> my lords without notice i could not say whether that is the case but of course all the civilised world condemns what has been happening by these executions <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but your lordships may know that on st march my noble friend lord colville of culross our delegate at the commission of human rights made a statement in which he expressed his governments deep concern at reports of the continuing persecution of bahais and on rd march our delegation co-sponsored a draft resolution at the commission which urged the iranian government to respect the human rights of all individuals under its jurisdiction <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble baroness lady gaitskell has said <e> <s> the government have considered very carefully all the options open to them on this matter and we believe that the best way to help the bahais is as i have set out in the answer to the question <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will appreciate that that is another question but if he cares to put down a question on that subject i will do my best to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already indicated what has happened at the commission of human rights <e> <s> at the session of the united nations commission of human rights in march the united kingdom co-sponsored a draft resolution which urged the iranians to respect the human rights of all individuals under their jurisdiction <e> <s> the resolution also called for the united nations secretary-general to continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to confirm to the noble lord lord oram that of course the government greatly value these institutes and the work that they do <e> <s> i realise that it is disappointing to him but i regret that i am unable to give him the kind of response which he would like today because my right honourable friends the secretary of state and the minister for overseas development are still considering their reponse <e> <s> but as i have already indicated to him we shall get a response to the report as soon as is practicable and of course the sort of remarks which he has made will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i have of course read the report from another place <e> <s> as i have already indicated my right honourable friend will be making a considered response to it <e> <s> on the question of costs and efficiency again i could not comment on the details of this but as someone who has had some responsibility for the scrutinies that have been conducted throughout the whole of government i should like to confirm that as part of the governments policy for reducing the size of the civil service every single department had to take some cuts of which the scientific units were one <e> <s> the scrutinies were designed to look carefully to see how these might most sensibly and properly be achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that common sense is never apart from the governments consideration of any matter at all but on a lot of things it is very important to identify what the true costs are not what people think the costs are but what they really are <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that these departments have made a very great contribution in this country and the world and that those who have worked for them have made their contribution too <e> <s> i should like to place on record my support for those who work for them and for the civil service in general <e> <s> but that does not in any way invalidate what i have said in other comments <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will wait until he hears the considered response on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already indicated the value that we place on these institutes <e> <s> i am quite sure that my right honourable friend when he comes to respond will take into account the points that have been made in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of the exchange of american mercenary prisoners i must explain that we had no standing and no involvement in the negotiations leading to their release <e> <s> but in the light of what information was available to us it was our judgment that it was simply not feasible to have our prisoners included and that our interests would be best served by continuing the bilateral contact <e> <s> as i am sure the noble lord will appreciate all discussions of that nature that are going on have to be confidential <e>", "<cs> my lords on the matter of the prisoners conditions i would say that embassy staff visit the prisoners each month and they are able to take in food and mail <e> <s> i would draw the noble lords attention to an answer which was given in another place in november by my honourable friend mr onslow setting out in some detail the conditions of the prisoners <e> <s> although it is never agreeable to be in prison i think one can say that the prisoners have enough to eat and that their health is regarded as good <e> <s> on the point that the noble lord raised about the negotiations themselves i would point out that during his visit to london last february the angolan foreign minister said that his government were looking for an opportune moment to release the prisoners which he hoped would occur this year <e> <s> we have urged that it should be done as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the first part of the noble lords supplementary question my understanding is that yes the food and other supplies come from private contributions <e> <s> the other matters are entirely confidential and i think that to comment on them at this time would not help the prisoners nor anyone <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware of the circumstances which led these young men to be recruited as mercenaries <e> <s> we regard this as a quite deplorable practice and we have condemned it <e> <s> as i have indicated we are taking all steps we possibly can to try to see that they are released <e>", "<cs> my lords we of course voted for the united nations security council resolution no in <e> <s> we supported the joint statement issued by the european community in october marking the united nations day of solidarity with political prisoners in south africa and of course we have made the south african government fully aware of our views <e> <s> there is no doubt that mr mandelas release would be widely welcomed as evidence of the desire for reconciliation in south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord lord walston has said on this matter <e> <s> i can only repeat that of course the south african government are fully aware of our views <e>", "<cs> my lords i have noted the proposal made by the noble lord lord mishcon on this matter <e> <s> i can only reiterate to him that the government must be the judge of how best we can help mr mandelas case <e> <s> we believe that some actions could in fact be counter-productive <e> <s> i should like to confirm that we do of course condemn the punishment of people for their political beliefs and we have made this quite clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that point <e> <s> as i indicated in my first answer we supported the european community in their vote on political prisoners <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the suggestion of the noble lord lord jenkins <e> <s> as i indicated to his noble friend lord mishcon we have made plain to the south african government our views on this matter <e> <s> we have to judge carefully how we can best help mr mandela and i think that we must recognise that some proposals could well be counter-productive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord seebohm for this timely debate <e> <s> it follows soon after our debate in the last session on the brandt commissions memorandum and it comes at a time when a number of countries particularly in southern africa are facing serious food shortages largely as a result of a further year of drought <e> <s> against such a background i am glad that we now have the opportunity to consider such a very important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we have all listened with the greatest interest to the well-informed and comprehensive contributions made to this most interesting debate <e> <s> i too add my congratulations to the noble lord lord seebohm for introducing it and my congratulations to the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead who is speaking i believe for the first time from the dispatch box <e> <s> we all listened with great interest to what he had to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not in any way wish to associate the noble earl lord longford with something with which he does not wish to be associated <e> <s> my point is that the noble lord referred to the general problem but i shall read <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour this is not a point on which i have the information <e> <s> i think it would be wiser if i were to look at what the noble earl said and indeed the noble viscount lord buckmaster and write to the noble earl on the point of government funding to voluntary agencies <e> <s> i can assure them and other noble lords that we shall continue to seek ways in which we can best support the efforts of voluntary agencies without destroying their essentially independent voluntary status which is of course a very large part of their value <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess that i would be misleading your lordships if i said that it was with any sense of pleasure that i rise to reply to this short debate this evening initiated by the noble lord lord hatch of lusby <e> <s> rather it is with a weary sense of <e>", "<cs> my lords this if i may say so is one of the questions that the noble lord lord hatch has put to me quite specifically and which i am going to answer later in my remarks <e> <s> to suggest that the general belgrano was attacked in order to avert the possibility of any peaceful settlement in particular to scupper the so-called peruvian peace proposals is i believe absurd <e> <s> i was grateful for the remarks of the noble lord lord mayhew on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both the noble lords lord cledwyn of penrhos and lord gladwyn for their reception of this statement <e> <s> if i may deal with the questions they have asked in the order in which they have put them the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos asked a question about unemployment <e> <s> as he recognises this is not specifically covered in the statement but as he will know one of our concerns about the whole question of denying steel imports to the united states is that it affects our steel industry and has an indirect effect on employment in this country <e> <s> all aspects of our discussions about the budget britains contribution to it the amount of money that we might receive back from it and of course the regional funds affect <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord for not answering his question <e> <s> the stuttgart declaration includes a remit to the commission to examine the need for strict financial guidelines and the review of the common agricultural policy over the autumn is to result in concrete steps to ensure effective control of agricultural expenditure <e> <s> we believe that a guideline of some kind is essential if this objective is to be achieved <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but i do not wish this afternoon to get drawn into a great discussion about favouring an increase in the communitys own resources <e> <s> as i have indicated from the statement that we made although the communitys own resources may in fact increase what we have been discussing is the proportion of the common agricultural policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in general agreement with what my noble friend has said on this matter but i think that it is very difficult to make a hard and fast rule that one will absolutely resolve the matter of the surpluses before there is any question of looking at the communitys resources <e>", "<cs> my lords as the statement makes clear it was a matter of regret to those meeting at the council that the united states administration took the decision that it did so soon after the commitment which was given at williamsburg against protectionism and naturally enough it has caused great concern and dissatisfaction within the community <e> <s> we have noted the presidents offer to negotiate orderly marketing arrangements for some of the steel products but there is no disposition on the part of the community to move ahead on this at this particular stage <e> <s> i do not think that i should at all like to speculate on what has led the united states administration to take this view <e> <s> i believe that overall one must regard this as one question which is a matter for regret but it does not of course alter our basic alliance with the united states and the importance of that alliance in our general foreign policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that what may well have provoked the american administration to act has been concern about the workers in the steel industry in america <e> <s> nevertheless our concern has been about the very serious effect on united kingdom industry the stainless steel plate which accounts for the bulk of the british steel corporations exports of special steel to the united states has been subject to the double penalty of an per cent <e> <s> tariff on top of the per cent <e> <s> countervailing duty and that would effectively shut them out of the market for this product <e> <s> even the new tariffs on sheet and strip metals which are not subject to countervailing duties would be very hard to surmount <e> <s> the effect of this has been very serious on some private producers in particular those concentrated in sheffield who have already contracted to a fraction of their size years ago <e> <s> so in effect we have made ourselves efficient but we are paying a double penalty as a result of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that on these matters i cannot go further than i have already gone in the statement <e> <s> negotiations are continuing and it would not he the practice to table papers or any such documents while negotiations are going on <e> <s> i have tried to indicate that my right honourable and learned <e>", "<cs> my lords the offer that was made by mr andropov was a small step in the right direction but did not amount to very much <e> <s> the russians would still have about ss warheads targeted on western europe and they have offered no constraints on missiles in asia <e> <s> the missiles in asia could be moved within range of nato quickly in a crisis <e>", "<cs> my lords the view that this and other nato governments take is that nato governments have shown a great deal of flexibility in the inf negotiations <e> <s> we have offered a zero level or an interim agreement providing for equality in warheads between the united states and the soviet union <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> that is not a view taken by her majestys government <e> <s> we believe that a freeze in inf at current levels would be unacceptable given the massive soviet superiority <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that the noble lord lord jenkins of putney has asked questions on this subject many times but then of course it is the right of a noble lord to ask the question that he wishes <e>", "<cs> my lords it may well be as my noble friend says that this is one of the reasons for making this proposal but of course the policy of her majestys government is that deployment will take place but at the same time that we shall continue to negotiate <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already indicated in answering some of the other supplementary questions we continue to seek negotiations but the fact is that the massive build-up of soviet ss forces since the late s has caused a disturbing imbalance in medium-range nuclear weapons <e> <s> it was against this background that the nato allies decided in to modernise their forces by introducing cruise and pershing <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> we have made it quite clear that if there were satisfactory negotiations this position could be reconsidered but our intention at the present moment is that there will be deployment of cruise and pershing towards the end of this year <e>", "<cs> no my lords that is not the case <e> <s> if the noble lord lord paget of northampton is asking a question about joint control of these weapons i can do no better than repeat the position as stated by my right honourable friend the prime minister <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and as i indicated in the answer to one of the earlier supplementaries we believe that the united states has shown flexibility <e> <s> we have offered the zero level or an interim agreement which would provide for equality in warheads between the united states and the soviet union <e> <s> indeed what we are seeking to achieve is a parity between united states and soviet weapons at as low a level as possible <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the whole intention of the dual track policy is that there will be deployment but that there will be a continuation of the negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lord lord jenkins of putney which i have given already is that we are continuing to negotiate <e> <s> we would all wish to have a successful conclusion to that but until we reach a successful conclusion both cruise and pershing missiles will be deployed <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable and learned friend the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both the noble lord lord cledwyn and the noble lord lord kennet for their responses to this statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord cledwyn asked me first about security in grenada <e> <s> as the statement makes clear at present we believe that no british citizens appear to be in immediate danger but if i take this further on a view about the regime i think it would be only right to say that there are features of the reports about how the new regime came to power <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first question raised by the noble lord lord hatch is that our consideration of the situation in grenada is concentrated on political economic and financial measures which might induce the present rulers in grenada to restore the rule of law and good order to the island <e> <s> the answer to his second question about aid is that we are providing no new capital aid to <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for that intervention <e> <s> clearly this is the kind of consideration which will be taken into account <e> <s> i will certainly pass on what he has said to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i do not feel at this stage in a very serious and complex situation that it would be appropriate for me to go further than the statement that i have already made on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable and learned friend the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both noble lords for their response to this statement and for the sympathies which they have expressed both to the united states and to france and particularly to the families of the men who have died <e> <s> the noble lord lord cledwyn commented on the need for the safety of our troops and this is a prime consideration at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the concern expressed by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter on this matter <e> <s> as i said in the original statement the safety of our troops is a prime consideration and that is why general kitson is going to the lebanon to look further at what arrangements might be made <e> <s> as i am sure my noble friend will appreciate it would not be in the best interests of our own troops in the force if any of these arrangements were made known publicly <e> <s> however <e> <s> i should like to give this assurance <e> <s> the fact that important steps are being taken will get to the wives and families of our troops out in the lebanon who must i recognise be very worried at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lord lord hankey is that the national reconciliation <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped that in my response to the earlier question i had made clear what the role of the mnf in the lebanon is but perhaps i could add further to what i have said <e> <s> the contingent is there at the request of and by agreement with the lebanese <e> <s> this is contained in an exchange of letters which was published as a command paper in the treaty series <e> <s> parliament has been informed of the subsequent extensions of the contingents deployment <e> <s> i should like to confirm that it is a peace-keeping force and that it is intended to support the government of the country in the peace-keeping efforts <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not feel that i can add further to what i have said <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mayhew will know the mnf is a peace-keeping force <e> <s> there is a legitimate government in the lebanon <e> <s> the purpose of the peace-keeping force is to give general support to the lebanese government and to try to help to keep the cease-fire and the peace in the lebanon <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated in my answer to an earlier supplementary question on the withdrawal of our contingent in the lebanon we do not intend to withdraw but when we agreed to participate we always made it clear that this could not be an open-ended commitment <e>

concerned i understand that they are maintaining their contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the attempted rescue of the united states embassy personnel held in tehran is concerned i cannot add anything to what was said at the time by my right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> however with regard to the nature of article to which i have referred i can do no better than quote what

that the noble lord lord hatch is able to condemn the violent <e>", "<cs> my lords since mr bishop became prime minister of grenada we and many of the other caribbean states have expressed our concern at some of the policies of that government <e> <s> we regard it as completely deplorable that there should have been this <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated on an earlier supplementary question it is the right of any state to take appropriate action to ensure the safety of its own nationals and that has been the prime concern of the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as her majestys government are concerned no formal written request from the organisation of east caribbean states was received in london until yesterday evening <e> <s> as the noble lord will appreciate discussions

point of the noble lord lord cledwyn but of course the house will be kept informed of developments <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first part of that supplementary question is yes i am aware

it is true that when i made the statement yesterday that we believed that british citizens could in fact be evacuated from grenada the british high commission in barbados were making every effort to

similar purpose in this country which would like community funds should they be available <e> <s> i should also say that any membership of a regional organisation would be a matter for the countries concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot be clear from what the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos says that what he is referring to is identical to the institute identified in the question <e> <s> but pursuit of this matter will depend largely on whether or not the european parliament agrees to reinstate this item in the budget when it could be further considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall of course look into this matter and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords we have already taken a lead in giving effect to most recommendations in the report of the commonwealth standing committee on student mobility <e> <s> the agenda of the commonwealth heads of government meeting has yet to be fixed but if as we expect the subject is included we shall be glad to encourage the rest of the commonwealth to make similar commitments to our own <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped from my original answer that the noble lord lord gladwyn would recognise that the government have made a very considerable contribution in this matter <e> <s> we made available million in february for awards to overseas students of which more than half has been allocated to the commonwealth <e> <s> we have the scholarship and fellowship plan which will take up about million of that million that i have already indicated and the odas technical cooperation and training programme is being expanded by million over the three years <e> <s> this we feel is a major contribution <e> <s> of course i recognise the noble lords point about distance teaching and video tapes but that is a specialised aspect of this matter although i see the point that he has made <e>", "<cs> my lords the reasons why the government took their original stand on the question of overseas student fees was the very considerable cost to the taxpayer in this country of an unlimited subsidy to overseas students <e> <s> i do not think that i can put it more clearly than to indicate that last february this large sum of money was made available for the purposes of helping overseas students and that over half will go to countries from the commonwealth <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i thank the noble baroness for that intervention <e> <s> in fact of course the differential between the home fee and the overseas students fee was started by the labour government in about i think <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to bring the house up to date on the situation in grenada <e> <s> the house will appreciate that at present our knowledge of developments is limited <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made this statement today as i said that i would when the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos asked me to keep the house fully informed of the position as we see it <e> <s> i have come to the house today with a further statement <e> <s> i should like to make it quite clear that my right honourable and learned friend the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs has at no time done other than speak to the house of the situation as he knows it <e> <s> i should not like there to be any misunderstanding on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first question that the noble lord has asked i should like to make it clear that in this situation her majestys government were consulted <e> <s> your lordships will see that from the chronology of the events that i have read out <e> <s> the situation is in fact that the united states and some commonwealth countries in the caribbean took the view that the risk to which their citizens were exposed called for some action <e> <s> the united kingdom and a number of other commonwealth caribbean countries took a different view <e> <s> the fact is that we regret the action that the americans decided to take <e> <s> but we do not necessarily agree with the americans on every issue any more than they always agree with us nor should we expect to <e> <s> but that does not in any way mean that there has been no consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord paget is entitled to his views about this matter but i think that it would be quite wrong to describe the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that this is the occasion to debate the development of the islands of the caribbean <e> <s> in answer to my noble friend on the general strategic issue her majestys government recognise that the americans live much closer to grenada than we do <e> <s> they had explicit and pressing requests from countries in the region to take a lead in restoring peace and law and order in grenada <e> <s> her majestys government recognise that the security of this part of the world in the american hemisphere is not something that the british can dismiss lightly because we are further away <e> <s> several of the countries most closely connected with grenada viewed developments there as a threat to their security and we should not forget that there are cubans on the island <e> <s> i think that we also have to recognise that the american community in grenada is very much larger than the british community and finally that the united states administration have the responsibility of deciding how best to secure their protection <e> <s> these points have to be borne in mind in this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i will only respond to the noble viscount lord st davids by saying that we all hope that the outcome is peace and stability in the island and a return to democracy <e>", "<cs> my lords the short answer to the noble lord lord jenkins of putney is no <e> <s> as i have already indicated in answering questions put by the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos the two situations are quite different <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it would be right or appropriate for me to make long-term judgments as to the consequences of this today <e> <s> my purpose in making the statement was to draw the <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may take the noble lords last point first <e> <s> the fact is that the eastern caribbean states are divided on their view as to the military intervention or whether or not there should have been economic and political measures <e> <s> on the other point that he has raised i think i can say that there is no suggestion at all and it is quite absurd to say that the bbc is briefing the government <e> <s> the bbc is perfectly entitled as an independent organisation to take the view that it thinks to be right <e>", "<cs> my lords this would be a matter for the usual channels who i am sure have taken note of this point <e> <s> perhaps it might be a convenient time for the house to return to the debate <e> <s> i would like to express my appreciation to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton who has been prevented from making his maiden speech while this statement has taken place <e> <s> i wish him very well and i hope that we <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a long and interesting debate <e> <s> we heard a robust maiden speech from the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon and if i may say so as always a very wise speech from my noble friend lord home of the hirsel an explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already indicated we should like to see better bilateral relations with argentina <e> <s> we have publicly welcomed its return to democracy and as an earnest of our good will our banks have helped to re-schedule argentine debts <e> <s> on the second point our position is clear and that is that we are not in a position to negotiate the sovereignty of the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> my lords the new government will not be in post until th december but there has been no statement from the argentine government that they are prepared to declare a definitive end to hostilities <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lord lord bishopston is as i have indicated that we welcome and should like to see better bilateral relations that is to say economic relations trade and commerce cultural relations and sporting relations <e> <s> there are a number of ways in which we could have better bilateral relations and we welcome those <e> <s> on the question of the possibility of united states arms sales to argentina we have said that we would regret this but it is not a definitive matter as yet <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that the government were in negotiation with the argentine government but one has to recall that it was the argentines who invaded the falkland islands <e> <s> we have made it absolutely plain that we are not going to negotiate the sovereignty of the falkland islanders <e>", "<cs> my lords we very much hope that the new government in argentina will make such a declaration of their policy <e> <s> if i might add one further point just as the argentine people have been able to express their wish for their government through the ballot box so we hope that they will understand why the falkland islanders should be entitled to the same right <e>", "<cs> my lords i hoped that i had made it clear in one of my former answers that the british government have already made a gesture to the argentine government because our banks have helped to re-schedule their debt <e> <s> we have had a very limited response to this <e> <s> therefore it would be difficult in the circumstances to say more than our public welcome of a return to democracy and our public wish to have better bilateral relations <e>", "<cs> my lords these are all matters which can be looked at and would be looked at very sympathetically if of course we had a return to better bilateral relations <e>", "<cs> my lords it was my right honourable friend the prime minister who made it clear that we are willing to enter into talks about good commercial economic or diplomatic relations <e> <s> but the time is not yet right to talk about the sovereignty of the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will be aware because i have said it on several occasions this afternoon and the government have made it quite plain that it really must be an issue for the falkland islanders themselves to determine <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to confirm that what my noble friend says is very important the wishes of the falkland islanders in this matter should be paramount <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i have already indicated my answer to the suggestion that has been made on several occasions in the course of this exchange about an intervention by the secretary general of the united nations <e> <s> however the house may like to be reminded that in the recent vote in the general assembly the result was slightly better from the british point of view than it was in and that countries showed their understanding of our position by declining to support the argentine resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the first supplementary question i have given the figures which were provided by the united states in washington and to the best of my knowledge and belief they are the best up-to-date and correct figures that we have <e> <s> on the second point it is not for me to speak for the american government but one of the reasons given for the action they took was to save the lives of american citizens in grenada <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a very dangerous thing to guess at anything on an occasion such as this <e> <s> we have said that we wish to see a return to democracy in grenada and we hope that that process is now taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords we did not take the view at the time of the invasion that it would be justified for us to participate in military action <e> <s> we took this decision in the light of our exchanges with caribbean governments and the united states and the decision of caricom in favour of political and economic measures against grenada <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to dispute the terminology here <e> <s> the fact was that the organisation of east caribbean states asked the united states to intervene in grenada <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for that <e> <s> in the communique which the commonwealth leaders issued at the end of their meeting in new delhi yesterday they have asked the commonwealth secretary general to undertake a special study of the needs of small states <e> <s> we stand ready to assist as appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord jenkins of putney is well aware of the stand that we took on the resolution of the united nations when we abstained <e> <s> my reply to his second point is that that would be a matter for the grenadian authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i do not have those figures available <e> <s> if i can get them i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware that contributions towards the forces in grenada were sent <e>", "<cs> my lords the united states have said that combat troops are due to leave grenada by christmas <e> <s> on the second point the noble lord will he aware of the answer that my right honourable friend mr raison gave in another place on th november indicating that we have agreed to provide a total of three quarters of a million pounds in grants to help meet immediate development needs including help with police training and with training and advice <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to comment on an article which appears in an american magazine <e> <s> her majestys government have accepted the explanation that the americans gave for their intervention in grenada as being the correct one <e>", "<cs> my lords representations were made by my right honourable and learned friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary to the saudi foreign minister during prince sauds recent visit here and later by our ambassador in jedda requesting the release and repatriation of mr carmichael for further medical examination and treatment in the united kingdom <e> <s> saudi legal procedures have no provision for bail as such although a person held for debt can be released from custody if a guarantor is found to stand surety for all claims against that person <e> <s> in mr carmichaels case it has not been possible to find such a guarantor <e> <s> there has been no official response to our representations from the saudi authorities so far but prince saud did promise to do what he could to speed up the legal process <e> <s> there is evidence that this is indeed happening <e> <s> we shall continue to press the saudi authorities to resolve this case as quickly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for the acknowledgement of the help that has been given by our embassy in saudi arabia <e> <s> on the question of the present state of mr carmichaels health we are of course concerned <e> <s> that is why we have continued to make representations about his case <e>", "<cs> my lords the embassy first gained access to mr carmichael in prison on st january <e> <s> on my calculation of the numbers of dates he was visited on occasions in and has been visited on occasions in <e> <s> a call was made to the prison but mr carmichael was in hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may take the noble and learned lords last point first i think that it will be quite clear from what i have already given in answer to his noble friend who put the preceding supplementary question that the embassy have taken a great deal of care in this particular case and that we continue to make representations <e> <s> in reply to the first point that he raised i think it very important that in making representations to the saudi government we leave it to the embassy to advance mr carmichaels case in whatever way they judge is the most likely to produce results <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer the noble lords supplementary question without notice <e> <s> i have no reason for supposing if there are a number of other british citizens imprisoned in saudi arabia that they do not have the same attention from the embassy as has mr carmichael <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not feel that i can add anything to what i have said with regard to the representations that we should make <e> <s> in cases like this i think that those who are in the embassy on the spot are in the best position to judge what is the right procedure <e> <s> i would advise that we should leave it to them bearing in mind all that the noble lord has said about this case <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no reason to believe that the measures taken by the greek authorities who are responsible for the maintenance of public order are insufficient <e> <s> her majestys ambassador at athens is in close touch with mr francis noel-baker about his estate and continues to be ready to offer whatever help he properly can <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to assure the noble lord lord paget that her majestys ambassador in athens and his staff have kept in close touch with the noel-bakers during the past few years and have given all the help they possibly can <e> <s> they have frequently taken up particular points with greek ministers and with officials <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully understand and appreciate the point put by the noble baroness lady vickers <e> <s> i myself saw mr and mrs noel-baker earlier this year and as i have said it is our intention to be as helpful to the noel-bakers as we can <e> <s> but i do not think it would be right or appropriate for us to dictate to our ambassador what he feels he should do in these circumstances <e> <s> i have no doubt that he will take note of the points that have been raised at question time here today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very interested in what the noble lord lord avebury has said about history in the th century but i think we have to remember that we are in now <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for my right honourable friend the prime minister to determine what points she takes up during her visit to greece and it would not be right for me to pre-empt anything she might consider in that regard <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the incident inevitably damaged the soviet unions international standing <e> <s> so far as her majestys governments relations with the soviet union are concerned we would welcome a more constructive relationship but would expect a change in the soviet attitude for this to be achieved <e> <s> as my right honourable friend the prime minister has made clear the government are ready to pursue in the right circumstances a sensible and realistic dialogue <e>", "<cs> my lords on the incomplete evidence that is available there is no reason to contradict the answer which was given by marshal ogarkov on th september that the decision to shoot down the airliner was given by the commander of the air defence region <e>", "<cs> my lords all air traffic on the route between anchorage and japan is out of radar coverage from the time it leaves the anchorage area until it approaches japan <e> <s> the pilot of each airliner using the route is responsible for reporting his position from time to time using his own navigation system <e> <s> so far as we know the pilot of kal made regular reports of his position and it appears that he thought he was following a normal air route <e> <s> in the circum stances the air traffic controllers would have had no way of knowing that the airliner was in fact off course <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not prepared to agree with what the noble lord lord jenkins has said <e> <s> it is not clear whether there was human error or some equipment failure as to why the airliner strayed off course <e> <s> there is of course an inquiry by the international civil aviation organisation whose report is expected to be published today <e> <s> that may throw some light on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid the noble lord is under a misapprehension <e> <s> as i said in an earlier answer in fact there is no radar cover on this part of the course of the aircraft <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already indicated there has been an inquiry into this matter and the results are expected to be published today <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments position on this matter has been quite clear <e> <s> we thought that the destruction of the korean airliner on st september was a disgraceful breach of the soviet unions international obligations in respect of air safety <e> <s> as a consequence we together with the majority of our allies imposed a -day ban on civil flights between the united kingdom and the soviet union and on soviet over-flights of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated in answer to an earlier supplementary question we do not know whether there was a human error or whether there was some equipment failure in the aircraft <e> <s> the report of the inquiry into this matter may shed some light on the cause of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very pleased to hear what the noble lord lord beswick said in the first part of that supplementary question but i am sure he will accept that it will not be for me to explain american policy on this matter <e> <s> it is for mrs kirkpatrick to speak for herself <e> <s> but not surprisingly and like all other countries the americans were very disturbed that a civil airliner should have been shot down <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to repeat a statement now being made in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank both the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos and the noble lord lord kennet for the way they have received this statement <e> <s> to answer the first question put by lord cledwyn of penrhos on consultation with the united states i can confirm that we were informed shortly beforehand but as he will understand each multinational force contributor has the right to self-defence and to decide what measures it deems to be necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords the position is as i described it in my original answer to the noble lord <e> <s> we were informed by the united states shortly before it took action <e> <s> but i must reiterate that each contributor has the right to self-defence and to decide what measures are necessary <e> <s> in fact in the case of the french retaliation we were not informed in advance <e> <s> i can perhaps go on to confirm that there could be no possible use of the british forces unless the british government wish them to be used in some way <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to speak for the american government in this particular matter <e> <s> it was for the american government to determine what they felt was right for their self-defence in the circumstances of the case <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think i have already indicated to the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos the british contingent enjoys the confidence of both sides in this particular circumstance <e> <s> on the question of consultations i can confirm that there will be a meeting of the mnf foreign ministers in brussels later this week <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to confirm that we see an urgent need for the full withdrawal of all foreign forces in lebanon <e> <s> at the time we welcomed the agreement as a commitment by israel to the full withdrawal of her forces from lebanon <e> <s> clearly there have been difficulties about the implementation of that <e> <s> we should not object to alternative arrangements which had the agreement of all parties <e> <s> we recognise the israeli concern about security for her northern border <e> <s> but what we really want to see is the withdrawal of all foreign forces from lebanon <e>", "<cs> my lords i should rather not be drawn down the particular path that the noble baroness lady gaitskell has outlined <e> <s> we believe that the majority of lebanese share the objectives of president gemayel to restore lebanese independence and secure the withdrawal of foreign troops <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not like to speculate on any view that the press may take now or some time in the future <e> <s> any agreements or arrangements between president reagan and mr shamir are for them <e> <s> in the answers that i have given to the other questions i think i have made clear what is the policy of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords in my answer to the first supplementary question asked on this statement i made it clear that each contributor to the multinational force to which the united states is a major contributor has the right to decide on its own <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord onslow will be aware there have been discussions in geneva with president gemayel on the future of lebanon <e> <s> we think that the majority of lebanese share his objective of restoring lebanons independence and securing the withdrawal of foreign forces <e> <s> there are differences between the parties over power sharing and institutional reform but we believe that these need to be sorted out by the lebanese themselves without outside interference <e> <s> it is not for us to be involved in this <e> <s> there has been some encouraging progress in the geneva talks <e> <s> indeed president gemayel is to come here to see us in the near future with the object of discussing the reconvening of the reconciliation talks which we must all hope will be successful <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord lord stewart but early on in my remarks i referred to the falkland islanders who had visited me at the foreign office and i indicated what they had said <e>", "<cs> my lords we have heard a most interesting range of views in our debate today

other speakers on the strategic importance which he perceives these islands to have <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i had better write to the noble lord on the point about the british antarctic surveys and south georgia because i do not have that information with me <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> what i said was that there are differences of opinion locally as to whether or not a farm with sheep is capable of supporting a family <e> <s> what i have indicated is that this gradual approach is one which we believe has the support of the falkland islands government and that is the way in which it is proceeding <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i note what the noble lord lord shackleton has said and i shall look at this matter in the light of his remarks <e> <s> i would not wish in any way to mislead the house but the information that i have been given i believe to be correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i was in fact about to turn to the whole question of the falkland islands company but perhaps i may just conclude on the question of the division of land <e> <s> development funds will be made available by the falkland islands government to the falkland islands development corporation to administer soft loans for agricultural development <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that this might be a possibility <e> <s> if i am wrong on that point i will of course let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords the next time i see sir rex hunt i shall take the opportunity to do so <e> <s> the noble lord lord annan made a great plea for realism about the future <e> <s> it might be helpful if i quoted again what i said about parliament namely that parliament has the final responsibility for taking decisions about the future of these territories <e> <s> this is constitutionally correct and it is realistic <e> <s> realism was also referred to by my noble friend lord buxton who remarked i agree with him that we should approach dr alfonsin in a spirit of co-operation <e> <s> this is our own view

reciprocated <e> <s> indeed what i have said about our first steps in bilateral relations with the new government in argentina was confirmed by my noble friend lord montgomery of alamein <e> <s> finally i was pleased that this realistic approach was shared by the noble lord lord shackleton <e>", "<cs> my lords i will confirm to the noble lord lord hatch of lusby and to the house what i said at some length on an earlier occasion on th july <e> <s> i said then that news of the peruvian proposals did not reach london until more than three hours after the general belgrano had been sunk in

office <e> <s> they were sent to the public record office and have subsequently been withdrawn from the public record office because they are required in the foreign and commonwealth office <e> <s> when they are no longer required they will be returned to the public record office <e>", "<cs> my lords all the documents that are referred to in the question are documents which are not classified

differing and in some cases conflicting views <e> <s> successive british governments have made it clear that they have no doubts about our sovereignty over the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> my lords i gave the original answer that i did in reply to the terms of the question asked <e> <s> secondly i cannot go wider than what i have already said <e>", "<cs> my lords this question is being widened

increase in manpower over this last year is in the county tier authorities which have not been affected by the transferred functions that the noble lord mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the point made by the noble and learned lord about welsh towns <e> <s> my understanding of the position is that welsh local authorities have discretion within their spending targets to determine how they spend their money <e> <s> i would not be in a position to comment on particular capital spending in any particular authority at least not without notice but my understanding is that where there are these cases it is possible for the town to use some if its money in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that intervention <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that overall about per cent <e> <s> of the rate bill is paid by industry and this affects their ability to employ more people <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot accept that <e> <s> i accept this is a tough settlement but we believe that it is achievable <e> <s> it is worth remembering that last year out of the welsh authorities achieved their targets and have shown that it is possible to do so <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord will appreciate that it is the duty of the government to fix total expenditure levels for all the reasons we have given and that it is central to our economic policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the general estimate for the future rate of inflation is per cent <e> <s> as it is now or perhaps lower <e> <s> we believe it is important that when fixing their wages local authorities must take account of the per cent <e> <s> increase that the government have given as a guideline on wage settlements <e> <s> furthermore we believe that local authorities must continue to ensure that they are getting value for money and look for good housekeeping in the way that they spend their money <e> <s> given those aspects and the other points i have made we believe that it is possible for authorities to keep within the targets which have been set <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have fixed expenditure levels but within those there is wide variation between authorities on what they choose to do <e> <s> some authorities have got themselves into difficulties because for example they have not increased rents by the amounts suggested and on the basis of which the grant will be calculated <e> <s> there is discretion for local authorities and it is therefore within the right of the electors to choose if they so wish to change the council at local elections <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos and the noble lord lord gladwyn for their responses to this statement <e> <s> i was particularly pleased with the final remarks of the noble lord lord cledwyn in which he welcomed the remarks of my right honourable friend the secretary of state on the need for the dialogue between east and west to be broadened <e> <s> perhaps it might be helpful to say that my right honourable friend believes that his talks with mr gromyko showed a wish on both sides for further contact <e> <s> he has agreed that he will in any event meet mr gromyko at the united nations in september <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i have not made the position quite clear <e> <s> i will try again <e> <s> what is contained in the statement is what has been tabled by ourselves and our allies at stockholm as a negotiating stand <e> <s> this will now be considered by officials <e> <s> as i have indicated in further elaboration it is designed to establish the patterns of military forces which both sides can understand <e> <s> we believe that this is the first stage towards verification and it is a confidence-building measure <e> <s> if it is successful and we build up confidence then we could move on to other matters <e> <s> but as the noble lord lord gladwyn said <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that the noble lord lord diamond has made his intervention in order to get clarification and i hope to help what we all want to see achieved which is some measure of advance in these confidence-building measures <e> <s> if i may i will read tomorrow in <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it is for me to speak on what motivates the soviet union in foreign policy <e> <s> as far as afghanistan is concerned we have made quite plain our view of the russian intervention in afghanistan <e> <s> this has been raised on five occasions at the united nations <e> <s> we have always made it clear and my right honourable friend the prime minister has made it clear on a number of occasions that nato is a defensive alliance that it was formed as a defensive alliance and remains as a defensive alliance in western europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful that both the noble lords lord cledwyn and lord rochester recognise that this is a particulary delicate situation <e> <s> the noble lord lord cledwyn asked the reason for this decision <e> <s> of course it is a decision which puts the employees of gchq in exactly the same position as other employees in security services in the government and the armed services <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the point that the noble lord lord dean has made <e> <s> i should like to make it quite clear that this in no way implies disloyalty among trade unionists <e> <s> as i said in answer to the noble lord lord cledwyn the purpose of the decision which the government have taken in this matter is to bring gchq into line with other security services <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for what he has said and i entirely agree with the points that he has made <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be glad to confirm to the noble lord lord cledwyn that this is in no sense an attack on trade unions or on their members <e> <s> i should like to repeat the assurance that i have already given in answer to a question raised by the noble lord lord dean <e> <s> the government believe that special conditions apply in security and intelligence work and that in the case of gchq they are bringing the employees in line with the same conditions as apply to those employed at the present time in other security establishments <e>", "<cs> my lords the decision was taken for the reasons that i have already given to the house <e> <s> the government because of the difficult nature of the decision and the particular circumstances felt that it was not a matter that could be discussed before the final decision was taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord drumalbyn for his understanding of the particular circumstances and of the answers which i must of necessity give under these circumstances <e> <s> my noble friend asked how many <e>", "<cs> my lords i can appreciate the strong feelings of the noble lord lord dean because he has only just heard the statement <e> <s> but i hope he will reflect upon what has been said this afternoon and no doubt read <e>", "<cs> my lords given the current interest in unesco arising from the american announcement of withdrawal at the end of this is a timely question <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord vaizey for asking it <e> <s> he is particularly at home with the subject because he is one of the members of our national commission which provides us with valuable advice on the workings of unesco <e> <s> i am also grateful to my noble friend for having given me notice of the questions he was to ask <e> <s> however i shall begin by saying something about the outcome of the general conference the subject of the unstarred question <e>", "<cs> my lords the british view is that we believe in a practical step-by-step approach to disarmament rather that in wide-ranging declaratory programmes such as the one which is implicit in the question asked by the noble lord lord brockway <e> <s> but if further development of the comprehensive programme seems to offer a practical means of advancing disarmament the united kingdom will join others in supporting it <e> <s> on the noble lords supplementary question as to whether it was the western powers which might be accused of being responsible for the lack of progress it was evident from the discussions in the committee on disarmament during and from recent united nations general assembly debates that many delegations had reservations about the programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i have made the position of the british government on this debate in the united nations quite clear by saying that we believe in a step-by-step approach to disarmament rather than in these general declaratory statements <e> <s> but as the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos will know we are deeply committed to the search for disarmament <e> <s> we are of course closely associated through nato with american attempts to reduce strategic and intermediate-range missiles and we have participated in the vienna talks on balanced conventional force reductions <e> <s> on the noble lords last point about the stockholm conference i looked again at what i have said <e> <s> i am sorry that there should be any misunderstanding on the point but of course we would hope that while the negotiations which may arise from the stockholm conference go on that in no way precludes or prevents other negotiations from continuing at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords on the three points that the noble lord has raised i am sure that he is right to draw attention to the importance of the cost of nuclear arms to the united states to the soviet union and to ourselves as well as to the importance of maintaining our proper level of defences and of course it is for this reason that as a government we have supported the deployment of cruise at the same time saying that we shall continue our negotiations <e> <s> i entirely agree with what the noble lord said about the lessons to be drawn from the s and s <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the point of the noble lord lord brockway about the strongly held feelings of the opposition parties in the united kingdom but as i have indicated our view as a government is that it is better and more likely to achieve results to have a step-by-step programme on disarmament negotiations <e> <s> i have indicated some of the negotiations in which we are currently taking part rather than these very broad principles which in fact do not have the support of many countries in the united nations for the reasons that i have given <e>", "<cs> my lords on mbfr we have participated in the vienna talks which we expect to be resumed shortly once the russians of course agree to return to the negotiating table <e> <s> we are playing our full part in these <e>", "<cs> my lords again we believe that the best way to get disarmament is through the various talks that are going on <e> <s> reference has already been made to the decisions coming out of the stockholm conference <e> <s> as i have already indicated we are associated through nato with american attempts to reduce arms both strategic and intermediate-range missiles and we are involved in the talks on mbfr <e> <s> in a whole range of ways the british government are either supporting talks or actively taking part in them <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already indicated we remain committed to seeking a balanced and verifiable agreement in mbfr <e> <s> the first stage of the cde complements what is happening in mbfr <e> <s> may i say that nato cannot be accused of stimulating a new arms race <e> <s> in october nato defence ministers announced reductions of nuclear warheads in europe following reductions of in <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord paget of northampton has drawn attention to an important point <e> <s> the fact is that since we have had the longest period of peace in europe this century and there is no doubt at all that the nato alliance is one reason for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord cledwyn and the noble lord lord kennet for their reception of this answer <e> <s> as far as concerns the help that has been given to both mozambique and swaziland i should add that in fact there is also help coming in from the eec and in the case of <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that there has been help from voluntary organisations <e> <s> there has certainly been help from oxfam and i believe from other organisations <e> <s> perhaps i might let the noble lord know which other organisations have in fact sent help or have promised to send help <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already indicated the aid that is coming from the european community and i understand that there will be aid from other western countries <e> <s> i have no information about any aid from the soviet union or any eastern european countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree with the noble lord lord taylor that this is a terrible situation and the figures and the latest reports indicate that to be the case <e> <s> if i may say so the position of the ida is in fact outside the question but the noble lord will recall that my right honourable friend mr raison said in another place recently that of course we are concerned about the position of the ida and are making a contribution so that there will be an increased amount in the ida <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i could accept the opening statement of the noble lord lord kennet <e> <s> the points i have made are very real points which were confirmed in the very interesting speech of my noble friend lord hood <e> <s> i said that we are continuing to work for a solution which would enable deep sea mining to take place but without the undesirable practical effects which the current suggestions allow <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it would be appropriate for me to go into the details of this solution <e> <s> however it is perfectly clear that there is considerable opposition to the present solution <e> <s> this gives me an opportunity to answer the point raised by the noble lord lord elwyn-jones the suggestion that some companies believe that the present situation is all right <e> <s> i am able to confirm that the government have sought the views of a number of bodies and organisations with interests in the various topics covered by the convention <e> <s> some of them have interests in more than one area <e> <s> parts of the convention are attractive to them while other parts of the convention are unattractive to them <e> <s> however we are not aware of any united kingdom body with a deep seabed mining interest which does not consider that part xi as presently drafted is unsatisfactory and we are not aware of any such united kingdom body which would wish to operate under the rgime established by that part <e> <s> we have received no request or advice to sign a convention in order that a united <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to say that i am about to come to that point <e> <s> as a signatory to the final act of the law of the sea conference the united kingdom is entitled to participate fully in the work of the commission although as the noble and learned <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a most stimulating debate this evening <e> <s> i have no difficulty in recognising that the noble lord lord paget of northampton is a member of the labour party and i was very touched to hear him give such a robust defence of the british empire <e> <s> i was even more pleased when he said that he wished to base all his remarks on the principle of reality <e> <s> but he asked of course an interesting question which bears on important issues the governments policy with regard to the recognition of other states the way in which states become accepted as members of the international community and the acceptance of new governments <e> <s> i am grateful for this opportunity to clarify the facts and set out the governments thinking on them <e>", "<cs> the debts my lords of its predecessor <e> <s> that is not directly dependent on the recognition or non-recognition of the government <e> <s> our current practice is consistent with that of our major allies and partners <e> <s> we naturally consult with other states whose interests are affected by this sort of situation in a similar way to our own <e>", "<cs> my lords i was on the point of answering some of the questions that the noble and learned lord had asked <e> <s> he asked what were the circumstances in which the government recognise any right of armed intervention <e> <s> the answer which answers the question he has just posed is that any armed intervention could not be regarded as lawful unless the state in which the intervention took place gave a genuine invitation to the intervening state or the intervention could be justified in accordance with the principle of self-defence confirmed by article of the united nations charter <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked how long it will be before a decision is made <e> <s> of course that is not a matter for us <e> <s> the tribunal reports direct to the zimbabwe government and as i indicated in my original answer to the noble lord lord paget of northampton the zimbabwean authorities are aware of the public concern in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with great interest to what my noble friend said in the debate last wednesday and of course it has been seen by my right <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated in my answer to the question the appeal has been heard by the review tribunal and we do not know when the answer will be given but it is a matter that is reported to the zimbabwe government <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the actual date when it finished <e> <s> we do know that it has been heard <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lords supplementary question is very far wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that what the zimbabwe government are doing is not unconstitutional and is not illegal <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is very difficult to make an assessment of the precise consequences as it is difficult to make an assessment of the precise consequences of the effect of the extra million package of additional support that has been given <e> <s> it depends upon a number of factors including the strength of the american dollar which affects where students might go <e>", "<cs> my lords the government announced in that there would be an increase of million in the financial years to to expand support to selected overseas students <e> <s> included in that amount was a particular sum for students from cyprus malaysia and hong kong <e> <s> furthermore there <e>", "<cs> my lords i have indicated the increased support that the government have given <e> <s> we recognise the importance of overseas students and their value to this country <e> <s> we also recognise what very good value for money a british university education is <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness is aware the increase of per cent <e> <s> in university fees is a matter for the university grants committee <e> <s> i note of course what she says <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely take the second part of the noble lords question <e> <s> when i use the word universities i should include polytechnics and courses at colleges of advanced education and colleges of further education all of which have overseas students <e> <s> on the first part of the noble lords question i cannot add anything to my original reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the point that has been made by my noble friend lady vickers and i also take on board the point which she has made about small countries <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has asked a very specific question about a specific country <e> <s> having noted the point that he makes and having indicated the extra support that the government have given to overseas students and our intention to give continuing support perhaps it would be best to follow up by correspondence the point which my noble friend has made about chad <e>", "<cs> my lords the provision that the french government make for students from their colonies is a matter for the french government <e> <s> i have outlined what we do in this country <e> <s> it is very important for any potential overseas students to recognise that in britain whether in a university a polytechnic or a college of advanced education it is possible to get a qualification in a short period of time and in a situation where there will be a very good staff/pupil ratio <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to speak for the university grants committee but my understanding is that the per cent <e> <s> increase is made up of per cent <e> <s> for inflation and per cent <e> <s> to cover what are regarded as the costs that are necessary for overseas students fees to meet the full economic cost <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the position as regards the increase in the fees for overseas students is as i have described it in answer to the noble lord lord glenamara and it follows the policy of an increase which would cover inflation and an increase which would mean that the fees cover the full economic cost <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite prepared to agree with the noble lord lord leatherland that it is always worthwhile to go to a british institution of higher education <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat the answer which has just been give in another place to a private notice question on the french lorry drivers dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the concern which has been expressed by both the noble lord lord underhill and the noble lord lord diamond on this matter <e> <s> i should like to confirm that the british government have made their concern for <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to speculate on the proposition that the noble lord lord kaldor has put up <e> <s> we do not anticipate such a situation in this country

should get worse we should have to consider whether there was anything further we could do <e>", "<cs> my lords i should imagine that all countries in the european community are equally as affected by this strike as we are in great britain and no doubt are making their representations just as forcefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what my noble friend lord maude has to say on this <e> <s> it may well be that if it persists this is what will happen <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable and learned friend the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lords lord cledwyn of penrhos and lord gladwyn for their reception of the statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord cledwyn asked a number of questions and his first was if we do not get the refund that we are entitled to would we consider withholding our payments <e> <s> the view of the government is that of course we want to secure payment of the bulk of our refunds by the end of march and we do not want to precipitate a premature and needless confrontation over this matter <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs raised the issue of parliaments attitude at the foreign affairs council on th february <e> <s> the council agreed to adopt my right honourable friends suggestion to send a letter to the parliament under article of the eec treaty formally requesting the parliament to give its opinion on the refund regulations in good time for the foreign affairs council on th and th march <e> <s> i hope that what i have said answers the first point put by the noble lord lord cledwyn and also the point put by the noble lord lord gladwyn on the need for parliament to give approval for the refund <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be perfectly prepared to agree with the noble lord lord cledwyn <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated in my original answer her majestys government are always concerned whenever there are violations of human rights and we have made that quite plain

saw him in stockholm and both i and my right honourable friend raised the matter with the former turkish foreign minister <e> <s> but in each particular case we have to determine which is the most appropriate way in which to try to help the individual concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am quite sure that the question today will be noted by the turkish authorities and we shall have to hope that the answer will be in the affirmative <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lords lord oram and lord diamond for their recognition that this is an important statement <e> <s> the noble lord <e> <s> lord oram began by asking me about privatisation <e> <s> as the statement makes clear the first proposals are a general reorganisation of the crown agents and questions as the method and timing of privatisation will be considered at a later date <e> <s> what has particularly precipitated this as is set out at the start of the statement is the fact that the government of brunei have terminated their contract with the crown agents so that since the summer of the crown agents have been running at a loss <e> <s> the government therefore felt it was right that the crown agents should be reorganised and the general proposals are set out in the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most gratetul for the words of my noble friend lord selkirk <e> <s> i think he has put very well what the present position is <e> <s> although it is very difficult to be sure what led the government of brunei to cancel their contract it may well be that they felt that with the approach of independence it would not be appropriate for the crown agents to manage their investments and that they wished to do this themselves <e> <s> it is for those kinds of reasons that we believe the present arrangements will be a better basis for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no reason for thinking that because it is a private organisation international bodies or developing countries should have less confidence in it <e> <s> i think it is a very dangerous statement to suggest that simply because something is a private organisation it will be less competent or less reliable <e> <s> i think we must look to the future with confidence that under its present organisation and present direction it will be able to fulfil its future role effectively <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to acknowledge to my noble friend lord gridley the importance that we attach to the expertise of the staff and indeed i recognise the appreciation which has been shown in all parts of the house of the expertise that has been built up over the years by the crown agents <e> <s> i should like to confirm to my noble friend that <e> <s> in looking to the privatisation of the crown agents some of the work which is at present carried out in east kilbride which of course includes the pensions administration work to which my noble friend has referred and some of what is now done for the overseas development agency may well continue to be carried out in the public sector <e> <s> but decisions on that particular part of the organisation have yet to be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i gave the effect of the reorganisation proposals which indicate a reduction of staff from about to about <e> <s> it is rather difficult to tell exactly how it would work out because there would of course be some natural wastage but the crown agents estimate that there would probably be a staff loss of about <e> <s> we believe that any alternative decision to the closure and the break-up of the crown agents would have meant that a substantially greater number would have been made redundant <e> <s> at <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is rather difficult to give a more detailed answer than i have given <e> <s> if there is a more specific number that i can give to the noble lord i will write to him about it <e> <s> it is rather difficult to make a judgment on something which has yet to take place <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord oram will i am sure have read the statement very carefully he will see that it says that the reorganisation is with a view to privatisation <e> <s> but clearly we wish to see the reorganisation take place and the privatisation should take place at a time which is in the best interests of the organisation for its future success <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord avebury is making quite unwarranted assertions <e> <s> as i indicated in the answer to the question which he put down just before christmas the records when the foreign and commonwealth office have finished looking at them are returned to the public record office <e> <s> that is always the procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer that i have given to the question today is couched in the precise terms of the answer that i gave to a supplementary put by the noble lord lord avebury when he put down a similar question in december <e> <s> as i indicated then and i confirm to the house again these are unclassified documents and when they are no longer required they will be returned to the public record office <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not the returning of the documents to the public record office which is expensive <e> <s> it is

entirely depends on the records being consulted <e>", "<cs> my lords i have indicated that all the documents will go back to the public record office <e> <s> on the first of the noble lords supplementary questions i can only repeat to him the answer that i gave to a similar supplementary question that he put down when this matter was last before your lordships <e> <s> i said then <e>", "<cs> my lords the assumption behind the noble lords question is that the foreign and commonwealth office is looking at only one document from the public record office <e> <s> as i have already indicated at any one time there may be records out from the public record office and therefore it would not be a practicable proposition to copy them all <e>", "<cs> my lords what i have said in response to this question applies to the particular documents to which the noble lord lord avebury has referred as well as to any other documents which the foreign office might be looking at at any one time <e> <s> when they are no longer needed they are returned <e>", "<cs> my lords some documents have been returned and others will be returned when we have completed our consideration of them <e> <s> but i think there is a misunderstanding which if i may say so is exemplified in the noble and learned lords question <e> <s> if some documents were to be copied the arrangements to be made for any one person would have to be available for everyone who borrows documents from the public record office <e> <s> that is where the disproportionate public expense and administration would come in

which is an increase of per cent <e> <s> over the comparable figures for and provisional figures for and are million and million respectively <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures that i have given show that the amount of money that we are giving for this year and for the following year are still ahead of the rate of inflation <e> <s> in answer to the noble lords original question we believe that these represent a considerable commitment to developing countries <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a question which is rather wide of the original question <e> <s> but may i indicate that the aid which we have given goes to both the developing countries and of course the least developed countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i regard a supplementary question on international debt as being rather wide of the original question <e> <s> but the fact of the matter is that britain has made a major contribution to the imfs rescheduling of debts and of course <e> <s> british banks have made a major contribution <e> <s> also <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i need to explain to the noble lord lord beswick what i meant by my answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to assure the noble baroness lady gaitskell that not only have we made our contribution directly in overseas trade we have as i have just explained been helping to reschedule debt <e> <s> we have already indicated what we are going to

already indicated in my previous answer the many different ways in which the government are helping developing countries <e>", "<cs> not without notice on that point my lords <e> <s> but i think i should be right in saying that we are approximately on the target that has been determined <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his supplementary question <e> <s> of course this is yet another way in which we are helping developing countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i made it plain in my original answer that within our resources we have made a very considerable contribution by way of overseas aid <e> <s> one must recognise that the other countries which the noble lord has mentioned are countries that are relatively more prosperous than we are and that unless we get the economy right we shall have even less to give to developing countries or to any other good cause <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to start by adding a warm welcome to my noble friend lord stockton and wish him many happy years in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a most interesting debate and i think at the end we can all agree with the noble lord lord greenhill who

like to wish the noble lord lord mulley well speaking for the first time from the dispatch box in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can say more than i have already made quite clear to

bbc <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad of the comments of the noble lord which i can confirm <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord leatherland did require to learn the english language then perhaps that might be necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that the noble lord has raised an important point but i think it is rather wide of the question <e> <s> if the noble lord would like to put down a question on that subject i will try to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that for over years of its existence english by radio and television has in fact built up a network of selling agents in countries <e> <s> the relationship between the bbc and these agents is regulated by contract and it has proved to be very valuable <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated in my original reply

noble lord lord avebury fully understood the answer that i gave to his original question <e> <s> there is in fact no such thing as nato ammunition <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole control of weapons in nato is of course another question and i should be happy to try to answer on that subject if the noble lord cares to put such a question down <e> <s> the whole point about the answer to this question is that there is no such thing as nato ammunition <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall draw to the attention of my right honourable friend the point that the noble lord has made <e>", "<cs> my lords as i would expect from my noble friend he has drawn our attention to an interesting point <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that i should be drawn by the noble lord lord jenkins of putney down the path of answering questions about the general situation in central america <e>", "<cs> my lords two examples of manufacturers of such ammunition are australia and india <e> <s> neither is a member of nato <e>", "<cs> my lords the united states programme is limited to research <e> <s> the soviet union already has a long-established programme of research in this field and neither party to the treaty has signalled any intention of abrogating it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his question <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no reason to alter our strong commitment to the independent strategic deterrent <e> <s> the united states is well aware of the importance that we attach to our own independent deterrent <e>", "<cs> my lords at the conference on disarmament in geneva we are actively seeking agreement for the setting up of a working group to examine all the issues involved in arms control in outer space including treaty arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the first question of the noble lord lord bishopston we are happy with the way the consultations are going and the issues involved are being fully discussed <e> <s> i think he will recognise from the answer that i gave to the original question that we do not accept that the treaty is being abrogated <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware the prime minister sent a message to president alfonsin on the occasion of his inauguration on th december which was intended to pave the way for the development of better bilateral relations <e> <s> we followed this up on th january by putting some specific ideas to the argentinians through the swiss protecting power <e> <s> we have now received a substantial response from the argentine government which we are still considering <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have made their position quite clear on the question of the sovereignty of the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his intervention <e> <s> on his second point it would be helpful if president alfonsin could now formally declare a definitive cessation of hostilities and renounce the future use of force <e>", "<cs> my lords as i believe the house and the noble lord lord shackleton are aware the possibility and the implications of declaring an exclusive fisheries limit are under careful consideration <e> <s> however the fact that the matter is still being considered reflects the complexity of the issue <e> <s> but i have noted the point which the noble lord has made <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have repeatedly made plain their view on britains sovereignty over the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord bishopston for his remarks about my visit to the falkland islands which was most valuable and interesting <e> <s> on his second point i should make it clear that we need to be fully satisfied that argentina renounces the future use of force <e> <s> we have noted the statements by the argentine government that they intend to pursue their claim by peaceful means <e> <s> at no stage have the government accepted the term fortress falklands <e> <s> it has been coined by others and has very little meaning <e> <s> turning to the question of the diplomatic initiatives i indicated in response to the supplementary question of the noble lord lord dean of beswick <e> <s> that we have now received a response from the argentine government to our initial proposals through the mediation of the protecting power <e> <s> we are considering that response but we believe that it is in the best interests of both ourselves and the argentine government for the details to be kept confidential for the time being <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course aware of the early day motion to which the noble lord has referred and i have studied the debate on foreign affairs which took place in another place last week <e> <s> i should like to make it plain that her majestys government wish to have more normal bilateral relations with argentina <e> <s> i have already described the proposals that we have made <e> <s> at the same time i should like to make it clear that it remains our policy to stand firmly by our commitments to the falkland islanders while seeking more normal bilateral relations with argentina <e>", "<cs> my lords that question is really rather wide of the original question on the order paper <e> <s> if the noble lord cares to put down a question on that subject i will be happy to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not quite hear the end of the noble lords question but may i say that it is the governments view that there should be a gradual acquisition by the islanders of their farms <e> <s> i believe the figures will substantiate that that is taking place <e>",

reiterated the basic principles namely israels right to existence and the palestinians right to self-determination <e> <s> the statement goes on to say that the parties must take steps towards negotiations and that europeans stand ready to help in this matter <e> <s> we are also in close contact with our partners in the ten on the iran-iraq conflict <e> <s> yesterday again they indicated collectively their wish to see that war brought to a swift end <e> <s> that point was made in the statement issued by ministers after their meeting in brussels <e>", "<cs> my lords we have of course made clear the importance of broadening the east-west dialogue to include the middle east <e> <s> president reagan has also spoken recently of the need to work with the soviet union to defuse tension and regional conflicts <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware that mr konienko the soviet first deputy foreign minister is currently visiting the united kingdom and we shall take this opportunity to exchange views on a wide variety of issues including middle east questions <e>", "<cs> my lords the position of her majestys government on this matter is quite clear <e> <s> it is a balanced policy on the arab-israel dispute <e> <s> we seek a negotiated settlement on the basis of the two principles i have enunciated namely israels right to a secure existence and the palestinians right to self-determination <e>", "<cs> my lords we do agree with the last point made in the noble lords question concerning the appalling suffering in the iran-iraq war <e> <s> we have deplored the continuation of the fighting and have urged both sides to avoid any moves that could lead to an escalation of the war <e> <s> we have repeatedly urged both sides to accept mediation <e>", "<cs> my lords we recognise that the united states is indispensable to the peace process in the whole of the arab-israel dispute and we support of course president reagans initiative of just over a year ago <e> <s> on the question of the iran-iraq war we support realistic attempts to bring this war to an end especially the efforts of the united nations secretary-general <e> <s> one of the difficulties is that there is no harmony of views between iran and iraq as to how further mediation could help to bring an end to the conflict <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make it quite clear that there is no discrimination against israel <e> <s> there has been a long-standing friendship with the jordanian royal family and the programme was arranged some years in advance <e> <s> president herzog will see the queen on nd april <e>", "<cs> my lords i have indicated that the ten issued this communique yesterday at the end of the meeting of the foreign ministers <e> <s> on the question once again of the iran-iraq conflict many would-be mediators have tried to help so far without any success <e> <s> consultations are continually in progress with other members of the security council in new york

stage <e> <s> it is not a new idea but we believe that progress must first be made in bringing the parties together on the main <e>", "<cs> my lords we are always ready to consider in consultation with our french and american allies steps that could lead to agreement between the four powers on hesss release we are in touch with our allies at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the whole house will sympathise with the first part of my noble friends supplementary question about the circumstances now surrounding hess <e> <s> however as he will be aware all matters relating to the imprisonment of hess are subject to agreement by the four powers <e> <s> as i think i indicated in my original answer we are in consultation with our allies <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have indicated this is a matter of course for the four powers under the four power agreement on berlin and we are in consultation with our allies about this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the position is that unilateral action by the british government or by the three western powers acting in <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point made by my noble friend on this matter <e> <s> i can confirm that the western prison governors are in continual contact with hess about his personal requirements including visiting hours and that they do make representations to the russians from time to time <e> <s> in recent years these have resulted in the installation of colour television the erection of a summer house in the garden and work has recently been completed on the installation of a lift to enable hess to reach the garden more easily <e>", "<cs> my lords the russians base their objection to the release of hess on the claim that soviet public opinion would not understand the release of a man who because of his involvement from to must share responsibility for the events that followed <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the then minister of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs raised the matter with the soviet ambassador in june <e> <s> there has been no formal response to that <e> <s> on the second part of the noble lords question the answer is in

to thank both the noble lord lord cledwyn and the noble lord lord gladwyn for their responses to this statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord cledwyn began by asking me about the size of the gap between what has been offered and what we feel we can accept <e> <s> he asked why if it is the size that it is it could not be bridged <e> <s> the answer is that the figure is of crucial importance because it provides the foundation for a system which will operate into the future <e> <s> it is therefore important that we get it right and the gap betwen and million ecus is a substantial one so far as the united kingdom is concerned <e> <s> but in terms of cost to other member states the gap is relatively small when divided between eight or nine contributors <e> <s> it is a matter of regret that our partners were unable to take on the necessary small additional burden to bridge the gap <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the position on own resources is as described by my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne <e> <s> on his second point we have always wanted to get community expenditure under control and what we have said on own resources is that we would be prepared to consider an increase of own resources provided that we could get agreement on the budget and provided that expenditure could be brought under control <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the government have made plain that they accept that what is required is a reform of the common agricultural policy in order to bring expenditure under control <e> <s> i agree with what my noble friend lord maude has said on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the government agree that there are very important long-term objectives for the european community and we should like to be able to turn our attention to these but we feel and we believe we have the support of the country in this that it is right that we should get a settlement on the budget issue and bring the expenditure of the community under control <e>", "<cs> my lords the negotiations are continuing <e> <s> i understand there are two sessions a year on this question <e> <s> as my noble friend will know we ourselves have proposed procedures for investigating any

have been produced since <e> <s> last year congress declined to authorise funds to modernise the ageing united states capability <e>", "<cs> my lords a team of specialists appointed by the united nations secretary-general has concluded that chemical weapons have been used in the conflict between iraq and iran <e> <s> i cannot comment on where they were manufactured <e> <s> however i should like to reiterate that for all these reasons we believe that a total ban on chemical weapons is urgently needed <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is a hypothetical situation <e> <s> we believe that the best way forward is to try to get agreement to abolish the use of chemical weapons in any country in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said we are working towards a ban on chemical weapons and as far as bacteriological weapons are concerned the next review conference takes place in <e> <s> this will provide an opportunity to discuss ways of improving the effectiveness of that

sides as useful and constructive and we are entering the twelfth round of talks <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say in answer to a previous question that we only took the view of the governor of hong kong but i take the point of the noble lord and we shall of course continue to keep in close touch with the views of the people of hong kong <e> <s> however it is too early to say exactly how hong kong opinion will be consulted on any specific arrangements for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly draw to my right honourable friends attention the point that my noble friend has just made <e>", "<cs> my lords on that particular point the government had no opportunity to influence the decision of jardine matheson in any way <e> <s> it was in fact a commercial decision on their part

attention of my right honourable friend the point that the noble baroness has made <e>", "<cs> my lords the specific question that the noble lord has asked is somewhat different from the question on

separate question i would be glad to try to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that as far as the posts for the new blood initiative are concerned it is for the university grants committee to determine what the distribution will be <e> <s> i have a list which i think i could make available to the noble baroness if she would care to see it <e>", "<cs> my lords we would welcome

be aware the financial cost of the rehabilitation of the falkland islands includes a million grant for rehabilitation which has been fully committed and expenditure will be completed by the end of the present financial year million for development <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point raised by the noble lord my right honourable friend the prime minister said in another place on th march that it would be difficult to restore diplomatic relations until argentina had said that hostilities towards us have permanently ceased <e> <s> but the absence of such a declaration need not rule out other intermediate steps <e> <s> on the noble lords second point as i indicated in my original answer the swiss delivered our response to the argentine comments on our proposals but we have made it quite

precisely the kind of issue which we hope will be dealt with when we have established more normal bilateral relations with argentina <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first place i do not answer for mr haig <e> <s> as to the other points which the noble lord has made may i make it quite clear that it was the peruvian foreign minister dr javier arias stella who first told the british ambassador in lima what the peruvians had in mind <e> <s> this conversation took place four and a half hours after the general belgrano had been sunk unbeknown to either of them <e> <s> the ambassador immediately reported by telegram to london what the foreign minister had told him of the peruvian ideas and there was no question of mr wallace accepting them in principle <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his intervention <e> <s> i might add that rear-admiral lombardo also made it clear in the panorama programme that the general belgrano was involved in a pincer movement with orders to attack british ships and that when he ordered it to withdraw he ordered it to withdraw to its former position not to its home port <e> <s> all these statements are entirely consistent with the british governments account of the circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged for the question of the noble lord lord annan and i agree entirely with what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe

incidents would have a serious effect upon our relations and that we expected the libyan authorities to do everything in their power to prevent criminal acts by libyan residents in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may take the questions of the noble lord in the reverse order to which he put them and first say something about defence sales <e> <s> as the noble lord has noted i have referred to this subject <e> <s> there is of course strict control over the sale of arms and paramilitary equipment at home and overseas <e> <s> all such sales require export licences which are

equipment and of course the existing licences are being reviewed <e>", "<cs> my lords that is why the statement makes plain that we are taking unilateral and immediate action to strengthen our control over the operations of foreign missions in this country <e> <s> we are doing this while the review of the vienna convention is taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that there were four libyan premises in london <e> <s> diplomatic immunity on all four has ended but we have an obligation under the vienna convention to protect and respect the buildings <e> <s> of course the property which belongs to the libyan government now no longer enjoys diplomatic immunity <e> <s> there are no consulates outside london <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that arab countries as

states policy <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i apologise to my noble friend lord mountgarret <e> <s> i had meant to answer the question he put earlier on the statement read by my noble friend lord elton <e>

to strengthen our position <e> <s> i quote again from the statement <e>", "<cs> the meetings requested by the director and the president of the uganda evacuees association were for the purpose of discussing our policy towards private claims against the uganda government <e> <s> that policy is being challenged by the three applications for judicial review which are before the queens bench division of the high court and which are supported by an affidavit from the director of the uganda evacuees association <e> <s> in our view the matters which the senior officers of the association wished to discuss lay at the heart of this legal action and it would therefore clearly have been inappropriate to agree to a meeting with them on this basis <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as the first part of the noble lords supplementary question is concerned i have of course seen the estimates made by the fao but the fact is that it is never easy to quantify situations of this kind <e> <s> as i

supply of seeds and water hole boring and other such equipment which will all be part of the encouragement of greater self-sufficiency will be a central objective of european community aid under the next acp/ec conventions <e>", "<cs> my lords of course if there are particular voluntary organisations which the noble lord has in mind perhaps he would let me know and we could consider them <e> <s> as it is we are giving million which was announced in march which includes million for the league of red cross societies and million for various voluntary agency projects to fight drought <e> <s> i might add that we have also contributed to christian aid for use by the sudan council of churches for victims of the drought in northern ethiopia which i hope may go some way to answer the question asked by the noble lord lord avebury <e>", "<cs> my lords on ida as a government we have come out publicly in favour of the united states billion dollars replenishment and have urged it on other donors <e> <s> when the billion us dollars replenishment was agreed but not signed earlier on this year we rallied support for a supplementary fund of billion us dollars <e> <s> when the united states

to a written question to my noble friend lord drumalbyn <e> <s> i also confirm that the noble lord <e> <s> lord kennet raised with me privately the question that he has put down on the order paper

about help in the nicaraguan elections i can add nothing to my original answer <e> <s> it is not our normal practice to give this kind of aid to foreign countries <e> <s> there have of course been

climate of confidence in which force limitations and reductions would be easier to achieve <e> <s> we are doing this by trying to promote increased transparency of military activities thus making it more difficult to mount a surprise attack <e> <s> as far as the soviet union are concerned the best thing they could do would be to return to the negotiating table <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter has raised a very important point <e> <s> those who seek to see that these commitments are re-affirmed should of course be the first to abide by them and the situation in afghanistan illustrates what is currently happening <e>", "<cs> my lords we have made it clear repeatedly that no nato weapons nuclear or conventional will ever be used except in response to attack <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to confirm to my noble friend that nato is a defensive alliance <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated in my answer to the first supplementary question put by the noble lord lord jenkins we are actively pursuing measures at the stockholm conference and at the mbfr meetings we shall again be actively seeking to promote constructive measures on disarmament <e>", "<cs> yes my lords this would be helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that a supplementary question on the gulf war is wide of the <e>", "<cs> my lords we have called for the transcripts of the inquest which we shall be studying <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to the first part of the noble lords supplementary question i <e>", "<cs> my lords on the second part of the question of the noble lord lord grimond i can only refer to what i have already said <e> <s> we are confident that the embassy did everything in their power to help mr skinner <e> <s> in fact an embassy official could not and indeed would not keep him in the embassy against his will <e> <s> on the first part of the noble lords supplementary question i understand that as it has been in this case and in other cases it is possible to hold an inquest in this country following a death abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords i have indicated already that we believe that the embassy in moscow did everything that they could to help mr skinner <e> <s> he was offered safe accommodation and was repeatedly urged to stay with embassy staff until his departure <e>", "<cs> my lords that would be a question that would have to be determined in the light of developments <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is a request for a statement in his house or any matter governing parliamentary business this is always a matter for the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord lord jenkins has said but i think that i have said enough on the subject of mrs skinner to make quite clear what is the government attitude on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords successive british governments have published security advice about visits to communist countries most recently our predecessors in <e> <s> we see no reason to alter the advice that has been given <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this is a matter on which i should write to the noble lord lord grimond <e> <s> it is a legal point and i should not like to go into it on this occasion without taking further advice <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that i had made that statement <e> <s> i said that if there was a request that there should be some business in the house this is usually a matter for the usual channels but of course as i indicated originally the government would consider these points <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry that the noble and learned lord should be so very concerned about what i have said <e> <s> i made it quite plain that if we consider it to be appropriate we will make a statement <e> <s> at present we have asked for a full copy of the transcripts which we shall consider <e> <s> i am sure that the noble and learned lord would recognise that it would be very unwise in the present situation to make a commitment in advance of finding out what has been said <e> <s> we would use our judgment of course as to whether we thought this to be appropriate <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord puts down a question or asks for a statement that is his prerogative and these matters would always be determined in the way they normally are in the business of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply do not understand what lies behind a supplementary question like that <e> <s> i have been very careful in what i have said to the house because we are in a situation in which we are still considering a matter <e> <s> when we have considered it if it is appropriate we will make a statement <e> <s> but when we have not considered it i think that it is unwise to make promises in a situation like this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am

question on th april the south african minister of justice nullified an application brought by persons including three bishops for an inquiry into their detention and minister coetzee declared that that would not be in the national interest <e> <s> on the second point about detainees the south african government are well aware of our concern on human rights <e> <s> we have recently made specific representations about the cassinga detainees <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord beloff makes a good point <e> <s> but i am sure that my right honourable friend the prime minister will make

government have made it plain that they do not support the policy of apartheid <e> <s> we do believe that it will be useful to have talks with mr botha with a view to making progress on issues of the kind that have been discussed in your lordships house today <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made it clear on more than one occasion in answering questions that we have made our concern about this matter clear to the south african government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord paget introduced a debate today on zimbabwe in a speech that went well beyond the motion he has down on the order paper <e> <s> may i say at once that the government condemn the violation of human rights wherever it may occur <e> <s> in the course of my remarks this afternoon i shall refer to the steps we have taken to make the zimbabwean government aware of our concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with most of the points that the noble lord has raised <e> <s> i can confirm that the present level of aid is over million in the year and that it represents over for each inhabitant on the island <e> <s> indeed the unique economic problems are recognised in the substantial programme which clearly demonstrates our support for the island <e> <s> the projects that are supported include expansion of agriculture forestry and fisheries <e> <s> with regard to the noble lords second question about increased immigration into the united kingdom i can confirm that the special dependent territories work permits quota is subject to regular review and the needs of st helena are taken fully into account <e>", "<cs> my lords a large part of our development aid programme is designed to be labour intensive which alleviates considerably the problems of unemployment <e> <s> we are exploring the possibilities of other employment elsewhere including the falkland islands <e> <s> so far as employment on ascension island is concerned there are at present st helenans employed on ascension island but this figure is likely to be reduced over the next year or two as construction projects are completed <e>", "<cs> my lords we intend to make suitable provision for the continuation of additional support for overseas students in which is the last year to which present public expenditure plans extend <e> <s> i cannot yet say however how much money can be made available <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord greenhill will be aware why i cannot give the figures <e> <s> under the pes arrangements we only look three years ahead <e> <s> but it is our hope of course that the numbers of students that can be helped will be maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mulley may like to know that additional awards were made under these schemes in and it is estimated this figure will increase to in the year <e> <s> we believe that this is a measurable contribution to providing help for students from overseas to study in our educational institutions <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will know indeed he has answered the second part of his question the reason for the treatment of students from the community is that it is part of the agreements made under the treaty of rome <e> <s> in regard to commonwealth students he may like to know that under the various schemes including the foreign and commonwealth scheme there are now students from malaysia from cyprus from hong kong and from other dependent territories <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that students have to pay the full economic cost of the course <e> <s> but <e>", "<cs> my lords yes they do come from both parts <e> <s> there are both greek cypriots and turkish cypriots <e> <s> without notice i cannot give the exact numbers <e>", "<cs> no my lords i did not say that <e> <s> i quoted these as quite specific countries that have been helped under specific schemes <e> <s> of course there are students from african countries who are benefiting from the foreign and commonwealth office scheme and from other schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords this funding to which the question is directed which is the funding from the foreign and commonwealth office is an fco matter <e> <s> but it is something which is done on behalf of the government and we recognise the benefits that come both to the students themselves and to our commercial interests among other interests <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that there may well be funding which goes into other trusts but the issue of the question is the fco scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have made it quite plain that they think it is very important that we should have the schemes which have been introduced <e> <s> we believe them to be very valuable and we welcome the fact that there are now a number of students studying in our educational institutions as a consequence of this <e> <s> what we have said is that we cannot make an open-ended commitment we cannot afford to make an open-ended commitment to the situation which existed before the full-cost fees were introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might write to the noble baroness on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the whole house will be grateful to the noble lord lord brimelow for introducing this debate today <e> <s> i am grateful too for the opportunity provided by the select committees report to stress the importance that the government attach to the current negotiations on a successor to the second lom convention <e> <s> your lordships will notice that i like the noble lord lord brimelow deliberately avoid the shorthand lom iii because no decision has vet been taken as to where the next convention will be signed <e> <s> that will be a matter for the african caribbean and pacific states to decide among themselves but the government would certainly be happy to see a commonwealth country act as host to the signing ceremony <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a most useful debate concentrating as it has on the many important issues in the current negotiations <e> <s> i very much welcome the support which the select committee has given to the governments approach <e> <s> a very wide range of issues has been raised this afternoon <e> <s> many of your lordships have said that in the next convention priority should be given to supporting agriculture <e> <s> the community must get away from prestige projects which commissioner pisani has graphically termed cathedrals of the desert and which are of little relevance to the vast bulk of acp populations <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had answered that in the reply that i made to the noble lord lord kissin when i talked about the common agricultural policy <e> <s> on innumerable occasions the government have made it perfectly plain that we are working for a reform of this policy <e> <s> what the noble lord lord hatch is i think concerned about is the effect of the common agricultural policy to which as a member of the european community we belong <e> <s> on the agricultural economies of acp countries <e>", "<cs> and the prices as well my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated i think it was in response to the point raised both by the noble lord lord banks and the noble lord lord oram on the amounts of money that were involved in this we have not yet taken a decision on this matter <e> <s> the most important question on the edf is how it is going to be used and i think it would be better to let the discussion rest at that point <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> a number of individuals and ngos have written to the government <e> <s> we are conscious of their wish to see the matter settled <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i cannot give an answer to that question but i will write to the noble lord on that particular point <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness will know the convention is broad in scope and government departments have been considering its provisions in the light of our existing law and practice <e> <s> because we take our obligations under the convention seriously this is time-consuming but the process is at an advanced stage <e> <s> perhaps i might remind the noble baroness lady lockwood that it took four years to ratify the international convention on human rights after we had signed it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord diamond has actually answered his own question <e>", "<cs> my lords we have taken every suitable opportunity to urge iran and iraq to end this wasteful conflict and to settle their differences by peaceful means <e> <s> following the recent series of attacks on shipping in the gulf we have made efforts both through the european community and at the united nations to prevent further escalation and to bring an early end to the conflict <e> <s> we welcome the acceptance by both sides of the united nations secretary generals appeal to stop attacking civilian centres of population <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already indicated in the reply to the question which the noble lord lord molloy has raised we view this as a very serious matter <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the community the ten including ourselves delivered messages to the iranian and iraq authorities on both th and st may urging restraint and emphasing the need to preserve freedom of navigation in the gulf <e> <s> we were pleased that on st june the united nations security council adopted a resolution calling on all states to respect in accordance with international law the right of freedom of navigation <e> <s> so far as nato is concerned events in the midldle east do not come under the purview of nato but naturally we are in close touch with our main nato partners over developments in the gulf <e> <s> i cannot say whether this matter is an item on the agenda of the foreign ministers consultations tomorrow but it is naturally a matter which has been discussed and is continually discussed between our own secretary of state and the foreign ministers of the ten <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord cledwyn will know that the gulf war was discussed at the summit conference and we hope of course that a solution to it will be found by diplomatic means <e> <s> on his specific point about shipping we issued warnings to british shipping on both th and rd may about the heightened risks of operating in the upper gulf <e> <s> after the first warning the general council of british shipping announced that the war-risk zone in the upper gulf had been considerably extended <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it would be premature to talk about any kind of military intervention <e> <s> we hope and believe that the crisis can be managed by diplomatic means <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord molloy for his remarks <e> <s> we shall of course support any serious attempt at mediation aimed at ending the conflict between iran and iraq especially through the good office of the secretary general of the united nations <e> <s> however there is still no sign that the iranians are ready to accept offers to negotiate a peaceful settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not accept the first part of the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> on the second part he may have noticed that in the statement that followed the london economic summit in regard to the declaration on east-west relations and arms control it was said by the seven powers which took part <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with what my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter says <e> <s> we wish very much that the soviet union would return to the negotiating table

noticed from the london economic summit that the united states has offered to re-start nuclear arms control talks anywhere at any time without pre-conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords it must be remembered that the british and french nuclear missiles are only a very small percentage of the total nuclear missiles in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords we should like to negotiate <e> <s> the unfortunate fact is that the soviet union has left the negotiating table at both the inf and the start negotiations <e> <s> we want to get the numbers down but we can do this only with a balanced agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have indicated the total numbers of sss went up at that period <e> <s> the moratorium was on the numbers of bases <e>", "<cs> my lords those were the figures that i gave in my original answer <e> <s> in fact there were about ss warheads in place over of them facing europe before nato installed a single comparable missile <e>", "<cs> my lords if we have the figure i shall write to the noble lord on that <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very serious matter <e> <s> it is not and should not be described as something like the numbers game <e> <s> the fact is that in stockholm we have proposed concrete measures which would build security and confidence which could then lead we hope to some prospect of disarmament <e> <s> the soviet union has left both the inf and the start negotiations <e> <s> we should like it to come back and we should appreciate any influence that can be brought to bear on this matter <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord might discuss with his friends in moscow who perhaps would have influence <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for foreign affairs is going to moscow and i have no doubt that these serious matters will be discussed then <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated in my original answer to the noble lord we have repeatedly made clear to the soviet authorities our concern about the treatment of dr sakharov <e> <s> as i am sure the noble lord will appreciate it would not he appropriate for me to disclose any particular points of an agenda which my right honourable friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary might raise when he visits moscow in july but clearly my right honourable friend will have these developments in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made clear in your lordships house on several occasions that her majestys government condemn the violation of human rights wherever this may occur <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not absolutely clear that i followed the precise question the noble lord has asked but we have in the case of dr sakharov and mrs bonner followed events very closely and we have repeatedly made our views known to the soviet authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lords first supplementary question i think that i did make clear that although it would not be appropriate to disclose the detailed points of an agenda in advance of the visit to moscow by my right honourable friend i have no doubt that he will have in mind the developments that have been raised by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first part of the noble lords supplementary question is that i thought i was specific <e> <s> i said that my right honourable and learned friend had discussed nicaragua on th june with secretary shultz <e>

economic reform efforts have been threatened by externally-aided insurgency and terrorism <e> <s> if this insurgency stops the united states military protection will be no longer needed <e> <s> with regard to the point concerning the visit of mr ortega i could not comment on that <e>", "<cs> my lords the united states government have repeatedly stated that they wish to see political reform in central america through peaceful means and we support that objective <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that we have established a post in managua <e> <s> we see this as an important contribution to getting more information about this part of the world <e> <s> on the noble lords second supplementary as i have indicated we have supported the objectives of the united states policy in central america though we have made clear that we deplore the mining of the nicaraguan ports and we have made our concern on this matter clear to the united states government <e> <s> we understand that an election will take place in nicaragua on th november <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for asking that question <e> <s> as regards the elections in el salvador we were pleased to see the election of president duarte <e> <s> we have published the reports by our two observers on both the first and the second election <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend that they are very

countries <e> <s> it is not for me to comment on the activities of the american government <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement on the foreign affairs council meeting in luxembourg on th and th june which is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs <e> <s> the statement is as follows i will with permission mr speaker make a statement on the outcome of the foreign affairs council which met in luxembourg on the th and th of june <e> <s> i represented the united kingdom

should be possible to resolve the remaining differences <e> <s> all sides have moved and what is now needed is one more move to clinch the agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments view on the question of the loan is that we want to see the expenditure of the community brought under control including of course the agricultural expenditure <e> <s> we also wish to see a final settlement of our own budget questions which have been the subject of all this negotiation before we can consider any increase in the communitys own resources the problem which the whole question of the loan is designed to relieve <e>", "<cs> my lords we should like to make progress at this conference and the united kingdom and the nato powers have made proposals which are designed to reduce tension and the danger of surprise attack through increased openness about normal patterns of military behaviour <e> <s> the soviet union proposals which were formally tabled on th may include a treaty on the no first use of force a declaration on the no first use of nuclear weapons a reduction in military budgets a ban on chemical weapons in europe nuclear weapon-free zones and some suggestions for building

right away in response to the noble lord lord cledwyn that my right honourable and learned friend the secretary of state went as the british foreign secretary and was speaking for britain <e>", "<cs>

kilgerran has raised we do see possibilities for increased trade between the two countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble lord has some specific case in mind but if he would care

intervention <e> <s> his observation is i believe a very wise one <e> <s> my noble friend will know from his own experience that it takes a long time before these kinds of negotiations and discussions

community while the frontier is only partially open <e>", "<cs> my lords as we have made plain on a number of occasions we believe in the full implementation of the lisbon agreement whereby there would be the full opening of the frontier between spain and gibraltar <e> <s> as i have indicated we wish spain to become a member of the european community and we think that it would be inconceivable that this would be the case unless the frontier betwen spain and gibraltar was fully open <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer to the question we recognise that the present partial opening of the frontier is having a detrimental effect upon gibraltar <e> <s> my right honourable and learned friend has had a number of meetings with the spanish foreign minister senor morn and will see him again in september <e> <s> this is clearly one of a number of matters which are discussed <e>", "<cs> i cannot without notice give figures on the point about which the noble lord asks <e> <s> the british government recognise that at the present time there are real transitional problems for gibraltar in the changeover of the dockyard from a naval dockyard to a commercial dockyard <e> <s> it is in recognition of those difficulties that the british government have given million in aid for the dockyard have guaranteed million for other work to the dockyard and have given this on top of the million in aid in the years from to <e>", "<cs> my lords the government wish to see spanish accession to the community <e> <s> i have made plain our position on the opening of the frontier and i think that it would be very unwise to answer what is after all a hypothetical question <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i should like to thank both noble lords for their response to the statement <e> <s> i should like particularly to thank the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones for what he said in this very difficult situation <e> <s> his remarks were very helpful in setting out the views in all parts of the house on this matter <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for not pressing me on the particulars of the case which i would not be in a position to give <e> <s> i am grateful that he has endorsed the governments request to the nigerian high commissioner to co-operate fully with the police in their inquiries on this matter <e> <s> we hope that we shall receive an early response to this request that has been made by the foreign and commonwealth office <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer i think to that question is that there has been no further explanation <e> <s> we are of course glad that there is now once again normal air traffic between the united kingdom and nigeria <e>", "<cs> my lords the present statement of the nigerian government to the reaction of our calling in the nigerian high commissioner is that they have publicly denied any involvement in this affair at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i am not able to answer that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the case to which the noble lord <e> <s> lord pitt has drawn attention <e> <s> i shall study carefully what he has said and draw it to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the noble lords last question <e> <s> i can confirm that my right honourable friend the minister for overseas development is at the geneva conference <e> <s> it was at that conference that he made the announcement concerning the extra money which i indicated in my original answer <e> <s> i hope that will indicate to the noble lord the importance that we attach to the conference <e>", "<cs> i assume that the long-term projects to which the noble lord refers are the projects for which funding is now being sought at icara ii <e> <s> i can confirm that to the extent that the non-governmental organisations concerned wish to implement the projects on that list and the government are satisfied that the project in question is well conceived then we would support it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we are concerned about the plight of the refugees to which the noble viscount has made reference <e> <s> most of the concentrations of refugees are in the horn of africa as well as in the sudan uganda ruanda burundi zaire and tanzania <e> <s> as the noble viscount will be aware we have just announced this extra million of money and we do give million each year in money and in food aid <e> <s> we make a further contribution through the community to which we contribute per cent <e> <s> of the cost <e> <s> and in response to special appeals in we have contributed million <e>", "<cs> i do not have available information about the sums of money that we give by way of overseas aid to those particular countries <e> <s> i have already indicated in answer to an earlier question the countries which have the highest concentrations of refugees in africa <e> <s> as my noble friend has said they are some of the poorest <e> <s> in this connection i should like to point out that in respect of the extra money we have announced today we are looking to schemes which will enable refugees to settle more successfully in the countries in which they have sought asylum and in which they will be encouraged by self-help schemes to support themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad of the support which the noble lord has given to this announcement <e>", "<cs> my lords we are of course aware of the concerns and the views of the people of hong kong <e> <s> indeed there is a continuous process of consultation with the people of hong kong on all matters relating to the territorys future <e> <s> a wide range of channels has evolved through which people make known their views <e> <s> we value our regular discussions with the governor and the unofficial members of the executive council <e> <s> in addition there are ministerial visits to hong kong and the reception of hong kong delegations to london <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord has to say but of course all matters of detailed discussion in the negotiations which are still going on are confidential <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to be able to reassure my noble friend that we shall continue to fulfil our responsibilities in the period up to <e> <s> we shall continue to provide the framework within which the hong kong government can administer the territory and plan for its future <e>", "<cs> my lords if i might take the last point first i would say that my right honourable friend will be continuing his series of discussions with the chinese foreign minister and with other chinese leaders on all aspects of hong kongs future <e> <s> his purpose is to carry the talks forward at the highest level <e> <s> on the other point that the noble lord raised i would refer him to the answer that was given yesterday in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> we are seeking by the publication of the green paper to set out the tests of acceptability to an agreement in hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords he will be going to hong kong and he will be continuing his discussions with people in hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be aware of the publication of the green paper which <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already indicated in an earlier answer to the noble lord lord fanshawe that in the interim and transitional period up to we shall continue to provide the framework within which the hong kong government can administer the territory <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his question <e> <s> it is of course our wish to maintain both the stability and the prosperity of hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will bear in mind the concerns of the churches along with the concerns that have been expressed by other people in hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both noble lords lord cledwyn and lord gladwyn for the reception of this statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord cledwyn has said that he regretted the breakdown of the negotiations as indeed do her majestys government <e> <s> but i was glad to hear him say that he supports the practical issues on which we have sought to have better bilateral relations with argentina <e> <s> he asked what the next moves are and whether are we to resume negotiations i think that the noble lord would agree that at the present time the need is to pause and reflect over these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have indicated these matters are in writing and i will certainly consider what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his intervention <e> <s> he has raised of course the most important point on this matter <e> <s> as i have indicated we are not prepared to negotiate sovereignty <e>", "<cs> my lords the record will show that her majestys government have taken a number of steps since july to try to improve relations with argentina <e> <s> in answer to the second point that the noble lord has raised it is precisely because we wish to get into more normal relations with argentina that we have been searching diligently over the past six months to find a way in which we could do so <e> <s> it is therefore a matter of regret that the talks have now broken down <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have made the governments position on the question of sovereignty quite plain and i note the other point which the noble lord has made <e>", "<cs> my lords we are confident of our position on sovereignty and we do not consider it necessary to refer this matter to the international court of justice <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord has said <e> <s> but i believe that the whole house will recognise what our position on sovereignty is and will recognise that although before we were in fact negotiating on this point the truth of the matter is that the argentine government have to live with the effects of the invasion and the consequences of it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i take the point of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first part of the question of the noble lord is that it really is too early to say but the answer to the second point is that we believe that we are capable of fulfilling our obligations to the falkland islanders <e>", "<cs> my lords we greatly regret the fact that the talks have broken down <e> <s> we greatly regret the implications of this as indicated by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> we judge united nations disarmament resolutions on their potential contribution to negotiated arms control measures <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his question <e> <s> in fact over half the resolutions dealing with nuclear issues which we voted against were sponsored or co-sponsored by members of the warsaw pact <e> <s> the remaining were unsatisfactory because they were contrary to our position on key issues such as the comprehensive test ban nuclear freeze no-first-use and deterrents <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the question of the noble lord lord jenkins is that the reason we did not support the soviet proposal for the condemnation of a nuclear war was that we need to prevent all war not just nuclear war <e> <s> on the question of a nuclear freeze the freeze in inf at current levels would be unacceptable given the massive soviet superiority <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord said in the first part of his supplementary <e> <s> it is true that because there is no extradition treaty in force with spain it is not possible for any fugitive criminal to be extradited from spain to the united kingdom at the present time <e> <s> but we accept that this is an urgent matter and as my original answer made clear we are addressing ourselves to it <e>", "<cs> my lords our own extradition act is over a century old as the noble lord made clear and in need of revision <e> <s> the extent to which it should be revised is likely to prove controversial <e> <s> however my right honourable friend the home secretary has stated his intention to issue a consultative green paper later this year to see whether some consensus can be achieved <e> <s> we shall then consider what changes in the law should be made <e>", "<cs> my lords as i hope i indicated in my original answer we are addressing ourselves to this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right the united kingdom is not a party to this convention <e> <s> we do however have bilateral arrangements with all states which are parties to the convention except lichtenstein turkey and spain <e> <s> adherence to the convention would override those other arrangements <e> <s> were we to ratify on the basis of the extradition act the one currently in force we would have to make a number of reservations including one in respect of our <e>", "<cs> my lords we have power to limit the size of certain missions and sometimes we exercise it but we need always to have in mind the reciprocal implications for our own missions abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first part of the noble lords supplementary question perhaps i could refer him to the statement of my right honourable and learned friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary to the foreign affairs committee on <e>", "<cs> my lords his full statement will be published when the proceedings are published <e> <s> they were of course as with all statements of this nature open to the press and there have been reports in the press <e> <s> he went through many of the problems which have been raised both in this house and in another place regarding the vienna convention <e>", "<cs> not without notice my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very interesting question but i really think that the noble lord lord leatherland will agree that it is outside the terms of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords we are concerned over reports of the continued detention in taiwan of people imprisoned for political reasons but we do not have details of the case of the reverend drkao <e> <s> we are not ourselves in a position to make inquiries as we and the united states have no official relations with the authorities in taiwan <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the strong feelings of the noble lord in this matter but i hope that he will understand the situation as i have described it in my answer to his original question <e> <s> british representatives overseas have instructions to report on the human rights position in the countries in which they operate but as i have already indicated <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course a question for the united states government as to whether or not they would make representations but as i indicated in my original answer the united states have no official representation in taiwan <e>", "<cs> my lords in the case of united kingdom citizens in taiwan they should be aware before travelling to taiwan that there is no british consular representation there of any kind and if there was a british citizen who was in difficulties and if the noble lord or any other noble lord had particulars of the case that would be a matter i could look into <e> <s> we are of course not concerned in this particular case with a british citizen and as i have indicated we have no representation there and therefore we cannot take up this particular case <e>", "<cs> my lords of course it is the right of any member of your lordships house to put down such a question and clearly if i could give a more helpful or forthcoming answer i would do so because i recognise the concern that has been expressed by the noble viscount lord ingleby by the noble lord lord cledwyn by the noble lord lord taylor and by the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> the fact is that it is not a question of whether or not we have any <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat the answer which has been given to a private notice question in another place on the european community refunds <e> <s> the answer is as follows our refunds totalling million were agreed by the heads of government at the european council in stuttgart over a year ago <e> <s> two principal steps were needed before the refunds could be paid approval by member states of the necessary implementing regulations and agreement by the european parliament to transfer the sums concerned from the reserve chapter of the budget <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both the noble lords lord cledwyn and lord gladwyn for their response to this answer <e> <s> i should like to make it quite clear that the difficulty and the quarrel that we have arises not with the other member states of the community but with the parliament which has voted in that way <e> <s> i am glad that there has been a recognition by both noble lords of that point <e>", "<cs> my lords of course this question that my noble friend has asked is very important <e> <s> in a way it relates to whether or not the parliaments action is illegal <e> <s> that was a question that was asked by the noble lord lord gladwyn <e> <s> the answer is that this is a question about which the community lawyers could argue for years <e> <s> we do not want to put ourselves into that position <e> <s> what we want is to have our refunds paid <e> <s> we shall do this because ultimately we do not believe that the parliament will stand against the rest of the community and that it will not stand against an agreement which was reached under chancellor kohls presidency of the community and was endorsed under president mitterrands presidency and was agreed at the fontainbleau summit <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lady elles very much for the remarks that she has made <e> <s> we know that the british members of the european parliament have spoken out vigorously against this decision that was taken <e> <s> i am well aware of the very important and valuable role taken by my noble friend lady elles herself on this matter <e> <s> we are glad to hear what she has to say <e> <s> we do of course hope that there will be a settlement of this issue in september <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bruce of donington has raised a number of points <e> <s> i would not wish to add anything to what i have already said on the question of whether or not the parliaments action is illegal but i have noted what he has to say <e> <s> i do not think that there is any member of her majestys government who would not agree that there have been occasions in which we have been in a minority of one in the european community because we have been standing up for principles which we believe to have been right <e>", "<cs> my lords it has always been envisaged that our refunds would be paid in on the revenue side of the budget that is as part of the revised own resources decision <e> <s> on the particular point that my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne has raised on the disposal of butter this is a possibility and it is one about which we have expressed our concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not have given the answer that i did when the question was originally asked if i had not had advice from lawyers <e> <s> the answer is therefore that this is a matter on which lawyers have given an opinion <e> <s> the opinion is that it is an issue on which community lawyers could argue for many years <e> <s> in fact we do not want that we want our refund <e> <s> that is what we want <e> <s> that is what we hope we are going to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords we hope of course that when the european parliament reassembles it will reconsider this matter <e> <s> my noble friend lady elles said that this was a matter that could be considered in september and the parliament will be meeting at times for the rest of this year <e> <s> if the noble lord lord cledwyn is suggesting that we should withhold it is one of the suggestions that has been made that is something on which it would not be proper for me to speculate at the present time <e> <s> what is clear in all this issue as i made plain right at the beginning is that the community heads of government have entered into a commitment that all the community institutions except one are ready to honour that commitment and that it is only the parliament that is at odds not just with britain but with all the other member states <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not think that i can add anything on this point to the answers i have already given <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer to the noble lord lord diamond is that the world is full of injustices and unfairnesses <e> <s> i think that if one were to ask someone like my husband he would say how unfair it was that when i was given a life peerage he got nothing whereas if he had been given a life peerage i would have got a title <e>", "<cs> my lords whether or not the noble lord lord diamond chooses to introduce a private members bill on this subject is of course a matter for him <e>", "<cs> my lords the short answer to the noble lord lord jenkins is that it is not my own view that that would be the case nor is it the governments view on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to assure the noble viscount lord ingleby that the government will do nothing that could undermine the family <e> <s> i have seen the arguments that he has adduced and i should like to say to him that we agree with certain of the doubts that have been expressed about the convention <e> <s> we would intend to deal with these by a declaration of interpretation or by reservations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the noble lord is right in referring to anyone as a life peeress <e> <s> i look on myself as a life peer <e> <s> but i agree with him that far from talking about equality i have always believed in the natural superiority of women over men <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot possibly of course speak for the noble baronesss husband but i am not sure that all husbands would wish to be so described <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i think that george bernard shaw drew attention to this point in his play <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that the government take seriously the points that have been raised by the noble viscount lord ingleby <e> <s> it is for that reason that we are considering them and we would enter a reservation on those points before ratifying the convention <e>", "<cs> my lords that is something that would take a very long time to ascertain and a great deal of historical research would be required <e> <s> i think we should find that it cost more than the amount which is usually allowable in answering parliamentary questions <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the position is as i have described it <e> <s> of course we hope that the decisions can be taken unanimously <e> <s> it may be that the position will arise as hinted by the noble lord but that is a hypothetical situation and we do not quite know <e> <s> i accept that it is an important point but as i said we hope that the decisions will be taken unanimously <e>", "<cs> my lods i understand the point that the noble lord is making <e> <s> perhaps he will allow me to write to him on whether or not this is something where each individual country can determine what it should do <e> <s> i shall contact the noble lord on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords we are fully aware of the close links between four of the original sponsors and five of the current members of the so-called generals group and the world peace council <e> <s> dr gerhard kade their co-ordinator until last year is also an official of the world peace council in helsinki and of its subsidiary the international institute for peace in vienna <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> these retired officers from nato countries in no sense represent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the point that my noble friend has made <e> <s> the fact is that in this country we have a tradition of responsible newspapers printing relevant facts and any lapses from such a high standard would be regrettable <e>", "<cs> my lords in a free society the officer in question is as entitled to express his views as anybody else <e> <s> but it is a dangerous matter when the suggestion is made that these people are speaking on behalf of nato or the nato allies or are writing on their behalf when in fact they are retired generals <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that in any of the exchanges that have taken place across the floor of the house this afternoon anyone has described brigadier harbottle in those terms <e> <s> what the noble lord lord chalfont drew attention to was the link between this organisation and the world peace council which i have supported <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not discussing the record of any particular person <e> <s> the point that has been made in this exchange is that there is a link between this organisation and the world peace council <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i would agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to show that the policy of generals for peace and the policy of her majestys opposition are the same <e> <s> i should have thought that there were divided views on that matter <e> <s> i would hope that that was the case <e>", "<cs> my lords there are very strict rules regulating the conduct of registered charities particularly regarding activities of a political character <e> <s> the points that my noble friend has made if valid are no doubt for the consideration of the charity commissioners or for my right honourable and learned friend the attorney-general <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the points that the noble lord lord chalfont has made <e> <s> in fact the meetings which have taken place and the third meeting which has recently taken place in vienna have in many respects been gifts to soviet propaganda <e> <s> in practice these meetings have been stage managed by the soviet-controlled international institute for peace the vienna counterpart of the world peace council in helsinki from whose former offices it operates <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we all agree that we should know our enemies <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones for his welcome to this order <e> <s> the negotiations with greenland were long and far from easy coinciding as they did with the closing stages of the communitys negotiations on a common fisheries policy <e> <s> but we believe that this order is fair <e>", "<cs> my lords our debate today is about foreign affairs and defence but before turning to those two matters i should like to wish both maiden speakers well first my noble friend lord eden of winton and secondly the noble lord lord moran <e> <s> we shall look forward to hearing what they have to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i think

the government share the widespread international concern felt both about the situation in nicaragua and about the tensions and instability in central america as a whole to which noble lords have drawn attention in the debate this evening <e> <s> we recognise that these derive in large measure from the social and economic conditions which have existed in the region for many years <e> <s> but we also believe that the <e>", "<cs> my lords we sent observers to el salvador and i am sure that the noble lord lord walston will have read their report <e> <s> we did believe that in fact there was

may be interested to hear for example that the socialist international hardly i think an organisation which could be regarded as right-wing said and i quote <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not their quotation after the elections but if i may say so to the noble lord lord kennet the whole point of the argument is what happened during the election campaign really whether or not the elections were free and fair <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure if the noble lord lord cledwyn cares to reflect over our history that we have always been as he describes it relaxed about what has happened for example in <e>", "<cs> my lords i would say to the noble lord lord kennet that i think that when you are looking at a country that is very near to your borders and you believe that it has a government which is not supportive of you or not in agreement with you you are going to be concerned <e> <s> the united states is inevitably concerned about what goes on in central america and it is a concern that we should recognise <e> <s> instability and an increase in soviet influence in the region cannot but have an impact upon our own and wider western interests <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both the noble lord lord cledwyn and the noble lord lord gladwyn for their reception of this statement and for their sympathies which will be conveyed <e> <s> on the first of the two points

negotiations between my right honourable and learned friend and sr moran made clear we have made it absolutely plain that we will stand by and maintain our commitment to honour the wishes of the people of gibraltar <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the first question raised by the noble lord lord kilmarnock the fact is that spain is going to join the community and we do not anticipate any other answer than that <e> <s> on the second point yes the rights are reciprocal <e> <s> they are for spaniards in gibraltar and for gibraltarians in spain <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord molloy that the loyalty of the gibraltarians has been very great and it is something which britain has recognised and continues to recognise <e> <s> as regards consultation the chief minister sir joshua hassan has been consulted as the statement made clear at each step in these negotiations and he will be fully brought into the future negotiations which will be held on other

about it <e> <s> of course the government recognise the importance of gibraltar and the long historic association between gibraltar and britain <e> <s> it is in recognition of that that we have given

commercialisation of the dockyard <e> <s> as i indicated to him in the answer to my original question quite a proportion of the million aid framework money will go towards infrastructure which of

increase of per cent <e> <s> over <e> <s> over the three years to overseas aid will have increased in cost terms <e> <s> on the second point the noble lord made the government believe that in the

made to emergency relief <e> <s> i am glad to confirm that so far during this financial year britain has contributed approximately million in emergency assistance to sub-saharan africa including our share of community aid <e> <s> since october we have contributed million in emergency assistance to ethiopia <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a recognition of the understanding that the british people have for those who are suffering so much from drought in sub-saharan africa that these very large sums of money have been raised <e> <s> the government recognise how valuable is this contribution and what it indicates about the view of the british public <e> <s> as i have already indicated the government have themselves made a major contribution to relieving the distress caused by the drought in africa <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what my noble friend says <e> <s> all new multilateral commitments are looked at critically and on their merits and we must of course be concerned about the effectiveness of the agencies to which we give money <e> <s> but i should like to assure my noble friend that we value the substantial bilateral aid programme which is in fact larger than the multilateral aid programme as part of the wider political relations with friendly developing countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not accept what the noble lord lord oram says <e> <s> if he looks at the figures he will see that the amount of aid as a percentage of gnp in was said to be per cent <e> <s> but that does not reflect the level of aid expenditure in that year <e> <s> in actual aid spending terms the figure was about per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is rather wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> what is undoubtedly true is that it is very important that the government should get the economy right so that we have should we wish more money for a great many desirable objectives <e> <s> that has been the underlying purpose of their economic policies <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i should like to make that particular comparison but on the expenditure of aid money as with all other public money the government try to ensure that the money goes to the purposes for which parliament ask for it <e>", "<cs> my lords what i said was that aid this year shows a cash increase of per cent <e> <s> over <e> <s> i said that over the three years from to it will have increased in cost terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we could debate for a very long time what is the first duty of a government but i would not i am afraid accept the definition given by the noble lord lord brockway <e> <s> the british government are in present circumstances maintaining the level of aid as was set out in the public expenditure white paper <e> <s> we could argue about whether it should be a great deal more but as i have already indicated in present circumstances we believe that this a very fair result <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord thorneycroft for his intervention and to say that i entirely agree with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i would accept that aid has fallen as a percentage of gnp but may i say so far as the united kingdoms performance is concerned that of the major aid donors we are ahead of the united states japan and italy although i accept below france and germany <e> <s> in absolute terms we have the fifth largest programme and within the european community the third largest programme to which we contribute approximately per cent <e> <s> on the other point about trade of course the government believe in world economic recovery and we also believe that growth in international trade would be helpful both to ourselves and to the developing countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the concern of the noble lord lord cledwyn and indeed the views that have been expressed by other noble lords about the strength of feeling over the links between st helena and britain <e> <s> however it is only right that i should make the position of her majestys government quite clear on this issue <e> <s> the british nationality act has only recently become law and as i have indicated the government have no present

clear that it is the commissions responsibility to manage community aid funds and the rules for community aid require that the economically most advantageous offer be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords it

received advice from the three independent consultants <e> <s> the commission believes that liat will need assurances about delivery times and other conditions which it is by no means certain that

and distressing situation <e> <s> as i have already indicated in the answer that i originally gave to him my right honourable friend the minister for overseas development has let it be known today that he is giving another million in aid as a recognition of the seriousness with which we take this situation <e> <s> we have given it to the high commissioner for refugees because we believe that this is the quickest and most cost effective way so that food supplies can be bought locally in order to ensure the quickest possible relief to those who are suffering <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the important point that the noble lord lord walston is raising <e> <s> but as he indicated himself one of the major problems in this areas is that we are dealing with an independent country ethiopia in which there is a civil war <e> <s> it is therefore not easy either to get the aid where it is required or indeed necessarily to know exactly where the next area of difficulty will break out very tragic though the whole situation is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to confirm to the noble lord that the million which was given to ethiopia and other drought-stricken countries in africa as well as the extra money that had been given in this particular situation have come out of the contingency fund which of course is there specifically for disasters and unforeseen expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords the problem of distribution is a very difficult one as i have already indicated but the aid is frequently given and distributed through voluntary organisations <e> <s> in this particular case we have made the money available to the united nations high commissioner for refugees <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously it will be as soon as possible <e> <s> but as i have already indicated the reason for giving the money direct to the high commissioner is that we believe that the most effective way of getting the food to the people who require it is to buy it locally so that the distribution time and length of journey is much reduced <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that there is an urgent need for early progress and we shall remain active and ready to support initiatives by the parties <e>", "<cs> my

there should be the involvement of the united states in any solution in the middle east <e>", "<cs> my lords the soviet union too clearly has an interest in peace in the middle east <e>", "<cs> my

committee and of course the government will be putting forward their considered response <e> <s> as to his last point of course in all matters concerning dependent territories parliament is the supreme authority <e>", "<cs> my lords as the government have made plain on very many occasions we should like to have better bilateral relations with argentina <e> <s> we tried to achieve this in the very long and detailed negotiations that went on leading up to the final meeting in berne last july <e> <s> it was a matter of great regret to the government that the agreement was broken but the government are quite clear that they are not prepared to negotiate sovereignty <e>", "<cs> my lords no this has not been a matter which has been considered at all <e> <s> indeed the government have already taken a number of what we believe are helpful and positive steps with the idea of getting ourselves back to more normal bilateral relations with argentina <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first of the noble lords questions is as i have already indicated we wish to have more normal bilateral relations with argentina <e> <s> it was to our great regret that the talks broke down in berne <e> <s> they were established with the agreement of the argentine government on the basis that the argentines would have the right to raise the subject of sovereignty we would say that we were not prepared to discuss it and we would then move on to other topics <e> <s> it was a matter of great regret that this agreement was broken and that the argentine government have insisted that sovereignty must be discussed along with any other issues that we should like to discuss with them <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already indicated in answer to the question raised by the noble lord lord hatch in all matters regarding dependent territories the ultimate authority must be parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords in answering both my noble friend lord onslow and an earlier question i think it might be helpful to confirm that the government have agreed that the human rights chapter of the new constitution for the falkland islands should have in its preamble a reaffirmation of the islanders right to self-determination <e> <s> the wording repeats the provisions regarding self-determination in article i of the international covenant on civil and political rights <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a proposal which i recognise has been raised on a number of occasions that we should lift the protection zone in exchange for argentina agreeing that there should be a cessation of hostilities <e> <s> we have always made it plain that we do not see that one necessarily follows from the other <e>", "<cs> my lords we have welcomed the fact that argentina now has a democratically elected government <e> <s> we hope that as the argentine people have had the right to choose their own government they will recognise that the falkland islanders should have a similar right to their own choice <e> <s> on the question of the united nations debate the fact is that when we are asked to enter into negotiations we are being asked to enter into negotiations about sovereignty <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said on several occasions already this afternoon her majestys government would like to have better bilateral relations with argentina <e> <s> we have indicated a number of areas where we think progress could be made which would be confidence building measures which would be pragmatic and which would be constructive and helpful in the present situation <e> <s> we hope for a response from argentina <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend with his usual clarity has drawn attention to a particular point about sovereignty <e> <s> what the government have made quite clear in parliament and have said to the falkland islanders themselves is that they are not going to enter into negotiations with argentina on the <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree with the noble lord lord glenamara that we have no doubt as to our sovereignty over the falkland islands <e> <s> we wish to see the economy expand and improve so that the way of life of the falkland islanders may continue and may improve <e> <s> i have already indicated our view on sovereignty <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am glad to confirm to my noble friend that we expect to be able shortly to place in the libraries of both houses of parliament copies of the draft constitutions for the falkland islands and for the falkland islands dependencies <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that the external services of the bbc have maintained broadcasting levels of between and hours a week among and languages ever since <e> <s> that is something we all applaud and we recognise the great value of the bbc external services <e> <s> at the same time over million has been committed to the audibility programme for the period and <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that the total increase is not quite as great as was originally intended but it does represent an increase <e> <s> we believe that it will be possible with the extra help we have given to the bbc for it to meet the economies for which we have called in all organisations the bbc included <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will understand priorities within the bbcs external services change from time to time but the figures i gave for the overall time and number of languages in which external services are broadcast have remained constant since <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are very glad to acknowledge the value of the work that the bbc external services do and have done for a very long time <e> <s> in fact in the present economic circumstances the amount of grant to the bbc has been increased this year as i have already indicated and this is in recognition of the value that we place on the services that it provides <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the value of the great amount of service that the noble lord has given to the bbc <e> <s> i do not accept the statements that he has made about the figures <e> <s> i have already indicated to the house that there has been no cut in the grant to <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i have already said to the house that the government greatly value the work of the bbc external services both the broadcasts in the english language and in foreign languages <e> <s> it is for that reason that the amount of money available to the bbc has increased each year <e>", "<cs> my lords the government always listen to your lordships house <e> <s> i hope that the figures that i have given will indicate to the noble lord and to his colleagues that indeed the bbc has been protected in the context of the governments overall expenditure targets <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the question is as i have given it to the noble lord lord paget <e> <s> i am surprised that he would demean himself by asking his further supplementary questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the first point that the noble lord lord cledwyn has made that we should now be looking to the future <e> <s> as her majestys government have made plain on a number of occasions we would welcome better bilateral and more normal relations with argentina but we are not prepared to discuss the issue of sovereignty over the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the position on this matter immediately following the end of the war is that they expressly ruled out declaring a definitive cessation of hostilities on the grounds that this would give legal status to our position in the falklands <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can give the noble lord lord gladwyn an answer other than the one which i gave him to the same question he asked the other day <e>", "<cs> my lords we have taken several initiatives to achieve more normal bilateral relations with argentina and we remain ready to do this <e> <s> we have made quite plain our views on the matter of sovereignty and as i think i said on an earlier occasion just as we have welcomed the return of democracy in argentina and the right of the argentinian people to vote for a government of their own choice so we believe that a similar right should be exercised by those living in the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not accept that we have been intransigent over these matters <e> <s> we have sought over extensive negotiations in the earlier part of leading up to the negotiations in berne in july means of establishing better bilateral relations with argentina <e> <s> that continues to be our policy <e> <s> it is our wish that we should have normal relations <e>", "<cs> my lords we should like to have normal trade relations with argentina but as the <e>", "<cs> my lords the position on a declaration of war is as i stated in the first answer to the question <e> <s> i think that it would be a much more profitable exercise to look now to the future and that is why her majestys government are seeking ways to have more normal relations with argentina <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we have to be quite clear that her majestys government are not prepared to negotiate sovereignty however it is described <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lords question is no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not absolutely clear as to the question the noble lord was asking <e> <s> i should like to say that i am glad he welcomes the steps which my right honourable friend the prime minister is taking to meet a representative of the nicaraguan government <e> <s> her majestys government support the objectives of the united states government of bringing democracy peace and better economic prosperity to the countries of central america <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord shinwell for what he has said and to say that i agree with the terms of his question <e> <s> he is right in stating that the americans have a major interest in what goes on in central america and we ourselves have supported their objectives as well as the contadora movement <e>", "<cs> my lords we have supported the contadora process which we believe is a most effective way in which to try to bring peace and democracy to central america <e> <s> we have supported the objectives of the united states policy both to bring democracy and to increase the economic prosperity of the peoples of that region <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not think that i can give a clearer answer to the noble lord lord molloy than i have given already <e> <s> the question that he has put down on the order paper is a very wide one <e> <s> i suggest that the subject is more suitable for a debate than for a parliamentary question <e> <s> it would be better to raise it in that forum than to try to answer these complex matters across the floor of the house at question time <e>", "<cs> my lords where the british government have a part to play they take part in all arms control negotiations <e> <s> those negotiations are not exclusively for the united states and the soviet union <e> <s> where it is a party to the negotiations the united kingdom plays a full part <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> in the negotiations which are currently taking place on conventional disarmament in the mbfr talks we are working to have balanced and verifiable reductions of conventional forces <e>", "<cs> my lords her

misunderstanding <e> <s> as i have made plain we are also taking part in arms control talks <e>", "<cs> my lords the mbfr talks are continuing <e> <s> we must of course have a starting point to make sensible decisions on the number of reductions that are required to reach the agreed goal of equal numbers on both sides <e> <s> of course there are problems concerned with effective verification which means that one must have an assurance that an agreement is being observed <e> <s> however these talks continue as of course do the talks in stockholm in which we are also engaged <e> <s> at those latter talks we have in fact made proposals aimed at trying to identify by greater transparency the numbers of conventional forces that are deployed <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the sdi and

macfarlane on th january and indeed we expect that to continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is just a specific question <e> <s> i have made the point about both our interest and that of our nato allies in achieving disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords i have answered the question put by the noble lord lord mayhew <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord molloy introduced a short debate on disarmament fewer than three weeks ago <e> <s> we also had a short debate on the strategic defence initiative last week <e> <s> the governments position on these matters has been made quite plain and

correct in saying that at the discussions in geneva all parties were looking forwards rather than backwards <e> <s> on the first of his questions the answer is yes the seaborne routes will be open as

quite soon on a number of practical issues of which aviation will be one <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that what i said in answer to the first supplementary question from the noble lord lord cledwyn made absolutely plain the british governments commitment to stand by the preamble to the constitution <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as the future of the moroccan workforce is concerned i can tell my noble friend lady vickers that sir joshua hassan has said that the public sector employers in gibraltar are firmly committed not to discharge any moroccan worker to make way for another worker from outside gibraltar <e> <s> there are approximately moroccans working in gibraltar and they make a valuable contribution <e> <s> the arrangement agreed with spain does not threaten those in paid

it to the noble lord lord molloy <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the position is that there will be completely free movement of goods and services as pertained before the closing of the frontier <e> <s> on the specific point about tariffs i understand that under certain circumstances it might be that there will be some goods which will be subject to tariffs <e> <s> however perhaps i might write to my noble friend on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as the attitude of the united kingdom government is concerned we are already urging support for the present process and we see our best role as to put our weight behind the united states effort <e> <s> as regards our attitude to unita we have indicated this in the way that we have expressed our concern to unita when they have taken hostages of british employees in the mining companies <e> <s> we regard this as very unhelpful behaviour in the current situation <e>", "<cs> my lords cuban withdrawal was not part of security council resolution nor do we recognise it as a precondition for a settlement <e> <s> the united states and south african government concerns must be tackled and the fact that they have made a linkage cannot be ignored if a settlement is to be reached <e> <s> we welcome the fact that angola has now put forward proposals on cuban withdrawal <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that the united states is playing a constructive role in the current negotiations and offers the best hope of progress <e> <s> as i have already indicated we are putting our weight behind that negotiation process <e>", "<cs>

indian sub-continent and million has been allocated in aid to ethiopia <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments position on the violation of human rights is quite clear <e> <s> we have deplored such violations wherever they have occurred <e>", "<cs> my lords the possibilities for participation by non-members of unesco in the four programmes will become clearer when the executive board considers the implication of the united states withdrawal later this week <e> <s> participation in the non-governmental organisations should not be affected if we ceased to be a member of unesco <e>", "<cs> my lords our preliminary view as to the effect on the scientific programmes of withdrawal from unesco is that it should be possible to continue to participate in two of the four major international scientific programmes the international oceanographic commission and the international geological co-operation programme but that it would not be possible to continue to be directly involved in the international hydrological programme and the intergovernmental programme man and the biosphere <e>", "<cs> my lords the position of our government is that we have given notice of withdrawal which unless rescinded will become effective on st december <e> <s> as regards my noble friends first supplementary the reforms within unesco are still being considered by that organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments view of unesco was set out in a letter from my right honourable friend the minister for overseas development as long ago as april and the reasons set out include the fact that there is excessive centralisation of management <e>", "<cs> my lords it would not be in the interests of the security services as i am sure the noble lord will understand to give any further detailed information of this nature <e>", "<cs> my lords the turnout for the referendum to which the noble lord lord cledwyn referred was per cent <e> <s> and this is very good by usual union standards <e> <s> a clear majority voted in favour of forming a staff association <e> <s> i am of course glad to confirm to the noble lord that the staff at gchq continue to carry out their duties with their usual dedication and to their usual high standards <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot add any further figures to the ones i have given <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to think that the noble lord lord jenkins would understand but perhaps not that it would not be appropriate to go into all this detail about an intelligence agency <e>", "<cs> my lords when planning ahead in our aid programme we make special provision to cover such contingencies <e> <s> this money comes out of the unallocated reserve so it is a new commitment <e> <s> in recognition of the terrible situation in africa of which we are all aware the million which has been allocated is a sizeable sum and must be seen against the background of our other aid to africa <e>", "<cs> my lords the sum of million which i quoted is the support money that we are going to give to the world banks special assistance facility <e> <s> we have of course already given million special assistance to ethiopia <e> <s> on the specific point about which the right reverend prelate asks we are still considering this <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am aware that the noble lord lord cledwyn asked that particular supplementary two days ago <e> <s> there is no contradiction in our policy <e> <s> there have in fact been many calls on our aid programme since we offered the money last year for the supplementary financing of ida <e> <s> as i indicated the money that we are giving the <e>", "<cs> my lords i have answered the supplementary question which the noble lord lord oram asked by making it quite clear that the money we have given for this facility comes from the unallocated reserve which is there for precisely this kind of purpose <e> <s> it is a new commitment <e> <s> i do not accept in the context of the figures of the money we are already giving to sub-saharan countries in africa that this is not in itself a sizeable amount of money in recognition of the seriousness of the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords the special facility is designed for use in helping governments to make structural changes in their policies <e> <s> african governments have welcomed it and i believe it will be of particular value to them in their present economic difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an excellent debate on hong kong today a debate which i believe illustrates the commitment of this house to that territory and to its people <e> <s> i should like to join my noble friend lord geddes in saying how much we all miss the noble lords lord maclehose lord rhodes and lord kadoorie from this debate today <e> <s> i am glad that there has been a large measure of support for this bill from all sides of the house and i particularly welcomed what was said by the noble lords lord cledwyn and lord beaumont <e> <s> it is particularly important to maintain all-party support in this house for the agreement on hong kong <e> <s> there are years between now and <e> <s> there are bound to be some difficulties in those years and we must do all we can to avoid unnecessary divisions and to promote a sense of stability and confidence in hong kong <e> <s> i was therefore glad of the support from both the noble lord lord cledwyn and the noble lord lord beaumont in particular for the fact that the government have moved to meet the strong desire on all sides of the house for an annual report on hong kong <e> <s> no doubt if the house wishes to debate the annual report this can be discussed through the usual channels <e>", "<cs> at this stage my lords i cannot say anything more <e> <s> this matter is one to which we can return at a later stage in the progress of this bill <e> <s> if i can give the noble lord any further information i shall of course do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly note the point made by the noble lord <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that the foreign office has very good arrangements for enabling serving officers to learn chinese <e> <s> as a country we should be very proud of the numbers who are able to speak chinese fluently <e>", "<cs> my lords without notice i cannot say whether or not there is a particular document that would answer the question put by the noble lord lord beaumont <e> <s> i recognise that the whole question of nationality is a complex matter <e> <s> i shall make available notes on clauses before the committee stage and they may help the noble lord on some of these detailed matters <e> <s> if there is other information which is generally available i shall certainly let him have it but without notice i cannot say that such information is available <e>", "<cs> my lords bilateral aid is normally tied to the purchase of united kingdom goods and services <e> <s> in poorer countries we finance some project costs incurred in local currencies <e> <s> but in about per cent <e> <s> of the bilateral programme was tied <e>", "<cs> my lords in our bilateral aid programme financed the purchase of about million worth of goods and services from british industry but it is also true that british firms benefited from our multilateral aid <e> <s> in british firms secured business worth some million through multilateral agencies <e> <s> i cannot give the noble lord the precise figures for unicef <e>", "<cs> my lords on the last point of the noble lords supplementary question the matter of whether the special facility aid money will be tied or untied is still to be determined <e> <s> on the first part of his question i would accept that the fundamental purpose of our aid programme is to promote the long-term growth of developing countries but the government believe in supporting british firms where we can <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always difficult to comment without notice on a specific case but i would agree generally with what my noble friend has just said <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree with what the noble lord lord molloy says about its being a good agreement that has been reached between britain and spain for the opening of the frontier with gibraltar <e> <s> in reply to the second part of his question i would say that consultation within gibraltar with the opposition would of course be a matter for sir joshua hassan <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have made their views on the subject of sovereignty very plain in parliament on a number of occasions and my right honourable and learned friend made them plain in the press and on television and in the negotiations <e> <s> i shall of course once again confirm that her majestys government stand by the preamble to the gibraltar constitution <e>", "<cs> my lords we have always recognised that the lisbon statement allows any subject to be raised by either side and we have recognised that the spanish side would wish to raise the subject of sovereignty as part of the negotiations <e> <s> they are entitled to do so <e> <s> as i mentioned we have said that we shall stand by the constitution <e> <s> i can confirm that sr moran outlined the spanish position on the sovereignty of gibraltar <e> <s> he has informally put to my right honourable and learned friend some ideas covering possible ways by which spain would wish to recover the sovereignty of gibraltar <e> <s> these ideas will be presented more fully through the diplomatic channel and until that happens it would not be appropriate to comment on them <e> <s> however i should like to confirm that my right honourable and learned friend has made the british governments view quite plain <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not absolutely clear what the noble lord lord cledwyn means by the commission <e> <s> i have made quite clear the right <e>", "<cs> no my lords it is quite clear that the british government support spanish accession to the community and we expect it to take place on st january <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to assure my noble friend lord balfour of inchrye that the spanish government have undertaken to take early action necessary to allow safe and effective air communications <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first part of lord brockways question is no we have not considered it <e> <s> we do not consider that it would be appropriate <e> <s> our position on gibraltar is quite clear <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are aware of the point that the noble lord makes and i hope that i have given him an assurance today as on other occasions as regards the governments stand on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not anticipate a change in our policy as regards sovereignty in gibraltar <e> <s> i can confirm that sir joshua

approach to these two orders and for his support of them <e> <s> as he has rightly said broadly speaking the first one on the wipo which i agree is not perhaps the happiest of acronyms is in fact to protect original work on industrial inventions <e> <s> the second order is to protect original work on plant breeding <e> <s> these are two issues which i think we can both agree are important and which these orders are designed to help <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships will understand that it would not be right for me to give the house an undertaking to make a further approach on a specific occasion <e> <s> however i should like to assure the noble lady that successive british governments together with the governments of france and the united states have argued for hesss release on humanitarian grounds <e> <s> her majestys government have made more than such appeals to the soviet union most recently in november <e>", "<cs> my lords i note of course what the noble lord lord avebury has had to say on this matter <e> <s> as he will be aware my right honourable friend the prime minister discussed human rights with mr gorbachev as recently as december and he can be in no doubt of the views of her majestys government <e> <s> at their meeting in moscow on th march my right honourable friend the prime minister drew attention to the importance of the helsinki final act <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can give the noble lord that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of giving evidence i should have thought that one way the non-governmental organisations could make their views plain would be to get in touch with members of parliament or members of your lordships house <e> <s> the government will of course be ready to take account of views that have been expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have already made clear the importance that the government attach to the helsinki process and the seriousness with which we are taking this new conference <e> <s> on the question of individual cases which are brought to our attention i am sure the house will understand that i cannot give a commitment in advance about particular cases but of course we shall have them very much in mind when representations are made <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the effect of the amendment which has been moved by the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> i am sure we have all listened with great care to the amendment moved by my noble friend lord gridley <e> <s> the purpose of this amendment seems to be to enable the government to provide by order in council for matters relating to members and ex-members of the hong kong public service particularly the payment of pensions and other benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i note what the noble lord lord gladwyn has said <e> <s> as he will appreciate access to papers retained under the provisions of the public records act is permitted only to those who need to see them for official purposes <e> <s> perhaps i may say that over the past months my department has done its best to be as helpful as possible to the noble lord and my ministerial colleagues in the foreign office have held a very extensive correspondence with him <e> <s> with regard to his second supplementary question i think that

said to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the detailed information that the noble lord lord kennet seeks without notice but the position with regard to the release of papers is of course as

a different matter <e> <s> i have described the position as it exists <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be unwise of me i think to comment on what may or may not be russian practice <e> <s> i can confirm that if the lord chancellor wishes for a further opinion about the retention of records by the department he may arrange for the secretary of the cabinet to look into the matter and advise him <e>", "<cs> my lords sales of arms except to the warsaw pact countries and certain other destinations which are subject to multilaterally agreed control are a matter for national governments within their obligations under international law <e> <s> in cases where arms sales by the united states might threaten united kingdom interests we naturally make our views known to the united states government

noble lord lord molloy has asked the sale of arms by the united states to any country is of course basically a question for the united states government <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that we

representations <e> <s> on the particular point about guatemala we most recently expressed our concern about military aid by voting in favour of a resolution adopted at the united nations general assembly in december which called on governments to refrain from supplying arms or other military assistance to guatemala so long as serious human rights violations continued <e>", "<cs> my lords i have indicated the governments view on these matters <e> <s> i do not think that there is anything further that i can add <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lords lord cledwyn and

plain that my honourable friend mr luce on summoning the south african ambassador asked for the fullest possible investigation into the events <e> <s> we have subsequently heard that the south african government have announced that they will set up a judicial inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the first part of the noble lords question the statement makes plain that the events which have just occurred are particularly tragic because they fly in the face of certain more hopeful developments that have occurred in south africa in past months <e> <s> they are therefore all the more to be regretted <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are appalled at the recent events in south africa and entirely agree with what my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls has just said <e> <s> we are glad that

gladwyn for their reception of this statement <e> <s> i have been asked a number of detailed questions about it <e> <s> the first one by the noble lord lord cledwyn was on the question of the overrun <e> <s> i can confirm to him that the figures are still under discussion <e> <s> the council in agreeing last october to meet the inescapable financial obligations in had in mind a shortfall of mecu

introduction into this house <e> <s> the close interest your lordships have taken in it has i am sure been welcomed by the people of hong kong as evidence of the concern in this house for their future wellbeing <e> <s> indeed i have been most grateful for the support given to the bill by the noble lord lord cledwyn which has been expressed again this afternoon and by the noble lord <e> <s> lord beaumont <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we should all want to thank my noble friend lord thomas of swynnerton for giving us the opportunity for such a wide-ranging debate this evening on his unstarred question <e> <s> my noble friend has placed our discussion of aid in a broader historical and political context and i think we have listened to most thoughtful speeches from all parts of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords we attach importance to our relations with south africa as there are major british interests there but our policy is to encourage a process of reform in south africa and we have of course condemned apartheid on many occasions <e> <s> we continue to believe that the new constitution should be given the test of time and the current parliamentary session will he a major test <e>", "<cs> my lords we consistently condemn violence in south africa from whatever quarter and the south african government can be in no doubt where we stand <e> <s> as i indicated in my answer to the earlier question we attach importance to our relations with south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree with my noble friend that we do not believe that sanctions would bring change <e>", "<cs> my lords we have deplored the tragic and unnecessary loss of life in south africa over the incidents in uitenhage <e> <s> my right honourable and learned friend the secretary of state issued a forthright condemnation of the shootings and my honourable friend mr rifldnd summoned the south african ambassador and expressed our shock and called for a full investigation <e> <s> we accept certain constraints on our relationship with south africa as a measure of our abhorrence of apartheid that is to say we support the united nations arms embargo and the gleneagles agreement and we have no nuclear or military collaboration <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and in this case we believe that it would be unlikely to influence south african policies it would inflict hardship on the black community and it is not at all clear that it would have much economic impact anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not think that there is anything further i can say to the noble lord lord brockway beyond what i have already said in answering earlier questions <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of investment this is of course a matter for the <e>", "<cs> my lords there is evidence that the black community is divided on this issue with a strong body of opinion opposed to sanctions <e>", "<cs> my lords that question is completely wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the reforms to which i referred in answer to an earlier question were contained in president bothas speech of th january in which he indicated a willingness to engage in a dialogue with the blacks suspension of forced removals pending a review of policy extension of -year leasehold rights to blacks in the cape area and the decision to develop crossroads as a black residential area <e> <s> those moves may not have gone far enough but they are a start <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i can confirm to my noble friend that we support wholeheartedly the antarctic treaty for the reasons that i have given and yes i think that the expedition which is taking place is very interesting and important <e>", "<cs> my lords i would entirely confirm what the noble lord lord shackleton has said about the antarctic treaty which as i have already indicated we wholeheartedly support and believe to be most valuable and which we wish to see continue <e> <s> with regard to the secretary-generals report we have welcomed this because we feel it presents an accurate picture of the treaty workings and it demonstrates the value and benefits of the antarctic treaty <e> <s> the document appeared in mid-november and if it is not in the library i am sure that a copy could be made available <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that my noble friend is referring to the minerals regime <e> <s> the latest round of negotiations on that subject took place in rio de janeiro between february and march of this year but the conclusion of the establishment of a regime is still some way off <e>", "<cs> my lords yes it is true that both britain and argentina are signatories to the treaty and that there is scientific co-operation betweeen the parties to the treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords it may well be as my noble friend says that that is one reason but i think the serious reason is that all countries which have acceded to the treaty believe that this is an opportunity for scientific research for the conservation of the environment of the antarctic and for keeping it free from any military intervention <e> <s> all of them are pledged to this end <e>", "<cs> my lords i would of course share the sentiments of the noble lord about both scientists and geographers as i am married to a scientist and i am the daughter of a geographer <e> <s> regarding united kingdom activities in antarctica we believe very much in the work of the british antarctic survey <e> <s> they provide a british presence in the british antarctic territory and conduct a very valuable scientific programme there <e>", "<cs> my lords it entirely depends on the questions which the noble lord asks me <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that even the noble lord lord kennet would think that this was quite wide of the question concerning the antarctic <e>", "<cs> my lords we have received reports from her majestys embassy in beirut and are also aware of reports produced by the lebanese government international relief organisations and the news media <e> <s> in the recent debate in the united nations security council we made clear our concern about these reports and our view that the israeli forces in lebanon must respect international law <e> <s> we abstained on the draft resolution because it offered nothing to promote early israeli withdrawal or to improve the situation in southern lebanon in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords we have deplored the appalling violence and have said that violence and counter-violence solve nothing but only add to the tragic suffering of civilians <e> <s> as regards the security council debate our representative at the united nations explained our over-riding concern that the debate should contribute to the breaking of the appalling cycle of violence in southern lebanon <e> <s> but the lebanese draft resolution was unhelpful it offered nothing to promote early israeli withdrawal or to reduce tension and contained no constructive forward-looking elements <e>", "<cs> my lords we have welcomed israeli assurances that they will withdraw their forces from the lebanon and we look for their early orderly and complete withdrawal <e> <s> at the same time we have deplored the violence in southern lebanon <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first part of the noble lords question is yes we are aware of the violence and i have stated our reasons for our abstention at the united nations <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i have made it quite plain in what i have said that we have already condemned the appalling violence in southern lebanon <e> <s> we believe that violence and counter-violence will solve nothing and will only add to the tragic suffering of civilians <e> <s> i think i would rather not be drawn into my noble friends other suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will know the british governments policy is to ensure israels right to exist but i think i have fully explained our policy with regard to israeli troop withdrawal in southern lebanon <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think this is the proper forum for speculating about what might or might not have been in the united nations resolution <e> <s> what we want to see of course is the early orderly and complete withdrawal of israeli troops <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> we admire unifils peace-keeping efforts under difficult circumstances <e> <s>

look for an early and complete withdrawal of israeli troops <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord annan that it is a very complex situation <e> <s> i hope that i have set out very fully the reasons why the government felt that it was right to abstain on that resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords we condemned the israeli invasion in <e> <s> we continue to urge an end to the occupation with the minimum of delay <e> <s> we believe that delaying the full withdrawal may damage the long-term israeli and lebanese interests in a peaceful border <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord bethell for putting down the question which has inspired the short but interesting debate that we have had this evening <e> <s> he is something of a specialist in this field <e> <s> it is therefore natural that his words are listened to with care and respect <e>", "<cs> my lords a new research institute working in the same field as weu but independent of it would need careful dovetailing of its work with that of weu itself to avoid wasteful overlap and duplication <e> <s> however i can confirm that there is no intention by weu to create a caucus within the alliance and we recognise the importance of the contribution made to nato by the non-weu allies <e>", "<cs> my lords no approaches of the kind that have been suggested in the press have been received from the americans in relation to the weu bonn ministerial session <e>", "<cs> my lords on the general point as the noble lord will be aware the renewed and reactivated weu will provide a valuable forum for foreign and defence ministers to hold joint debate about european defence and security matters <e> <s> we believe that greater co-operation in this field will improve the european contribution to the alliance and give political impetus to work in other fora <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first express my hope that the noble lord lord molloy will make a speedy recovery <e> <s> i should like to say this in answer to the further question from the noble lord lord hatch <e> <s> mr gorbachev made a visit to london only four months ago <e> <s> it was the most comprehensive visit to the united kingdom of any soviet visitor in recent memory <e> <s> we believe that contacts of the highest level clearly have their part to play <e> <s> on the question of the freeze we and our allies will study

question <e> <s> i would confirm to him what i said in answer to another supplementary question <e> <s> a freeze would mean a massive imbalance in favour of the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already given my answer to the first part of the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> on the second part i would simply say to him that even a unilateral moratorium must be seen as an attempt to freeze the very heavy long range inf imbalance in the soviet unions favour <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for paying tribute to my right honourable and learned friends visit <e> <s> as i have already indicated the talks centred on east-west relationships and my right honourable and learned friend underlined the wests sincere wish to reduce the levels of weapons through negotiations <e> <s> he also stressed our concern about the observance of human rights throughout europe <e> <s> as in all his visits my right honourable and learned friend wished for contact with a wide range of opinion as he would do in all the countries that he visits <e>", "<cs> my lords while not accepting for one moment that the visit abroad by my right honourable friend the prime minister

speculate on the points that the noble lord lord boston has raised about the number of people travelling between east and west but i note what he said about the importance of the raising by my right honourable friend of human rights matters and the opportunities that he took for talking to such a wide range of opinion in the three countries that he visited <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of my noble friends point <e>", "<cs> my lords we have tried on a number of occasions to achieve better bilateral relations with argentina <e> <s> one area where we believe we could make progress to the benefit of both ourselves and argentina is that of trade and commercial relations <e> <s> unfortunately argentina has been unwilling to discuss this matter unless the issue of sovereignty is also discussed which is unacceptable to us <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very interesting point but it is wide of the original question <e> <s> however if my noble friend would care to put down a question on this subject i shall be happy to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords the government recognise that special considerations apply to books <e> <s> indeed we have repeatedly urged the argentine government to lift reciprocally all remaining commercial and economic restrictions between our two countries <e>", "<cs> my lords the agreement reached at the paris club meeting on th and th january on the rescheduling of argentinas official debt is an important contribution to the economic adjustment programme of this third largest international debtor <e>", "<cs> my lords the government of argentina have not yet officially declared a cessation of hostilities but we have still said that we would like to have better bilateral relations including trade relations <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have raised on five occasions through the presidency of the european community the possibility of lifting trade restrictions <e> <s> we tried in our long complex negotiations leading up to berne to do so again and we have tried again subsequently <e> <s> but for the reason i have already given nothing unfortunately has come of these <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lords lord boston and lord walston for saying they will support these two orders <e> <s> the noble lord lord boston has asked me a number of questions and i shall certainly do my best to answer them <e> <s> on his point about acronyms i agree with him i think we have some rather strange ones <e> <s> i cannot help thinking in the case of who that who knows and that is perhaps why dr who goes under that name <e> <s> in regard to the number of people likely to be affected by the order it is in fact one person to whom i referred in my opening remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the situation is that that is the case but if there is any doubt about it i shall of course write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lords first supplementary question the united <e>", "<cs> my lords the weu the subject of the question is a useful forum for an exchange of views and it is helpful for us to hear the views of our european partners <e> <s> but the major forum for substantive discussion and consultation on security issues must remain the alliance <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the point that the noble lord is making about the importance of this <e> <s> as he will know we understand too the urgency with which the americans wish the allies to respond to their invitation on research <e> <s> but as they have now made clear there is no longer a -day ultimatum <e>", "<cs> my lords it is too early to say what co-ordination of european reactions to this may be possible <e> <s> the weu members first need to develop a dialogue with the united states in order to establish a factual basis on which participation in the research programme might be possible <e> <s> then there can be discussion among the european countries to see how co-ordination might be developed <e> <s> the noble lord would not expect me to comment on his last point which is a hypothetical question <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we do appreciate the difficulties which would be caused to individuals were that to happen <e> <s> in the first instance it would be appropriate for the institution itself as a private institution to approach the nigerian authorities <e> <s> however as has been indicated my department has raised this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely appreciate the point that the noble lord is making on this matter <e> <s> as i indicated in my original answer the list which was published by the central bank was not produced with the authority of the nigerian ministry of education <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for the point that she makes <e> <s> it is a valuable one in that it would give good advice to students intending to study at independent institutions in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the south african government are fully aware of our deep concern at recent events <e> <s> my right honourable and learned friend has strongly condemned the uitenhage shootings <e> <s> our views were directly communicated to the south african ambassador <e> <s> on th april european community ministers issued a statement deploring the current violent situation in south africa <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the british governments view on both anti-semitism and apartheid is quite clear <e> <s> we have unreservedly condemned them both <e>", "<cs> my lords i note of course the point that my noble friend makes but i think he will agree that it is in fact another question <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lords first question is that there is no evidence we believe that sanctions will achieve the changes we want to see <e> <s> however we are determined to maintain our pressure for change in south africa and we believe that we must remain engaged politically diplomatically and economically and use all our influence and our contacts to press the south african government to introduce major reforms urgently and to talk to the genuine leaders of the black community <e> <s> as i indicated in my first answer we and our european partners have issued a statement condemning the uitenhage shootings <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord shinwell makes an interesting point but it would not be for me to speak on behalf of the south african government <e>", "<cs> yes my lords as i indicated earlier we have continued to press the south african government to make the kind of reforms that we should like to see <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already indicated that there is no evidence at all to indicate that sanctions would in fact achieve the results that we should like to see or indeed that the noble lord should like to see <e> <s> we believe that they would be unlikely to influence south african policies <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i think we need to bear in mind that there have been some important measures announced this year <e> <s> president bothas speech of th january indicated a desire for a wider dialogue with the blacks the suspension of forced removals pending a review of policy and the extension of the -year leasehold rights to blacks in the cape area <e> <s> these are improvements <e> <s> there is still a long way to go and we believe that the processes of discussion and the means that we are trying to use to influence the south african government are more likely to achieve that end <e>", "<cs> my lords what i said was that we would press the south african government to talk to the genuine leaders of the black communities in their country which we believe would be helpful in the present situation <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend will be aware discussions are continuing with the spanish authorities about changes to the prohibited airspace for military aircraft <e> <s> under the circumstances i think that it would be better for me not to go into the details of that matter on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords our ambassador who is resident in costa rica also looks after nicaragua <e> <s> however we have diplomatic representation itself in managua <e> <s> naturally we have reports both from the ambassador and from our representative in the capital of nicaragua itself <e> <s> on the second point that the noble lord raised he will know that the honduran ambassador at the united nations security council on <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding the policy of her majestys government towards nicaragua and central america we wish to see an early and comprehensive negotiated settlement of the regional tensions <e> <s> to that end we have consistently supported the contadora proposals <e> <s> on the second point about aid to nicaragua the view is that all these matters and indeed loans to nicaragua have been decided on technical grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords we have supplied in bilateral aid to nicaragua since <e> <s> community aid to central america in totalled million of which nicaragua received about million the largest share <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware we contribute to the community budget about per cent <e> <s> as to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that we support the contadora process <e> <s> what we have said and i have said on many occasions in your lordships house is that we support the aims of united states policy in central america namely to promote democracy political stability national security and economic development <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the first question that he asked the noble lord will know the situation in central america is very complex <e> <s> i have set out the governments position on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the united states administration we have not been asked by them to join in imposing sanctions <e>", "<cs> my lords we remain in close touch with the united states administration regarding the latters strategic defence initiative research program me <e>", "<cs> my lords the british governments position on sdi is clear <e> <s> it is set out in the four points agreed between the prime minister and president reagan at camp david just before christmas <e> <s> as the noble lord has said my right honourable and learned friend the secretary of state set out our position in his speech in march <e> <s> nothing is being hidden on these two public documents <e> <s> they make quite plain our view on this important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can add anything in answer to the noble lords question following upon the important debate that he raised in this house last week <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable and learned friend set out a number of questions on matters that need to be considered <e> <s> they are being considered not only in this country but also in other countries in europe <e> <s> they are matters among others that we are discussing with our allies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house is grateful to my noble friend lord chelwood for introducing this debate this afternoon <e> <s> the need for a solution to the arab-israel dispute is in our view increasingly urgent <e> <s> we share with our european partners a firm belief in the importance of encouraging early practical steps towards a settlement <e> <s> the conflict between israel and its arab neighbours has become one of the most lengthy and intractable disputes in the world today <e> <s> i am sure that we all listened with great interest to what the right reverend prelate the bishop of ripon said on this matter and the observations that he made in this dispute <e> <s> we also noted with interest the remarks of the noble lord lord kagan <e>", "<cs> my lords that is indeed what i said <e> <s> i said they should be able to choose what attainable constitutional arrangements they could willingly accept <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not absolutely sure as to precisely the question that the noble lord lord shinwell wished to raise with me <e> <s> i can assure him that the meeting has seen discussions on a wide range of issues and that these have been complemented by very useful informal contacts between the delegations in the margins of the meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords we continue to work actively for the establishment of a multilaterally-based fisheries conservation and management regime in the area around the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> my lords we are actively developing our multilateral approach <e> <s> we are working urgently to ensure that we have as full and complete a picture as possible of fishing activity around the falklands and its long-term implications for fish stocks <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first part of my noble friends question is of course yes <e> <s> we are very well aware of the situation we have been aware of it for some time and we have listened to representations from a number of sources <e> <s> the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the first part of the noble lords question i think that it would be wrong for me to go into details on the whole matter of our multilateral proposals <e> <s> in answer to his second question we are of course aware that a great many vessels are fishing around the falklands and it is for that reason and for other reasons which have been made known that we are actively pursuing this multilateral proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that anyone is concerned with whaling around the falklands <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> of course i understand the point that has been made by my noble friend who is such an expert on this subject <e> <s> it is for that reason that we are urgently pursuing our multilateral approach <e> <s> i can confirm that a study is being undertaken to pool information available from all sources and it is being pursued as a matter of urgency <e> <s> we need to understand as well as we can how stocks are being affected by current levels of fishing activity <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has asked an important question <e> <s> as he himself has said this is a sensitive matter and i think it would not be appropriate for me to go into it in the house today <e> <s> i can give the noble lord an assurance and i can give the house an assurance that the government are urgently pursuing this matter <e> <s> we are aware of the strong feelings not only of your lordships house but of another place and of outside conservation interests but as the noble lord will appreciate it is a sensitive question and it needs to be handled carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords to the best of my knowledge there are no british ships fishing in the falklands waters <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first place we are not stonewalling <e> <s> in the second place it is self-evident that to be workable a multilateral regime should include as many as possible of the nations with an interest in fishing in the south-west atlantic <e> <s> in the third place in regard to the question of other areas there are of course waters where fishing regimes are in force without heavy policing but these are areas over which sovereignty is not contested <e>", "<cs> my lords i take entirely the point that my noble friend makes <e>", "<cs> my lords in order of activity the main countries fishing round the falklands are the soviet union poland spain and japan <e> <s> the others in alphabetical order are argentina although not in the falkland islands protection zone brazil bulgaria denmark the federal republic of germany finland the german democratic republic italy norway sweden taiwan and urguay <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not in any way accept the first part of the noble lords supplementary question and i would reaffirm what i have said on earlier occasions that it remains our view that the constitution should be given the test of time and may contribute to the process of reform <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am sure the noble lord the leader of the opposition will understand that is a question about namibia which is outside the terms of the question but if he cares to put down a question on that subject of course i should be willing to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords when a question is as widely drawn as this one can of course go very far outside it <e> <s> but i should be very happy to answer the noble lords question if he puts it down on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords what i can do is to confirm that the involvement of indians and coloureds in the parliament has probably been a major factor in the decision to repeal the mixed marriages act section of the immorality act and the political interference act which restricted membership of political parties on racial lines <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer to the original question made clear the governments position on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should greatly regret it if the noble lord lord mishcon or the noble lord the leader of the opposition felt that there had been any discourtesy on my part <e> <s> i am happy to answer questions in so far as i am able to do so on the constitution and on the particular point in the question <e> <s> but the whole question of namibia on which the governments policy is quite clear is another matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are determined to maintain pressures for change but we must remain engaged politically diplomatically and economically with that government <e> <s> we believe that it is vital to use all our influence and contacts to press the south african government to introduce major reform urgently and to talk to the genuine leaders of the black community <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have put things less felicitously than i should have done i am sure that the noble lord lord diamond understands exactly what i was saying and the governments policy <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord comes to read in <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have made quite clear the governments position on the matter of apartheid <e> <s> i do not wish to repeat what i have already said <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lords lord cledwyn and lord walston for the way in which they have received the statement <e> <s> the government recognise that we are dealing with a very serious situation <e> <s> i hope that the information i have been able to give indicates both our immediate response and our action in the preceding weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a misunderstanding by the noble lord lord walston <e> <s> i did not mention the chartering of a vessel <e> <s> i said that we were providing for the charter of a hercules aircraft and money for a light plane <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the second question of my noble friend lord gisborough first <e> <s> we are conscious of the difficulties and i hope that i have <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked about prospects for this year and this of course depends very much on the rain which as i understand it should start this month <e> <s> therefore it is difficult to predict what might happen <e> <s> i understand that the cause of this immediate tragedy in the west of the sudan is a consequence of the failed harvest in the main grain producing areas last november and the small reserves that people held have now been exhausted <e> <s> transport from the port to the west has been the major problem and that is why we have been doing what we can to alleviate the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we all understand the immensity of the tragedy in sub-saharan africa and now in the sudan <e> <s> as i have already indicated the government have set aside considerable sums of money million last year and million in this financial year and have indicated that they will consider more should this prove to be necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not wish to draw any analogy with what my right honourable and learned friend has said about football hooliganism in europe which not only he but also the government and i think everyone in this country have condemned <e> <s> on the particular point which is the subject of this question i should make it quite clear that we have been unable to find any trace of the two men who were named in the newspaper article as having served in the british army <e> <s> without further information than that in the press reports it is not possible to make any checks on the others <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i shall always agree with the statement which the noble lord lord jenkins has made but i fear that there will be many occasions when i shall not <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i should be most unwise to attempt in the house a definition of the word mercenary <e>", "<cs> my lords we have of course signed <e> <s> the decision now is one for ratification <e> <s> but i can perhaps say to the noble baroness that we certainly hope to be able to announce a decision on ratification in advance of the conference in nairobi which will be held from th to th july <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take this opportunity to pay a very warm tribute to the important and impressive contribution made by non-governmental organizations and womens <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may just clarify a point if we decided to ratify the convention we would enter a number of reservations <e> <s> they are still of course under discussions so i cannot go into all the details <e> <s> but they would cover such areas as succession to the throne and hereditary titles the right of education authorities to determine curricula and text books as they do at present and the affairs of religious ministries <e> <s> in fact a number of other countries including some of our european community partners have entered reservations upon ratification <e>", "<cs> my lords the position is that countries have now ratified the convention but as i explained in answer to the question put by the noble lord lord cledwyn in deciding whether or not we should ratify the convention we are considering a number of reservations covering some of areas that i have enumerated in my earlier response <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> again i am very glad to pay tribute to the immense amount of work that has been done by a great many womens organisations towards the preparation of the nairobi conference <e> <s> we do appreciate the widespread concern among womens groups and organisations that the united kingdom should ratify this convention <e>", "<cs> my lords it would not be appropriate for me at this time to go into the detail of what might be the governments reservations were we to ratify the convention <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the considerations upon ratification would be consultation with our dependent territories <e>", "<cs> my lords once again the noble lord lord hatch is widening the question <e> <s> if he would like to put down a specific question on that particular point i should of course be happy to try to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i would be the first to support the noble baroness lady seear in what she says <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> as i indicated in answer to an earlier question we hope to be able to announce a decision on ratification in advance of the conference <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i note what the noble baroness says <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be very well aware this whole matter is an enormous question <e> <s> it would not be appropriate for me to discuss at this stage the details of what might go into a reservation <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am sure the noble lady is aware indeed as i think all noble baronesses in this house will be aware things do not always work out precisely as you expect <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord lord davies that we take every opportunity to impress on south africa the need for early implementation of security council resolution and that we have with our contact group partners intervened over the new internal administration arrangements to remind south africans of their commitment to security council resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make it quite plain that the government do not recognise the new administration <e> <s> it has no standing under the united nations plans <e> <s> we have made our position quite plain to the south african government on that matter <e> <s> we believe that the new administration will not affect the negotiations towards the implementation of security council resolution nor does it alter south africas international obligations on that resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hatch is quite right the debate on namibia is at present continuing <e> <s> but we hope to see a resolution which will contribute in a constructive way towards the implementation of security council resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have made quite plain the british governments attitude to these matters in namibia <e> <s> we wish to see a resolution of this difficult problem <e> <s> we hope that the united states negotiations will prove to be successful and that they will be based on the united nations resolution which we support <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear that the interim administration has been set up and will be inaugurated on th june <e> <s> i have already expressed the governments point of view about that and the community foreign ministers stated on th april that they consider the south african announcement on the setting up of an interim administration to be null and void and reaffirm the tens commitment to security council resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know that i entirely follow the noble lord lord molloy in all his arguments on this matter <e> <s> i hope i have made plain to your lordships the british governments view over namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have made clear the position of the united kingdom and the community <e> <s> of course the contact group countries have declared the interim administration arrangements null and void <e> <s> the presidential statement of the security council on rd may also declared the interim administration null and void <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that we are actively pursuing the matter of a mutilateral approach but it would not be helpful to go into detail while contacts are taking place <e> <s> on my noble friends second supplementary question about squid we are aware of reports that squid have disappeared from falkland waters earlier than usual <e> <s> however information which we have received very recently from the falkland islands governments fishery observer indicates that fishing for the species of squid found in falklands waters is continuing <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the concern of the noble lord lord shackleton who has taken such a very great interest in this matter <e> <s> i should like to assure him that our aim is the establishment of a really effective conservation and management regime in the south-west atlantic for all the reasons that he has given <e> <s> that means working for the widest possible measure of international acceptance and participation <e>", "<cs> my lords the first point which the noble lord makes is of course hypothetical <e> <s> however as regards a unilateral declaration of such a limit we must be realistic and face the fact that there is a dispute about sovereignty in the area <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am sure my noble friend will be the first to appreciate we are still negotiating about a multilateral regime <e> <s> i think that it would be quite improper for me to comment on what is still a hypothetical situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord would agree that in fact that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords in using those expressions i have been talking about what is generally accepted as a -mile fishing limit around the falkland islands <e> <s> however the term the south-west atlantic can also be used to cover south georgia where the fishing is already covered by the convention for the conservation of antarctic marine living resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the point that my noble friend makes on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to go into the details of this sensitive matter of the discussions on a multilateral regime except to reiterate the importance and the urgency which the government attach to this measure <e> <s> in fact we are talking about the waters around the falkland islands to which on an earlier occasion your lordships have addressed many questions particularly relating to the number of ships already fishing there <e> <s> on the last point that the noble lord raised i would refer him to the report of the house of commons select committee on foreign affairs published in december which makes the point that enforcement and policing of a unilaterally declared efl would raise practical and political problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend would accept that that is a somewhat wider question <e> <s> i referred to south georgia only in relation to fishing matters <e>", "<cs> yes my lords my right honourable and learned friend will of course study what has been said in your lordships house which i am quite sure will be read with great interest by those in the falkland islands <e> <s> i hope that they will appreciate the urgency and importance that we attach to achieving a resolution of this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord says <e>", "<cs> my lords on the general question of the fee the agency fee charged at ethiopian ports is high though i understand that ethiopian port charges are generally in line with those of other african ports <e> <s> i can confirm to the noble lord that in common with other major donors we have channelled our representations about this state of affairs through the united nations co-ordinator who acts on behalf of all donors on questions of this kind <e> <s> on the two other points the noble lord made about the charges made to the united states government and the aid given by the band aid group i have no information and i cannot confirm them or otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the whole house would agree with the point that the noble lord lord oram has made that what is essential is to get the aid through <e> <s> nevertheless i think we take the point of the noble lord lord taylor and we are making representations <e>", "<cs> my lords of course that is a matter for the media <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the point of the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> however i think that he would agree that it is wide of the specific question that has been raised which is about the duties levied <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i take the point <e> <s> i should say that there is no evidence of corruption or excess profits on this <e> <s> however as i indicated earlier we shall support the efforts of the united nations co-ordinator to seek a reduction in the fees levied at the ports <e>", "<cs> my lords we regret that our many appeals at ministerial level to the ethiopian government to release the detained members of the former ethiopian royal family have so far been unsuccessful <e> <s> we shall nevertheless continue to stress our concern at every opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords the ethiopian government can be in no doubt about the degree of concern felt in this country for those members of the royal family detained still without trial <e> <s> the matter was raised by my honourable friend mr rifkind when he spoke to the ethiopian foreign minister in july last year <e> <s> my right honourable friend mr raison repeated our concern during his visit to ethiopia in december and my right honourable friend the secretary of state raised it once again last march when he met the ethiopian foreign minister in london <e> <s> we have no information to suggest that the prisoners are being ill treated or indeed that they are in ill health <e> <s> i understand for example that they have been given proper medical treatment when necessary <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can confirm that they have been detained without trial <e> <s> that is one of the many reasons why we have expressed our concern to the ethiopian authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that nine members of the former royal family were released from custody in an amnesty in september <e> <s> indeed one came to the united kingdom for medical treatment and has subsequently been allowed to stay <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we have taken every opportunity to make clear our concern about the situation <e> <s> in the case of the one member of the former royal family who has been released she is now in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend must understand that we are talking about the nationals of another country in that country <e> <s> the powers of the british government in such a circumstance are therefore simply confined to expressing our concern <e> <s> we have done so on every occasion <e> <s> we hope that the ethiopian government will pay heed to what we have said and will release these members of the former royal family <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord has suggested <e> <s> we shall raise this whole matter and in doing so add to it the very real concern that has been expressed in your lordships house when my right honourable friend meets the new ethiopian ambassador <e> <s> we recognise that the ethiopian government have made little effort to improve their human rights record or their relations with the west despite the aid that has been given <e> <s> this is a fact <e>", "<cs> my lords the representations have been made at the highest level by ministers who have been visiting ethiopia or alternatively with the ethiopian ambassador in london <e> <s> so there is no question that they are unaware of the representations <e> <s> what one wishes to see is a result from those representations <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that all of us would agree <e> <s> not only is it a great waste but it is also a very tragic situation <e> <s> we would wish to see it brought to an end as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord lord annan has said on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords we are ready to contribute to the second replenishment of the ifads fund as soon as the other participants agree <e>", "<cs> my lords we intend to provide the same share as we did of the first replenishment namely per cent <e> <s> of the share of oecd countries <e> <s> depending on the size of the replenishment and the dollar-pound rate of exchange used the cost of the aid programme seems likely to be about million <e> <s> that compares with million which we contributed to the first replenishment and to million which we provided towards the initial funding <e> <s> on the second point which the noble lord raised about the special programme we shall of course consider that in due course <e> <s> however our first priority is to get the second replenishment in place <e>", "<cs> my lords the position is that the united states are not yet willing to accept the proposed burden sharing between the oecd group and the opec group <e> <s> all the other donors including ourselves are willing to do so <e> <s> i do not think that i would accept that the united states government have been less than generous in the funding that they have given throughout the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord misunderstands the position because if we increased our own contribution in practice it would not benefit anyone <e> <s> the overall total of the replenishment would remain the same and it would merely enable another oecd country to reduce its contribution at the united kingdoms expense <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not prepared to accept any of these extraordinary allegations that have been made by the noble lord lord molloy <e> <s> i can confirm to the house that we discuss all important issues with the united states government at various levels <e> <s> they are fully aware of our views <e> <s> nicaraguan allegations that the united states is about to invade nicaragua have been formally denied by the united states <e> <s> indeed president reagan has given a written assurance to a united states congressman that he is not seeking the military

meeting of the central american states with the contadora group in panama on th and th april <e> <s> we hope to see further agreement on outstanding points as soon as possible <e> <s> the general principles that i gave in answer to the original question namely to see stability and democratic development in central america are of course particular points of the contadora process that we wish to see achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already indicated we share with the united states administration the common objective of a peaceful settlement of the dispute in central america on the basis of the contadora principles <e> <s> we have at the same time made plain that we see a need for restraint on all sides in the present situation <e> <s> however in particular we want nicaragua to end the substantial build-up of arms troops and foreign military advisers and to stop supporting attempts to destabilise neighbouring democratic governments <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not see a contradiction in our view about the situation in nicaragua and our total condemnation of the russian invasion of afghanistan <e> <s> i have already made plain in a supplementary answer to the noble lord lord molloy that so far as the united states is concerned there is no intention to invade nicaragua and president reagan has given that assurance <e> <s> in the case of afghanistan there has been an invasion of afghanistan by the russians and we have completely deplored what is going on in that country <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had made the british govenments policy towards nicaragua quite plain to the house <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the strategic defence initiative is a united states research programme permitted under existing treaties <e> <s> any strategic defence initiative-related deployment would have to be a matter for negotiation <e> <s> we strongly support the agreed aim of the united states-soviet talks in geneva to prevent an arms race in space and to end it on earth <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord lord molloy and the house that the british view towards the strategic defence initiative is based on the four points that were agreed between president reagan and my right honourable friend the prime minister at their meeting last december <e> <s> that remains our position <e> <s> on the noble lords supplementary question about the soviet government i think that we must recognise that soviet research on ballistic missile defence has been continuing since the s <e> <s> the abm defences around moscow are the only type in existence in the world <e> <s> they have extensive programmes on ballistic missile defence-related technologies including high-powered lasers electric pulse beams and heavy-lift capability <e> <s> all this research is currently taking place in the soviet union and therefore it is not surprising that research should be going on in the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am sure the noble lord lord gladwyn is aware the french have put forward a proposal for a european research coordination agency known as eureka <e> <s> we have responded positively to this suggestion proposing the formation at the forthcoming milan council of a high level group of interested countries <e> <s> this is of course a separate issue from the immediate one of the strategic defence initiative as the french have made clear because it is for each country to determine what its attitude to the research will be <e> <s> as my right honourable friend the prime minister has indicated we intend to take part in the research programmes <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree with much of what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i believe it is important for us all to recognise that an arms race in space would benefit no one and we are glad that the geneva talks are focusing on the prevention of an arms race <e> <s> we believe that negotiation and mutual restraint are both needed to meet the urgent challenge posed by costly new space technologies <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is perfectly true and of course european countries discuss all these matters in the appropriate forum such as nato <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever the view of the population of america may be on sdi we are of course considering the policy of the united states government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not absolutely clear about all the questions which were included in the remarks of the noble lord lord molloy but perhaps i might deal with two points <e> <s> the noble lord several times referred to the suggestion that the americans are trying to achieve superiority <e> <s> that is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that that is a view that would be shared by the overwhelming majority in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords our consistent objective at geneva has been to negotiate a balanced and verifiable agreement to limit and reduce intermediate range missiles in europe <e> <s> a freeze or indeed a reduction would mean either a massive imbalance in favour of the soviet union or would still mean an imbalance in favour of the soviet union if the reduction was just as it were across the board <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that the soviet government is continuing its research programme on ballistic missile defence <e> <s> the united states is continuing its research because there is a clear need for it to match the soviet efforts <e> <s> but i believe that our immediate task is to maintain alliance unity and to work for results in geneva <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to confirm the united states decision to continue to observe the salt ii constraints even though the soviet record gives cause for concern <e> <s> it is a decision which underlines the united states commitment to the arms control process and its positive contribution to the geneva talks <e> <s> the noble lord lord molloy should be aware of this from the question that he asked yesterday but as he has perhaps not read <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments view is that compensation out of public funds for the wrongful acts of diplomats would be inappropriate <e> <s> the loss that is suffered does not flow directly from the governments obligation under international law and even if it did that would be no reason to provide compensation out of public funds <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to embark on an exchange over the law with the noble and learned lord lord denning but the position so far as diplomats are concerned is that under article of the vienna convention all persons enjoying the privileges and immunities are asked to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving state <e> <s> in the case of diplomats who have offended against the law in some respect we draw the attention of the head of mission to all serious offences alleged to have been committed by diplomats <e> <s> in some cases we request either a waiver of immunity or the removal of the offender <e> <s> of course to be sent home in disgrace can be a severe punishment <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated in the answer to the original question most cases in which the government have intervened have had a successful outcome <e> <s> but as the noble and learned lord will be aware we published in april a white paper setting out very fully the governments view about the vienna convention and diplomatic immunities and privileges and i think this has been well received by the diplomatic community <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is always rather inadvisable to give public advice across the floor of the house as to what people should do in certain circumstances <e> <s> the first move i think by any claimant with regard to a diplomat who is alleged to have offended in some way would be to write to the head of mission of the country to which the diplomat is accredited <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has given an illustration of what could be an offence committed by a diplomat <e> <s> as i hope i have indicated the fact is that we would draw to the attention of the head of mission all serious offences which are alleged to have been committed by diplomats and in those instances we should ask either for a waiver of diplomatic immunity or possibly the removal of the person from the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i have tried to explain how this might work <e> <s> in circumstances such as that the first matter would be that the claimant would write to the head of mission of the country to which the diplomat was accredited <e> <s> if he failed to get a reply or if such a reply were unsatisfactory then this would be a matter in which it would be possible for the foreign office to intervene and also make representations <e> <s> when this happened then some of the circumstances described would if the offence were shown follow on <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord hatch has managed to include about seven questions in his one supplementary question <e> <s> i shall answer his point about the vote in the security council on security council resolution from which we abstained because of our reservation on certain elements of the resolution and because we regretted the failure of the security council to agree a consensus text <e> <s> her majestys government continue to believe that economic sanctions are not the most effective way of securing a namibian settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords we too are very pleased to see the noble lord lord underhill back in his place <e> <s> on the particular point that the noble lord lord cledwyn has raised on the south african raid into gaberones we acted swiftly <e> <s> my right honourable and learned friend summoned the south african ambassador immediately on th june and made clear the very serious view we took on this indefensible attack <e> <s> we strongly condemned this blatant violation of botswanas sovereignty and we joined our community partners in the statement by the ten on th june strongly condemning the south african action <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made plain in your lordships house on many occasions what is her majestys governments view on the effectiveness of economic sanctions <e> <s> we do not believe that they would be effective in this case and we continue to think that we can best make our views known and best influence the south african government by leaving open the channels of diplomatic communication and other lines of communication <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that economic sanctions would be counter-productive and would be likely to hurt the blacks in south africa most and harm the economics of the neighbouring black african states <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made plain her majestys governments view over sanctions <e> <s> perhaps i may add that we do not believe that they would be effective in securing the implementation of security council resolution which is the subject of this question <e> <s> indeed it is much more likely to bring to an end the possibility of negotiating a peaceful and internationally accepted settlement in namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the point that my noble friend makes on this matter <e> <s> in fact so far as the interim administration in namibia is concerned we do not recognise it and it has no standing under the united nations plan <e>", "<cs> my lords we are quite clear what it is that we wish to achieve in namibia that is the implementation of security council resolution <e> <s> the question is how to achieve it <e> <s> we do not believe that imposing sanctions will achieve it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both the noble lord lord oram and the noble lord lord banks for their general welcome for this order <e> <s> i particularly welcome the remarks of the noble lord lord oram who very fairly set out what he saw as the improvements which come under lom iii <e> <s> he listed quite a number of improvements that he saw particularly the emphasis on agriculture the work that is to be done in both drought and the advance of the desert and the promotion of small and medium-size firms <e> <s> these are very valuable developments <e>", "<cs> my lords this is simply a proposal that a small secretariat should be established but among the areas of political co-operation we would see terrorism as being a suitable subject for close political co-operation in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite certain that the noble lord lord gladwyn will have studied our proposals which have been in the library of the house for some few days <e> <s> i am glad to tell him that they have been generally welcomed <e> <s> they are currently under discussion <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> my understanding on the particular subject of this question is that it concerns the establishment of a small secretariat <e> <s> this is something which could be established and which we <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the current procedure each president of the community will have his own staff <e> <s> when the presidency changes so the new president uses his own staff <e> <s> the object of this exercise would be to establish a small permanent secretariat so that there would be continuity of policy <e> <s> we believe it would give political co-operation a permanent base maintain the continuity between presidencies and strengthen links with the community <e> <s> the decisions on policy would of course rest with member countries <e>", "<cs> my lords if indeed that is the policy of the labour party i was not aware that it was i think it most unlikely that it would achieve power <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble and learned lord if i have used language that was less than precise <e> <s> i am referring to the presidency of the council of ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> we believe that political co-operation has been a considerable success in the ten <e> <s> we think it is time for another step forward and we put forward proposals at milan for a binding co-operation agreement incorporating this small permanent secretariat and for closer co-operation on security <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware there has been a committee known as the dooge committee which has been sitting and looking at the institutions of the community <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> my lords the position is that the formula which has been agreed between the foreign and commonwealth office and local authorities subject to local traffic conditions is that for each mission up to three parking spaces outside its office buildings plus one for the head of missions residence is allowed <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that the white paper which has of course been drawn to the attention of all diplomatic missions in london has been helpful in the present situation <e> <s> i shall have to write to the noble lord on the specific point that he raised about the number of car-parking offences committed since its publication <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i understand that the united states foreign missions amendment act which the noble viscount must have in mind covers only vehicle insurance <e> <s> in the united kingdom the position is as described in the answer i gave to the noble viscount on th june <e> <s> we would normally request the transfer of any diplomat found to be driving without third-party insurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given the governments view of the value of this piece of american legislation in british circumstances but the noble viscount must understand that should a diplomat be found not to have carried third-party insurance and to be involved in an accident we would <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think i can assure the noble and learned lord lord denning that it would frequently be the case that if there was a matter in which a diplomat had committed a criminal offence and the police would have preferred charges had the person not been a diplomat there would be an opportunity for the police to report the matter to the home office which in turn would report to the foreign and commonwealth office which would raise it with the head of the mission <e> <s> it is then possible for the government sending the diplomat to give a waiver of diplomatic immunity and the matter can then be brought before the court <e>", "<cs> yes my lords this too is perfectly possible <e> <s> diplomatic immunity can be waived by the government of the country sending the diplomat to this country <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many cases where diplomatic immunity is waived <e> <s> indeed it may in effect be waived by the diplomat himself who may go before the court and not indicate that he is a diplomat with immunity to waive <e> <s> it is perfectly possible that such might be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not possibly comment on what the united states might or might not like in these circumstances <e> <s> i simply stated what the law is <e> <s> so far as the united kingdom is concerned nobody can like such a circumstance as asking a diplomat to leave <e> <s> it is a question of whether or not it is the right thing to do <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble and learned lord has rightly said the vienna convention applies to diplomats all over the world <e> <s> whatever ruling we may wish to apply here we must recognise that it may be applied also to our diplomats in whatever country they are serving <e> <s> so far as motor vehicle insurance is concerned we of course insist on third-party cover <e>", "<cs> my lords that point was raised earlier in the question of the noble viscount lord st davids <e> <s> the position is as i have given in my original answer to that question <e> <s> we believe that it would be impossible for officials or a special tribunal to determine the facts of any case without compulsory powers to obtain documentary or written evidence <e>", "<cs> not without notice my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both the noble lord lord oram and the noble viscount lord falkland for the welcome they have given to this statement <e> <s> i am sure that we are all glad that we have been able to extend the use of the hercules aircraft and the detachment to look after them because their value has already been shown in all the relief efforts <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend asks an important question <e> <s> i have not the figures for the contribution made by the eastern-bloc countries but i can tell him that the major contributions have been made by the united states the european community and the countries of the west and relatively little has been provided by the eastern-bloc countries <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the second question of the noble lord lord hatch yes it is true that half the costs of the aircraft are being borne by the ministry of defence the costs amount to about a month and half is being borne by the overseas development administration <e> <s> the answer to his first question is that the money for the emergency aid has come from the contingency fund of the overseas development administration <e> <s> we regard this as a proper use of that money because clearly this is an emergency and that is what this money is set aside for <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with what the noble lord lord walston has said about the complications of distribution and the importance of having both trucks and spare parts and people who are capable of repairing the trucks and keeping them in order <e> <s> indeed the latest information available to us suggests that sufficient food is being shipped to ethiopian ports and stocks are building up in the warehouses but distribution problems persist <e> <s> we and other donors are keen to ensure that the ethiopian authorities continue to make more vehicles available for distribution purposes <e> <s> as i indicated in an earlier answer we are providing spare parts for trucks and have provided an engineer <e> <s> but the point the noble lord makes is important and i recognise it <e>", "<cs> my lords everyone has been immensely impressed by the work of the band aid group and the unbelievable amounts of money that have been given so generously by so many people <e> <s> before the work of the band aid group it was a measure of the very real concern shown by the overwhelming majority of people in britain that so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the visit to which my noble friend has referred <e> <s> the programme of the national union of mineworkers representatives in moscow is of course their affair <e> <s> it is not a matter for her majestys ambassador in moscow <e> <s> however we should hope that the visitors to the soviet union might draw appropriate conclusions about the extreme difficulties confronting soviet citizens who seek to exercise their basic human rights rights which we in britian have learned to take for granted <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lord lord shinwell was really given in my original answer to the question <e> <s> the plight of those who have been trying to monitor the helsinki act is indeed terrible <e> <s> however i think it would be quite wrong for her majestys government not to continue to press the soviet government to do all that it can to fulfil its obligations under the helsinki final act <e>", "<cs> my lords we should hope that the soviet union having signed the helsinki final act would fulfil its obligations and there is no doubt at all that my right honourable and learned friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary when he visits helsinki to mark the th anniversary will raise this matter again <e>", "<cs> my lords i set out the final conclusions of the ottawa conference in a written answer to the noble lord lord brockway in the course of which i said it was not possible to reach agreement at the meeting on any final document <e> <s> nevertheless the implementation review provided a valuable opportunity to make clear our concerns on a range of issues and to call the east to account <e> <s> in the course of doing that individual cases such as the one to which the noble lord lord cledwyn has referred could be raised <e> <s> i do not think it would be appropriate for me to go further in this particular forum but i can assure the noble lord and the house that we are very conscious of the number of individual cases and continue to raise them <e>", "<cs> my lords these are all matters that the government would like to see implemented in the soviet union because they are all the kinds of human rights referred to in the helsinki final act <e> <s> as i have indicated and i repeat again today we have taken every opportunity to press the soviet government whenever opportunities arise and we shall continue to do so <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we shall continue to make this point quite clear <e> <s> as i have just indicated my right honourable and learned friend will undoubtedly refer in his speech in helsinki to failures by some countries to honour their helsinki commitments on human rights and other aspects of the helsinki final act <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so to the noble lord lord jenkins that is quite outside the terms of this question <e> <s> however i should make it clear that the united kingdom government have condemned violations against human rights wherever they occur <e>", "<cs> my lords the government endorsed the united nations general assembly resolution no <e> <s> / of december which proclaimed as the international year of shelter for the homeless <e> <s> we support the objectives of the resolution and the emphasis placed in it on work in poor countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i think one has to understand what is the purpose of the united nations international year of shelter for the homeless <e> <s> i understand that the intention was that the year should he a focus for activity in the developing countries <e> <s> to that end we have been asked by the united nations to nominate as a special contribution to the year projects that are now being implemented and will be operational in <e> <s> we shall do so and plan to nominate two such projects funded from the aid programme <e> <s> there is therefore no inconsistency i believe in our policy <e>", "<cs> my lords we regard the primary focus of the year as one of assistance to developing countries <e> <s> therefore the overseas development agency has taken the lead in nominating projects in that regard <e> <s> however i understand that the department of the environment has recently received an approach from the international year of shelter for the homeless trust about assistance in relation to its united kingdom activities and that this is being considered <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are aware of the problem of homelessness in this country <e> <s> action on homelessness is primarily a responsibility for local authorities <e> <s> however we are concerned and accept that the government have a responsibility for setting the framework <e> <s> within the inevitable financial constraints we are taking a fresh look at the problem and considering possible measures <e> <s> for example earlier this month we issued a circular to local authorities setting out ways in which better management could reduce the number of empty dwellings announcing a relaxation in the rules of eligibility for housing association grant to facilitate the use of local authority short-life property <e>", "<cs> my lords that question is a very wide one considerably wider than the specific question on the order paper <e> <s> but it would be wrong to assume that the governments of many countries in africa are not facing up to their social responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords no not without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord kennet for giving us the opportunity to debate once again the governments policy towards nicaragua <e> <s> this subject was debated fully in november and has been the subject of a large number of questions here and in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there are two things <e> <s> we would like them to go back to the negotiations in the contadora group one of whose objectives is the establishment of democracy <e> <s> and of course we would like to see free and fair elections as i said at the beginning <e>", "<cs> my lords the mexican elections are not the subject of this debate <e> <s> we are discussing nicaragua <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i am glad to publicly acknowledge the extraordinary amount of money that has been raised by the band aid group which i think reflects the very real feeling of all british people of concern about the famine in ethiopia <e> <s> i think the figures speak well for what has been provided by the western countries in this tragedy <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hatch has asked that question before and i shall confirm the answer that i gave him earlier that the money which has been provided for famine relief in ethiopia has come largely from the contingency fund and that if he looks at the answer that has been given by my right honourable friend the minister for overseas development in another place he will see that he has confirmed that it has come from the contingency fund the purpose of which is to provide money for such emergencies <e>", "<cs> my lords there is some evidence that that is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to question the reasons a particular question has been put down on the order paper it is for the government to respond to it <e> <s> i have given the figures as asked and i think the house can draw its own conclusions from them <e> <s> i have already indicated that quite properly we have given very generously in response to the very tragic situation arising from famine in ethiopia and indeed in other parts of africa <e> <s> i should add that not only has there been the money that we have given through the oda but also the ministry of defence has contributed some million as its share of the raf airlift in ethiopia <e>", "<cs> my lords i have just indicated that the ministry of defence has contributed a certain proportion of that <e> <s> the other part will come from the direct money from the oda <e>", "<cs> my lords if the purpose of the noble lords question is to identify some projects that have been lost my understanding of the situation is that the money has come from the contingency fund and that in the course of a year not necessarily all the money is actually spent because for a variety of reasons it cannot be spent <e> <s> i do not have any reason for thinking that we have switched money from one project to another for ethiopia <e>", "<cs> my lords how the money is spent and how any of the supplies may be distributed is of course a matter for the live aid group and their supporters <e> <s> however if we are asked for help or advice we shall be very happy to give it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that we have missed an opportunity <e> <s> our position has been absolutely plain all along <e> <s> we wish the aid to get to the people who require it <e> <s> if asked we would help in any way we could in the distribution of it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is my understanding of the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have that figure in front of me <e> <s> i know however that it amounts to a very generous sum of money <e> <s> my understanding is that it is quite a proportion of the sum of money that the government have raised <e> <s> i believe that this reflects the real concern of the british people <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friends first question on a timescale for treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords we have welcomed the commitment to the completion of the common market which is a fundamental objective of the treaty of rome and which has consistently been one of our own major objectives in the community <e> <s> indeed much of the commissions white paper accords with our own thinking <e> <s> the european council identified as areas for priority action on those matters which we had in fact put forward in our own programme of action <e> <s> they include the removal of technical barriers to free movement of goods within the community the creation of a free market in financial services and transport sectors the full freedom of establishment for the professions and the liberalisation of capital movements <e> <s> we believe that this will help the economy of europe and of course the economy of our country and that it could therefore make a contribution to reducing unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords we have put forward proposals for political co-operation <e> <s> on the particular point that the noble lord lord shinwell raises which is related to defence this is of course a concern of the nato alliance <e> <s> we hope that it will be possible to strengthen co-operation in this area in such a way that all partners can participate <e> <s> the western european union may initially be the right vehicle for this <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the particular point that the noble lord puts is of course a question that is covered by nato <e> <s> the issue that is addressed <e>", "<cs> my lords the government take the point that the noble lord lord bruce has made <e> <s> we want to see the full implementation of the community treaties as they are at present <e> <s> indeed we have put forward proposals that could be implemented without treaty amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the governments wish that we should implement very many of the proposals that have been made in the white paper on the completion of the common market my understanding is that some of the proposals would require a treaty amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords we put forward proposals at milan for a binding political co-operation agreement which incorporated a small permanent secretariat and closer co-operation on security these ideas together with other ideas that were put forward at milan will now be discussed among the ten in the coming months <e>", "<cs> my lords that does not surprise me coming from the noble lord lord jenkins of putney but i was asked for the governments view <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make it absolutely plain to the noble lord lord bruce and to others who may be concerned about this that before any commitments are made the house will have ample opportunity to discuss these matters <e> <s> the house will recall that we deposited the report of the dooge committee in the library and that it was debated in another place before the milan meeting <e> <s> nor can there be any question of an amendment of the treaties without the consent of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his intervention <e> <s> i hope that the majority of those in your lordships house and certainly those who sit on the government benches are interested in a forward look to the european community and agree that to that end britains ideas should be put forward vigorously <e>", "<cs> my lords as i told the noble lord on th june we are ready to contribute to the second replenishment of the international fund for agricultural development as soon as the other participants agree <e> <s> until agreement is reached on an appropriate governors resolution the second replenishment cannot take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i have nothing further to add to the answer that i gave to the noble lord on th june <e> <s> the government are ready to contribute to the second replenishment as soon as it is agreed and we indicated that we would reach a decision about the possibility of a united kingdom contribution to the ifads special programme for africa after agreement on replenishment had been reached <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of the piece of research to which my noble friend refers <e> <s> the governments position is as i have stated it on this occasion and as i stated it when this same question was asked previously <e>", "<cs> my lords

money between the oecd countries and the opec countries <e> <s> we are still waiting to hear whether the united states is prepared to make its contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of ifad is to mobilise additional resources to help developing countries to introduce expand or improve their food production systems <e> <s> for this reason we contributed to the first fund and we have said that we will contribute to the second replenishment <e> <s> in fact it would be quite wrong to say that anyone is playing a game over the <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made it plain that we are prepared to contribute to the second replenishment and we are prepared to consider the voluntary fund <e> <s> we have already given very considerable amounts of money to the relief of the famine in ethiopia and in the sudan and now by way of direct bilateral aid to sub-saharan africa <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we would all accept that the tragic situation in ethiopia is not helped by a civil war <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter to which i assume the noble lord is referring is discussed in the report of the select committee on foreign affairs in another place published on th july <e> <s> it would not be right to anticipate our considered reply to this report but the house will be aware that the report states that the house of commons was not misled on the main issue that the attack on the general belgrano was authorised for legitimate military reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not prepared to comment further than to say that the governments considered reply will be given to your lordships house and to another place at the appropriate time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to respond to my noble friends supplementary question <e> <s> this is in fact the seventeenth occasion that this matter has been raised in your lordships house there have been parliamentary questions two debates and three other supplementary questions on matters raised by other of my noble friends <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no quest ion at all of my sheltering behind producing a reply later <e> <s> that is the proper constitutional position with regard to select committees of another place <e> <s> but in case the noble lord should think that the government might be concerned the report makes plain that the house of commons was not misled on the main issue that the attack on the general belgrano was authorised for legitimate military reasons and not out of political design <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first point of the noble lords supplementary question is yes <e> <s> the answer to the second point will be considered in our response <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should now like to make a statement on the world conference to review and appraise the achievements

noble baroness lady seear for her very kind remarks about myself <e> <s> i have placed in the library a copy of my statement which of course covered the three themes of the conference equality peace and development <e> <s> i was able to outline some of the improvements in education and employment for women which have occurred over the past years in this country and to go on to point to some of the things which still need to be put right and was able to make the point on peace that although we all wish for peace the actual discussion of arms negotiations was not a suitable topic for the nairobi conference <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am right in saying that there were some black representatives from south africa at the nairobi conference <e> <s> i do not doubt that apartheid bears very heavily on women and children as indeed it bears heavily on men in south africa <e> <s> we have made our position on south africa very plain and one of the important factors about the nairobi conference was that at the end the forward-looking strategy was agreed by consensus <e> <s> there have been a number of united nations conferences which have not ended so well and this for the united nations in its fortieth anniversary year is an advantage <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that i did refer to the question of family planning in my statement <e> <s> it clearly was an issue which came up at the conference <e> <s> it is as i realise an immensely complex and difficult subject <e> <s> i think it is one which has to be approached with great care and understanding with countries whose backgrounds and traditions are different from our own <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady turner for what she has said about the statement <e> <s> she will know the governments response to that particular draft directive <e> <s> we in britain have a higher percentage of women in employment than any other country in western europe <e> <s> in fact the proportion of women who are now getting jobs is slightly higher than the proportion of men <e> <s> we feel that employment is one area where women have managed to gain but of course i take the point made by the noble baroness about the directive <e>", "<cs> my lords there were delegations of women from both pakistan and iran <e> <s> i did not myself hear the delegation representative from iran speak <e> <s> i regret that some of the points that were made concerned political matters points against zionism and the state of israel but i take the point my noble friend makes <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will know that in fact i cannot give her the undertaking she is seeking <e> <s> what i have said is that i have noted what she says as indeed i have <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments general view on nuclear weapon free zones is that their establishment in certain parts of the world could contribute to regional security to non-proliferation and to disarmament in general <e> <s> i cannot comment on the point about the numbers of nuclear devices but on french testing in the south pacific the united kingdom understand the reasons for the french tests while at the same time we recognise the strong regional concerns about matters of nuclear testing <e>", "<cs> my lords if not formally on the agenda for chogm this is a matter that may be discussed in the margins of the meeting <e> <s> as far as nuclear testing in the south pacific is concerned we believe that the best way to resolve the problem of testing is to work towards a total ban through the conference on disarmament at geneva <e> <s> i can confirm that we have not been formally asked to sign the ratification of the protocols <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a position to confirm all the figures the noble lord has given <e> <s> i think he has strayed slightly beyond the terms of the question but i very much take the point he made in the second part of his question because i think it is a real issue <e> <s> as i have indicated we are still studying this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already given the governments view on the french testing in the south pacific <e>", "<cs> my lords this house will have a good opportunity to debate the whole question of a comprehensive test ban treaty as the noble lord lord brockway has an unstarred question on this matter down for next week <e>", "<cs> my lords the position of the government is that we have only just officially received the text of the treaty but not the protocols from the south pacific forum <e> <s> it will be for the forum to decide how and when to approach the nuclear weapon states on the question of ratification <e> <s> the answer to the original question to which the noble lord referred is that we believe that the establishment of nuclear weapon free zones in certain parts of the world could contribute to regional security but this is a view conditioned by nuclear weapons not already being a feature of the security of the region and all states concerned being prepared to participate on the basis of agreements freely entered into and in keeping with internationally recognised principles <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i have made clear that we understand the strong regional concern about nuclear testing and the governments view on the best way of dealing with this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i can agree with the first point that the noble lord lord cledwyn made when he said that the recent events in the middle east emphasise the need again for us to try to see a way forward in these difficult circumstances <e> <s> i cannot however accept the tenor of the subsequent questions that he put to me <e> <s> i will go through those in detail and at the same time answer the points that have been raised by the noble lord lord gladwyn <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will be good enough just to listen to what i have to say i will do my best to set out what the position is <e> <s> i think this is a very serious and disappointing setback to a very brave endeavour to try to make progress in the middle east <e> <s> i have no wish to hide anything from your <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i did not answer that important question that the noble lord asked earlier on <e> <s> the negotiated assurances were made with the jordanian prime minister and the statement was cleared with the jordanian prime minister and with bishop khoury <e> <s> but we understood from the jordanian prime minister that mr milhem would agree to the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for the point that he has made <e> <s> it is a very important point <e> <s> the reason why the talks did not take place was because one of the palestinians did not accept israels right to exist in security within her own borders <e> <s> i am very glad that my noble friend has recognised the courage of both the prime minister and my right honourable friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary in trying in a difficult situation to assist the peace process <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the two points raised by the right reverend prelate bishop khoury had denied allegations of complicity in terrorism <e> <s> it is worth recording that he had never been prosecuted by the israeli authorities for terrorism <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that in this situation bishop khoury has himself acted with courage <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the first supplementary question by the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for saying that this was a courageous initiative <e> <s> the government believe that it was and regret very much the outcome <e> <s> the outcome is a setback but the government will persevere in their search for a way to advance the cause of peace in the middle east <e> <s> i will not add anything to my noble friends last remark <e> <s> we must concentrate on the best and most constructive way to go forward <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that the agreements reached and the assurances given by people acting responsibly who also had an interest in pursuing the process of peace and who also wished for a successful outcome were satisfactory <e> <s> it is a matter of regret that that was not the case <e> <s> i believe that the jordanian government share our disappointment at that outcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that there may be a misunderstanding of the position by the noble lord lord bottomley <e> <s> before the talks were to begin at all the british government had negotiated the form of words in writing which we understood all members of the delegation were prepared to agree to and which were to be issued as a statement at the conclusion of the talks <e> <s> it was only after the delegation had arrived in london that it was made plain that the delegation was not prepared to support the very essential assurances <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept for one moment that the foreign and commonwealth office has been put in a ridiculous position <e>", "<cs> my lords the government and my right honourable and learned friend have pursued a courageous initiative with care and prudence <e> <s> it is a matter of regret that the initiative has ended as it has <e> <s> nor can i accept the noble lords statement concerning bishop khoury <e> <s> i have already said in answer to a point made by the right reverend prelate that bishop khoury denied allegations of complicity in terrorism at the time and he has done so again recently <e>", "<cs> my lords he has never been prosecuted by the israeli authorities although it is true they are now claiming that he admitted awareness of transporting for others a package which contained explosive <e> <s> this was apparently later used in a bombing attack <e> <s> what is important now i think is to concentrate on the present <e> <s> the past record is important but it does seem that the present commitment is even more vital <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the question of the noble lord lord chalfont is that the assurances were to be given on behalf of the members of the delegation <e> <s> this was made quite clear and it was part of an initiative which was proposed by king hussein to advance the course of peace in the middle east <e> <s> the two members of the plo could not be described as representatives of the plo <e> <s> i think it is very important to recognise that the plo in a sense is a set of initials which embraces a wide cross-section of opinion apparently enjoying the support of most palestinians in the occupied territories <e> <s> i think it is also important to recognise that not all palestinians support terrorism and the armed struggle <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to confirm to the noble viscount lord tonypandy that that is indeed one of the conditions that have been set by her majestys government in this matter <e> <s> the right of israel to exist in security within her own boundaries and the rights of the palestinians to self-determination are of course part of security council resolution <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i entirely see the point which the noble lord lord caccia is making <e> <s> as the statement makes clear this initiative does arise out of the initiative of king hussein <e> <s> it was thought and hoped that having a delegation so composed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that my noble friend the leader of the house will have noted what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that the noble lord lord shinwell feels very strongly about this matter <e>

gives us a clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely take my noble friends point <e> <s> i do not think i implied in any way by what i said that we were celebrating the tenth anniversary <e> <s> we marked the tenth anniversary by the visit of my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary to helsinki and we considered the matter further at a seminar <e> <s> but nobody can be satisfied with the progress that has been made <e> <s> we would like to make more progress in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will have noted that my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary is the first foreign secretary to have visited the soviet union and all the eastern european countries which he did during the course of the last year <e> <s> we hope for improved relations <e> <s> it is too early to measure and to say what precisely is coming out of these matters but we do believe that the dialogue is important <e> <s> may i also add my congratulations to the noble lord lord shinwell <e> <s> i had not appreciated that it was his birthday tomorrow <e> <s> i am sure that i speak for all my noble friends in wishing him many happy returns <e>", "<cs> my lords the government believe that unfortunately there is no discernible improvement in the situation over the helsinki agreements and no sign that the new leadership in the soviet union is taking a different view of these matters <e> <s> but we believe in the continuing importance of raising them and of showing the russians that their behaviour is not overlooked <e>", "<cs> my lords we regret the action taken by the hungarian authorities which is contrary to the spirit and purpose both of the cultural forum itself and of the csce process <e> <s> indeed it is a sad commentary on the willingness of certain governments to tolerate freedom of expression <e> <s> the united kingdom together with our partners in the community have made clear to the hungarian authorities their regret that those outside the forum have been hindered in expressing their views <e>", "<cs> my lords i must look more carefully at what the noble lord lord shinwell has said and tell him about all the places where i can agree with him and leave out the places where i cannot agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords the most recent discussions in nato were by the united states secretary of state mr shultz when he briefed all his colleagues on the north atlantic council on th october about the current negotiations in geneva and the forthcoming meeting between president reagan and mr gorbachev <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point mentioned by the noble lord lord cledwyn as president reagan has repeatedly confirmed the sdi research is consistent with present obligations including the abm treaty

around moscow are the only type in existence in the world and they are being upgraded <e> <s> there is an extensive programme based on ballistic missile defence-related technologies <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the negotiations are concerned we are glad that the geneva talks are focusing on preventing an arms race in space <e> <s> we recognise that both sdi and the parallel soviet research are permitted under the existing agreements <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we would all agree that we want to see progress made at geneva but we must face the fact that the talks are not going to produce quick or easy results <e> <s> however we are all working with the objective in mind of achieving some constructive results <e>", "<cs> my lords our view is that it is in the best interests of the united kingdom and of the developing countries that we assist for the atp to be administered by the overseas development administration as part of our aid programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to comment other than on a specific point <e> <s> however i can confirm to the noble lord lord beaumont that we use a greater proportion of our aid than our competitors for atp-type financial packages and that over the three years to we won over million worth of contracts with the help of the atp <e> <s> those include major contracts in india brazil indonesia egypt zimbabwe kenya and peru <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord has a specific case in mind i shall be happy to look at it <e> <s> but my understanding is that in the past three years the dti has proposed almost atp cases <e>

interests <e>", "<cs> my lords the overseas development administration is there <e> <s> it is of course now part of the foreign and commonwealth office but it is within that a separate entity <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord oram has quite properly said the atp was established to help counter the often aggressive way in which some countries use aid funds to support their national firms in competition for large contracts in developing countries <e> <s> the atp is used to help british companies compete on an equal basis where other <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> for the reasons that i have given we do not believe that that would be the best line to pursue <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that it is in the best interests both of ourselves as a country and of the countries that we assist that the atp should continue to be administered by the oda <e> <s> that is the subject of the question <e> <s> that is the answer to it <e>", "<cs> my lords european union is an elusive and emotive term upon which many different constructions may be put <e> <s> i should like to begin by congratulating the select committee on the thoroughness with which it has tackled this important subject <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a most useful and i believe constructive debate and i am grateful to your lordships for providing the opportunity to consider this important report <e> <s> the government will take careful note of what has been said today <e> <s> i am sure that the report will attract much attention in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me i think to speculate on what

number of questions <e> <s> but the question to which he ought to address himself is will sanctions bring about the objectives which he is seeking <e> <s> there is no evidence that they have been effective in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord brockway for asking this question and i too add my congratulations on his birthday which i gather he is about to celebrate <e> <s> we all wish him many happy returns <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can add anything further to the answer that i have given the noble lord <e> <s> we shall clearly vote for those resolutions on which we think there will be progress but not others <e> <s> i hope i have said enough to indicate that we should like to see progress on this matter <e> <s> as my remarks continue i think that the noble lord will appreciate what we have to say on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the answer that i gave to the house will be sufficient to answer the question the noble lord has just asked <e> <s> i have indicated that there are real doubts which have been expressed by those who are competent to judge these matters that it would be very difficult to get the kind of verification we require <e> <s> these are concerns which the british government cannot ignore because they have a responsibility to the british people and to the whole of the world <e> <s> so far as the recent soviet proposal for a moratorium on testing is concerned this contains no new ideas and indeed ignores the problems of verification and of peaceful nuclear explosions so there are real difficulties there <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord jenkins for his kind congratulations and i should like to add mine also to the noble lord lord ponsonby <e> <s> may i say that the answer to the second part of his question is yes <e> <s> we hope that the discussions that will be taking place in november will be successful and will have a constructive outcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord has answered his own question by implying that if you ask a question couched in those terms it is impossible to give a sensible answer <e> <s> i do not intend to try <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point of the noble lords supplementary question i cannot add anything further to my original answer <e> <s> on the second point the governments position with regard to the negotiations at geneva is well known <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord chalfont for his question <e> <s> he is quite right in saying that what we are seeking to do is get balanced and verifiable reductions in arms <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord lord molloy will know the answer to his own question because last week he put a question to me in rather similar terms and i answered it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to be drawn into the technical details of this matter but i should like to assure the noble lord and the whole house that the government are as anxious as anyone to achieve arms reductions <e> <s> however it is a complex matter and reductions must be both balanced and verifiable <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an important matter but i take the point that my noble friend makes that it is very difficult to add anything new to the answers i have already given to earlier questions <e>", "<cs> my lords again the governments position on a nuclear freeze is well known and i have often given it in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for his question <e>", "<cs> my lords i gave the noble lord lord jenkins the answer that i cannot confirm the figures which is quite true <e> <s> i shall of course have to read carefully in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for asking that question <e> <s> it gives me an opportunity to say first that we hope very much for a constructive outcome in the direct talks between president reagan and mr gorbachev and then that we are in consultation with our american allies both on the political and on the arms control side of these talks <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is any disagreement in the house that we live in a very dangerous world <e> <s> what the government are trying to do in all our discussions both with our american allies and with others is to make progress in arms control talks where we are a party to them and in the political dialogue <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall continue to encourage realistic moves towards negotiated settlement of the conflicts in the middle east <e> <s> but the prime responsibility must remain with the parties directly involved <e> <s> we fully support king husseins courageous initiative <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm to the noble lord that we shall continue to encourage and support all constructive moves by the parties concerned towards a negotiated solution which provides for israels secure existence and right to exist within secure and recognised borders as well as the right of the palestinian people to self-determination <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make it clear that we found the breakdown of the proposed negotiations in early october which i explained in a statement to your lordships a great disappointment <e> <s> we must not allow this to be a fatal setback and we need to be forward looking <e> <s> we shall of course consider how we might best proceed because the fact is that an urgent need for a peaceful settlement remains <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we still stand by the principles of the venice declaration

settlement of this extremely difficult situation <e> <s> we keep in close touch with king hussein and i believe that the jordanians were as disappointed as we were at the postponement of the meeting with the joint delegation of jordanians and members of the plo and the fact that it did not take place <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a tribute to the most reverend primate the archbishop of canterbury and to the motion that he has put down for debate today that so many noble lords have spoken this afternoon <e> <s> if i may say so almost everyone has spoken from his or her personal experience <e> <s> in my opening remarks i was able to pay tribute to a number of noble lords who were in at the beginning of the united nations <e> <s> but now that i come to wind up i

stand by the statement that in order to make progress we need to have adequately verifiable proposals and i cannot therefore accept the suggestion he is making <e>", "<cs> my lords the suggestion arises from the leaders of six nations india mexico tanzania sweden greece and argentina who issued a declaration which urged the united states and the soviet union as well as the united kingdom

noble lords question i can only say-that in this case limited unilateral gestures are no substitute for long-term durable agreements <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it would be wise of me to reflect on the competence or otherwise of the people who made this proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very interesting proposal by the noble lord lord molloy <e> <s> i think that in fact these discussions are going on in the appropriate fora <e> <s> what is important is to get some agreement on verification <e>", "<cs> my lords agreement was close between and in the trilateral negotiations

resolution of problems of that kind that is needed in order to make progress <e>", "<cs> my lords referring to the article in the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mayhew may ask his question a second time but i can only reiterate the answer i gave him the first time <e>", "<cs> my lords there is an argument for saying that the balance of deterrence has been a contributory factor in keeping

speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the ban but the fact is that limited

those that he made about unesco when we debated this among other matters in the foreign affairs debate on the queens speech <e> <s> i agree when he says that the reforms that have been instituted in unesco have not been substantial enough <e> <s> on the specific point about mr mbow i can only say that we believe that he is responsible for low management standards <e> <s> it is however important to remember what has been said in the statement about the alternatives to remaining a member of unesco namely that the money that has been saved from our contribution will be used through the aid programme to further educational scientific and other activities designed to benefit developing countries particularly in the commonwealth <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say to the noble lord lord caradon and can only repeat what i have said to other noble lords who have raised similar points on this statement that our decision is a decision of the government <e> <s> it is not a reflection of the views of the united states <e> <s> nor indeed is this an attack on the united nations system as a whole <e> <s> i made this plain in an answer that i gave to an earlier question <e> <s> indeed the statement itself makes it quite clear <e> <s> as it says in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords the two questions that the noble lord has put to me this evening are ones that <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the first part of the noble lords supplementary as i have already indicated we support all organisations which are honestly attempting to promote greater understanding between east and west <e> <s> but in the case of this particular organisation it is significant that the world peace council has given prominent support to the ippnw in its currrent programme of action <e> <s> i also understand that the programme of the world peace councils sub-committee for scientists and doctors urges its members to co-operate with the ippnw and that organisation receives considerable publicity in world peace council publications <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friend lady cox i confirm that a message was sent to the chairman of the nobel peace committee in oslo on behalf of the conservative party on the th december in terms similar to those sent by chancellor kohl <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lords question is wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has misunderstood what i said <e> <s> i repeated what i said in the first part of the answer to the question namely that we support honest attempts to secure greater understanding on disarmament issues <e> <s> that does not mean that everybody who supports these organisations qualifies for a nobel prize <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already indicated the governments view about this organisation <e> <s> it would be very regrettable if people were to believe that this organisation was other than what it is <e> <s> the ippnw is not a soviet front organisation of the traditional kind but since the world peace councils world congress in new international peace groups for particular professions in this case doctors have emerged in most of which the soviet hand is apparent <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the first part of the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> as far as the award of the prize is concerned this must ultimately be a decision for the committee that determines who should receive the prize <e> <s> i think it is a very serious matter that one of the founders of this organisation dr chazov directs the fourth chief administration of <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have in front of me the speeches of the recipients of the nobel prize <e> <s> but i agree with the second observation that my noble friend has made <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already indicated in answering an earlier question dr chazov directs the fourth chief administration of the soviet health ministry and therefore is in a central and senior position within the soviet union <e> <s> to that extent he must bear responsibility for soviet union policies <e> <s> but of course the ultimate decision on who should receive the prize must be a decision for the nobel prize committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that anything that has been said in the course of this exchange this afternoon has been intended to be a criticism of the nobel prize committee <e> <s> their record is clear enough <e> <s> however i think one must make it quite clear that their members on this particular occasion may not have adequately considered all the factors involved before making their award and in making it they have therefore called into question their impartiality on a matter of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite clear that i understand the question of the noble lord lord rea <e> <s> all i know is that people in this country and in many countries of the west have on many occasions called for the release of dr sakharov and expressed their concern about his fate in the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that in what i have said i have made it quite clear that these two particular recipients would not be our choice for this prize <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i can assure my noble friend on the points that he raises <e> <s> yes some money does go towards the ship the rms st helena and we have been considering the options for maintaining a shipping service to the island <e> <s> in the light of the report by consultants we concluded that a detailed appraisal should be carried out for a replacement vessel of similar size

falkland islands st helena receives twice as much aid per head as any other dependency <e>", "<cs> my lords i can understand the enthusiasm of the noble lord lord shackleton for asking a supplementary question <e> <s> i am of course aware of the point that he raises about communications <e> <s> as i indicated to my noble friend lord inglewood the feasibility of constructing an airstrip for emergency use has been under review but i must tell him that the indications are that the cost even for a limited use facility would be very considerable <e>", "<cs> my lords there is the possibility of consideration of an airfield for emergency use and the cost of an airfield which is described as a low-cost airfield <e> <s> but we are of course considering the whole question as i have already indicated of the replacement of rms st helena <e>", "<cs> my lords at the present time we are financing a new power station at the cost of million a new secondary school at the cost of some million

shall write to my noble friend on that point <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i note what the noble lord says and thank him <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that there is no doubt that the government are fair to all these people <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say that the middle east was specifically an agenda item <e> <s> i should have expected that in the course of their discussions they would have talked about the middle east <e> <s> however i can confirm to the noble lord lord cledwyn that we keep closely in touch with the united states over this matter because we recognise that the united states has a special role because of her close links to parties on both sides of the dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i accept the importance of the role particularly of the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord paget is quite incorrect on anything which i said in answer to the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give an answer to the noble lords question couched in the terms that it is <e> <s> we do not accept that the plo is the sole legitimate representative of the palestinian people but we believe that they should be associated with negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept the remarks of the noble lord lord molloy about the united states <e> <s> however perhaps it may be helpful to the house to add something further about the plo <e> <s> i think it is important to recognise that not all palestinians support terrorism or the arms struggle and that it embraces a very wide cross-section of opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i would wish to follow the noble lord lord paget down that philosophical path <e>", "<cs> my lords i did study the original question of the noble lord and i gave him an answer to it <e> <s> there already exist ample opportunities for international consideration of the implications of sdi <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware the sdi was discussed at the summit meeting when president reagan made it clear that he was going to continue with the research but within the restrictive interpretation of the abm treaty <e> <s> on the other question which the noble lord asked about our contribution to this research we believe that there are opportunities for this if british companies want to take them <e>", "<cs> my lords there have already been questions on the detail of the anglo-american agreement <e> <s> it is quite wide of the question on the order paper but the noble lord is quite right in thinking that there is the possibility that a very substantial amount of sdi work consistent with our industrial base could come to this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend for drawing attention to that very important point which was fully spelt out in a statement made by my right honourable friend mr stanley on th november <e> <s> it is clear that the activities of the united states are only prudent in the light of what is being done by the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord lord jenkins is fully aware that the basis of the united kingdoms policy remains the four points that were agreed at camp david one year ago <e>", "<cs> my lords the question asked by the noble lord is wide of that on the order paper <e> <s> if he cares to put it down as a separate question then i shall be happy to try to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the noble lord lord molloy that there is no difference of opinion between the secretary of state and myself in respect of any of the answers i have given this afternoon <e> <s> the fact is that the americans are committed to the common defence both of north america and of western europe which is secured under the nato treaty and that there are close and frequent alliance consultations about the implications of sdi for the defence of europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to give effect to a request by the parliament and government of the commonwealth of australia <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all those noble lords who have taken part this afternoon in this short but i believe very important debate on the australia bill <e> <s> i am particularly grateful for the wholehearted support given by the noble lord lord cledwyn and the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones as well as that from the noble earl lord grey <e> <s> it represents the views of all parts of political life in this country <e> <s> i think we would all agree with the words of the noble lord lord cledwyn when he said that although we all wholeheartedly support the bill we feel a tinge of nostalgia at the same time <e> <s> this has been reflected in the words spoken in todays debate <e> <s> indeed it is the end of an era nevertheless it is an important step and one that we all welcome because it reflects the rightful relationship between two important equal and independent countries <e>", "<cs> my lords the views of the two governments to which the noble lord has referred on certain aspects of alliance policy are well known <e> <s> they are not shared by this government or the rest of the alliance <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree with what my noble friend says <e>", "<cs> my lords the secretary-general of nato is as i said in my original answer entitled to express an opinion about the views held by other governments in the alliance <e> <s> that is what he did in this particular speech <e>", "<cs> my lords members of your lordships house are of course perfectly entitled to put down questions on matters which are within the general arrangements of your lordships house <e> <s> i hope i have given noble lords a fair answer to the question <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i agree with what he says <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given my view on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given a straight answer to the noble lord <e> <s> let me make it absolutely plain <e> <s> lord carringtons statement was not a statement of party politics but a statement on alliance issues <e> <s> the activities of some of the peace groups in the west and of the parties which support them will inevitably encourage the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords not so far as i am aware <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement on the evacuation from the peoples democratic republic of the yemen that is being made in another place by my right honourable and learned friend the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both the noble lord lord cledwyn and the noble viscount lord falkland for their very good kind and positive reception to this statement <e> <s> in what they said they reflect what we all feel in the recognition of and our sympathy for those who have had to leave south yemen and our tribute to those who are responsible for their rescue <e> <s> i was glad to hear the tributes paid to our ambassador and his staff in aden as well as to those responsible in the royal navy and the merchant navy for what they have done <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make it quite clear that we have condemned all acts of terrorism from whatever quarter and will continue to work with other like-minded countries to bring both political and diplomatic pressure to bear on states which support terrorists <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware we have tightened security and there are now armed police at heathrow which i think indicates the seriousness with which we view the problem <e> <s> we also encourage a full exchange of information and intelligence with others on terrorist activities and we also monitor the movement and actions of would-be terrorists and those who support them <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that at this stage that is a hypothetical question <e> <s> the governments position on the question of sanctions against south africa is well known <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer my noble friend we have taken a number of actions against libya <e> <s> following the shooting of the policewoman in st jamess square in we broke off diplomatic relations we prohibited the export of defence equipment we denied ecgd cover for medium and long-term credit and we imposed severe restrictions on libyan immigration into britain <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that question is quite wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we all agree that this is a very serious matter indeed but i must make plain that the opposition of the united states administration to the pira is well known and it is not policy to harbour ira terrorists <e> <s> indeed a supplementary extradition treaty has been concluded with the united states administration which if approved by the senate will prevent fugitive terrorists from avoiding extradition by claiming that their alleged offences were political <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lords question is quite wide of the orginal question on the order paper but let me make it quite plain that the united states administration have not asked us to join with them in imposing sanctions on nicaragua <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept what lies behind the noble lords question as i entirely accept the concern expressed in the orginal question by the noble lord lord chalfont <e> <s> indeed the foreign ministers of the european community will be meeting next week and one of the subjects on their agenda will be terrorism and it underlines our belief that is must be tackled by like-minded states working together <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hatch is well aware of the steps that her majestys government have taken towards south africa and the agreements that we have reached with our community partners and indeed with our colleagues in the commonwealth <e> <s> we still believe that sanctions in that situation would be counter-productive and we prefer positive measures such as the commonwealth eminent persons group <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make it clear that wherever there is evidence of support for terrorists by a foreign government we do not hesitate to make clear our condemnation and take the necessary steps to deter and if possible stop such support <e> <s> i have already indicated the firm measures that we took after the shooting in st jamess square and we believe that it is quite unacceptable for other countries to export violence to the united kingdom or to other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords the first committee of the th united nations general assembly considered one resolution recommending consideration of the conversion of the partial test ban treaty into a comprehensive test ban <e> <s> it was adopted by votes to three with abstentions <e> <s> there were three further resolutions calling for a comprehensive test ban and for the inclusion on the agenda of the st general assembly of an item on the need for the cessation of tests <e> <s> of these one put forward by australia and new zealand was adopted by votes to three with abstentions one proposed by hungary was adopted by votes to three with abstentions and that sponsored by mexico was accepted by votes to two with abstentions <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make the position of our government quite clear <e> <s> we voted against the resolutions tabled because they did not meet our criteria <e> <s> the government continue to believe that outstanding problems of verification must be solved before negotiations can be started on a comprehensive test ban <e> <s> nor indeed would i accept that the record of the western powers is in any way preventing the peace process <e> <s> on the contrary the peace process is more likely to be taken forward if we start our negotiations from a position of strength <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not prepared to accept that statement made by the noble lord lord mayhew which he has of course made on a number of previous occasions <e> <s> we have made our position quite plain on this matter <e> <s> as i have already indicated in the answer that i gave to the supplementary question of the noble lord lord brockway we are committed to seeking progress towards a comprehensive test ban treaty and our own nuclear tests are conducted to maintain the effectiveness of our nuclear capabilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not prepared to accept that the united kingdom is isolated <e> <s> we voted in these debates with the united states and with france and most of our nato partners abstained <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure to which scientific evidence the noble lord is referring <e> <s> if he is referring to the norwegian seismic array experiment we hope of course that this experiment will provide a solution to some of the outstanding technical problems <e> <s> but claims for the efficiency of high frequency seismic stations can be exaggerated and we do not have much data on them <e> <s> nor are there any reliable discriminants applicable to high frequency signals <e>", "<cs> my lords we have received the latest proposals sent by mr gorbachev in his message to my right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> many elements are a repetition of existing soviet ideas but the proposals are wide ranging they contain new elements and they will require full and careful study <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord chalfont for his questions <e> <s> it is true that there are other nations who would be involved in a comprehensive test ban treaty and we agree that the scientific evidence available is not sufficiently advanced to be sure that we can rely on getting the verification that we require for a test ban treaty <e> <s> i further agree that the united states proposed an exchange of test site observers and in july invited soviet observers to visit a united states test site <e> <s> this would go to the heart of the key issue which is verification on the ground <e> <s> it is a matter for regret that the soviet response has so far been dismissive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry that the noble lord lord cledwyn should feel that i have not dealt adequately with any point in the committees report <e> <s> as i indicated to the noble lord we agree with almost every point that has been made <e>", "<cs> my lords what i would like to say on the visit of the israeli prime minister is that useful and constructive discussions were held <e> <s> we agreed on the need for an early negotiation and settlement of the arab-israel dispute and we welcomed the positive development of common ground between mr peres and king hussein on negotiations within an international framework <e> <s> we have also been in touch with ambassador murphy who saw both king <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i made plain in my original answer to the noble lords question that king hussein paid a private visit to london <e> <s> he met with my right honourable friend the prime minister on th january <e> <s> we support his efforts in the peace negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord molloy asked about five questions within that supplementary question <e> <s> to establish a basis of fact for answering them it might be better if i welcomed the interest that mr gorbachev expressed in paris in october in finding a common language on international problems <e> <s> his suggestion of contacts between the warsaw pact and nato was however couched in vague and hypothetical terms and not something which has either been pursued by the russians or seriously considered by nato <e> <s> it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i can best answer that supplementary question by saying that we are in close touch with our american allies over a wide number of issues and we talk to them very regularly <e> <s> the particular point that the noble lord raises about a comprehensive test-ban treaty is i think outside the terms of the question <e> <s> but if he is good enough to put down a question on that subject i shall of course be happy to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords once again if the noble lord were to put down a question on that particular point i should be happy to try to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will know we and our american allies and our partners in nato want to see a genuine reduction in armaments but they must be both balanced and verifiable <e> <s> as far as the outcome of the geneva summit is concerned we believe that it was a success and that it had a number of specific results <e> <s> it contributed a measure of confidence and greater understanding between two world leaders <e> <s> president reagan received the full support of the alliance and will continue to do so in the run-up to the next summit which will be held in the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords i should much regret if it were reported that i was in any way discourteous either to the noble lord lord cledwyn or to the noble lord lord boston <e> <s> but it is a very wide question on the order paper and these are very serious and complex subjects <e> <s> i answered a question on the comprehensive test-ban treaty giving the governments views on that matter <e> <s> i feel that i should not be prepared to go further than what i said in answer to that question today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to agree with what my noble friend has said in his tribute to the bbc external broadcasts <e> <s> his original point of course is one of the matters which no doubt will be looked at in consideration of the report that has recently been received <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be very difficult to answer the noble lord lord cledwyn because it is too early to say how any proposal which might be made for a television service could be funded <e>", "<cs> my lords i note very much what my noble friend has to say about the importance of the telecommunications industry and the fact that it is in the forefront of development <e> <s> i assure him that the proposals made by the bbc will be studied carefully bearing in mind the point that he has made <e> <s> the iba has recently presented a report to my right honourable friend the home secretary on possible options for a united kingdom dbs service and those are currently being studied by the relevant departments too <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord says <e> <s> i am sure that that is one of the matters that needs to be considered carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point that the noble lord has made which is an important one <e> <s> i have no doubt that that is one of the matters that will be considered by the working party that is looking at the future possible service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to confirm to the noble lord the importance that we attach to the bbc external services <e> <s> we recognise their value throughout the world <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a question which is partly hypothetical <e> <s> all i can say to the noble lord is that following upon president bothas speech we believe that this contained a significant statement of principles as well as positive steps for this parliamentary session for example the restoration of citizenship the extension of freehold rights and the abolition of discriminatory passbook systems <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as apartheid is concerned i have made plain the governments position many times in your lordships house <e> <s> i was asked a question which was hypothetical but i gave the best answer i could to it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very large question <e> <s> i think that i would require notice of it before trying to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree with what the noble lord lord chalfont said in the first part of his question <e> <s> as is well known to your lordships we as a government have supported the measures taken with our community partners in september following the meeting in luxembourg <e> <s> we have supported the agreements reached following the chogm meeting in the bahamas <e> <s> of course we support the work of the <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the governments position about apartheid has been made plain <e> <s> i have already indicated the steps that we have taken and which we believe are right with our colleagues in the community and friends and allies in the commonwealth <e> <s> so far as investment is concerned this is a matter for the individual firms concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation following the meeting in lusaka is that the meeting agreed that if all the various measures announced so far fail to achieve the desired results further measures should be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to say what are the motives of the soviet union in making this proposal <e> <s> but i am glad to be able to say that the soviet union has made clear its support for the secretary-generals initiative in his proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i hope that the secretary-general is fully aware of the importance that we attach to his initiative and of the very full support that we have given him throughout the long complex and patient negotiations that he has been undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm to the noble lord that the prime minister of turkey is at present in london making his official visit here <e> <s> i had the opportunity to have talks with him yesterday and among the matters discussed was the problem of cyprus <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very difficult for me to answer a generalised question such as that <e> <s> i am quite sure that there are very many members of the commonwealth who hope very much that there will be a settlement in cyprus <e>", "<cs> my lords one has to be clear about the functions of the international monetary fund which provides short-term balance of payments support <e> <s> it does not specify particular uses of loans <e> <s> indeed the conditions that are attached to loans are aimed at restoring the position of borrowers balances of payments and their long-term economic growth <e>", "<cs> my lords the position of the government on the question of arms sales is that we consider each circumstance on a case-by-case basis wherever it may be but we do not agree to the sale of any equipment which in our judgment is likely to be used for internal repression or in order to violate human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this is a supplementary which is quite wide of the question which is really concerned with the development of the armaments industries within the countries themselves <e> <s> but perhaps i may add for the noble lord that article of the united nations charter stresses that independent states have the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already indicated all aspects of a debtors economic performance are considered in debt negotiations <e> <s> of course i recognise that the second half of the original question is concerned with the very wide issue of world stability <e> <s> naturally the government are concerned about peace in the world which is a very large question but as i have already indicated it is an inherent right of any country to develop

responded to the proposals that have been made by mr gorbachev and there has been close consultation about this response which has our full support <e> <s> it is a practical step-by-step approach and

stockholm vienna and geneva on conventional and chemical arms control <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of anti-satellite weapons we have welcomed president <e>", "<cs> my lords the position of the government on sdi is based on the four points which were set out following on the agreement between my right honourable friend the prime minister and president reagan in december <e> <s> as the right reverend prelate will know we have agreed to take part in the research on sdi <e>", "<cs> my lords i have quoted from the communication precisely what president reagan said <e> <s> the talks that are going on at geneva cover a whole range of these space weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords the russians have made much use in public of the statement that a condition of progress at geneva is the abandonment by the united states of sdi <e> <s> in practice this has not prevented the russians from putting forward specific proposals both in september and subsequently on th january this year <e> <s> we believe that the immediate priority is the reduction by each side of offensive weapons and we hope now that the soviet union will allow rapid progress to be made in the geneva talks <e>", "<cs> my lords without notice i could not give the noble lord an answer to the second part of his question <e> <s> if he would put down a question on <e>", "<cs> my lords i was stating a fact about the soviet

example the restoration of citizenship the extension of freehold rights and the abolition of the discriminatory passbook system <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is for the british government to say who should represent the south african blacks in negotiations with the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord cledwyn will know that the commonwealth heads of government meeting took place in october <e> <s> the six months is therefore is not quite up <e> <s> on the point about president bothas speech one fact that we can warmly welcome is the south african governments decision to lift the state of emergency <e>", "<cs> my lords yes it is an economic pressure <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that the release of mr mandela would constitute a major act of national reconciliation in south africa and could provide the impetus for a genuine dialogue <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made plain the governments position on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that question <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be aware that i prefaced my answer to his earlier question by saying that this was a process of change <e> <s> we hope that there will be more

peaceful settlement in a very difficult political situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord molloy for asking for this short debate <e> <s> i welcome the opportunity to put on the record once again the governments views on the current state of arms control and disarmament agreements and on the very best way to ensure the defence of europe with our nato allies <e> <s> i also welcome the opportunity to comment on some of the proposals for new international bodies which were advanced by the noble lord in his speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not quite hear the noble lords last word <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that the soviet union which has asked us to include those weapons in certain negotiations has not put a precise date on that <e> <s> if i am wrong about that i shall of course let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just answer the point that the noble lord lord kennet made on this matter before he gets up again <e> <s> i remind him that this is not merely a technical matter <e> <s> the united states would have to seek the political approval of its european allies for the redeployment of inf on their territories <e> <s> that could obviously take some time <e> <s> the soviet union on the other hand would face no such constraints and could redeploy its weapons as fast as any aircraft could carry them <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point that the noble lord has made <e> <s> my understanding is that the soviet union has said that some of the ss s would be destroyed and others would be moved <e> <s> they could be redeployed to the east of the soviet union <e> <s> that is the point that i was making in my last remark in answer to the point that the noble lord was making <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will just let me complete my speech before he interrupts me once again with these points i will note what he has to say <e> <s> the establishment of an adequate verification regime is not merely a technical matter <e> <s> let us not forget that scientists assessments are not the whole story for the assessment of adequacy remains a political judgment backed up by technical findings <e> <s> and such a judgment rests upon a range of considerations including the extent of political confidence on the part of one party that others will comply with a treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord if i misunderstood what he said but i thought he had <e> <s> at any rate i have now set out for the record what the position is <e> <s> he asked me at the end of his speech two questions which i should like to answer <e> <s> first he asked me to confirm an answer given by my honourable friend mr renton in another place <e> <s> as president reagan has repeatedly confirmed sdi research is consistent with the us present obligation including the abm treaty <e> <s> he confirmed that sdi will be conducted in conformity with a strict interpretation of the treaty <e> <s> the government have repeatedly made clear that we regard the treaty as an important element in preserving international peace and stability and i can confirm that we want to see it reaffirmed and strengthened <e> <s> any suspicion of violations should be pursued according to the mechanisms provided for in the treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords i have tried to listen with great care to what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i hope very much that he will perhaps reconsider some of his remarks and withdraw the remarks that he has made about the advisers in the foreign office and other civil servants who as he will know are not in a position to speak for themselves and i think we would all accept do for governments of all complexions a very good job <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the point behind my noble friends question and i can say to him that of course we are sympathetic to the difficulties which westminster city council face <e> <s> the requirement to carry out work on environmental grounds and the recovery of the costs are matters for the city council <e> <s> however i can assure my noble friend that fco officials keep in very close touch with the city council officials and give them assistance and advice <e> <s> also westminster city council is kept fully informed of the negotiations with the iranian government over damage to diplomatic property both in the united kingdom and in iran <e>", "<cs> my lords we are involved in quite complicated negotiations with the government of iran which cover both british property in tehran as well as iranian property in london <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord will appreciate that it would not be appropriate to go into the details but i can assure him that we are actively engaged in negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords i can very much sympathise with the point that the noble lord lord strabolgi makes in this matter <e> <s> as he will be aware legislation is under consideration to enable the government to acquire the title in exceptional circumstances of premises formerly used for the purposes of a diplomatic mission which the government concerned refuse to dispose of <e> <s> however <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give an answer to my noble friend specifically on rhodesia house <e> <s> however in order to make the position quite plain about what lies behind the question of my noble friend lord kinnoull let me say that it is not a question of non-payment of rates it is a question of costs which westminister city council have been put to in order to make sure that the building is safe <e>", "<cs> no my lords in this particular situation we are negotiating directly with the iranian government over our properties in teheran and the iranian governments properties in london <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the position the westminster city council have now spent a considerable sum of money making the building safe under the health and safety regulations <e> <s> one of the subjects of negotiation between ourselves and the iranian government concerns the claims with respect to damage to the property which occurred when there was the difficulty in the then iranian embassy and they are balanced against the claims which the british government have against iran for british property in teheran which was affected by the iranian revolution <e> <s> there are a number of complex interlocked negotiations going on <e> <s> what i can say to my noble friend is that we are actively engaged in trying to make some progress in them because we should all like to see progress made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of course that the noble lord lord brockway raised a very similar question on monday <e> <s> i have read both his question and the answers which were given on that occasion <e> <s> i am also aware of the sincerity with which he asks his questions and the strength of his feeling about the issue of nuclear testing <e> <s> may i make it quite clear that the government would also like to see progress made but as i have said to him and as my noble friend lord trefgarne said to him on monday what is important is that we should be quite sure that we can have the tests verified <e> <s> we are not sure that the verification is possible at this present time <e> <s> until it is we cannot enter into something when it would be possible for one of the parties to the arrangement to cheat <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much appreciate the point my noble friend has raised in his supplementary question <e> <s> of course we welcome president reagans statement that if we are able to agree on verification proposals he is prepared to move forward on the ratification of both the threshold test ban treaty and the peaceful nuclear explosions treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may take first the last point raised by the noble lord lord cledwyn the six-nation offer was made last october to set up monitoring stations on their territories as part of an international monitoring network and it was not directed to the united kingdom but towards the united states and the soviet union immediately before the geneva summit <e> <s> but even with third party monitoring we have some doubts that the testing moratorium would be adequately verifiable <e> <s> third parties could have a role to play in an adequate verification regime for a comprehensive test ban treaty and of course these ideas could be pursued at the committee on disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with very much of the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> it is very important that we should find methods of verification i and that politically there should be the confidence to <e>", "<cs> my lords we have welcomed the renewal of the united states invitation to the soviet union to send observers to nevada <e> <s> we regret that the soviet reaction has reportedly once again been negative on that matter <e> <s> referring to the conference on disarmament of course negotiations referring to that would be premature before progress has been made towards resolving all the outstanding issues and especially verification <e> <s> in answer to the earlier question that is obviously a forum where matters of verification could be pursued <e>", "<cs> my lords i hoped i had given the governments response when i answered an earlier supplementary question on the six-nation offer <e> <s> the six nations are of course india sweden argentina tanzania greece and mexico <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no new policy on aid to tanzania <e> <s> we have told the tanzanian government that we are ready to provide balance-of-payments support once economic reforms are in place along lines advocated by the international monetary fund and the world bank <e> <s> meanwhile we are continuing to provide modest capital aid to maintain recently completed major projects such as the songea-makambako road and for certain other rural <e>", "<cs> my lords my honourable friend mrs chalker was reported as saying that we would give no more aid until tanzania agreed with the imf <e> <s> we are not offering aid except where it is needed to ensure that existing projects remain effective such as providing for road maintenance <e> <s> further aid must depend on an economic climate in which we could expect it to bring real benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason for the original answer i gave is that we believe that tanzania should conform to the principles laid down by the imf and if they did not do so the benefits of any aid would be short-lived and largely wasted <e> <s> there is need for a structural adjustment <e> <s> aid that allows developing countries to delay making reforms that are necessary can in fact do more harm than good <e>", "<cs> my lords yes that indeed was the point that i was making <e> <s> the aid that we are giving is in support of specific projects to which we have already contributed to make quite sure that they remain effective but at the same time we hope that tanzania will accede to the requests of the imf <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that if the noble lord lord hatch looks at my original answer to his question he will see that i have made it quite plain that we have not cut off aid to tanzania but that it is being provided in specific instances <e> <s> indeed we are spending million on aid to tanzania in this financial year <e> <s> that includes million on technical co-operation to provide training teaching and advice <e> <s> although we have great sympathy with the economic problems with which tanzania is faced we believe that the imf programmes and world bank assistance remain central to the task of structural adjustment and economic policy reform and indeed for restoring economic growth and for the management of its debt problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is precisely for the reason that my noble friend has identified that there have been difficulties in the past that the greatest care is taken to try and ensure that the aid that is given reaches the people for whom it is intended <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat the answer that has been given to a private notice question in another place on gchq by my right honourable and learned friend the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs <e> <s> it reads representatives of the council of civil service unions called on me yesterday at their request to discuss the governments future intentions for staffing at gchq <e> <s> i explained that the governments decisions affecting gchq had been taken in the interests of national security to ensure that gchqs operations would in future be free from disruption <e> <s> that objective had been achieved and there was no change in the governments basic policy <e> <s> the government intended that this policy be applied as sympathetically as possible in individual cases <e>", "<cs> my lords both the noble lord lord cledwyn and the noble lord lord rochester asked a series of questions on the answer which i have given to the private notice question <e> <s> i will answer them in the order in which they were asked <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that the alternative jobs offered will be in other parts of the civil service <e> <s> as i said at the beginning it is our intention that we should try and offer jobs which are acceptable to the b and the c optants if they prefer to look for another job rather than to accept the terms of premature retirement <e>", "<cs> my lords as i hoped i had made clear in the answer to the first question that was asked the government believe that now that over per cent of employees have accepted the revised terms of service the government have achieved their objective which is to ensure the smooth running of gchq without disruption <e> <s> we believe that this is now the right way forward <e> <s> i explained in answer to the question that was asked why we felt that a no-disruption agreement was not a viable option <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord will accept that per cent of those employed at gchq have accepted the arrangements which we have outlined <e> <s> this fact coupled with the restructuring agreement which will be negotiated between the staff federation at gchq and the treasury will we hope indicate to those who have agreed to these new terms the importance that we attach to their work and their conditions of service <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his references to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> as i have already indicated we believe that the best hope for an early settlement is through the united nations and in particular through the good offices of the secretary-general <e> <s> we supported un security council resolution which was adopted on th february we joined with our community partners on th february in a declaration which underlined the need for the implementation of this resolution as well as the requirement to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of neighbouring states and on st march we endorsed the statement by the president of the security council which condemned both the use of chemical weapons by iraq and the prolongation of the conflict <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord cledwyn is referring to a press report on what my honourable friend mr renton is alleged to have said <e> <s> may i make quite clear that what he said in kuwait and i confirm now was that any kuwait request for help would be considered promptly and sympathetically <e>", "<cs> my lords the position of her majestys government is as i have set out in support of the initiatives and the efforts of the united nations secretary-general to bring this appalling conflict to an end <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments view is that it is right to support the efforts of the united nations secretary-general to try to bring to an end this terrible war which has already cost so many young lives <e>", "<cs> my lords we sell no defence-related equipment which could significantly enhance the capability of either side to prolong or to exacerbate the conflict <e> <s> all applications for the export of defence-related equipment are rigorously scrutinised to ensure that all such items are excluded <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the supplementary question which the noble lord asks and i hope he will understand that really it would be very difficult to comment on that type of question <e> <s> what i would say to him is that kuwait knows that we would give any request our full consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that our position on the use and recruitment of children in these conflicts has been made quite clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i have noted what the noble lord lord kennet said and as would be the normal practice on such questions in your lordships house they will be studied with care both in my department and by my colleagues with responsibility for this part of the world <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can confirm that we wish to see the earliest possible end to this conflict and that we support all realistic initiatives especially those through the united nations <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will appreciate from what i have said that we do not believe that we have a simple solution to ending the war but we are supporting those who are trying to get a negotiated settlement <e>", "<cs> it is now some time since the noble lord lord mcintosh rose to move this amendment <e> <s> in the course of that time we have had a very interesting discussion during which a number of very important issues have been raised <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord mcintosh said in opening his support for these linked amendments we are in fact taking one by one a number of the points raised in the long debate we have just had on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the effect of these amendments is to seek to include on governing bodies for county controlled and maintained special schools additional teacher governors and a new category of support staff governors at the same time reducing the number of co-opted and in the case of a controlled school foundation governors <e>", "<cs> i should much regret it if the noble lord lord taylor were to take personally any remarks i have made <e> <s> i was trying to set out what his committee was saying what the amendment does and why the government disagree with certain parts of it <e> <s> i hope that he will accept what i said in that spirit <e>", "<cs> i should be happy to try to explain the arithmetic as i understand it <e> <s> under the proposed series of amendments if we take the smallest school there would be one teacher one head teacher and one member of the support staff that is three <e> <s> there would be two parents two local authority nominees and two co-opted members <e> <s> my point is that there would be more staff than in the group of parents the local authority representatives or the co-opted members <e> <s> the staff would be the largest group <e> <s> however it <e>", "<cs> as i suspected when we were debating amendment no <e> <s> and the matter of pupil governors was raised that was not the last word on this subject <e> <s> i can tell from the number of members of the committee who have taken part in this debate on pupil governors that this is a matter on which individuals can have very strong opinions based on their own experience <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to what the noble lord lord mcintosh has said <e> <s> perhaps i can say in response to his welsh credentials that i can claim only that my mothers family all came from wales and that i like wales very much indeed <e>", "<cs> i understand that the purpose of the amendment is to preclude local education authorities from resolving that any two or more maintained schools may be grouped for school government purposes if any school involved is a welsh medium school or one that has a welsh medium unit attached to it <e> <s> i must draw attention to subsection <e>", "<cs> i take the point that the noble lord makes that there is this problem <e> <s> if i have understood the position correctly it is similar to that referred to in the earlier amendment on schools with welsh medium units attached to them <e> <s> the noble lords concern is that they should not be grouped with english schools <e> <s> he has given examples of where this has happened <e> <s> i shall look carefully tomorrow at <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to what the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey has said on both clauses and and with the permission of the committee i should like to speak to both clauses at the same time <e> <s> clause re-enacts section of the act and provides for the detailed procedures to be followed where schools are to be grouped under a single governing body or where those groupings are to be terminated <e> <s> however it introduces a new requirement for grouped schools which like every other school are to have an instrument of government to establish the constitution of the governing body and to contain other provisions for their proceedings term of office and related matters <e>", "<cs> i should have been disappointed had the noble lord lord kilmarnock not moved his amendment tonight particularly after he talked in such moving terms about his experience of pr in a boarding school run by ilea <e> <s> i am sure he must have been the person to influence the governing body to come to that decision <e> <s> the noble lord i see shakes his head <e> <s> however it shows how high is my opinion of his ability to put his case well that i should have thought that the boarding school governors would have decided to have their elections by pr <e> <s> i think the committee would have been disappointed had we missed this opportunity to discuss pr <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to what has been said on both these amendments <e> <s> we think the provisions proposed in these amendments concern matters which are best left to the leas and the governing bodies discretion <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh was making this point quite clearly when he quoted clause and which governs the general circumstances of the voting <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not accept what the noble lord lord jenkins of putney has said <e> <s> so far as the question of the moratorium proposed by mr gorbachev is concerned we believe that it was a declaratory gesture which is no substitute for effective and negotiated arms control measures <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made clear the british position on this matter on many occasions in this house <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the noble lord is quite right when he says that the key to this whole matter is the question of verification <e>", "<cs> my lords i indicated in reply to an earlier question that the moratorium that the soviet union declared is no substitute for effective and negotiated arms control measures <e>", "<cs> no my lords the position with regard to the united states government is that we have welcomed president reagans statement that if he were able to agree on verification he would be prepared to move forward on the ratification of both the threshold test ban treaty and the peaceful nuclear explosions treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot comment on that and it is in any event wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> i listened with great interest to what the noble lord lord mcintosh said in moving his amendment as i did to the noble lord lord ritchie <e> <s> i recognise that the point which the noble <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord renton as a lawyer has picked on a point and has asked the question who is going to have the last word <e> <s> we are now talking about the reality of what might well be a specific situation in a school a situation covered exactly by one of the amendments which follows and to which he has put his name <e> <s> if i have understood correctly the noble lord and his noble friends who have put these amendments down they seek to meet their objectives by writing into the face of the bill what shall or shall not happen something which could always be amended at a later stage by somebody else writing in something else <e> <s> it brings in the central government further and further into the curriculum with all the complications of definition that follow from all of that <e>", "<cs> i appreciate what my noble friend lord renton said about this and perhaps i may add a few further words of clarification about clause <e>", "<cs> i think that is the point of departure between what the noble lord lord mcintosh is saying and what is in the bill <e> <s> although there will be a degree of consistency i believe between schools this is borne out by all these long discussions on what might broadly be called a core curriculum and it will be accepted that certain things will inevitably be taught in all schools what we are actually talking about is what might be described as fringe subjects where there is likely to be conflict <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord would not expect me to comment on details of intelligence reports but what i can say to him is that the pentagon stated publicly that warnings were given to united states personnel in berlin and that security officers were on their way to the la belle discotheque but were five to minutes away when the bomb exploded <e> <s> i cannot possibly accept the last statement in his supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this would be most unlikely <e> <s> i suggest to my noble friend that he will find a lot of background material available as a result of the debate in another place this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords both the united nations general assembly and the security council have adopted declarations and resolutions condemning terrorism and calling for greater international co-operation to combat the problem <e> <s> these were positive steps but they did not deter the libyans from giving support to terrorists attacks nor has the security council been able to agree on a response to the libyan attack on us forces in the gulf of sirte <e>", "<cs> no one can have listened to the proposals behind this amendment by the noble baroness lady masham and the support that she has received from all parts of the committee without being conscious of the strength of feeling on this amendment throughout the committee <e> <s> i therefore approach what i have to say bearing in mind the strictures we have had from the noble lords lord harris of greenwich and lord annan on the preceding amendment with trepidation <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement on british interests in the lebanon and terrorism which is being made in another place by my honourable friend the minister of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs mr renton <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank the noble lord lord cledwyn for his expression of sympathy shared by all of us to the relatives of those who have died in beirut <e> <s> i also join with the noble lord lord kennet in his utter condemnation of terrorism wherever it may occur <e> <s> both noble lords have asked me a general question as to whether or not the statement with its tragic news is a consequence of the events earlier in the week and <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the british community in libya we have no reports of any british casualties <e> <s> mr dunnachie who is in the british interests section in the italian embassy in tripoli is in very close touch with british community leaders and <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right in saying that there are regular meetings <e> <s> as the noble lord said at the end of his remarks we shall be having a debate tomorrow <e> <s> i would prefer to leave any comment on this particular matter until tomorrow when i think that it would be more helpful to set it in the context of everything else that is happening <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the exact number of libyans in this country <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord will be aware following the assassination of wpc fletcher two years ago we did take a number of very tough measures against libyans <e> <s> we broke off diplomatic relations we closed the peoples bureau we imposed a strict visa regime that has had the effect of limiting the number of libyans entering this country very severely and we banned of course new defence contracts <e> <s> these measures are of course still in force and are looked at very carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> the noble lord lord mayhew is quite right <e> <s> all that we know is as the statement says that pinned to one of the bodies was a notice claiming that they had been executed by an organisation calling itself the arab fedayeen <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hatch has misunderstood what i said in answering an earlier question <e> <s> i shall re-read it in order that there shall be no mistake about it <e> <s> i said that the dutch foreign minister stated that no foreign minister that is at the european community foreign ministers meeting in paris had been aware of the imminence of the united states action against libya during the previous meeting of foreign ministers in the hague on monday <e> <s> the point that i was making which is a very important point is that there were no recriminations over this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that when the noble lord lord hatch comes to read <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not issued any official advice about travelling to other parts of the middle east <e> <s> we have only given advice quite specifically both about the lebanon and about libya <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that is the conclusion which can be drawn from what i have said <e> <s> i shall of course have a look again at what i have said and indeed at what the noble lord lord stewart has said <e> <s> the point i was making and it is a very serious point is that we ourselves as a country have suffered from terrorism <e> <s> so of course have the united states and very many other countries <e> <s> it is a war in that sense which is being perpetrated <e> <s> we did not believe and we do not believe tragic and terrible as it is that three people should have died that we could be held as it were to ransom by kidnappers and terrorists in fighting this war <e> <s> we must continue to do what we believe to be right <e> <s> after all there have been many instances i could give the noble lord a list of them of terrorist activities and of the thousands of people who have died as a consequence <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> nor did i suggest that there was any connection between them <e> <s> but the government felt it was right that the house should have all the information about all these various activities which happen to have taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> two citizens were kidnapped on th march this year and one mr keenan who is of dual british-irish nationality was kidnapped on th april <e> <s> my noble friend lord home is therefore quite right in saying that the kidnapping took place long before the events of last monday <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree with the noble lord lord chalfont in saying that we have been in the front line of this war for some time and indeed a list of terrorist activities by libyans going back to makes this quite clear <e> <s> it is a terrible war but i think in principle that it is quite right that we should take a stand in this country and a lead with other countries in europe in trying to get international co-operation to stamp it out <e>", "<cs> i am very conscious once again in getting up to speak in reply for the government to these amendments of the strength of feeling on this subject in all parts of the committee and the matter was very fully debated a year ago on a government bill <e> <s> there is one point which i should like to clear up at the very start of my remarks and i should like to say what in fact was the european courts ruling <e> <s> it is important to remember that it did not call for the abolition of corporal punishment <e> <s> the european court of human rights has not ruled that corporal <e>", "<cs> if i may finish my train of thought i shall then give the noble lord a chance to speak <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> i should not like to comment on the systems of discipline within the united states of america <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that education is a state matter and therefore the position will vary from state to state <e> <s> i think i would be unwise to comment unbriefed on this subject <e> <s> but as a general rule and certainly in some of the countries that i have visited corporal punishment has at least been available <e> <s> i could not say whether or not it is used but it is certainly available <e> <s> what we are talking about on this amendment is legislating to abolish it throughout the educational system in england and wales <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mcintosh in introducing his amendment asked what is the position of the government in respect of the european courts ruling on corporal punishment <e> <s> last year we introduced an education bill to allow parents to exempt their children from corporal punishment <e> <s> in so doing we were seeking to reconcile the twin objectives of securing compliance with the european courts ruling and at the same time of respecting the widespread feeling in favour of the availability of corporal punishment <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the point that the noble lord has raised <e> <s> i hope that i am able to give an answer but if i cannot give a full answer i hope he will understand if i write to him later because i should not want to give an incomplete reply <e>", "<cs> i say right away that i shall be happy to send a copy of my letter to the noble lord lord harris <e> <s> if i may say so i think it is a matter of regret that he did not speak in those terms on the preceding amendment <e>", "<cs> the purpose of this amendment is to require local education authorities to include in the articles of government for welsh medium schools and schools with welsh units a requirement that the governors report to parents shall be published in welsh as well as in english <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can make one further comment that may help the noble lord in his consideration of the matter <e> <s> parents in welsh schools can have their report in welsh <e> <s> if they want it in welsh they have only to ask for it at a parents meeting <e> <s> to say that they can have it is different to introducing by statute that it must be available <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment would be to require the annual parents meeting to be open to all registered pupils at the school <e> <s> i am not sure that this could be appropriate <e> <s> the annual meeting will be an important forum for parents and will provide an opportunity for them to voice their concerns in relation to the school <e> <s> we have already debated earlier in the committee stage the amendments proposed by the noble lord lord mcintosh on the inappropriateness of pupils being mandatorily involved in all the work of the governing body <e>", "<cs> i understand that the purpose of this amendment is to allow the local education authority or the head teacher flexibility in their response to resolutions passed by parents at their annual meeting <e> <s> it would allow the lea or the head teacher to report back orally to the governing body <e> <s> to meet its duty under clause <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord prys-davies has just said in dealing with amendment no <e> <s> i set out the governments policy in respect of the use of the welsh language that is that it is best protected and developed by consent rather than by compulsion <e> <s> this amendment which seeks to impose a statutory right to conduct business in the welsh language is going against that policy <e> <s> that said we have every sympathy with the aspirations of those who seek to protect the welsh language and we understand how closely it is linked to the welsh culture and heritage <e> <s> i think that our record of financial support for the language that is over million in this financial year speaks for itself <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the intention of this amendment and i do take the point that the noble lord has raised when he says it is an important point <e> <s> as i understand it it is to remove any possibility of a deadlock in the selection of a head teacher by giving a casting vote to one of the panel members nominated by the authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that that is governed by a number of the rules governing the publication of documents <e> <s> this understanding has applied since and it applies with equal force today and remains valid for the future <e> <s> it has been reaffirmed by successive prime ministers and presidents all judging it to be satisfactory <e> <s> most recently the arrangement was reviewed by my right honourable friend the prime minister and president reagan in february <e> <s> the understanding applies to bases for all united states forces in this country both conventional and nuclear <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not presume to comment on a report of a radio programme <e> <s> i can only give what i know to be the fact as stated by my right honourable friend the prime minister that on the <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord no doubt will be aware the government are not a party to the united states-soviet union nuclear and space talks at geneva but the united states rigorously consults its alliance partners about these talks <e> <s> as far as a comprehensive test ban is concerned he will be aware of the governments views on adequate verification being essential <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be well aware this is a highly technical matter but the united kingdom presented to the conference on disarmament in july a paper setting out some views about verification <e> <s> we hope that these were regarded as being constructive in a difficult area <e> <s> what we have not been able to accept are the reports of a norwegian seismic array experiment that appeared in a <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has asked me that question on a number of occasions in different forms and i have made it plain to him that we demand verification as a major concern at this time <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is an important question <e> <s> the early elimination of nuclear weapons would be possible only if they could be disinvented <e> <s> for a considerable time nuclear deterrence will continue to play a major role in the defence of the west and what we aim at is not just the elimination of nuclear weapons but progress towards overall disarmament <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i thank the noble lord for his question <e> <s> it is indeed an attempt by the united kingdom government to advance the complex and technical question of verification and it is a matter for regret that little progress has been made on it <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the norwegian experiment is concerned as i indicated in answer to an earlier question we hope that it will provide a solution to some of the outstanding technical problems but claims for efficiency of high frequency seismic stations we believe have been exaggerated <e> <s> we do not have much data on them nor on their reliable discriminate applicable to high frequency signals <e> <s> as to the noble lords other point i shall consider it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has asked a number of supplementary questions somewhat similar in nature <e> <s> if i may disentangle the two points of this argument the first answer is that which i gave him on the whole question of the disarmament talks at geneva <e> <s> they are between the united states and the soviet union and the united kingdom is not directly a party although we are consulted regularly by the united states government on the proposals that they are making <e> <s> the second concerns the question of a comprehensive test ban <e> <s> there i have indicated in my original answer the proposals that we have made <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> it is important that no one should be able to cheat <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt at all that the possession of nuclear weapons has been one of the guarantors of the peace that we have had ever since the ending of the second world war <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to assure the noble viscount lord buckmaster that we have made known to successive ugandan governments our concern about human rights <e> <s> i do not think that we can accept his statement on that <e> <s> we welcome president musevenis commitment to improve ugandas human rights record and the action that he has so far taken to punish those found responsible for violations <e> <s> i hope that the answer i have given to the noble viscounts original question will make clear the governments commitment and policy towards the new government in uganda <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the point that the noble lord lord cledwyn has raised <e> <s> all police training ceased in july but the overseas police adviser visited uganda last month to report on the need for further training and we are studying his recommendations <e> <s> with regard to military aid there are no ugandans receiving military training in the united kingdom at present but the future of the british military advisory training team is still under consideration <e> <s> we have had discussions with the new government about its future <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely take the pont that the noble lord raised <e> <s> we are in our future aid programme looking at a number of issues <e> <s> on the point about the civil service i think it right that i should write to the noble lord lord cledwyn and i shall copy the letter to the noble lord lord mcnair <e> <s> but we are certainly helping with the education system <e> <s> we have this year planned to spend million and the poor security in uganda obliged us to suspend much of our aid programme up to the time of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that uganda is a beautiful country although i have not visited it <e> <s> it has had a series of unhappy governments with a lot of suffering for its people <e> <s> we hope that things are now improved <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble viscount will understand if it is a private company it will be an arrangement between the company itself and the government of another country <e> <s> that is not to say that our government may not approve of its activities <e> <s> that may well be the case <e> <s> but the arrangements would be a matter for the two parties <e> <s> i do not know what specifically the noble viscount has in mind but that generally speaking would be our view <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad just for once to be able to agree with the noble lord <e> <s> it is still early to say what the policies of the new government will be but there is no doubt that president museveni has made an encouraging start and has included representatives of most of the major political and ethnic groups in his administration <e> <s> he has also stressed the need for unity and reconciliation <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we all understand the terrible sufferings of the people of uganda <e> <s> we must all hope that the current government are successful particularly in dealing with the question of human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords following the uprising of th january staff of her majestys embassy in the peoples republic of yemen were temporarily withdrawn in the international evacuation of th january <e> <s> by the end of last month we concluded that the situation in aden had returned to normal and reopened our embassy on th march under a charge daffaires <e> <s> her majestys ambassador mr marshall is expected to return later this month when some of the damage to our buildings will have been repaired <e> <s> our aid programme is being resumed in full <e> <s> a number of british commercial firms have also resumed their operations in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to hear of the positive views of the noble viscount about our relations with the peoples democratic republic of yemen <e> <s> on the particular point about our aid programme i am aware of the importance of the two key english language teachers at aden university <e> <s> the programme was suspended at the time of the uprising but the noble viscount will be glad to know that steps were taken to resume it once our embassy reopened at the end of march <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot without notice give the noble lord the answer to his question on british nationals <e> <s> but now that our ambassador is returning our aid programme is being established again and business is starting up we see no reason why british people should not visit the yemen <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i cannot without notice give precise details about exiles <e> <s> but what i can say is that the new government have made it clear that although they will maintain the alliance with the soviet union they will continue with the policy of the previous ali nasser government in fostering better relations with the west and at the same time fostering better relations with the neighbouring arab countries <e> <s> i hope that this may well be the kind of positive information that the noble lord is seeking on this point <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> we are interested in trade with the yemen and as i indicated in my original answer british commercial firms have resumed their operations in the country <e> <s> on the other point that the noble lord raised i can confirm that we have received no indication that the pdry authorities intend to take steps against the united kingdom in connection with events in libya <e>", "<cs> my lords we have accepted the conferences solemn appeal and resolutions <e> <s> we agree that continuing destruction of forests leading to the spread of deserts in the drier african countries is a most serious problem <e> <s> we also share the widespread concern about air pollution and damage to european forests <e> <s> my right honourable friend the minister for overseas development sent a message of encouragement for the launching of the tree appeal on th april and wished it every success <e>", "<cs> my lords a cash donation is not envisaged but my right honourable friend the minister for overseas development would be ready to consider proposals from the men of the trees organisation which is mounting the appeal for support of specific projects under the joint funding scheme sometimes known as a pound-for-pound scheme which is the odas source of support for development projects put forward by many ngos such as oxfam and christian aid <e> <s> we welcome the support of the fao for the tree campaign and the other fao activities which help to preserve and develop vitally important forest resources in developing countries <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i was answering specifically the question raised by my noble friend lord bessborough but i entirely take the point of the noble lord <e> <s> indeed we are providing substantial amounts of aid in different countries for forestry <e> <s> we are doing so in ghana and in the sudan and in india we put million into a social forestry project <e> <s> we also give high priority to the training of technical staff <e> <s> as well as direct bilateral aid the community is providing some million ecus under the european development fund and <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware britains contribution to that is per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords our claim to sovereignty is not in doubt but our first priority is to secure a fishing regime which is both workable and effective <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will appreciate that we are working actively with the fao to establish a multilateral regime and the first stage of that which is to undertake a technical study is now under way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for my noble friends last remark <e> <s> i hope i can assure him that although it seems that the number of dead penguins is greater than usual there is as yet no definite knowledge about the total numbers involved or indeed the cause of the deaths and there is no evidence to link the deaths of the birds with squid fishing in the falklands <e>", "<cs> my lords what is happening at the present time is that under the fao a technical survey is being conducted to establish the state of the fish stocks <e> <s> i am glad to confirm to the noble lord that the study is well under way technical experts from the fao have been visiting capitals of the fishing nations and argentina is participating in the study <e> <s> talks to implement any possible scheme will of course follow the publication of this study but we have not yet reached that stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm and gladly do so to my noble friend that co-operation with argentina on a multilateral fishing scheme would be the best basis for a successful regime <e> <s> i confirm that argentina is currently taking part in that <e> <s> i can also confirm that such a regime would be without prejudice to sovereignty on either side <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement on the foreign affairs council which is being made in another place by my right honourable and learned friend the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs sir geoffrey howe <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord cledwyn for his support for the measures which have been agreed in the european community <e> <s> the noble lord said that he welcomed them though he regretted that nothing had been said about economic sanctions a point which was also made by the noble lord lord gladwyn who also referred to an oil embargo <e> <s> i think that both noble lords will be aware of the governments view on sanctions against libya <e> <s> the possibility of a trade embargo has been considered on a number of occasions but the government have always concluded that it would not be an effective response <e> <s> as my right honourable friend the prime minister told another place on nd april sanctions will only work provided everybody operates them <e> <s> with regard to an oil embargo we believe that this would be most unlikely to be effective and no such sanction would have an impact comparable to a reduction in the price of oil <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the strength of feeling of the noble lord and on the part of his noble friends on the question of sanctions against libya <e> <s> i have explained again our view about sanctions <e> <s> we do not believe that they would be effective and they are certainly not effective unless everybody applies them <e> <s> we have after all had some experience in applying sanctions <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware we took steps against libya two years ago following upon the assassination of woman police contable yvonne fletcher <e> <s> we are glad that our community partners agreed the steps they did at the last meeting held on monday <e>", "<cs> my lords the topics discussed at the foreign affairs council were the ones on which i have reported in this particular statement <e> <s> i cannot of course say what topics might be discussed at the tokyo summit and i do not believe that the noble lord would expect me to do so on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already confirmed to the noble lord lord mayhew and i <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to confirm what the noble lord has said <e> <s> we do not believe that the use of terrorism is justified on behalf of a political cause <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point of the noble lord <e> <s> preparations for the new gatt round are under way in geneva <e> <s> i would share his view that what could develop is serious because if the united states takes unilateral action in the way that has been suggested as the statement makes clear we would not hesitate to retaliate to defend community interests <e> <s> this cannot be in the best interests of either the united states or the community <e> <s> that is why we hope that this problem can be resolved in the gatt negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lords lord cledwyn of penrhos and lord taylor of gryfe for their responses to this statement <e> <s> i think we would all join as the statement makes clear in deploring the failure of the soviet union to give us the necessary information not only of course in their own country but particularly in europe and in the world as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first question about advice to people in britain is that no special precautions are necessary since radiation levels <e>", "<cs> my lords as the statement makes quite clear there has obviously been a very serious nuclear accident <e> <s> i am sure the whole house would agree that what we need to have is the fullest possible information from the soviet union about what has happened <e> <s> our ambassador in moscow is under very detailed instructions to find out as fully as he can what has happened <e> <s> my right honourable friend the prime minister is seeing the russian ambassador this afternoon and will be not only offering assistance to him but seeking to gain the fullest information that we can get <e> <s> i think that is the most important matter at the present time <e> <s> we must all hope very much that such an appalling accident does not happen again but certainly getting the information on the present one would be a help <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think there is any question of doubting the facts when they come <e> <s> i think our concern has been that we have not had the facts <e> <s> as the statement makes clear the soviet authorities announced on th april that there had been an accident <e> <s> that was the day after radioactivity had first been monitored in scandinavia <e> <s> therefore there is a presupposition that the accident happened earlier than that and it is the time-lag that has been of concern <e> <s> what we now want to have are the fullest possible facts about the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that this is a very serious accident and i would not wish anything that i have said in any way to appear to understimate the seriousness of it <e> <s> the fact is that chernobyl is unlike any existing or planned reactors in the united kingdom and the united kingdom nuclear authorities rejected its design many years ago as intrinsically unsuitable <e> <s> as that is a matter for the soviet union we must i use the verb again hope that with its co-operation such an accident will not happen again <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i note the point that the noble lord has made i see the point of that <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord st john of bletso for asking this unstarred question this evening <e> <s> we all listened with great interest to his thoughtful and balanced speech <e>", "<cs> i am sure the whole committee will have considerable sympathy with the spirit of the amendment which has been proposed by my noble friend lady cox <e> <s> the safety of our schoolchildren is a matter of the greatest concern and it is right that we should take this opportunity to consider whether the present arrangements relating to it are sufficient or whether they could be improved by legislation along the lines proposed <e> <s> perhaps i may say right at the beginning that i am a very great admirer of the work that is done both by the red cross i know having heard lady hylton-foster speak of the important role that she plays as i think president of the red cross and by the st johns ambulance <e> <s> i am sure all of us are full of admiration for the voluntary work that they do on so very many occasions in our country and we fully appreciate the offer that they have made about training suitable people for this task <e>", "<cs> may i just conclude <e> <s> i see the point that the noble lord is making <e> <s> i do not wish to be flippant but when i was a girl guide i passed a course in first aid <e> <s> however i should hesitate to say that i was qualified to advise on injuries on a rugger field or to give medical advice except of the simplest kind <e> <s> i suspect although this is a personal judgment that many teachers qualified in first aid would hesitate considerably when dealing with somebody elses child to take the responsibility and would first call for an ambulance and take the injured child to hospital if they thought the injury was serious <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for elucidating that point <e> <s> specialist pe teachers would be supervising and they will almost invariably have had relevant first aid training <e> <s> science teachers in any case have a general duty to instruct their pupils in the safe handling of chemicals and equipment because science laboratories and indeed kitchens can be dangerous places and require stringent supervision <e> <s> furthermore the health and safety regulations require there to be certain facilities including first aid kits available to teachers and other employees <e> <s> it is inconceivable that those facilities would not also be available to pupils in the event of an accident <e>", "<cs> i am very disappointed by what my noble friends have said <e> <s> i have taken this amendment very seriously indeed and i have tried to set out what the statutory position is <e> <s> i recognise what my noble friend lady cox is asking for and i have tried to indicate that i believe it is fulfilled <e> <s> i think that my noble friend lord de la warr was ma king a debating point about people who are qualified and about how they will deal with children <e> <s> my noble friend lady cox shakes her head <e> <s> after all she is a qualified nurse she has the confidence to deal with accidents <e> <s> i have myself seen her deal with an accident and if i had one i could not be more confident of being properly looked after than if i were being looked after by my noble friend lady cox <e>", "<cs> there is no doubt that the present arrangements for allowances for governors are highly unsatisfactory <e> <s> under dubious <e>", "<cs> as we have already made clear we regard service as a governor as a valuable form of voluntary service <e> <s> in considering such service parents and other governors will clearly give careful consideration to their domestic circumstances in the light of the commitment necessary to enable them to discharge that important task effectively <e>", "<cs> the best that i can do is to write to the noble lord on that point and i undertake to do so <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i shall be able to be as reassuring in response to the noble lord lord mcintosh as he would like <e> <s> i wish however to set out for the benefit of the committee the reasons that have led the government to include the clause in the bill <e> <s> despite the interest shown by the noble lord lord mcintosh the secretary of states annual report to parliament is not being read as widely as it once was <e> <s> sales have declined steadily over recent years from about a year in the late s to about today <e> <s> on the other hand for those who want to read a great deal the total number of publications produced by the des has risen from about to about <e> <s> given the comparatively limited scope of the departments publications programme in earlier years it was probably wiser to produce the annual report <e> <s> indeed it was a necessary and useful source of information about the governments education policies <e> <s> but times change <e> <s> the annual report now <e>", "<cs> under sections to of the education act it is for local education authorities or where appropriate the governors of voluntary schools to make proposals for the establishment discontinuance or significant alteration of a school <e> <s> they do so by publishing notices of their intentions <e> <s> the notices are expected to be the outcome of a period of public consultation and recent high court decisions have confirmed that those affected have a legitimate right to be consulted on proposals for school reorganisations which is enforceable to the same extent as a statutory requirement to comult <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to what the noble lords lord kilmarnock and lord ritchie of dundee have said and particularly to the cases that they cited <e> <s> i think there are three such cases in fact including the one that was cited by the noble lord lord mcintosh on the preceding amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the particular document to which the noble lord refers and from which he has quoted <e> <s> i can only confirm that on signing the protocols in the united kingdom made a statement of understanding to the effect that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord should make these extraordinary allegations in this way <e> <s> the united kingdom statement is in full accord with the intentions of the international committee of the red cross which stated in their introduction to the draft protocol <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i thank the noble lord for that statement that he has made <e>", "<cs> my lords the additional protocols are designed to update the existing laws of armed conflict and to provide improved protection for <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not going to confirm that statement <e> <s> i have just made it myself in answer to the question that the noble lord has put down today <e> <s> i will note of course what he has had to say <e>", "<cs> i think my lords that the noble lord will find that it is in the library but if it is not i shall certainly see that a copy is put there <e>", "<cs> my lords that was very well put if i may say so by the noble lord lord chalfont <e>", "<cs> my lords what i said was that we made a statement of understanding <e> <s> as i understand it that is not the same as a reservation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made the governments position on this matter quite plain <e> <s> there is no misleading of your lordships house or of the public at large <e> <s> the situation is as i have described it and i hope now that the noble lord will be satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords i would of course have to look at the question to which the noble lord lord hatch refers to make sure that the two questions are precisely the same <e> <s> as he will be aware these figures can be presented in different ways but i should like to assure him that what i have told him is to the best of my knowledge correct <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks a good question <e> <s> one of the most important steps we take is to ensure that the aid we provide is effective <e> <s> the noble lord will of course be pleased to know as well that our overseas aid is planned to increase by million in million in and million in compared with the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to confirm to my noble friend that both those statements are correct <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already indicated to the noble lord lord mellish we take a great deal of trouble to make sure that the aid is used effectively <e> <s> this is important <e> <s> as the noble lord lord paget will i am sure recall in the numerous aid debates that we have had in your lordships house i have given and so have a number of your lordships many examples of the good use to which our aid money has been put <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not give the assurance that in any aid programme that is the case but some of the money goes to the purposes that the noble baroness has described <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we remain committed to the un target for aid but we have not yet set a date for achieving it <e> <s> progress towards the un target depends on developments in the economy and other claims on our resources <e> <s> it is worth remembering that in absolute terms in we had the sixth largest aid programme and within the european community the third largest <e>", "<cs> not without notice my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords again that is a not a question that i can answer without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are using very emotive terms to describe these matters <e> <s> the fact is that the use to which aid money is put is a real point and that is why a great deal of care is taken to make quite sure that its use is as described to parliament and that it is monitored <e> <s> there are some very good results <e> <s> as the noble lord lord bruce will know quite well the question of european finance is fully reported to parliament <e>", "<cs> yes my lords a great deal of aid goes into helping countries to develop their own agriculture <e> <s> as the noble lord may perhaps be aware through our programmes we made a major contribution to indias ability to feed itself through british aid and the great support of the indian government themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i answered the noble lords original question in what i said <e> <s> as he will know one of what i think are the more encouraging factors about the figures is the very high level of private donations that there has been <e> <s> those should be added to the figures i have given him for because the private flows are not yet available <e> <s> if one looks at the tragedies in the world today one sees that there has been remarkable private response <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord morris reminded your lordships some time ago we had a debate on the first namibia bill introduced by the noble lord lord hatch as recently as last october <e> <s> this evening six months later we have before your lordships a second bill <e> <s> it is in fact different <e> <s> it gives me an opportunity to set out once again the governments policy on namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to my noble friend is that we hope very much that the negotiations under the secretary-general will continue <e> <s> we shall do all that we can to support his efforts as we have done since his initiative began because we believe that he is best placed to see what we should all like to see a lasting peaceful and just settlement of this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for what the noble lord lord cledwyn said in his support for the secretary-generals efforts <e> <s> there are a number of <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we should all like to see a lasting settlement of the cyprus issue <e> <s> cyprus is within the commonwealth and of course we all hope that it will remain within the commonwealth <e> <s> how the details are worked out will be a matter for negotiating parties <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that there is a problem of refugees within cyprus and of course any lasting settlement of the cyprus problem would deal with that issue as well as the others <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be very unwise in a delicate situation for me to be drawn into what may be a final outcome of a very difficult problem <e> <s> there are a number of difficult issues <e> <s> my noble friend touched on one or two of them and the noble lord lord bottomley touched on others <e> <s> this is a matter for settlement by the parties to the dispute and one must hope they will be able to reach agreement upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both noble lords lord cledwyn and lord mackie of benshie for what they have said about this statement <e> <s> both have referred in considerable detail to the first part of it which concerns the chernobyl disaster <e> <s> if i can i shall try to deal with the questions that they have raised <e> <s> first of all the noble lord lord cledwyn asked me about a possible source of disagreement on the safety levels <e> <s> i can confirm to him that the original figures on safety levels proposed by the commission posed some technical difficulties for some member states but the experts are now meeting on that matter <e> <s> as far as the question of safety levels and intra-community trade is concerned experts are meeting this afternoon in brussels to agree on safety levels on the basis of scientific data for intra-community trade <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i did not see the television programme to which the noble lord has referred but i can tell him that what the community have decided to do is to ban the import of fresh fruit and vegetables live domestic animals fresh meat milk and milk products and freshwater fish from the ussr romania poland czechoslovakia hungary bulgaria and yugoslavia from th may until st may <e> <s> this is a precautionary measure and it is to be reviewed on th may in the light of the latest scientific evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it would not be true to say that no tests have been made because tests have been made in europe as they have been made in this country concerning levels of contamination <e> <s> what i think one does not want to do in what is really a very difficult and new area for <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the matters which are covered are the list of items which i have just read out to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to the noble lord lord chitnis for tabling this unstarred question and it is a matter of regret that it should come on at so late an hour <e> <s> the noble lord is right to draw attention to the problems which have been caused by the enormous exodus of refugees from vietnam in recent years <e> <s> i do not think we need to be ashamed of the part we have played in the efforts to solve this problem most of the burden has of course fallen on the authorities and people of hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for those supplementary questions <e> <s> i have given the percentage increases for the years about which she has asked and i think that it represents a very good record <e> <s> we all appreciate how much work the voluntary agencies do in this field and that often particularly so far as disaster relief is concerned they are the quickest to get to the area and they make a most cost-effective use of the resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not a breakdown of the figures in precisely the form for which the noble lord asked in his first supplementary question but i agree with him that much of the money which goes to the overseas development projects is raised by the charities themselves in their own fund-raising activities which again we greatly welcome <e> <s> the government have contributed on top of what the charities themselves have provided <e> <s> to this end we are very glad that my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer announced proposals in the budget which are designed to give charities further tax advantages <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that some of the charities have asked questions about the budget proposals <e> <s> this is a matter for my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer and i understand that his officials are discussing it with the charities <e> <s> on the noble lords second point i think it is very much to the advantage of the education system that those young volunteers who have done two years service overseas are able to return to teach in this country with that valuable experience <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord taylor will appreciate that that specific question about teacher assessment is wide of the original question and again if he cares to put it down on the order paper i shall be happy to answer it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the latest figure available is <e> <s> that is for the end of march <e>", "<cs> my lords the grants to voluntary agencies for long-term development projects often through joint funding schemes and the british volunteer programme were in million and in million <e> <s> that represents an increase in real terms of per cent <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware that the proportion of money that goes to voluntary organisations is a relatively small proportion of the whole aid budget <e> <s> but the point i am making is that we believe it to be very valuable that we are able to contribute to the voluntary organisations because they provide a cost-effective and quick way of dealing in particular with disasters <e> <s> on the noble lords other point as i said to the noble lord lord oram if he cares to put down a question about development teaching i shall be happy to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords the question on the order paper is about the money being given to voluntary agencies and if the noble lord puts down the question to which he refers again i shall be happy to answer it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we all think that the work done by band aid and the fund raising efforts that have followed have been very commendable indeed and have made a major contribution to helping charities in the field <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have figures with which to answer that particular question <e> <s> some of the aid goes to long-term development projects and it is much to be hoped that it will make a major <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated earlier to the noble lord lord hatch the question on the order paper concerns money going to charitable agencies <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord cledwyn for the way in which he has received this very serious statement and to thank the noble lord lord kennet for what he said on the british governments reaction to this matter <e> <s> the noble lord lord cledwyn raised two questions in particular <e> <s> as regards the group of eminent persons they are of course a group of eminent individuals operating independently so it will be for them to decide how these raids affect their mission <e> <s> however as i have made clear the fact of the raids underlines the importance and urgency of working for a peaceful settlement in south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords this point has not been considered but i note what the noble lord lord bottomley says <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i am quite sure that the point which the noble baroness lady jeger makes about the sufferings of people as a consequence of these raids is very true and as she said as a member of a cpa delegation in gabarone she will have witnessed it herself <e> <s> it is for those reasons as well as the political reasons that the statement is couched in the very firm language that it is <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am glad to confirm that and to make yet again the point that there is no comparison in these two cases <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept that this is a weak statement <e> <s> as the noble lord will see when he has the opportunity to read it in full in the record the statement in fact says <e>", "<cs> yes my lords my noble friend is quite right we have not yet received the detailed information from any of our high commissioners in the three countries involved <e> <s> nor indeed have we heard from our ambassador in pretoria <e> <s> no doubt when we have the full information we shall be in a better position to assess what actually has happened <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first question that the noble lord lord paget asked the group of eminent persons has we believe had opportunities to talk to a great many people in south africa including members of the south african government as we believe this to be a valuable exercise <e> <s> so far as his second point is concerned may i make it clear that we oppose violence in south africa wherever it may come from but we cannot condone the attacks by south africa on three sovereign states <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point that my noble friend makes about the past history of south africa <e> <s> we are however in the situation in which these acts of aggression have in fact been committed by the south african government and i would only say to him out of consistency that we have completely condemned the russian invasion of afghanistan as of course we deplore the israeli raid on tunis and our attitudes have been consistent in this regard <e>", "<cs> my lords the idea of a group of eminent persons was one of the results of the commonwealth heads of government meeting but of course the fact that it was set up the fact that those in it act as individuals operating independently means that it is for them to decide what attitude they will take in the light of the raids today <e> <s> the answer to the noble lords second point is that we have not been approached for military assistance but as i am sure the noble lord will be aware botswana is one of several african countries which benefit from british training schemes for their armed forces <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make it clear that the united states government do not <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking about the united states government <e> <s> no doubt individuals within that country have differing views as they do in any democratic society <e> <s> on the second point of the noble lord as i made clear libya was a case of its own and we do not accept that article can properly be invoked in the case of the south african actions <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord soames for that helpful intervention <e> <s> he speaks with great knowledge and recent knowledge of events in zimbabwe <e> <s> i shall certainly see that the point that he has made is conveyed to my right honourable and learned friend <e> <s> i was of course aware that the zimbabwean government had denied the use of their territory by terrorists <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey introduced a similar amendment to this at the committee stage he indicated that the opposition would refer to these amendments again <e> <s> at the committee stage the noble lord agreed that it would be inappropriate for the secretary of state to issue detailed guidelines and indeed the noble lord lord irving of dartford has confirmed that this afternoon <e> <s> but he suggested that the guidance might set out a number of options one of which an lea or governing body would adopt <e> <s> we do not believe that such guidance would really be doing any more in many instances than stating the obvious and it remains the governments view that guidance in this area would either be so detailed or indeed so superficial that it would not fit the bill in either instance <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to respond to the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> i am aware that there have been these complaints both by the advisory centre for education and by the association of school governors and managers <e> <s> i think this was of course because the whole idea of elections was a new one under the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord kilmarnock for his kind remarks on my response to his earlier amendment on this subject <e> <s> but in fact i think in a sense he has answered the point of the second amendment which he has put down <e> <s> i appreciate that the point of his amendment is to draw attention to the possibility of the elections to a governing body being by proportional representation without compelling those who are voting to have a system of proportional representation <e> <s> nevertheless for the reasons that i adduced before it is perfectly possible under the bill to conduct the elections by proportional representation or by the first past the post system whichever the parents decide they would prefer to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it would be very difficult for me at this stage to commit the government to something like that in the circular <e> <s> we have all listened to the point that the noble lord has made and we are all aware of it <e> <s> i should have thought that if he wished as he clearly does to make sure that local education authorities are aware of this he would have plenty of colleagues in the local education authority world who would be able to do just that <e> <s> i should have thought that that would be the way <e> <s> however i shall note what he had to say and pass on to my right honourable friend the point that he has made <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i too reread what had been said at committee stage on these amendments which were moved on that occasion <e> <s> the reason that this provision has not been written on to the face of the bill is that the government wish as far as possible to avoid central prescription and the provisions in subsection in this case are what we think are appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house in view of what the noble lords lord mcintosh lord kilmarnock and lord harris have said i will take this back and look at it again <e> <s> i think there is a very real point about postal ballots for teachers who are in a rather different position from that of parents <e> <s> it is an area that needs looking at but i sense the feeling of the whole house about this and i will look at the matter again between now and third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mcintosh quite properly said in introducing this amendment it is one which goes very much to the centre of the proposals in this bill which is before your lordships house <e> <s> i am very glad that it presents the government with an opportunity to try to clarify what are the proposals as regards the curriculum in this bill and to relate them to some of the amendments which follow this one and which have as their purpose making and writing on to the face of the bill certain proposals on certain subjects in the school curriculum <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we all listened to the noble baroness lady masham when she moved a somewhat similar amendment at the committee stage <e> <s> we have listened with great care once again when she has moved a rather shorter version of it on report <e>", "<cs> my lords the government agreed at committee stage to consider this matter further <e>", "<cs> my lords here again we appreciate the view that has been expressed by the noble lord lord ritchie and i hope that we may be able to be helpful to him <e> <s> wherever the final decision on exclusions lies there is bound to be occasional scope for conflict among head teachers governing bodies and the leas about the reinstatement of excluded pupils <e> <s> leaving the last word with governors as some would like would not in our view provide an effective alternative and indeed we must bear in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the point that the noble baroness makes about an industrial tribunal and about the way that industrial matters would be dealt with <e> <s> in the education world it would be seen as a more unusual procedure <e> <s> we are concerned to try to find a way to resolve a point that she and her noble friend have identified namely the right of head teachers to appeal in such circumstances <e> <s> the noble lord asked an important question about poundswick <e> <s> in this that case is not answered <e> <s> that is one of the matters that we are considering further <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mcintosh said this amendment is substantially the same as the one put forward by the noble lord at the committee stage <e> <s> i appreciate the point that he is making <e> <s> i can understand the desire to prevent a stalemate in the appointment of a head teacher <e> <s> but as the noble lord himself said at the committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i can fully understand the reason why the noble lord lord irving of dartford has moved this amendment <e> <s> but i am sure that he will appreciate that clause of this bill is designed to promote the professional development of teachers and so improve the quality of teaching in our schools as set out in the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that the consultations will only cover education welfare officers <e> <s> although we recognise the point that the noble lord has made as to the other groups of people my understanding is that they are not covered and that it is only the education welfare officers <e>", "<cs> my lords i too went back to re-read the report of the debate that we had in committee on the similar amendment that my noble friend lady cox moved on that occasion <e> <s> this evening she has raised three points which she felt were unsatisfactory in the answer that i gave <e> <s> i too have considered the legislative position and i hope that i shall be able to reassure her on the three points that she has made <e>", "<cs> my lords the venice declaration to which my noble friend has referred set out fundamental and balanced principles for a just settlement <e> <s> we believe that these principles are still valid and that there would be nothing to be gained from a new statement at this time <e> <s> of course in co-operation with our european partners we are reviewing the prospects for new steps forward and we are in close touch with the parties <e>", "<cs> no my lords in my answer to my noble friend i was referring to the point as to whether or not there should be another as it were venice declaration <e> <s> however we believe that those principles still hold good and that they are the basis on which a settlement would be formed <e>", "<cs> my lords there is much in what the noble lord says <e> <s> he will note what i have said about the attitude of the united states in these negotiations <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we stand by the venice declaration <e> <s> but it depends on the attitudes of the parties concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the second point made by the noble lord is completely wide of the mark <e> <s> however as he will be aware my right honourable friend the prime minister is to visit israel <e>", "<cs> my lords we keep in close contact with the united states <e> <s> we have made our views quite clear and my right honourable friend the prime minister discussed the middle east with president reagan in tokyo <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first supplementary question that the noble lord has asked he is not in fact correct <e> <s> the correct answer was given earlier by my noble friend lord trefgarne to the question that the noble lord put down on the order paper <e> <s> i gave a correct answer to the question that he asked on nd may <e> <s> the function of a reservation is to modify for the reserving state the provisions of a treaty or protocol <e> <s> in this case the united kingdom would not need to enter any reservation on nuclear weapons since the protocol does not contain any provisions relating to them <e>", "<cs> my lords the point that the noble lord lord mellish has raised is somewhat wide of the subject of this question <e> <s> it is a very important matter <e> <s> as he will be aware the function of these protocols is of course rather separate from arms control negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already indicated to the noble lord that they will be placed in the library of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble lords first supplementary question about the american governments attitude <e> <s> in answer to his second supplementary question it is the british governments view that nuclear weapons have made a contribution to peacekeeping since the end of the second world war <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated in an earlier answer a reservation modifies for the reserving state the provisions of the treaty or protocol <e> <s> in this case a reservation was not necessary because the <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord molloy will be well aware the government are doing all that they can to help with the arms control negotiations to bring about some resolution of these difficult problems <e>", "<cs> my lords noraids fundraising activities are the subject of frequent discussions between her majestys government and the united states administration <e> <s> we are grateful to president reagan for his determined opposition to those in the united states who give support of any kind to organisations involved directly or indirectly in terrorism in northern ireland <e> <s> eight noraid members and office holders have been convicted in the united states of gun running to the ira since <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all aware of the terrorist activities of the ira both in northern ireland and in the united kingdom as a whole <e> <s> as for outlawing noraid this is a matter for the united states but there can be no doubt at all of the united states administrations determination to arrest and prosecute the gun runners <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to what the noble lord lord shepherd has said in raising this motion that we should not give the bill a third reading this afternoon <e> <s> as a former leader of the house he will appreciate more than most that that is a very serious step for the government to undertake about something on which we have agreed with the usual channels <e> <s> the bill has gone through all the procedures since early march and those who have taken part in the detailed debates that have taken place are aware of the timetable <e>", "<cs> my lords recommit the clause <e> <s> i understand the point about recommitting the clause but i do not feel nevertheless that we could recommit this clause <e> <s> the clause has been brought forward to meet an obligation <e> <s> the time has been short although it was said on th may at report stage that we would bring forward an amendment at third reading <e> <s> i recognise that time has been short and we have not had the opportunity for the consultations which we should like to have had <e> <s> i shall give an undertaking to your lordships about this which i would have given and shall repeat when i come to the amendment <e> <s> the government will look further at this amendment in the light of what has been said and in the light of consultations which my right honourable friend the secretary of state is to have with those in the universities the polytechnics and other higher educational authorities about this <e> <s> i shall expand this remark later because i do not want to get into the substance of it now <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already said to the house what it was the governments intention to do <e> <s> i have no reason for thinking that there will be any change in that because the clause which followed an undertaking given on report and which was tabled for your lordships this afternoon is now to be withdrawn <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened very carefully to what the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee has said in moving this amendment which is a new amendment which we have not seen at earlier stages of this bill <e> <s> the effect of it would be as the noble lord has explained to make representation of the appropriate voluntary organisation on the governing body of a maintained special school discretionary depending on whether the local education authority and the governing body consider such representation to be appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcintosh is quite right in saying that i undertook at report stage to look again at the question of postal ballots and indeed i have subsequently written to noble lords opposite who spoke on the matter <e> <s> it is i think common ground between us that nothing in the clause as presently drafted excludes a postal ballot <e> <s> it is also fairly clear that the provisions of subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords the point that lies behind this amendment has been looked at as the noble lord lord mcintosh quite properly said in considerable detail at earlier stages of the bill <e> <s> indeed i went over this ground at report stage very carefully to set out the governments thinking behind the curriculum provisions of the bill provisions which are central to the bills purpose of giving parents and governors a genuine voice in the running of their schools <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be for the convenience of the house if i explain at the outset the governments position on this amendment <e> <s> noble lords will remember that the noble lord lord ritchie tabled on report an amendment which is virtually identical to the amendment that he proposes today <e> <s> on that occasion the noble lord lord henderson of brompton suggested that the amendment of the noble lord lord ritchie was inconsistent with amendments to the bill which had already been made in the same subject area namely the treatment of political issues in schools <e> <s> the noble lord lord henderson took the view that to move the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee would be contrary to standing order no <e> <s> which provides <e>", "<cs> my lords the government recognise the valuable contribution made to the education service by educational psychologists and the importance of adequate training for them <e> <s> the governments policies for the education of children with special education needs in particular depend as the noble lord lord kilmarnock has said upon this key group of staff <e> <s> it is for this reason that educational psychologists are included within the scope of the present pooling regulations and that we are now seeking powers to enable the secretary of state to include them within the new grant scheme <e> <s> the government therefore fully share the concerns which underlie the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage of the third reading debate i do not wish to repeat all the arguments that i have used on the two previous occasions on which we have debated this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady hooper explained when your lordships considered this matter at report stage that recent high court decisions have established that parents have a legitimate expectation that they will be consulted on proposals under sections to of the act and this is enforceable to the same extent as a statutory requirement to consult <e> <s> where consultation has been inadequate the secretary of state will not approve the proposals <e> <s> it would therefore we believe be entirely otiose to make a requirement in statute that local education authorities should provide reasons for their proposals they are already under such an obligation <e> <s> so far as the disclosure of information is concerned that obligation to disclose extends to any report considered by a council or its education committee and even to background papers on which the report or an important part of it was based and which have to be relied on to any material extent by those who prepared the report <e> <s> i regard this as a far-reaching provision which i hope will meet the noble lords concern <e> <s> i take his point about parental interest in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that i can give the noble lord an assurance that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education will read very carefully the debates which have taken place in your lordships house including the debates on this particular amendment <e> <s> i shall draw them to his attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to respond to the very generous remarks that have been made by the noble lord lord mcintosh and the noble lord lord ritchie about the procedures of this bill <e> <s> coming back as i have to the debate on education it has been very valuable to discuss these matters with people who are so knowledgeable about education and i hope that <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it is a matter of sorrow that there should have been civilian casualties <e> <s> but the point of the noble lords question is answered by saying that the targets met the criteria stipulated <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> what is important in this matter is a recognition by this country of the importance of our alliance with the united states <e> <s> i made clear in my answer to the question the points that my right honourable friend the prime minister made in consultation with the american president <e>", "<cs> my lords there were no civilian targets so a question of warning to civilians did not arise <e> <s> as i indicated we laid down the criteria for the use of united kingdom-based aircraft and within these criteria the operational decisions were for the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of noraid is quite outside the terms of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall read <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the points made by the noble lord lord mellish would be shared by very many members of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not accept what the noble lord has said <e> <s> the united states action <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already made clear we regard it as important that the salt ii agreement should continue to be observed by both sides <e> <s> the door is therefore left open for a positive soviet response <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that this is a very complex matter <e> <s> we trust that we shall get a positive soviet response <e> <s> we believe that <e>", "<cs> my lords on the general issue we recognise of course the importance of arms control discussions and negotiations <e> <s> indeed we hope that this will be possible <e> <s> we want to see rapid progress made at the next round at geneva <e> <s> as to the particular point that the noble lord raised we trust that a positive soviet response will make it possible for the united states to avoid exceeding the salt ii limits at the end of this year <e> <s> this would leave the way open we believe for real progress to be made in arms control as envisaged by both leaders in geneva last year <e> <s> we would much regret it if the provisional decision of president reagan to exceed the limits had to be implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords i am saying two things <e> <s> we are not a party to the salt ii treaty but we have made our view on the matter clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i have just been asked whether we have been discussing this matter with the united states government <e> <s> clearly this is a matter that has been discussed <e> <s> we are aware of their view of the breaches by the soviet union <e> <s> what is important is that we hope that both the united states and the soviet union will comply with the treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i have made the position of our government clear on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume the noble lord has in mind the funds special programme for countries in sub-saharan africa <e> <s> we are contributing our agreed share to the recent general replenishment of the ifad but beyond that we believe it is better to help agricultural projects in africa bilaterally and through the voluntary agencies than to put the money into this separate extra appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the point that the noble lord is making about this fund <e> <s> we would indeed have put more into the general replenishment if we had thereby been able to use it to act as a lever to obtain extra contributions from the opec donors <e> <s> as it is we think that it is better to use the extra money for specific bilateral projects in africa <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> we very much agree with the point that the noble lord is making about the importance of agricultural projects in africa and to that end we have given very considerable amounts of aid <e> <s> the proportion of our bilateral aid in africa has increased <e> <s> in it came to million <e> <s> we have recently announced the approval of some important additional projects in the sudan zimbabwe and kenya <e> <s> the total british bilateral and multilateral aid to africa was about million in having risen from million in <e>", "<cs> my lords the point that the noble lord makes is an extremely important one which has been raised in your lordships house before and by many other people <e> <s> we make every effort to ensure that our aid is spent as effectively as possible <e> <s> i think that there have been some very good examples of the use to which it has been put <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated earlier we were ready to contribute to a larger replenishment supported by all donors <e> <s> however this was not possible notably because opec donors did not pledge more <e> <s> but what we are not spending multilaterally as this added contribution would have been we shall be spending bilaterally <e> <s> one important point about that is that british bilateral aid to africa is usually on grant terms while the ifad aid is usually through repayable loans <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i am saying that this money will come from the agreed amount of money for bilateral aid but it will be a part of that money <e> <s> it will be spent on these particular matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree that the ifad is a very valuable organisation which has done some good work <e> <s> it is not a criticism of that organisation <e> <s> but one of its merits is its pattern of agreed co-operation and negotiated burden sharing between and among the countries of the oecd and opec <e> <s> this is absent on this particular replenishment and therefore each donor has to decide what it should do <e> <s> we have decided that the money that we would have given is better spent bilaterally on particular projects for the reasons that i have given <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise from what the noble lords lord cledwyn and harris of greenwich have said as the government do that this is a serious and important statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord cledwyn raised a number of specific points <e> <s> the first concerned the penalties that have been imposed <e> <s> the principal establishment officer at gchq has decided to apply the provision in the civil service code of loss of increments <e> <s> i understand that the exact sum <e>", "<cs> my lords on the point that the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones makes about the european court i hope i have set out in my answer to his noble friend lord cledwyn the position with regard to that <e> <s> on his second point the position is that the action has been taken under the civil service code of disciplinary procedures <e> <s> there are a number of penalties which can be taken of which the noble and learned lord will no doubt be aware <e> <s> they have been taken in this case because those few members of gchq who resigned from the trade union and agreed this and accepted the which was given to those who did so have subsequently rejoined <e> <s> as my right honourable and learned friend made clear <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend will be aware world agriculture has been facing a crisis of over-production but there has been substantial <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the first remark of the noble lord lord cledwyn because the policies that we shall be actively pursuing during the next six months have been british initiatives over some period of time <e> <s> on the specific point that the noble lord raises about south africa the european community heads of government will consider policies towards south africa including the possibility of further measures when they meet later this week that is on th and th june <e> <s> on the noble lords second supplementary question about employment the joint anglo-irish-italian paper on unemployment growth into the s has been presented to the social affairs council and discussed within the commission <e> <s> it emphasises the promoting of enterprise and employment flexible employment patterns training and helping the long-term unemployed <e> <s> the paper was deposited in both houses on rd june <e> <s> it will be discussed at the european council and we hope that it will form the basis of a community labour market strategy which can be adopted during our presidency <e> <s> this is an issue to which we attach great importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the interest that the noble baroness has in this subject <e> <s> it is one of the issues which is of concern to us in regard to the whole question of the completion of the full common market <e> <s> transport is included in that <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will have the opportunity to debate the whole question of south africa on th july <e> <s> perhaps i may suggest to my noble friend who raises a very important matter that this is something which we might leave to that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kennet knows of the importance which the government attach to the development of a common view on foreign policy matters in the community <e> <s> the particular list was grouped with a number of economic points and the political points came at the end but that does not in any sense downgrade them <e> <s> they are important and all the points i have raised are important <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will be aware of the governments view on the ems a matter which was recently the subject of debate in your lordships house <e> <s> i could not go beyond what was said on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have achieved a number of successes in the community not least our success in our rebates from the community budget and indeed the success to which i referred in answer to the supplementary question of my noble friend lord rodney on the cap <e> <s> we attach great importance to these various economic measures which we believe will be of great benefit to all the people in this country and they are well worth working for <e>", "<cs> no my lords that is not the position <e> <s> i have made clear on this occasion and on many others in your lordships house that the crucial question is one of verification <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mellish for raising that point because last july the united states proposed an exchange of test site observers and invited soviet observers to visit a united states test site <e> <s> this goes to the heart of the issue which is verification and it is a matter of much regret that the soviet response so far has been dismissive <e>", "<cs> my lords i recall the question that the noble lord asked a little while ago <e> <s> the other matters which would have to be dealt with are scope duration and compliance but the key issue is verification <e>", "<cs> my lords we should like to see a comprehensive test ban treaty <e> <s> with regard to the question of verification and recent scientific advances to which the noble lord referred and indeed the claims that verification is not a problem particularly in the light of advances in seismology the government do not agree and we do not believe that the recent arguments advanced invalidate the conclusions of a united kingdom paper presented to the conference on disarmament in july <e> <s> for example these arguments concentrate largely on detection ignoring problems of discriminating between explosion and earthquake <e>", "<cs> my lords they have not indicated their reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords what i said to the noble lord on the question that he asked me about other issues that have to be raised besides verification on a test ban treaty related to difficult questions such as the scope of the treaty its duration and its compliance <e> <s> but the key issue is verification <e>", "<cs> my lords among the most recent developments is an agreement only in principle though it is not yet confirmed of the soviet acceptance of united states monitors <e> <s> but the russians apparently are prepared to accept non-official american scientists to start stations in the soviet union but are not prepared to talk to the united states government scientists about verification <e> <s> the soviet proposal suggests that non-official us scientists should be admitted to the soviet union <e> <s> the americans are prepared to agree that soviet government scientists should be admitted to the united states <e> <s> clearly this is a difference of view but we hope that there might be a resolution of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do agree with the commons in their amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the government regard such an appointment as the one in question as a matter for the commission alone <e> <s> we have not offered support for any individual candidate and will not do so <e> <s> we have no reason for thinking that all proper procedures have not been gone through in the commission in the appointment of a candidate for this post <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot comment on what may have happened in other appointments by the commission but on this particular appointment as i indicated in my original answer to the noble lord lord mayhew it is a matter for the commission and it is a matter for the commission why it chooses to move its staff <e> <s> i would add one further point for the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls and your lordships that it is for the commission to decide what this particular individual does next <e> <s> but i can assure your lordships that we shall be concerned that he like <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the point of the noble lord lord mellish <e> <s> i have no doubt that the commission offices will note it too <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the position was first advertised internally in the commission in accordance with normal commission rules <e> <s> it was advertised in several national newspapers the <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i think that i should like to confirm what i said at the beginning that in the case of mr scott the decision to move him is a decision for the commission <e> <s> i am aware of the report that appeared in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give that part of the answer satisfactorily because it could be construed as something which we properly should look at <e> <s> but i want to make it absolutely clear that the appointment of people to commission posts is the responsibility of the commission it is not a responsibility of the british government <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord leatherland is thinking of applying for the job i am sure that although it may be rather late in the day now his application will be noted by the commission <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree with both the points of the noble lord lord henderson of brompton <e> <s> with regard to food aid one of the major objectives of our presidency will be to improve the effectiveness of the community food aid programme <e> <s> on the noble lords wider point about help in preventing disablement we support through our multilateral health assistance the world health organisations special programme for research and training into tropical diseases the expanded programme on immunisation and the action programme on essential drugs and

"<cs> my lords i am aware of the interest of the noble baroness in this matter and i much regret that she was unable to have her debate on this important issue a short while ago <e> <s> i shall certainly draw to the attention of my right honourable friend the point she makes <e>", "<cs> my lords in preparation for this question i of course looked again at the debate of the noble lord lord henderson in your lordships house last month <e> <s> i accept the important point that the noble lord lord oram has repeated concernng what my right honourable friend mr raison said about this matter <e> <s> we believe that the best contribution the community can make is through its food and financial aid programmes to improve the conditions which lead to disablement <e> <s> my understanding is that for the community direct help for the disabled overseas is best carried out through the bilateral aid support of each country and that of course is how principally we shall be doing it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> we help through personnel and i should add that through joint funding with voluntary organisations we have helped a number of specific schemes for the disabled <e>", "<cs> my lords their detention is regularly reviewed by the tribunal as laid down in the zimbabwean constitution <e> <s> since june three separate review tribunals have been convened but none has recommended the release of the men <e> <s> on th march this year the men claimed in the high court that the proceedings of the tribunal were unfair <e> <s> in march of this year

noble lords question i shall have to write to him because i have no information to hand <e> <s> as to the first mr hartlebury is a british subject as i have indicated and to the best of my knowledge and belief his immediate family were until recently resident in harare <e> <s> because he is british he is visited regularly by consular staff <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much regret it if anything that i said might have been construed in the terms that my noble friend has suggested <e> <s> the men have been regularly visited by our consular officials <e> <s> if they were not british citizens then of course our <e>", "<cs> my lords their cases unquestion-ably have been taken up and they have lodged an appeal to the supreme court <e> <s> as to their expenses i am not in a position to comment but their case is being heard <e> <s> perhaps i may say to your lordships that in these cases which have been taken up by both my right honourable and learned friend and by my honourable friend mrs chalker in another place it is sometimes in the best interests of the people involved if matters are not necessarily talked about across the floor of the house <e> <s> we all of us wish to do what we can in the best interests of the men concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the point made by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and by my noble friend lord broxbourne <e> <s> the information that i have is that the cases have been reviewed and that there is to be an appeal to the supreme court <e> <s> obviously the men cannot do that unless they have been able to support that appeal <e> <s> i assure the house that our consular officials and the high commission will do what they can under the circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords the two men were originally charged with contravening the zimbabwean official secrets act and the emergency powers maintenance of law and order regulations <e> <s> on th january they were acquitted because the court ruled that certain prosecution evidence was inadmis-able <e> <s> they were re-arrested under the countrys emergency power regulations which were created many years before the present government in zimbabwe under regulations passed by the former rhodesian rgime <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i much regret that my noble friend should feel that the men are not being helped <e> <s> we have used what influence we have <e> <s> my right honourable and learned friend visited harare and there have been other ministerial visits <e> <s> we have used our influence through our high commission and by regular visits <e>

<e>", "<cs> my lords i shall of course do as the noble lord asks <e> <s> as i am writing to him on the other matter i shall also advise him on this matter <e> <s> i can say that under the constitution in zimbabwe there is provision for such detentions to be regularly reviewed by a tribunal <e> <s> although it would be true to say that there has been some administrative delay the procedure has in the main been followed <e>", "<cs> my lords i have taken the point made by the noble lord <e> <s> we are speaking about an independent country zimbabwe <e> <s> we can only make the representations that we do <e> <s> we have to consider all the factors involved <e> <s> we have made our representa-tions as i have already said in answer to an earlier question and we are not in a position because it is not the united kingdom to do more than make these representations in the course of justice in another independent country <e>", "<cs> my lords to the best of my knowledge and belief they have been properly represented and the procedures are taking place <e> <s> however we have to recognise that we are as i have said speaking about an independent country and one must recognise the limits of what we as another independent country can actually do in the circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords there is of course something in what my noble friend says <e> <s> the regulations which were introduced by the former rhodesian regime were produced at a time when the situation was not as it is today in zimbabwe <e> <s> however whether or not these regulations are repealed is a matter for that government <e>", "<cs> my lords the appeal to the supreme court is to be held on th july <e> <s> it was originally fixed for th june but was delayed as the defence counsel was not available <e> <s> in those circumstances it is right to recognise that this whole long procedure it is the end of a long procedure is still <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by thanking the noble lord lord oram for his support for the principle of this short tactical bill <e> <s> i think the noble lord accepts the point the government have made that this will be for the benefit of the crown agents <e> <s> i was also glad to hear the tribute he paid to the work of the crown agents <e> <s> i too looked at their last report and what they have done in so many countries of the world is very impressive <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have no wish to see any change to the nato area as defined in the north atlantic treaty of and its protocol of <e> <s> no nato country has commented on mr weinbergers speech <e> <s> of course individual nato countries have out-of-area interests <e>", "<cs> my lords the speech to which this question refers was made at a symposium at annapolis in maryland <e> <s> we of course regularly discuss aspects of foreign and defence policy with the american government <e> <s> i think that the noble lord is referring to the united states exercises in the pacific rimpac which took place earlier this month <e> <s> we are unaware of any plans to create an alliance of that description in the pacific <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord molloy will recognise that the question he asked is far wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> if he cares to put down a question on that subject i shall of course answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords any united states activity in central america is of course a matter for the united states <e> <s> the noble lord will of course be aware of the comment that we have made on the recent icj ruling <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat the answer which has been given by my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary to a private notice question in another place on south africa <e> <s> the answer is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both the noble lords lord cledwyn and lord gladwyn for their reception of the answer to this question <e> <s> on the first question asked by the noble lord lord cledwyn i can confirm that my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary will be going as the president of the council of ministers on behalf of and with the full authority of the twelve <e> <s> his mission is an effort to establish conditions in which dialogue can begin and he hopes to build on the progress that has been made by the eminent persons group <e> <s> as i said during the course of our debate on friday his mission is not a fact-finding mission <e> <s> he hopes to persuade the key parties to make progress towards the immediate european and commonwealth objective of a dialogue and the suspension of violence <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to tell my noble friend that we all felt his absence from our debate on friday <e> <s> we are very glad to see him in his place today <e> <s> i have certainly noted what he has had to say <e> <s> he speaks with enormous experience of foreign affairs and in a very wise sense about a possible settlement <e> <s> i am sure he is right in what he says about the need for patience and the timescale on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord bottomley first for his generous remarks about the debate on friday <e> <s> all of us who took part in it thought it was an excellent debate and i have drawn it to the attention of my right honourable and learned friend <e> <s> i shall also draw to his attention the remarks and the suggestion that the noble lord has made today <e> <s> i am sure that when my right honourable and learned friend visits south africa it will be his hope to see as wide a spectrum of opinion as possible <e> <s> there are always time constraints on these matters but i thank the noble lord for the suggestion he has made <e>", "<cs> my lords the dates that i gave in the original answer are that my right honourable and learned friend will be visiting zambia and zimbabwe from th to th july and he will be going in his capacity as president of the council of ministers <e> <s> i am not in a position to confirm the report that the noble lord has heard about mrs winnie mandela <e>", "<cs> my lords i am fully aware of the views of the noble lord lord hatch on this matter as we have frequently discussed them across the floor of the house both at question time and in debates <e> <s> he will be aware from what i have said to the noble lord lord cledwyn what is the purpose of the mission of my right honourable and learned friend <e> <s> it is to build on the progress made by the eminent persons group and to make an effort to establish conditions in which dialogue can begin <e> <s> i am aware of what has been said in the report of the eminent persons but we believe and it is our hope that my right honourable and learned friend will be able to persuade key parties to make concrete progress towards the immediate european and commonwealth objective of both a dialogue and equally important a suspension of violence <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have indicated the south african government have made clear that they are ready to receive my right honourable and learned friend <e> <s> they have proposed alternative dates <e> <s> these <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is always very dangerous on occasions like this for ministers to speculate exactly on what lies behind the views that have been taken by other governments <e> <s> the point which is being made by my noble friend lord thomas was one that was made from a number of different parts of the house during our debate on friday <e> <s> i think the fact that economic sanctions were not successful in rhodesia and were not successful as the noble lord lord gladwyn told us originally when applied in abyssinia and the noble lord lord thomas quotes the case of afghanistan makes one realise that they are not quite as effective as some people would make out they are <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is saying that countries have agreed to impose sanctions and have failed to keep that agreement of course that is not something that one can accept <e> <s> but it has been shown to be a fact that one of the difficulties about sanctions is not only getting all the countries to agree to impose them but even more important ensuring that they are carried out by the governments and all the other private firms or individuals within those countries <e> <s> if sanctions are to be effective there must be no ways of getting round them <e> <s> this has always been one of the difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that we abandoned our chemical weapons in the late s and that the united states brought in a unilateral restraint since which has not been matched by the soviet union <e> <s> i shall of course draw to my right honourable and learned friends attention the point my noble friend makes so that it may be raised when this matter is discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point that the noble lord lord cledwyn raises we welcome the soviet chemical weapon initiative of nd april in so far as it includes some points of detail for instance an offer to declare chemical weapon production sites within days and the beginning of a dismantling within one year as opposed to the usual generalities that we have had from the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been no change in government policy and none is proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall draw the point made by the noble lord lord kennet to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree with what my noble friend says <e> <s> that is why we regard challenge inspection as very important <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to confirm to the noble lord lord molloy what i said to the noble lord lord cledwyn <e> <s> there is no change in government policy with regard to chemical weapons and none is proposed <e> <s> nato has no wish to see the united states resume the production of chemical weapons if a better option a negotiated ban can be achieved <e> <s> i note his last point <e> <s> i think that he will agree that it is wide of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord lord cledwyn i set out as fully as i could the governments position on the proposals made by the soviet union in april <e> <s> i confirm again that the problem is challenge inspection <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend will agree that the supplementary question is wide of the mark <e> <s> i assure your lordships that i have drawn the attention of my right honourable and honourable friends to the important debate that we had in your lordships house last friday <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly note what my noble friend has to say on this point <e> <s> i undertake to draw it to the attention of my right honourable and learned friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be aware of the question that was put down on this subject yesterday by my noble friend lord orr-ewing and the answer which i gave on that point <e> <s> i confirm of course that we have abandoned production and stockpiling of chemical weapons <e> <s> again this will be a matter that will be raised in the discussions <e> <s> we have <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware of what i said in my original answer <e> <s> we shall press for progress in human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords on the latter point that my noble friend asks we shall ask the soviet union to ease the restrictions on the levels of emigration of the jewish community from the soviet union <e> <s> but we shall also bring to the attention of mr shevardnadze the need for a better implementation of the commitments under the helsinki and madrid csce documents in particular as regards the treatment of their citizens including religious minorities <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for the way in which he has couched his question and the importance which he and his noble friends attach to what we believe is a very important meeting and an important opportunity for dialogue it is something to which i think all of your lordships would attach importance <e> <s> on the specific final point that he raises i cannot add to what i have already told your lordships <e> <s> however we must all hope that in all the different current arms control discussions some progress will be made <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> there will be discussions on the full range of arms control issues with mr shevardnadze and we believe that there are elements in the latest soviet proposals at geneva which deserve further exploration <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i have already made clear the importance that we attach both to the helsinki agreements and to the csce agreements <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary is currently visiting southern africa in pursuit of the mission entrusted to him by the european council <e> <s> he expects to pay a visit to south africa later this month <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course aware of the press reports to which the noble lord lord molloy refers <e> <s> my right honourable and learned friend is undertaking this mission in his capacity as president of the council of ministers in europe <e> <s> he goes on behalf of the countries and with their full support and we hope that he will make progress in his mission <e> <s> i would not wish to comment on a hypothetical situation <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i am aware of the statement to which the right reverend prelate refers <e> <s> i would say to him and to his colleagues that the heads of government of the countries of the community agreed on the urgent need for a genuine national <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his first remarks on his wish and that of his noble friends that my right honourable and learned friend will be successful in his mission <e> <s> one of the objectives of his mission is to see whether or not a dialogue is going to be possible and to make quite sure that there is no misunderstanding about the british governments position both in our condemnation of apartheid and in our wish to see a suspension of violence <e> <s> we wish to achieve these things if we can by dialogue <e> <s> i have noted the other points that the noble lord made but we must hope for progress in this mission before commenting on what might or might not be its outcome <e>", "<cs> my lords yes because as i said at the beginning it is important to recognise that he is speaking on behalf of the countries of the community and with their full support <e>", "<cs> my lords yes we are well aware of the views of mrs suzman and others who have spoken out against sanctions economic measures against south africa <e> <s> i have made clear our own governments concern over the dangers of economic measures and of their effects on the black population in south africa just as much as on the white <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure at this point that it is necessary for me to remind the right reverend prelate of that quotation as my noble friend seems to have done so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i follow the sequence of thought of the noble lord lord molloy <e> <s> i have attempted in my answers to set out the governments position on these difficult issues <e>", "<cs> my lords we all heard with great interest what the noble lord lord gladwyn had to say from his experience in the foreign office when sanctions were applied i think abyssinia was the first example and were found to be quite ineffective <e> <s> what my right honourable and learned friend is attempting to do speaking as the president of the european council is of course to get into a dialogue with these countries <e> <s> that is why he is meeting both the front line states and the south african government <e>", "<cs> my lords all that the noble lord lord hatch has said is that in public life and in important and difficult issues it takes a long time to reach solutions <e> <s> but one of the facts in this case is that the south african government have taken a series of steps to end apartheid <e> <s> they may not have gone as far or as fast as we should like but they have made progress and in all of this that should not be forgotten <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord should feel that i did not answer his question <e> <s> it seemed to me that i had given him an answer precisely to the question which he had asked <e> <s> but perhaps i might confirm that the scope of the consultancy programme is wide <e> <s> it will report on open learning facilities already in existence throughout the commonwealth operating at national regional and international levels higher further and continuing education facilities will be examined the range of actual and potential beneficiaries and methods and structures of organisations will be covered and the consultants will also identify potential areas for new initiatives <e> <s> so far as open and distance learning is concerned i share the noble lords interest in this matter <e> <s> much is going on <e> <s> the open university is in the forefront of the development of distance learning and has more students than ever before while the open tech programme has funded no fewer than projects to develop open learning materials and services <e>", "<cs> my lords we expect the cost to be approximately <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend will understand that the point that he raises is one which is wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> what i have indicated on the question which is before us is that we are contributing to what we believe to be something which will be of value to a great many young people throughout the commonwealth <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i am quite certain that there is a very great deal that can be learned from these new techniques <e> <s> my understanding of the position is that the new consultancy which is to be set up will be able to explore how these techniques might be used as well as identifying what is being done at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that this is a time for having a major debate about the commonwealth <e> <s> i would say to my noble friend that i think that the point that he raised is wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> split-site courses are already encouraged under the aid programme wherever this is appropriate and viable <e> <s> in many cases where permission is given for students to work at phd level under the aid programme agreement from the oda is conditional on split-site study <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that every member of your lordships house is perfectly entitled about all these matters to express views which are deeply held <e> <s> my only concern is that we should keep to matters on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that i can give the noble lord a precise answer to the question he has asked because i understand that one of the functions of this consultancy will be to identify what open learning facilities are currently available <e> <s> but if he is thinking of the sort of problems that are raised by exchanges throughout the commonwealth on equivalence of qualifications and so on that is a very complex matter and i am not sure that there is a detailed breakdown of the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord has in mind precise courses in different countries of the commonwealth then so far as british institutions are concerned the knowledge of these is available and to the best of my knowledge is distributed quite widely through british missions through the british council and through the oda overseas <e> <s> but if the noble lord has a specific point in mind then if he will let me know i will of course write to him about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> unless therefore any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first part of the noble lords supplementary question is yes both my right honourable friend the prime minister and my right honourable friend the foreign secretary raised the subject of afghanistan with mr shevardnadze <e> <s> regrettably he indicated no change in the soviet position on afghanistan <e> <s> with regard to the noble lords second supplementary question we of course welcome all initiatives to encourage discussion and dialogue on the middle east <e> <s> we remain convinced that the regions problems can be solved only by negotiation <e> <s> it is of course too early to evaluate the effect of the visit to morocco of the israeli prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords the position is that the talks continue <e> <s> the united kingdom supports the effort of mr cordoves to find a settlement along the lines of the united nations resolution which calls for an immediate withdrawal of foreign troops the return of refugees self-determination for the afghan people and the restoration of afghanistans independence and non-aligned status <e> <s> perhaps i may add to what i said about the discussions with mr shevardnadze <e> <s> mr gorbachev has said that he wants to withdraw soviet troops but we want him to translate his words into reality <e> <s> there is no obstacle to his doing so <e> <s> troop withdrawal is the real test of soviet commitment to negotiations and the key to a peaceful solution to this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i did not make that part of my reply plain the talks continue <e> <s> of course they do not go on all the time <e> <s> the key obstacle to a solution is the question of the withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first part of the noble lords question again the soviet proposals for a middle east conference were discussed with mr shevardnadze when he was in london <e> <s> we have no objections to the principle of an international peace conference or indeed a preparatory meeting as has been proposed by the russians but the timing is crucial and neither can be effective if the parties are not ready to make them work <e> <s> we are not at all certain that the gap between the parties has yet narrowed sufficiently to make that possible <e> <s> on the noble lords second point about afghanistan i think that i have made the governments position clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to hear that the noble lord holds the foreign and commonwealth office in such high regard <e> <s> i shall pass that on and i am sure that it will be pleased to hear it <e> <s> we have done our best to help with a solution on afghanistan <e> <s> we are not of course directly a party to the talks <e> <s> we hope very much that a solution will be found but as the noble lord rightly says the key is the withdrawal of soviet troops <e>", "<cs> my lords as always the noble lord puts plainly what i think everybody believes <e> <s> the soviet troops should not be in afghanistan and there are now about of them there <e> <s> but when the <e>", "<cs> my lords we have made clear quite consistently that we have our own policy on central america <e> <s> we have advocated a political solution to the problems of central america on the basis of the contadora objectives <e> <s> i should like to make it quite clear that the contras are in fact nicaraguans who have resorted to armed struggle against their own government <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be helpful to remind the noble lord lord cledwyn and other noble lords that the united states senate has still to act over the allocation of the funds in aid to the contras <e> <s> however as i have already made clear we have consistently advocated a political solution to the problem of central america on the basis of the contadora objectives and so far as i know no date has been set for a final signing of the contadora act <e> <s> we do not consider that the problems of the region can be solved by armed force and we ensure that the united states government are made aware of our views <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made clear the governments view on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the question of the noble and learned lord lord wilberforce adherence to the rule of law is fundamental to our foreign policy <e> <s> we are still studying the reasoned and lengthy judgment of the court but we have consistently made it clear that we advocate a political rather than a military solution to the problems of central america <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first part of the noble lords supplementary question is no <e> <s> the answer to the second part is that the government really have to pay attention to what the united states government are saying and not to the unnamed spokesman <e>", "<cs> a further confusion my lords <e> <s> i shall now return to where we were <e>", "<cs> not at the present time my lords but perhaps i may say to the noble lord lord kennet as i have said to the house that i entirely understand <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the point that the noble lord makes about this case and i can assure him that we are in constant touch with the commission and it is well aware of our view that an offer should be made without delay <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the issue in dispute and the reason why there has been a delay is that the commission told us that it needed full documentation on mr adams claim and if it had not obtained this the commission would have been reprimanded by the court of auditors for failing to obtain it <e> <s> this has taken some time and has been the reason for the delay <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord lord cledwyn that we are equally concerned that this matter should be brought to a conclusion and we are of course aware of the difficulties suffered by mr adams in the meanwhile <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i take the point that my noble friend lord renton makes about this matter <e> <s> i can assure him also that we have done all that we can to keep in touch with the commission and to impress upon it the urgency of the matter <e> <s> i shall of course draw the attention of my right honourable and learned friend to what has been said in your lordships house today <e> <s> however as i said in my original response to this question we hope that a settlement will be made before th august <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the point that has been made by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> as he will be aware the facts of the matter are that the court gave nine months until th august for an agreement to be reached between the parties on the amount of damages <e> <s> as i said we have been in constant touch with the commission and we expect it to make this offer before th august <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot give an answer to my noble friend lord broxbourne on that particular point but the commission will no doubt be in direct touch with mr adams and his solicitors as regards the amount of damages <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the position is that the ruling by the european court of justice was in november when the commission was ordered to pay damages for breaking the bond of confidentiality <e> <s> in making its decision the court allowed nine months until august for the settlement to be reached and for the money to be paid <e> <s> it is our expectation that this matter will be settled before that date <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it would be most unwise for me to enter into a dispute as to whether or not the court procedures were wrong <e> <s> i can only tell the house what in fact has been the case and that it is our hope that there will now be a settlement <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> as i indicated in answer to the earlier question by the noble lord lord broxbourne we do not know what the settlement will be <e> <s> that will be for the court to determine and no doubt it will be in touch with both mr adams and his solicitors <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement on the turks and caicos islands being made in another place by my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state mr tim eggar <e> <s> the statement is as follows on th march the house was informed that a commission of inquiry had been set up by the governor of the turks and caicos islands one of our remaining caribbean dependencies <e> <s> the commission was asked to investigate allegations of arson of government offices corruption in the public works department and related issues <e> <s> the commissioner mr louis blom-cooper qc submitted his report to the governor in london on th july <e> <s> mr blom-cooper has found arson of a public building by persons unknown <e> <s> he has also found the chief minister and two of his ministerial colleagues unfit to hold ministerial office <e> <s> the report states that ministers have indulged in unconstitutional behaviour political discrimination and administrative malpractices <e> <s> the commission also finds that the leader of the opposition party and a senior opposition figure have been involved in a conspiracy to commit public order offences in order to overthrow the present government <e> <s> the commission observes that such is the corrupting effect of patronage throughout the system that this was the only means of protest available to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both noble lords the noble lord lord cledwyn and the noble lord lord mcnair for their very helpful and positive responses to what is a very serious constitutional situation <e> <s> it is most helpful that the statement should receive this support from all parts of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords the money that we give to turks and caicos is million annually and of that million is in budgetary aid <e> <s> it is our intention to provide immediate additional support in certain key positions of the present administration <e> <s> we estimate that those will cost between and million in the present financial year <e> <s> for the longer term we are appointing a manpower commission to review the requirement both in education and in health for the islands <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord kennet will be aware we give a substantial amount of aid to the caribbean <e> <s> one of the ways in which we feel it is most important for us to help them is by keeping a very high level of diplomatic representation through <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord lord molloy that the american government already put very considerable resources into trying to stop the drugs trade which transits the caribbean trying to intercept the boats aeroplanes and so on as i understand it as do the canadian government <e> <s> we are all working together because as i am sure everyone will appreciate the only hope of stopping this terrible trade is by close international co-operation <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall be putting a copy of the report in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend asked a number of questions which i realise are of interest not only to him but to many of your lordships <e> <s> we are actively continuing our efforts to achieve any early discussion and agreement on a multilateral regime <e> <s> we are expecting the technical study under fao <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i take note of what the noble lord lord shackleton has said <e> <s> it is true that a bilateral agreement on fisheries was initial-led by the governments of argentina and the soviet union earlier this month <e> <s> i think that it is unfair and untrue to say that we have done nothing because we are still waiting for the fao study which i think will be valuable and wil tell us what is happening as opposed to what people assume is happening <e>", "<cs> my lords the fao study is a technical study to which we have indirectly made an input on this matter <e> <s> the study is supported and accepted by all the nations involved in fisheries in the south-west atlantic and contributions are being made by all the nations <e> <s> i think that it will give us a good basis for knowing what is happening to the fish stocks in that part of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the last point is yes this matter was raised with mr shevardnadze when he was in london <e> <s> on the first point that the noble lord lord kennet raised it is of course a protection zone and not an exclusion zone that we are talking about and only argentine warships and military aircraft are excluded from the zone <e> <s> it has always been possible for argentine fishing vessels to enter it <e> <s> they have had to ask permission to do so <e> <s> but there is no reason for thinking that they would not be given that permission if they so wished <e> <s> peaceful activities by soviet fishing vessels and argentine fishing vessels pose no threat to the security of the islands <e> <s> by definition therefore the actual crew is not a major consideration in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is of course that the protection zone is covered by aircraft and an account is taken of ships in the zone <e> <s> the answer to the second point as i have already indicated is that we shall not be clear about the full picture until we get the fao study in the autumn <e> <s> preliminary indications are that while one of the main species of squid has come under heavy pressure the other squid species and the main species of fin fish appear to be holding up well <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be aware that we should like very much to have better relations with argentina and to negotiate many matters with that country <e> <s> what we have said is that we are not prepared to negotiate sovereignty <e>", "<cs> my lords we retain this right <e> <s> our aim is the establishment of an effective conservation and management regime in the south-west atlantic <e> <s> i believe however that we still need to look at establishing workable arrangements for fisheries conservation and management in the south-west atlantic <e> <s> the disposition of fish stocks makes it strongly preferable to apply conservation measures over a wide area of the south-west atlantic extending beyond the waters around the falklands <e> <s> it is an international issue and we believe that it requires an international solution <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the point that the noble baroness makes <e> <s> pressure on the fishery makes it all the more important that we should secure a multilateral regime <e> <s> in the meantime we have negotiated with some of the principal fishing nations voluntary restraint arrangements that have operated during the last fishing season <e> <s> these have helped i believe to reduce the threat <e> <s> i accept however that they cannot be a long-term solution <e>", "<cs> my lords the ussr has agreed to take part in the fao study and to contribute to finding out what the case is <e> <s> of course once we get that study we shall have to look rapidly at the next phase which will be some agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe there is no doubt that all the countries fishing in this part of the world are very well aware of the british position on the matter and of the importance that we attach to reaching a solution <e> <s> i am certain that the remarks made in your lordships house today will not be lost on other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the minister for overseas development said in a written answer in another place on rd june at col <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hatch will be well aware of the governments view on this matter because we have debated it on several occasions in the past <e> <s> he knows of course the reasons that we have given for the position as it is <e> <s> i appreciate the noble lords particular interest in aid to agriculture in africa <e> <s> between and the proportion of our aid to sub-saharan africa spent on agriculture and available for spending by that sector increased from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> and we aim to increase this where we can <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the purpose behind my noble friends question is whether or not we make sure that the money given in aid is used for that purpose and it is valuable to have that question <e> <s> over the years the oda approval procedures have been refined to ensure that only aid-worthy projects get official support <e> <s> special arrangements for monitoring our aid are built into these projects and the same is true where balance-of-payments aid is concerned <e> <s> this is given in the form of british goods and services and <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as projects in south africa are concerned we have recently agreed as the noble lord will be aware to give an extra million which is going to be spent specifically on the black population <e> <s> of that money a proportion will go in the form of grants for scholarships <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i appreciate the interest of the noble lord lord oram in this matter <e> <s> as i said in answer to an earlier question we aim to increase aid to agriculture where we can although helping agriculture directly relieving poverty depends upon economic growth in the countries concerned <e> <s> that is why we also finance infrastructure <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the figures broken down in the form that the noble lord asks for <e> <s> i do not think it would be right to say that all this aid is in the form of grants <e> <s> if i can get the information he wishes i will write to him on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that that is a question on which i do not have the figures at my disposal <e> <s> i can tell my noble friend that british aid to zimbabwe rose from million in to nearly million in and that we have made offers of new aid in <e> <s> we continue to expect to provide substantial help <e> <s> it is also true that the level of aid in any particular country is kept under review <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware a proportion of the bilateral aid that we have given has been direct food aid and disaster relief <e> <s> he may like to know that in the particularly tragic situation in southern sudan we have responded swiftly to the urgent need for emergency assistance to help the victims of famine in the sudan and other drought affected countries in africa <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first question of the noble viscount lord falkland is one that i gave in reply to my noble friend lord onslow about the most effective use of aid <e> <s> but we have said particularly in relation to the united nations fund that it is very important that the aid recipients in the countries involved should play their part in pursuing sensible economic policies at home <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now make a statement about the recent visit to southern africa of my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful that both the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and the noble baroness lady seear reiterated what has been said from both the labour and liberal benches that they wished my right honourable and learned friend well in his mission to south africa <e> <s> they reiterated what i think is believed by all british people that is that in no way has his personal standing been diminished by any of his experiences <e> <s> indeed he has bravely stood out and stood up for what we all believe the point that has been made that we all want to seek a change in apartheid and we want to see that change brought about peacefully <e> <s> the question is how we are to achieve that <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord massereene and ferrard asked three questions <e> <s> my right honourable and learned friend did in fact meet chief buthelezi and is well aware of the views which he has expressed on behalf of the zulu people <e> <s> we are also well aware that the south african government has taken steps partially to dismantle apartheid <e> <s> we have welcomed those steps <e> <s> what we have always said is that they have not gone far enough or fast enough <e> <s> concerning the point of the offer of freedom for nelson mandela in return for the renunciation of violence i think it is important to note that what my right honourable and learned friend said and it is the view of the government is that we want not only the release of nelson mandela but also the release of other political prisoners and the unbanning of the anc <e>", "<cs> my lords i am completely dismayed by what the noble lord lord hatch of lusby has said <e> <s> we had a debate last night lasting nearly two hours at the end of which i set out the governments statement <e> <s> i went out of my way to answer the specific points he raised and i have no intention of repeating this afternoon what i said last night <e> <s> i can only say that so far as what the noble lord has described as the mini-summit by which i take it he means the meeting of seven commonwealth countries i have already answered that question in what i have said to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely correct <e> <s> discussions have been going on with our community partners and we had discussions with our commonwealth partners stemming from the nassau meeting of the commonwealth heads of government <e> <s> as i said we are already implementing a whole range of measures with our community and commonwealth partners <e> <s> as i have also indicated my right honourable and learned friend made clear on th july in another place his view on other measures <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept what the noble lord lord brockway said that either my right honourable friend the prime minister or my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary have been humiliated by that visit <e> <s> i am bound to say that i have listened in this house on many occasions to the noble lord putting if i may say so eloquently the case for negotiation and talks with people <e> <s> i am surprised that he should feel that making a further effort to negotiate with the people who are in a position to implement change in apartheid is humiliating or not worth while <e> <s> we do not see it in those terms <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord <e> <s> lord paget has asked a number of questions and made a number of points <e> <s> but i shall try to confine my answers to those which are relevant to the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for his very helpful and positive support for the statement that i have made and for his support for the policy and the line that is being pursued by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord lord molloy i point out that my right honourable and learned friend during his visit to southern africa had the opportunity to put very frankly our view about the situation in south africa to state president botha and to other members of the south african government and in the same way he has had the opportunity to put very freely and frankly our position to president kaunda <e> <s> we have made clear on many occasions that we condemn apartheid <e> <s> i would only add so far as concerns the united states and its attitude to the mission of my right honourable and learned friend that it has been very supportive and my right honourable and learned friend will be seeing dr crocker later this afternoon <e> <s> the hague summit decision provided for consultation with other industrialised countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i would say to the noble lord lord alport that it is a matter of concern that some of the questions have been way outside the terms of the statement <e> <s> the convention of the house is that on a statement noble lords should put questions with the exception of the front bench speakers <e> <s> i shall of course draw to the notice of my noble friend the leader of the house the remarks of the noble lord lord alport <e>", "<cs> my lords i note of course what my noble friend lord onslow has said <e> <s> one of the difficulties about sanctions is that to be effective they require the complete co-operation of all countries <e> <s> he is right to draw this point to our attention <e>", "<cs> my lords we very much regret what has happened regarding the commonwealth games <e> <s> the important thing to remember is that they are commonwealth games although they happen to be taking place in edinburgh <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon puts in rather a different form the question <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had the kind of debate today for which this house has a well-deserved <e>", "<cs> yes my lords or fascist <e> <s> we also recognised years ago that our economic interest lay in europe <e> <s> membership of the community is not an easy answer to our economic problems <e> <s> it does not shield us from the need to be competitive <e> <s> it does not shield us from the need to follow policies which lead to sound inflation-free growth nor free us from the need to moderate pay settlements and improve productivity <e> <s> those are the realities of life that will be with us whether or not we are in the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm what the noble lord said about the consultations that have taken place <e> <s> i take note of the noble lords interest in his supplementary question about a statement <e> <s> it is unusual to make a statement about a meeting at which her majestys government are not present <e> <s> but we certainly wish to keep the house informed in an appropriate way <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for the question that he has put to the house and to say that i think he has made a very important point <e> <s> if i may say so to those sitting opposite some of us who heard the anti-american remarks made at their party conference last week do not feel that those are in britains best interests <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to hear from the noble lord that he welcomes this meeting at reykjavik which we regard as a token of the wish of both sides for a full summit <e> <s> we hope that that will take place in the united states this year as agreed at geneva last year <e> <s> quite specifically both sides have made clear that regional issues will be on the agenda and we hope as well for results on human rights <e> <s> we hope that the meeting will lead to a productive summit meeting with substantial results in arms control building on the earlier agreement at the geneva summit and on the useful work which has been done since then by the negotiators in geneva <e> <s> her majestys government in consultation with their allies have made a positive and active contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord would expect me to go into detail but as he will know there has always been close consultation between ourselves and the united states and that applies at the present time <e> <s> on the particular point he raises about inf and the united states proposal for warheads in europe i cannot comment on the details of that proposal <e> <s> it is fully consistent with agreed alliance policy but there must be equal and global limits on warheads and appropriate constraints on shorter-range systems <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all glad that the meeting is taking place and we hope for progress at it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that statement <e> <s> if the noble lord and his friends cared to consider the great dangers to which they are putting this country by their anti-nuclear policy i think they would recognise that the overwhelming majority of the british people will be very frightened by it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i think it is very reassuring to hear from the noble lord on that point <e> <s> it is important for the whole world that this meeting at which we wish to see progress <e> <s> is taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very unclear about the question that the noble lord asked at the end of all that <e>", "<cs> my lords i remain unclear as to exactly the question that the noble lord asked but i comment on one point that he made in all that that is that it would be difficult for this country to remain a firm friend and ally of the americans by pursuing policies which they would object to very strongly <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already indicated in an answer to the noble lord lord molloy the position about that <e> <s> i am sure that what i have said has been taken note of by the usual channels and by the leader of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords none significantly <e> <s> nearly all missions have reduced their fines since some more dramatically than others <e> <s> we are intensifying our efforts to persuade those which have not yet fallen into line to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of the money not without notice <e> <s> but on the question of the second part of the noble lords supplementary question i can tell him that diplomats were sent home in in in in and that so far in because of serious parking offences have been removed from the united kingdom at our request or on the initiative of their own government <e>", "<cs> my lords on that particular point because diplomats have immunity from criminal jurisdiction and clamping is a penal measure both in intent and in effect it in fact contravenes the <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot without notice give a figure for vehicles towed away but that of course is allowable and many cars have been towed away <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give my noble friend some further information <e> <s> the ten nations with the highest totals of unpaid parking fines incurred in the june quarter were in order saudi arabia france china nigeria sudan ghana turkey egypt iraq and malaysia <e> <s> preliminary statistics for the september quarter indicate that of these missions nigeria has achieved a significant decrease in parking fines <e>", "<cs> my lords the new policy was introduced in april and we determined that we would keep detailed records of unpaid parking fines incurred by all diplomatic cars with diplomatic registration plates both official and private from the st may <e> <s> we that is in this case the foreign and commonwealth office notified them at the same time that persistent and deliberate failure to pay parking fines would call into question their acceptability as members of diplomatic missions in london <e> <s> we have since followed that policy <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the specific information my noble friend asks for not without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords diplomatic immunity would apply to certain named people in the embassy <e> <s> i think one has to remember what its purpose is <e> <s> it is not to benefit the individuals but to ensure their efficient performance of functions in diplomatic missions as representing individual states <e> <s> the vienna convention on diplomatic relations codifies this longstanding international practice <e>", "<cs> my lords we would expect all british diplomats to obey the laws of the countries to which they are accredited <e>", "<cs> my lords the guard was withdrawn on the st july <e> <s> it no longer seems appropriate to have a guard of this nature at a frontier between two countries who are european community partners and north atlantic treaty organisation allies <e> <s> the spanish government have not yet withdrawn their guard <e> <s> we will continue to press them to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords we informed the spanish government in advance of our intention to withdraw the guard and we urged them to make a reciprocal gesture <e> <s> we shall continue to press them to do so <e> <s> but can i say to my noble friend that the gibraltar government have expressed satisfaction at the terms of the response of my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary on th september to the memorandum which was signed by leaders of all gibraltars political parties on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i can quite see that my noble friend is making a very clever debating point but i think we ought to realise that in this matter we are after all talking about a country which is our partner in the european community our ally in nato and one with whom we have good diplomatic relations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to give an assurance to the noble lord lord cledwyn and indeed to the whole house that the british government stands by the preamble to the constitution <e> <s> this assurance has been given many times in your lordships house in another place and of course in gibraltar itself <e>", "<cs> my lords in the course of our discussions with the spanish which take place at official level and of course will again take place at ministerial level we have made our position on this matter absolutely clear <e> <s> we hope very much that the spanish will consider withdrawing their ceremonial guard as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill has already been the subject of extensive debate in another place <e>", "<cs> i hope that even the noble and learned lord lord edmund-davies will feel at the end of the debate on amendment no <e> <s> which has now lasted minutes that we have had a very fair and complete discussion of the issues involved <e> <s> that has always been my wish as it has been the wish of the government and i am very glad that we have heard from so many members of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> in view of the hour i wonder whether this might be a convenient moment for us to break for dinner <e> <s> therefore i beg to move that the <e>", "<cs> this amendment relates to a part of the single european act which has already been the subject of a report from the select committee on the european communities of your lordships house <e> <s> as the committees report pointed out article of the single european act which this amendment would negate is in fact designed to make the functioning of the institutions of the community more effective <e> <s> the house of lords committee went on to acknowledge <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can reassure my noble friend lord tranmire on the points that he has raised <e> <s> i refer to two conclusions of your lordships select committee report on the delegation of powers to the commission <e> <s> paragraph reads <e>", "<cs> in its report on the european union the select committee of this chamber on european communities said <e>", "<cs> i said at the start of these proceedings that we had no wish to curtail anybodys discussion of the amendments before the committee but i believe that however strongly the noble lord may believe that we should not have entered the community we are in it and that is our starting point <e>", "<cs> the amendment now before us <e> <s> no <e> <s> would delete article of the single european act under which qualified majority voting would be extended subject to certain qualifications to provisions where the treaty currently requires unanimous decisions <e> <s> all these articles are directly related to the internal market <e>", "<cs> i shall do my best to answer all the specific points that the noble lord lord bruce of donington has raised <e> <s> i shall write to him about the first point because it is something which i think even he will accept is somewhat wide of the amendments on the marshalled list <e> <s> i shall let him have a note on it <e>", "<cs> if i can continue with this the commission is currently challenging the united kingdoms interpretation of a provision of the second vat directive which permits zero rating for clearly defined social reasons and for the benefit of the final consumer <e> <s> the commission is only challenging our zero rates to the extent that they do not clearly fall into this category <e> <s> the vast bulk of items currently zero rated that is food childrens clothes and supplies of gas and electricty to the final consumer are not affected <e> <s> we are fighting the case vigorously in the european court but i must stress that it predates the <e>", "<cs> i hope that i shall be able to satisfy the noble lord lord stoddart <e> <s> the new articles a and b are intended to make further provision than exists in the present treaties for certain aspects of what may broadly be described as social policy <e> <s> therefore i think that they are the sort olobjectives that he himself would accept <e>", "<cs> i shall repeat it <e> <s> what the noble lord appeared to be saying was that these articles could lead to higher minimum health standards for working people but they are to be resisted because the application of such standards could cost money <e> <s> i must remember that argument <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord will be aware we have accepted the amendments which have been proposed in the single european act and the consequences that flow from it <e> <s> the government have helped in a wholly practical way through the single european act to contribute to the raising of these various standards that are involved in health and safety at work <e> <s> as i said our standards are already among some of the highest in europe and the effect of this new provision is likely to be a gradual improvement in minimum standards elsewhere in the community <e>", "<cs> i shall do my best to clarify the points raised by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> he asked me what was meant by the second part of paragraph of article a <e>", "<cs> in view of the lateness of the hour and as we have reached a part of the bill where it would be right perhaps to conclude our proceedings for this evening i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has asked three supplementary questions <e> <s> first with regard to the mining of the nicaraguan ports we noticed with interest the finding of the international court of justice about the mining of the nicaraguan ports and the interruption of maritime communications <e> <s> we made it known at the time of the united nations security council meeting that we deplored the mining of nicaraguan waters <e>", "<cs> my lords we understand that the united states secretary of state mr shultz has <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to confirm to the noble lord lord cledwyn that we have our own policy on central america and that together with our european partners we support a comprehensive and verifiable negotiated settlement to the problems of central america based on the contadora principles <e> <s> the agreements reached at luxembourg in november were a practical demonstration of that support but we do not believe that the problems of the area can be solved by armed force and the united states is well aware of our views <e>", "<cs> my lords we have made quite plain to the united states government our own view that the problems of central america can best be resolved through the contadora process which we hope will be continued by the countries of the area involved <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter for the american government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right in saying that the americans view central america as their back yard and are naturally concerned about what might happen there but we believe that these problems will best be resolved by a political solution based on the contadora principles <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord jenkins will be fully aware of the governments view about the elections in nicaragua <e> <s> i shall not repeat them now because i am sure that his noble friend lord mellish has heard what he said on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord chalfont that it is a matter of regret that this conference is being held and that it is the first time that an attempt has been made to hold this conference in a nato capital since the attempt in when the congress had to move itself from the proposed venue of sheffield to warsaw <e>", "<cs> my lords as a matter of fact i knew that the noble lord was going to that conference in copenhagen and i assumed that he would be speaking at it <e> <s> it is a matter of regret that many people should be sufficiently misguided to wish to attend the conference but i think that the noble lord lord brockway will recognise that among others who have not been allowed to attend are members of such <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that we all agree that nato is strong enough to stand up and make perfectly plain its view on negotiations at world level <e> <s> i make quite plain our view about this particular organisation because i think it is the kind of organisation which can mislead some people into thinking that it is doing one thing when in fact it is not <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not looked in detail at the agenda for the conference but i think that my noble friend and i both agree that the conference is not the forum which is likely to make any progress on the real questions concerning the reduction of nuclear weapons in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not say what effect it will have on public opinion here <e> <s> judging from reports we have seen of the numbers attending it there will be nothing like so many delegates as originally expected <e> <s> we must hope that it will not have very much effect <e>", "<cs> my lords this is all very much a matter of judgment but i believe that it is important we should be warned about these matters even if as we hope they are not successful in achieving their end <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may look at organisations such as that and be able to interpret what the word peace in that context means <e> <s> we have to remember that there are <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and the point that the danish foreign minister is making is that danish society is strong enough to withstand the congress as is nato <e> <s> as it happens the organisation does not seem to have been very successful and has not attracted as many delegates as expected <e> <s> nevertheless it is right that we should be warned about these organisations and the dangers to those who are unaware of their activities <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both the noble lord lord cledwyn and the noble lord lord kennet for their reception of this statement <e> <s> both have asked a number of specific questions to which i shall try to respond <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord lord zuckerman will have heard the answer i gave to the noble lord lord kennet on a somewhat similar point on this matter <e> <s> perhaps i could say further that the united states have made clear over an extended period that the russians have no veto over the deployment of sdi <e> <s> but president reagan invited the russians should strategic defences prove to be feasible to move to a more defence-orientated world and any deployment should thus be co-operative <e> <s> meanwhile president reagan made clear that sdi continues to be conducted in accordance with the abm treaty <e> <s> but we are not prepared to see the treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords on this matter of inspections particularly with regard to nuclear testing the position is that despite soviet propaganda in the run up to the reykjavik meeting we understand that nuclear testing was not a major issue at reykjavik <e> <s> but we have long believed that progress must be sought in areas where it is most likely and the first step would be to seek the verification necessary to ratify both the threshold test ban and the peaceful nuclear explosions treaties of the s <e> <s> we therefore welcome the extent of the reykjavik agreement to work for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord lord brockway views the outcome of the reykjavik meeting as hopeful <e> <s> as i indicated very early on in responding to the noble lord lord cledwyn we believe that there has been some good news that has come from reykjavik and that we must build on what has been said <e>", "<cs> my lords i think what is very important in all these humanitarian concerns is that if progress can be made on these these would be not only right in themselves for the individuals concerned but they would be confidence-building measures between both the united states and the soviet union <e> <s> of course we hope that progress will be made on these issues of human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords one point which has become very clear about the reykjavik summit is that some of the immediate reactions to it have not been the same as the reactions which are now apparent two days later <e> <s> i think one must make ones judgments about the matter as time proceeds <e> <s> however as a consequence of this i think there is every reason for us to be hopeful <e> <s> that is not just wishful thinking <e> <s> this is ground for believing as i indicated in earlier answers to the point raised that the russians too wish to see the progress continued <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord chalfont has made a number of really very important points <e> <s> i should like to start by saying to him that on repeated occasions the government have made clear that nuclear disarmament and the reduction of conventional weapons are inextricably linked in the search for general and complete disarmament <e> <s> this of course remains the governments ultimate objective <e>", "<cs> my lords i point out to the noble lord lord molloy that i think that the views of her majestys government on the reykjavik summit are now quite clear both to the united states government and to the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords what i said was that president reagan has made clear that sdi continues to <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there may be much in what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> not for the first time in the course of this committee stage i have myself been very surprised that the noble lord lord bruce of donington should have put down these particular amendments <e> <s> this is especially true in this case because he began by saying that he was in broad and general sympathy with the objectives <e> <s> indeed the particular quotation he read from article a is clearly something to which all your lordships would subscribe and i am very pleased that the noble lord lord bruce does as well <e> <s> however as the noble lord lord banks clearly pointed out if we in fact accepted his amendments this would make these objectives less likely to be achieved not more likely <e>", "<cs> what i was seeking to explain were some of the reasons which i believe led those countries when they came together to form the european community to take the view that they did about the importance of agriculture <e> <s> what i think is important to note is that we as a government and it is a view shared from all parts of your lordships house wish to see reform of the effect of that which is now worse because of the worlds over-supply of agricultural products <e> <s> that is something that could not have been foreseen years ago but is a fact today and something we are working very hard to deal with <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should begin by answering the question that the noble and learned lord lord silkin raised at the end of his speech and say something about the legal status of the preamble and title i in relation to the remaining provisions of the single european act <e> <s> article of the vienna convention on the law of treaties provides that treaties <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful if i recall the purpose of the provisions on foreign policy cooperation which form title iii of the single european act <e> <s> these provisions stem from an initiative by the british government <e> <s> we judged that the time had come to place co-operation in foreign policy known as european political co-operation on a firmer treaty basis <e> <s> our partners agreed with us and the text of title <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i did not make myself plain to the noble lord lord moran <e> <s> i thought i had explained that specific point <e> <s> if your lordships will allow me i shall repeat what i said for the sake of clarity <e> <s> i said that it is a basic principle of political co-operation that we remain free to adopt our own national positions where we think that it is necessary <e> <s> political co-operation operates by consensus and there <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the noble lord lord harris for those remarks <e> <s> i think i would be right in saying that the argentine government were surprised at the unanimity of support that we had from our european partners for which we were most grateful at the time and which was i think an extremely good example of the kind of european political co-operation that we are discussing <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bruce asked the question right at the beginning of his remarks does the veto exist or does it not <e> <s> in the proceedings on the first day of committee on th october my noble friend lady hooper explained the distinction between a veto as constituted by the unanimity requirement and the so-called veto represented by the luxembourg compromise <e> <s> the luxembourg compromise is not and never has been a provision of the european community treaties <e> <s> it is a political understanding based on the so-called luxembourg accords of th and th january and as the noble lord lord bruce quoted from the letter that i sent him i went into some detail on this point <e>", "<cs> i am sure that all members of the committee accept the sincerity of the points that the noble and learned lord lord denning has put forward <e> <s> we have been over this course several times in the committee <e> <s> we also went over it at second reading <e> <s> at this late hour i shall not take up the time of the committee by repeating the arguments <e> <s> i hope that the noble and learned lord will not press his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to go into hypothetical questions of that nature <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mayhew will know what the governments policy is from the answer that i gave to the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that once again the noble lord lord mellish has spoken for many of us <e> <s> what is important is that in effect we have had the longest period of peace in europe this century <e> <s> the nuclear deterrent has made a major contribution to that <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in answer to an earlier question it is not profitable to go into hypothetical questions <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason for having them is the reason that was given by the noble lord lord mellish in an earlier question <e> <s> they have deterred <e> <s> the noble lord lord jenkins may well <e>", "<cs> my lords i take this whole issue very seriously and so do the government <e> <s> what is important is that the whole object of the nato weapons system is to deter aggression against us <e> <s> in that it has so far been successful <e>", "<cs> my lords the policy of nato is that it is a defensive alliance <e> <s> we have repeatedly made clear that nato would never use any weapons except in response to an attack <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord mountgarret for that question <e> <s> as i have indicated in reply to other supplementary questions it would be most unwise to speculate on hypothetical situations <e> <s> i do not therefore wish to be drawn into this matter <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is correct <e> <s> it is a policy of flexible response that is pursued not only by us but by our nato allies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely sorry <e> <s> i did not hear the last part of the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> on the contrary my lords <e> <s> i heard the noble lord perfectly the second time <e> <s> i apologise for missing part of the question when he asked it originally <e> <s> i am sure that what he says is very wise advice <e> <s> that is why the answers are given in general terms <e>", "<cs> my lords it never crossed my mind that the noble lord lord jenkins was laughing at me <e> <s> this is not i think actually a laughing matter <e> <s> it is a very serious matter <e> <s> we need to consider the facts of the case <e> <s> the government are very concerned at the labour partys proposed policy on ending nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i have answered both parts of the noble lords question once in replying to the noble lord lord chalfont and again in replying to the noble lord lord molloy at the beginning of his question <e>", "<cs> my lords under the bbc licence and agreements with the foreign and commonwealth office

external services programmes in the national interest <e> <s> on the matter that the noble lord raises about the broadcasts at the time of the fall of the shah of iran i shall draw attention to that

generalisations of that kind but if the noble lord has some specific point on the broadcasting by the bbc external services to a particular country then he should write to the external services about that <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i thank my noble friend for his kind remarks about the external services <e> <s> on the perry report the review made a number of recommendations to improve the efficiency and effectiveness with which the external services are run including regular reviews both by the foreign and commonwealth office with the bbc of individual services but nothing in the report implied any change in the government-bbc relationship or in its traditional editorial independence <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for the remarks of the noble baroness <e> <s> i believe this is a service which is of enormous value to very many listeners around the world <e>", "<cs> my lords under the terms of their charter the bbc external services are under an obligation to present the news in an impartial way <e> <s> i have already indicated that if there is evidence that if this is not the case then the noble lord should write to the bbc giving the evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am sure the noble lord lord strabolgi is very well aware the amount of money spent on the external services has risen from million annually in to million in and to million in <e> <s> since there has been an increase of about per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords we receive occasional complaints particularly from people who listen abroad <e> <s> on balance i stand by what i said earlier i think the service is much appreciated by an enormous listening audience throughout the world <e> <s> however i shall undertake to draw my noble friends remarks to the attention of the external services department at the bbc because i should not wish it to be thought that this kind of criticism might go unanswered <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank both the noble lord lord cledwyn and the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for their reception of this statement and for their support for the action which the government have taken with regard to syria <e> <s> i have been asked a number of quite specific questions by both noble lords <e> <s> i shall see whether i can give them answers to all the matters that they have raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i am able to give my noble friend that assurance <e> <s> this was one of the matters discussed in a very lengthy meeting <e> <s> it is clearly one of the issues to which my right honourable and learned friend will be returning at the meeting on th november <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly given an assurance to my noble friend that as i indicated earlier we are looking actively at the whole question of diplomatic bags <e> <s> i have noted the important point that he made <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is very important to recognise in what has been said that we believe that we have made useful progress <e> <s> except for greece all the partners share our sense of outrage at the syrian involvement <e> <s> as i indicated they expressed their understanding for the action we have taken <e> <s> it was clear that all the partners were prepared to take further action <e> <s> however in order to get all countries to agree on the same action there will need to be further discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords we are in close contact with our community partners <e> <s> we made our announcements as to what we would do following upon the result of the court case last friday <e> <s> it has been clear over the weekend the action that we have taken <e> <s> i think it is important to understand that progress was made yesterday not as much progress as we might have wished but nevertheless progress was made <e> <s> my right honourable and learned friend wishes to come back at the next meeting on these other matters which i recognise as does the noble lord lord beswick and other noble lords are issues that are extremely important and on which it will be important to reach agreement for common action <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been a number of earlier european community statements on terrorism <e> <s> we have not been asking anything of our partners which has not already been agreed in principle in these statements <e> <s> i should like to draw the attention of the house to them <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite proper that the noble and learned lord should make that point to the house because of course we had to wait until the conclusion of the case before we could take action and that was why the statement was made when it was <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the noble lords last point obviously i take note of what he has said and i shall draw it to the attention of my right honourable and learned friend <e> <s> i apologise to the noble lord for not answering his question about the syrian arab airlines <e> <s> the syrians have themselves ended syrian airline flights to london <e> <s> the noble lord asked <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact of the matter is that no decision has been taken by the twelve on arms sales <e> <s> i assured my noble friend as i assure the noble lord lord stewart that this is clearly a matter to which we attach the greatest importance <e> <s> it is a matter on which we wish to obtain community co-operation to stop arms sales to syria in these circumstances and that is clearly something which will be high on the agenda at the meeting on th november <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the position is that there are arms sales in prospect but the important point is the decision which we hope will be made by all our community partners at the next meeting to ban arms sales <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both the noble lord lord cledwyn and the noble lord lord grimond for their response to this statement <e> <s> i confirm again to both noble lords that we have been very concerned about the conservation of fish stocks <e> <s> i have been conscious that this point has been raised on many occasions by noble lords from all parts of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord campbell of croy for his warm reception of this statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord shackleton for his warm welcome of the statement it is even more welcome because as we know he recommended such a zone in his report published in and no one has been a stronger advocate of it <e> <s> i am glad too that he believes that it has been the right policy to play it slowly <e> <s> we have tried hard to achieve a multilateral regime <e> <s> i am particularly pleased to hear from him that conservationists will welcome this because it is such an important part of the argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly note the important point that the noble lord has made <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the interim conservation zone is co-terminous with the falkland islands protection zone <e> <s> we have claimed up to miles but the actual area that will be licensed and will be patrolled will be of miles radius <e> <s> this is because most of the fishing is done within miles radius and because it is coterminous with the falkland islands protection zone <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to the noble baroness lady lockwood for raising this important issue this evening <e> <s> the link between health and family planning is an important one <e> <s> family planning raises fundamental questions about family life <e> <s> large families are customary throughout the developing world especially in rural areas where a persons status is often measured by the size of his family <e> <s> in africa the population is rising

"<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to start my remarks as i began when moving the third reading of this bill by thanking those such as my noble friend lord reay and the noble lord lord ezra who have supported the bill in this discussion this afternoon <e> <s> also i think that the whole house was very grateful to the noble and learned lord lord wilberforce for his most telling and important intervention <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord banks but to draw his attention to the fact that my right honourable friend the lord privy seal voted for this bill at second reading in another place and of course as he will know from the constitution it would be a collective cabinet decision <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i appreciate the point that my noble friend is making <e> <s> indeed we share her concern <e> <s> in fact along with several other member states we have placed a financial reservation on the european community programme <e> <s> we are making every effort in the present discussions in brussels to avoid any damage to our current youth exchange programme <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and i appreciate the point that my noble friend lady elles is making <e> <s> there has been a cautious welcome in principle to these proposals <e> <s> as i have indicated however many member states including ourselves have reservations about the scope size and cost of the detailed proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i know full well the views of the noble lord lord bruce of donington about expenditure on the cap and he knows full well that the government wish to see the system reformed <e> <s> the issue before us is in fact precisely on youth exchanges and as i have said in response to my noble friend lady carnegy at this early stage of the discussions it is difficult to be precise about the financial implications <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i entirely agree in principle with what my noble friend says <e> <s> we have of course always recognised the important long-term effect of personal contacts between young britons and young europeans <e> <s> youth exchanges are an excellent example of co-operation between the people of the united kingdom and other countries <e> <s> there are many excellent schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we all share the wish of the noble baroness that more of us spoke other foreign languages <e> <s> that is absolutely right <e> <s> i should like to make it quite clear that there are already a number of youth exchanges to europe <e> <s> i believe that in the number of young people who came to the united kingdom totalled and britons went to the european community on such exchanges <e> <s> i share the view of the noble baroness that this is important work and it would certainly assist the people of this country to improve their ability to speak foreign languages <e>", "<cs> my lords the question relates to the measures agreed by the european economic community <e> <s> the question of measures taken by the united states is i think outside the terms of the question <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> we have implemented them and as i am sure the noble and learned lord will be aware from the written answers given to questions in this house on th october we have indicated our view and what has happened on new investment and on tourism <e>", "<cs> my lords the measures apply to south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords the point that my noble friend raised is wide of the question but i can say to him as i have said on many occasions that as a government we wish to see an end to the system of apartheid <e>", "<cs> my lords at brussels the twelve decided to send a further signal to the south african government indicating the need to change <e> <s> the impact of the measures is not only economic it is also a political signal <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer that i gave to the noble lord lord hatch indicates the purpose of the measures that we have agreed to take in conjunction with our community partners <e>", "<cs> my lords the particular point raised by my noble friend is of course wide of the question <e> <s> if he would like to put down a question on that subject <e> <s> i shall try to answer it <e> <s> we have welcomed the steps that the south african government have taken toward ending some aspects of apartheid but we believe that they have been too few and too slow <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord actually asked a question <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that question is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope my noble friend lord gisborough appreciates that in fact i indicated that the south african government had taken a number of steps to break down apartheid <e> <s> we wish that they would move faster and do more <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to interrupt the noble lord lord gladwyn but on a point of factual information as the statement on the interim conservation zone made clear the protection will be done by two

<e>", "<cs> my lords our attitude to any possible motion in the security council is something that we would have to decide when such a resolution appears <e> <s> at present it is a hypothetical question <e>", "<cs> my lords the action of barclays bank is a matter for barclays <e> <s> it is a commercial decision for them <e> <s> as regards the point about whether we were informed in advance we were warned in very general terms <e>", "<cs> my lords the attitude of the british government has been very plain <e> <s> we joined with our community partners in a statement of the measures that we were taking in september <e> <s> on the positive side we have given considerable financial support to the black african community within south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords as a general principle we have taken steps to help black south africans within south africa <e> <s> as regards the particular issue of barclays disinvestment in south africa that of course is a matter for barclays <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of whether a company should disinvest from south africa is a matter for the commercial judgment of companies and not for her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords it is i think for barclays to answer why they took the decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the attitude of the government to south africa and particularly to the policy of apartheid is well known but of course my noble friend makes an important point <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not my business to speak on behalf of barclays and the reasons which led them to the decisions which they have taken and i do not intend to move from that point <e> <s> on the second point that the noble lord lord hatch raised the fact of the matter is that the south african government have taken a number of steps to end apartheid but as i have said to him on many occasions in the past and i say again we think that they have been too few <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the policies of the south african government are again a matter for them but as i have said on many occasions the british government would like to see an end to the system of apartheid <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say well said <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a most interesting debate on a highly technical subject <e> <s> it has given us a useful opportunity to reconsider the functions and needs of the european parliament and indeed of parliamentary bodies in general <e> <s> if i may do so i congratulate all your lordships who have taken in this debate this evening on the careful contribution which each has made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for that point of explanation as to why the particular situation has arisen <e> <s> i think it is certainly something to bear in mind but i will continue with the point that i was making <e> <s> it is essential that the immunity procedures should be accelerated before member states decided on any expansion of the immunities conferred under the protocol <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made our governments position very plain on this matter and my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary will have a further opportunity to raise it when the spanish foreign minister visits london in january <e> <s> so far as nato is concerned the demarcation of the north atlantic treaty organisation command boundaries is a matter for the alliance as a whole and in this case does not arise since spain is not fully integrated into the alliances military structure <e>", "<cs> my lords this matter has been raised on many occasions both at ministerial level and at official level <e> <s> we shall raise it again in january <e> <s> i think that the point that the noble lord makes will not be lost on the spanish government but i think it is appropriate at the present time to see what will be the outcome of the next round of talks <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have explained to the noble lord before we are committed to seeking progress before a comprehensive test ban treaty <e> <s> but any negotiations would need to deal with difficult questions such as scope duration and compliance the key issue being verification <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not the case <e> <s> we suggested as long ago as a non-negotiating mandate for the ad hoc committee at the conference on disarmament but as yet this has not been taken up by the soviet union <e>", "<cs> again my lords the noble lord lord mellish makes an important point <e> <s> we should all like to see movement towards a comprehensive test ban treaty but a limited unilateral gesture as has happened with the soviet union is not a substitute for a long-term agreement with verification <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i have anything further to add to the noble lord lord brockway other than i have already said in answers to questions <e> <s> but i really cannot accept his last statement <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated in the answer that i gave to the noble lord lord jenkins we have suggested a non-negotiating mandate for the ad hoc committee at the conference on disarmament <e> <s> some countries the soviet union and some non-alligned countries are not even prepared to accept this <e> <s> it is a technical matter and it needs to be considered appropriately in that committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the papers which were presented in <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> we believe that these unilateral gestures are not a substitute for long-term durable agreements <e> <s> of course the second point that my noble friend made is important <e>", "<cs> my lords again i think that i answered the noble lord lord mayhew in a written answer earlier this year <e> <s> we are committed to the modernisation of an independent nuclear deterrent and we shall take steps to ensure this as of course have previous governments <e> <s> the fact is that while there are no prospects of negotiations on a comprehensive test ban treaty it is a hypothetical question to link the two <e>", "<cs> my lords of course major european states consult closely and it is sensible that they should do so <e> <s> for example weu member countries recently agreed procedures to increase consultation on security and disarmament issues in order to strengthen the european contribution to the alliance <e> <s> there is no question of a formalised inner group <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the point made by the noble lord lord cledwyn <e> <s> i do not believe that i can add to the supplementary answer which i gave to the noble lord lord kennet <e> <s> we do consult european states regularly and closely <e> <s> as i indicated the weu recently agreed procedures to increase consultation on security and disarmament issues which strengthens the european contribution to the alliance <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the point that the noble lord makes <e> <s> there is a difference between regular consultations between all the european partners of the nato alliance and a triumvirate of three countries which i believe lies behind the question of the noble lord lord kennet <e> <s> in answering the question i sought to deal with the specific point that he raised <e> <s> however i can assure the noble lord lord cledwyn that there is regular and frequent consultation between the european partners of the alliance as i indicated earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that point <e> <s> my right honourable friend the prime minister and president reagan agreed at camp david on the way forward in arms control identified as priorities an inf agreement per cent <e> <s> strategic cuts and a ban on chemical weapons and confirmed that the alliance strategy would continue to require effective nuclear deterrence <e> <s> reductions in nuclear weapons will increase the importance of eliminating disparities in conventional forces <e> <s> our main european allies have since told us of their full support for the outcome of the discussion between my right honourable friend the prime minister and president reagan <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot accept that interpretation of the events <e> <s> as i have indicated to my noble friend it was very valuable that my right honourable friend the prime minister had this opportunity to discuss with president reagan the way forward on arms control one of a number of meetings that she has held <e>", "<cs> my lords again i think i have answered the point that the noble baroness raises <e> <s> the europeans are committed to maintaining the solidarity of the atlantic alliance <e> <s> there are regular exchanges of views between the european members as there are between the european members and the united states <e> <s> we believe that these exchanges improve discussion in the alliance and strengthen the transatlantic bond <e>", "<cs> my lords we share many of the concerns that have been expressed by monsieur chirac <e> <s> we welcome his support for the text which my right honourable friend the prime minister agreed last month with president reagan at camp david and we concur wholeheartedly in his emphasis on the importance of nuclear deterrence and the role of the british and french nuclear forces <e> <s> we welcome in particular his assertion that <e>", "<cs> my lords i can hardly blame the noble lord for trailing his coat in that way but he would agree that his question is quite wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not think that i can accept that statement from my noble friend particularly in view of the answers that i have given <e> <s> we would all agree that my right honourable friend the prime minister and my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary in discussions in the case of my right honourable friend the prime minister with president reagan and in the case of my right honourable and learned friend in many fora around the world have effectively put both british and european policy and have had the effect of influencing the outcome of the discussions which have taken place <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i take the point of the noble lord lord chalfont <e> <s> one of the considerations is our own security and the importance of our own independent nuclear deterrent <e>", "<cs> my lords in my answer to the noble lords first supplementary question i made it clear that there was no question of any formalised inner group <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with what my noble friend said <e> <s> i believe that the right of freedom to choose the education for ones child is very important <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcintosh would not expect me to agree with the second part of his question <e> <s> to talk about education in those emotive terms helps neither the pupils nor the education system of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a very useful short debate on this bill <e> <s> i am sure that we have listened with very great interest to those noble lords who have spoken from extensive personal experience as trustees of the chevening estate <e> <s> i was particularly interested to hear the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale say that he felt that lord stanhope would have approved of the bill and also what the noble lord lord hirshfield had to say speaking from his long experience as a trustee <e>", "<cs> my lords the new procedures which are to be introduced by the commission will speed up the provision of food aid at all stages and emergency needs are to be given priority <e>", "<cs> my lords the features of these reforms are not in themselves designed to reduce food surpluses which is a separate matter and separately under consideration <e> <s> as i indicated in my original answer the object of these reforms is to meet the needs of developing countries rather than for the system to become a means for the disposal of surplus food and so that food aid should be better integrated with other forms of community development assistance <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes an important point about food surpluses <e> <s> i am sure he will be aware that within the european community we have been a leading nation in trying to get a reform of the common agricultural policy which among other matters leads at the present moment to the creation of these large surpluses <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be a very interesting question but i believe that the noble lord will agree that it is wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> if he cares to put down a question on that subject i shall do my best to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes a very important point <e> <s> on balance we would agree that the existence of surpluses may damage agriculture in developing countries <e> <s> there are mitigating factors for example importing to developing countries food at cheap prices <e> <s> however the surpluses can do economic damage to producer countries as the recent world bank studies have shown <e>", "<cs> my lords i make three points to the noble lord in answer to that question <e> <s> the question of recognition does not arise <e> <s> as a matter of fact a system of courts exists in namibia as part of south africas administration of that territory <e> <s> we do not recognise that south africa has any right to continue to administer namibia <e> <s> i can confirm the point that my honourable friend mrs chalker made <e> <s> we do not intervene during the course of judicial proceedings in namibia or elsewhere and that has been the policy of successive governments <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord it is a matter of principle <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that we continually make clear our concern about human rights issues in namibia to the south african authorities both privately and publicly and we shall continue to follow the situation there closely <e> <s> on the issue of security council resolution we are of course fully committed to this and we continue to support both the united states and the united nations negotiations which are aimed at implementing that plan <e>", "<cs> my lords when proceedings have been concluded that will be a separate matter <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that that is the case and that we have condemned violations of human rights wherever they may occur <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated in answering the question of the noble lord lord cledwyn we have supported both the united states and the united nations in working towards the full implementation of security council resolution <e> <s> however i confirm to the noble lord that it would be quite wrong to suggest that we have some unique responsibility for achieving namibian independence <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood the noble lords point the first time he made it <e> <s> i have given him an answer as a matter of fact concerning what the situation is and has been under successive governments <e>", "<cs> my lords as my original answer indicated we have taken all the steps that we can bilaterally in concert with our european partners and at the united nations to make our position clear <e> <s> in we co-sponsored the relevant resolutions on human rights in iran adopted by the united nations commission on human rights including that of appointing a special representative for iran <e> <s> we shall continue to take all suitable opportunities to press for improvements in human rights on the issues raised by the noble viscount as well as on others <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we shall continue to take all the opportunities we can to press <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has raised an important point <e> <s> however i think that it is outside the terms of the original question <e> <s> if he cares to put down a question on that subject i shall be happy to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to speak on behalf of the united states government <e> <s> however i believe that if the noble lord looks at their record he will find that they too have condemned violations of human rights wherever they occur <e>", "<cs> my lords when an improvement takes place it is always difficult to show whether it has happened because of representations made from outside <e> <s> however i make it clear that we have condemned violations of human rights wherever they have occurred <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the latter point is an interesting one and perhaps i may write to the noble lord on the subject <e> <s> i have no detailed information as regards the other matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the concern which lies behind the supplementary question of the noble lord <e> <s> the truth of the matter is that no official permission is required to open an office or to move to new premises as it is not a diplomatic or an official mission <e> <s> as i have indicated it does not therefore enjoy any official status or immunities <e> <s> of course if the organisation breaks the law we will not hesitate to act if there is evidence of illegal activity <e>", "<cs> my lords as the government have made clear on a number of occasions the plo as such is not a terrorist organisation though several of its component organisations have a deplorable terrorist record <e> <s> the plo is an umbrella organisation expressing the aspiration of thousands of palestinians to secure their legitimate rights <e>", "<cs> my lords i must make it plain that the government have not been responsible in any way for establishing this independent office <e> <s> this is a matter for the plo and although i take the point that the noble lord made i think we have to face the fact that in a free and democratic society such as ours any organisation may maintain an office here so long as its activities remain within the law <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mayhew made two points <e> <s> the first point is a matter of fact <e> <s> on the second point he will be well aware of government policy <e> <s> i should say to him that the terms of the question are very tightly drawn about the office of the plo <e> <s> i think the noble lords second supplementary is wide of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords again i take the noble baronesss point about all this but i must make it plain to her that in the move of this office no official permission was required <e> <s> as for the use of the particular house the office must comply with the local boroughs planning regulations <e> <s> any kind of irregular use which conflicts with them would be a matter for kensington and chelsea borough council <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord paget should recognise that the plo has had an office in london since <e> <s> i would not accept if he comes to look at my answers in <e>", "<cs> my lords the short answer to the noble lord lord cledwyn is that my department was not consulted <e> <s> there was no reason why it should be consulted <e> <s> as i have explained it is open to any organisation to establish an office in london and if in the course of its activities it breaks the law then of course it will be prosecuted <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course the duty of the police to maintain law and order <e> <s> i have no doubt that my right honourable friend the home secretary will see that if an offence is committed there will be a prosecution <e> <s> of course there would be police protection were this to be asked for or were it to be necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not absolutely sure that i have the question that the noble lord has asked but in fact the plo has had an office in london since <e> <s> the reason behind this particular question on the order paper is the fact that it has moved its office to another address <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped that in my answers to earlier questions i had made the position of the government plain <e> <s> i understand the concern that has been expressed and i have the point that the noble lord raised in his first supplementary but as i have explained this was not a move which required official permission <e> <s> as for the allegation that the house has now become an armed fortress this of course is a matter the alteration to the structure of the house or the lights and all these other matters for the local boroughs planning regulations <e> <s> it is for it to enforce those if it believes that these developments are contrary to the regulations which exist in that part of kensington <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said earlier the plo has had an office in london since <e> <s> the point of the question is the move of the office <e> <s> if the noble lord looks carefully in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount for that piece of information <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we all recognise what the hong kong government have done in this particular circumstance <e> <s> i am aware of the letter from miss dunn from hong kong expressing concern over the vietnamese problem <e> <s> as i indicated we are looking for ways of solving this and thereby easing the burden on hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely appreciate the point that the noble lord makes <e> <s> in fact over extra resettlement places were secured as a result of the united kingdoms decision to accept some more family reunion cases <e> <s> we are very grateful for the other countries responses and we hope that they will continue to do what they can to help <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that the total figures for refugees in hong kong are both in the closed and in the open camps <e> <s> in refugees were resettled from hong kong including in the united kingdom <e> <s> arrivals totalled which was a sharp increase but the total refugee population fell from to at the end of the year <e> <s> as i indicated we have accepted refugees in this country <e> <s> that has set an example to others and we are grateful for the numbers that they have taken <e> <s> in answer to the noble lords last point of course we shall get an answer on this matter as soon as we can <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the point that the noble baroness has made and i will draw it to the attention of my right honourable and learned friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i think our record on this matter is a good one and we have in fact accepted into this country some thousands of refugees <e> <s> furthermore we do not examine newly arriving boat people in hong kong in order to determine whether they are refugees under the terms of the convention <e> <s> we <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been very concerned about the situation on human rights in vietnam and that continues to be one of the problems which is causing the outflow of refugees <e>", "<cs> my lords we have accepted nearly indo-chinese including from hong kong <e> <s> we took a further from hong kong last year and we have used this initiative to encourage other countries <e> <s> we are considering actively what more might be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all your lordships who have taken part in this debate and indeed for the very wide welcome that this bill has received from all parts of the house <e> <s> as is only to be expected on this occasion all those who have spoken have done so from a great wealth of personal knowledge on this subject <e> <s> that has shown the importance and value of this bill <e> <s> as my noble friend lord cranbrook said in the course of his remarks i have been asked an enormous number of questions <e> <s> i shall do my best to answer them but i can assure your lordships that i shall carefully read <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that because we are at present in the process of establishing these marine nature reserves within the three-mile limit we do not yet have the scientific data available to make a reliable assessment of whether a marine nature reserve is needed between three and miles <e> <s> that is why the power is in the bill to make such a reserve by order in council <e> <s> however i take the point made by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it it would be possible but not by virtue of this bill <e> <s> i think that it would be something that could be done separately <e> <s> if i am not correct on that point i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords under this bill we do not intend to extend the provisions to the dependencies <e> <s> that would require another bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the answer to that is that this bill is not concerned with what might be the regime within the three-to -mile limit to which we are now extending but with extending the limit itself <e> <s> as regards the specific point that she has raised if i may i shall write to her if there is something further i can say but i think that the way i have described it is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i am unable to give the noble baroness the information that she requires because i cannot predict the timetable before the outcome of the court hearing and any appeal are known <e>", "<cs> my lords the position is exactly as i stated it in my original answer <e> <s> we all hope that the irish government will ratify the single european act as soon as it is legally possible for them to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lord is that an individual irish citizen mr crotty has challenged the single european act on the grounds that it substantially extends the scope of the community treaties without it being possible for the courts to review the constitutionality of council acts taken under the single act once it enters into force <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not at present in a position to reach definite conclusions about marion island <e> <s> we shall however continue to watch developments <e>", "<cs> my lords we all greatly mourn the death of the noble lord lord crowther-hunt <e> <s> concerning the questions the noble lord lord hatch asked the south african government have asserted that they are considering the construction of an airstrip on marion island solely for civilian purposes namely fisheries protection air-sea rescue and movement of scientific personnel based on the island <e> <s> so far as concerns the israelis there has been no official israeli comment <e> <s> we understand that the state department of the united states has answered questions by describing press reports as highly speculative <e> <s> referring to the question of the so-called test in despite much speculation there has been no conclusive evidence that a flash detected by a united states satellite in was a nuclear test as was alleged at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that the noble lord will recall that splendid programme yes minister in which the foreign office was asked where the island was <e> <s> i can show him on a map <e> <s> it is just over miles south-east of south africa <e> <s> i am sure that if he looks at a map that is where he will find it <e>", "<cs> my lords the position concerning the antarctic treaty is not quite as the noble lord has described it because the treaty does not cover marion island <e> <s> south africa exercises sovereignty over marion island and therefore it does not provide a basis for raising any questions with regard to the signatories of the treaty <e> <s> so far as concerns approaching the south africans we are ready to consider doing so if there are further developments which justify such an approach <e> <s> but at the present time there is very little to go on and in any case we have regularly urged the south african government to adhere to the non-proliferation treaty which should provide the necessary reassurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord has said <e> <s> as he will be aware we remain in close contact with the americans on a wide range of issues concerning south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords marion island is part of the sovereign territory of south africa <e> <s> i answer questions because these are matters which can be raised in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord puts in a different form the question which he asked earlier <e> <s> i can only say that my clear advice is that the antarctic treaty does not cover marion island <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that most helpful reply <e> <s> i am sure it is one which will be widely welcomed in the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm to the noble lord that we have made clear to the south african government that they should keep to the non <e>", "<cs> my lords let me start by making clear the position of the government on this matter which is not quite as the noble lord suggested in his supplementary question that is that we shall consider whether to approach the south africans in the light of further developments <e> <s> i cannot comment on press reports of what it may or may not have been alleged was said or took place in washington <e>", "<cs> my lords i really cannot add anything to the answers that i have already given <e>", "<cs> my lords these matters were discussed with the spanish authorities <e> <s> we entirely take the point made by my noble friend but we no longer think it appropriate to have a military guard at the frontier between two community partners and nato allies <e> <s> we very much hope that the spanish authorities will take the same view <e>", "<cs> my lords the use of the airport is one of the matters which is currently being discussed between ourselves and the spanish government <e> <s> we have not yet come to any conclusions although we should like to make progress on this as we should on other matters <e>", "<cs> my lords on the contrary we have made our position absolutely plain <e> <s> we stand by the preamble to the constitution <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that it is valuable that parliamentarians from both the british and spanish parliaments should meet to discuss these matters <e> <s> they may come to a greater understanding of each others viewpoints <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always difficult for a british minister to speak on behalf of another government as regards their views <e> <s> however i am quite sure that if my noble friend who is so wise on so many matters reflects upon this he will no doubt see that the spanish authorities also have their political difficulties over the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> we very much hope that these matters of the ceremonial guard and the use of the air space will be resolved <e> <s> that would create an atmosphere of greater confidence which would be helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords president sassounguesso paid a working visit to the united kingdom from th to th february in his capacity as chairman of the organisation of african unity <e> <s> the president was received by her majesty the queen and met my right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> talks were also held with senior government ministers and with leaders of the opposition parties <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that we welcome the visit by president sassounguesso and his party <e> <s> very useful and friendly discussions were held both on african issues and on matters of bilateral concern <e> <s> on the question of the road that my noble friend mentioned i can only say to him that projects cannot be looked at in isolation from broader aspects of the imf programme agreed with the government of the congo and congos overall external debt <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will understand details of my right honourable friend the prime ministers conversation must remain confidential but i understand that my right honourable friend said that while it is of course for the people of south africa to work out their own future those wanting progress in south africa should focus their attention on practical steps to bring about a dialogue <e> <s> such steps might include for example laying groundwork for a constitutional conference attended by all political and racial groups in south africa <e> <s> the noble lord will therefore see that there was no question of discussing this with our community partners <e>", "<cs> my lords i of course note with interest the point that the noble lord makes about his partys support for such a conference <e> <s> i have explained the position and this was one of the matters that president sassou-nguesso noted in the course of his talks <e> <s> but i ought to make it clear that from the point of view of the government there is no united kingdom initiative to propose such a conference <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord lord hatch should recognise what my right honourable friend the prime minister has done in regard to these friendly and useful meetings on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> in moving amendment no <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning said that he would speak to both his amendments <e> <s> with the leave of the committee i shall take advantage of this opportunity and reply to both amendments at the same time <e> <s> i was very glad to hear from the noble and learned lord that he supports the purpose of the bill <e> <s> i have studied with great care the amendments that he has put down and i hope i can show that we can cover the points he has raised <e> <s> perhaps i may also say that i am grateful for what my noble friend lord campbell of croy has just said because i agree with his interpretation of the bill <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble and learned lord will consider very carefully before he decides to press this amendment <e> <s> i hope that i have explained the position <e> <s> i should like to make clear my firm advice on this point that international law covers the new limits <e> <s> it does not lay down the extent of this limit in each case <e> <s> as i said at second reading almost all countries have recognised a -mile limit <e> <s> if we were to go down the path that the noble and learned lord is suggesting we would be doing something which we have not felt it necessary to do under the three-mile limit <e> <s> we do not therefore see any reason for doing this on a -mile limit because the same arguments that apply to the three mile limit will apply to the l-mile limit <e> <s> we should therefore be creating other complications within the bill <e> <s> perhaps i may remind the committee that the bill was welcomed on all sides of the house <e> <s> it has been a matter on which we have wished to legislate for some considerable time and its purpose is to extend the territorial limits <e> <s> it is not concerned with the regime within those limits <e>", "<cs> may i say at once to my noble friend lord campbell of croy that i share entirely the aim which lies behind the amendment that he has moved <e> <s> i should like to give him and indeed the noble lord lord cledwyn the assurance that our intention is to bring the whole act into force at the same time subject to the making of any necessary secondary legislation to deal with technical matters <e> <s> in practice i am advised that this is likely to take place some two months after royal assent <e> <s> i would therefore hope that it would be well before january <e> <s> that is the point that both my noble friend lord campbell and the noble lord lord cledwyn wanted to hear <e> <s> i hope very much that that will be the case <e> <s> it is not in any event dependent upon what might happen over the channel tunnel <e> <s> the bill stands on its own <e> <s> i can give that assurance <e>", "<cs> may i say in response to the amendment that has been moved by the noble baroness lady white that i am very glad of the opportunity to make clear that the proposed power by order in council to extend the area for marine nature reserves is not intended to be restrictive <e> <s> of course in preparation for this committee stage i did look again at what the noble baroness lady white had said at second reading as well as my noble friend lord cranbrook and the noble lord lord cledwyn and i understand their concern <e> <s> what i believe the noble baroness said in moving her amendment i did make a note of her words is that she did not think that at the present time there was any immediate prospect of designating nature reserves outside the three-mile limit <e> <s> indeed my understanding is that the nature conservancy council itself is not pressing for the immediate extension proposed in the amendment <e> <s> the fact is that as she herself said an extension may be needed later on and we share the noble baronesss quite justifiable concern for conservation but we believe that it is prudent to await more information on the three-to -mile area before extending the limits <e>", "<cs> the noble earl lord cranbrook will know i am sure far better than i do myself because he is very familiar with the detail of this that there has been much discussion on the nature reserves within the three-mile limit <e> <s> there are many matters that need to be considered <e> <s> i do not in any way wish to make some excruciating pun about going into difficult waters but i believe fishing is one of the issues that need to be considered in relation to this <e> <s> one therefore has to get agreement from a number of people before a nature reserve can be established <e> <s> we have not yet got agreement within the three-mile limit <e> <s> when it is thought suitable when at least an area is identified for a nature reserve in the three- to -mile limit then of course we can look at that but we have not yet reached that position <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add further to what i said earlier on <e> <s> the fact is that the wildlife and countryside act of was drafted with inshore and coastal waters in mind <e> <s> the machinery which was developed to consider the proposals for marine nature reserves may not be appropriate for areas lying in the wider limit <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will understand that there may be serious complications both in shipping and in fishing to resolve in administering reserves in the more distant areas issues which we have not really considered fully <e> <s> as she will know in consideration of marine nature reserves it is necessary to balance all the interests the needs of conservation but also the rights of access of community fishermen between six and miles and the right of unimpeded innocent passage of foreign vessels which are more likely to make use of deeper waters <e>", "<cs> i very much hope that i have made the position plain <e> <s> i am most grateful once again for the intervention by my noble friend lord campbell of croy <e> <s> the fact is that the arrangements in the schedule apply within the three miles but the position is not quite the same between three miles and miles <e> <s> for example the water is deeper there are more ships and there are more fishermen <e> <s> the situation is different outside and therefore there would be different machinery <e> <s> other pieces of legislation come into play <e> <s> at the risk of being thought not to have any common sense and bearing in mind that we all want the bill perhaps i may suggest that what the noble baroness lady white would like is possible <e> <s> i hope that she will accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords nuclear arms control is an aim we can all endorse in one form or another <e> <s> no one questions the catastrophic effects of the use of nuclear weapons a point made by the right reverend prelate the bishop of mancehster no democratic state would wish to spend money unnecessarily on <e>", "<cs> my lords no i am not giving way <e> <s> i listened with great care to others and time is limited <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord had followed what i was saying and from his observation it does not appear that he did he would realise that the point i made is that nuclear weapons have made a contribution towards giving us the longest period of peace in europe this century and indeed in europe as a whole for centuries <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will not interrupt me and will let me finish my argument <e> <s> that is apart from the fact that america is within nato <e> <s> that is what i was talking about and that is what i was referring to <e> <s> nuclear weapons of course have not been used in central america or anywhere else <e>", "<cs> my lords the government welcome the statement by mr gorbachev for three reasons first it accepts the alliances idea of the zero option secondly the soviet leadership appears to have broken the link between inf and sdi and thirdly it makes no reference to the independent nuclear deterrents of both the united kingdom and france <e> <s> we shall of course want to look carefully at the fine print in mr gorbachevs statement <e>", "<cs> my lords although i cannot anticipate what my right honourable friend the prime minister will say when she gets to moscow i have no doubt that arms control will form a part of her talks <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not in any sense accept the noble lords last remark about what my right honourable friend the prime minister said after reykjavik <e> <s> i can only confirm what i have already said to the noble lord lord mellish <e> <s> i have no doubt that arms control talks and a follow up from this initiative will form part of the discussions that my right honourable friend will hold in moscow <e>", "<cs> my lords although i welcome the first part of the noble lords response to the supplementary answer that i gave earlier we note with less satisfaction the continued soviet harping on a nuclear-free world <e> <s> as my right honourable friend the prime minister has often stated our security will continue to rest on deterrence for the foreseeable future and this applies to nuclear weapons in europe as much as elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord should look carefully at <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated we welcome the statement that has been made particularly because it accepts the idea of a zero option and has broken the link between inf and sdi <e> <s> that is of course only one form of arms control <e> <s> there are other fora in which we should also like to see progress <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will be aware that following the meeting with president reagan at camp david last november three priorities were set up cuts in inf per cent <e> <s> cuts in the start programme and a complete ban on chemical weapons all with effective verification <e> <s> these were endorsed in december by nato ministers <e> <s> indeed if it were possible to agree on such priorities it would be an historic achievement <e> <s> we welcome the present proposals because they refer to one section of the matters which were agreed at camp david <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not absolutely sure of the question that the noble lord has in mind but it may be helpful for him to know that we expect the united states to explore in detail the implications of mr gorbachevs statement during the remaining days of the current round of the geneva nuclear and space talks which are due to end on th march <e> <s> we shall be doing the same in our contacts with the russians leading to my right honourale friends visit later this month <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very glad to hear from my noble friend lord campbell of croy that this was a probing amendment <e> <s> the reception it has received from the noble and learned lord lord silkin and from others of your lordships who have spoken indicates that they see it in that light <e> <s> i hope that i can give my noble friend the assurances that he requires <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble and learned lord lord denning has indicated that in putting down these two amendments at report they are probing amendments <e> <s> i listened with care to what the noble and learned lord lord silkin said in supporting the amendments as probing amendments <e> <s> i hope that i can give both noble and learned lords the explanation that they require <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to assure the noble lord that the debate which my right honourable and learned friend foreshadowed two years ago and which the noble lord mentioned in his question has been in progress since that time and is continuing and that political decisions have not been pre-empted by the march of technology <e> <s> the political parameters were set out at camp david in december <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do not interpret the abm treaty and have never done so <e> <s> we welcomed the conduct of the sdi research programme within the restricted interpretation <e> <s> the united states is consulting its allies on the implications of a move to a broad interpretation which it as signatory to the treaty believes is fully justified <e> <s> we hope that the two signatories will discuss any difficulties through the established mechanisms <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a hypothetical question which i cannot answer <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> what we should all like to see is serious negotiation on lower levels of arms <e>", "<cs> my lords i made the governments position quite plain and i indicated what view we take <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments position on sdi is that we are supporting the research programme <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord looks to see what i said in answer to a question yesterday from the noble lord lord molloy i am quite sure that he will know exactly what the governments position is on what mr gorbachev said two days ago <e>", "<cs> my lords we regret that the initiatives that we have supported in the united nations european community and other fora have not brought about a ceasefire or a negotiated settlement <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we wish to see an end to this wasteful and destabilising conflict <e> <s> discussions continue between the un secretary-general and the un security council aimed at achieving a negotiated end to the conflict <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly not the wish of the british government to be drawn into the war at all <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware of the allegations concerning the activities of the iranian military procurement offices in london <e> <s> our understanding is that the organisation from britain of arms sales to iran is not illegal unless the goods <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it would be right for me to comment on the policy of the american government with regard to their sale of arms or any of the subsequent consequences <e>", "<cs> my lords our view on arms supplies to iran and doing deals with those holding hostages is well known <e> <s> i do not think it is right for me to comment on any other aspects of the american governments policies <e>", "<cs> my lords our policy on defence sales to iran is well known and as part of our scrupulously maintained impartiality in the conflict we refuse to sell to either side defence equipment which will significantly enhance the capability to prolong or exacerbate the conflict <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may answer that supplementary question by saying that following publication of the tower commission report the united states government have assured us that there are no blowpipes in contra hands and that there is no us intention to supply blowpipe to the contras <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will know that it is not our practice to discuss details of arms sales <e> <s> so far as the kms company is concerned of course it is a commercial organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords let me put the answer to the noble lords question in this way the united states government are fully aware of our views on the diversion of arms to the contras and a no-transfer clause would serve no useful purpose <e> <s> with regard to other no-transfer clauses it is not the governments policy to comment on the details of contracts relating to individual arms sales to particular countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the point that the noble lord made in the preface to his question but i should not have answered it if we were not satisfied with the procedures <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the point that the noble lord is making <e> <s> i think that i answered his question in an earlier point that i made <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will know we are of course aware of the report on which i think his question is based <e> <s> we understand that the united states has not changed its assessment of the abm radar on the basis of that report <e> <s> our position on krasnoyarsk is well known to the house <e> <s> the noble lord would not expect me to comment on the first part of his question <e> <s> serious questions with regard to compliance are raised <e> <s> i understand that the united states administration have raised the matter with the soviet authorities on various occasions <e> <s> the united states authorities have not received a satisfactory reply <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord cledwyn will be well aware of our view of the interpretation of the abm treaty <e> <s> it may be helpful to remind the house yet again of what my right <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to details of the soviet strategic defence research programme i cannot add anything to the answer that was given by my noble friend lord trefgarne on th december <e> <s> it is in the light of these activities that the united kingdom supports and participates in the us sdi research programme <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always unwise to answer questions of that nature in words of one syllable <e> <s> as the noble lord lord kennet will appreciate they are extremely complex <e> <s> i can only say that it is too early to give any definite views of soviet actions over radars <e> <s> our own view on compliance of soviet actions with treaty obligations is well known <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall certainly make the point of verification on every occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not think that it would be appropriate for a third state to intervene in a bilateral dispute between two other states except with the consent of both of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the concern of the noble lord lord cledwyn when he asks that particular supplementary question <e> <s> however i do not feel that i can add anything further to the answer which i gave to the earlier question by the noble lord lord cledwyn namely that we have no locus in interpreting the abm treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords the icj is competent to settle disputes about interpretation of treaties but it has jurisdiction only in particular cases if both parties have agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first place there has not been any arms control agreement which has ever been submitted to the icj and although the united states has recently withdrawn its acceptance of <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of boring the house yet further i can say only that we are not a party to the treaty and our views on it are well known to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord lord molloy i do not think i can say anything other than the points that i have already made to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very interesting piece of information which the noble lord lord kennet has put to the house <e> <s> however it does not detract in any way from the original answer which i gave to his first supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords how the american government voted is a matter for them <e> <s> i have said what the policy of this government is namely to vote in the international and financial institutions only on economic and technical grounds <e> <s> we of course keep up pressure on the chilean government in the appropriate fora for example in the united nations on the question of human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already given the answer to the question that the noble lord lord molloy has asked in answer to his noble friends original question <e> <s> i would not describe the government of chile as a terrorist organisation it is a military government <e> <s> we have made plain on a number of occasions that we oppose violations of human rights wherever they occur <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of the loan was to help the chilean economy <e> <s> we believe that a strong economy is in the interests of all the chilean people <e> <s> naturally on giving the loan the financial institutions will make quite sure that both the technical and the economic criteria are met <e> <s> however it may be of interest to the noble lord to know that in <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given the reasons for our vote in this particular case but let me say that we have supported moves to re-establish fundamental human rights in chile <e> <s> we voted in favour of critical resolutions on chile at the united nations in and and in and at the united nations commission of human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords we and our community partners have frequently made plain our concern about human rights and abuses and the continuation of violence in chile <e> <s> indeed we have condemned violence from all quarters including the attack on the president <e>", "<cs> my lords i have set out the governments policy on this matter on many occasions <e> <s> i have answered the noble lords question on the order paper <e> <s> if i may say so it is really an own goal in view of what mr gorbachev has said <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord gladwyn has asked me a question in similar terms on many occasions <e> <s> i agree that he has hitched this particular one to a recent press report <e> <s> however the position cannot be other than i have stated it namely that we have no <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord mellish <e> <s> in his statement mr gorbachev delinked sdi from negotiations on inf <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be difficult for me to answer my noble friends question in the form it was put <e> <s> however it has been demonstrated by sdi that progress can be made if both sides adopt a reasonable attitude to negotiations <e> <s> it is clear that the link between inf and sdi is unreasonable and it is totally unreasonable to ask the united states to drop sdi research when russias activities into bmd research would continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord cledwyn for his support of our response to what mr gorbachev has said <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord would expect me to go into detail about what my right honourable friend will say when she visits moscow in april <e> <s> however i have no doubt at all that there will be discussions on arms control talks <e> <s> as regards our relations with the united states we discuss these matters regularly with the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> the position is that mr gorbachev has suggested that there can be the zero-zero option on inf <e> <s> in his recent statement mr gorbachev made it clear that that was not dependent on the united states giving up its research into sdi <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord chalfont puts the position very clearly <e> <s> the answer to the first two parts of his question is yes <e> <s> as i indicated earlier i think that the question on the order paper has been overtaken by events <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord jenkins is quite mistaken if he thinks that there is any disagreement in the government about the part that britain is playing in the research programme on sdi <e> <s> a number of british firms are taking part in the programme and i believe that there is much to be said for our keeping in the forefront of technology <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lords question is outside the terms of the question on the order paper <e> <s> however i can confirm that we and the french were glad that when mr gorbachev made his proposals he did not refer to either the british or the french independent nuclear deterrent <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords question is based on a completely false premise <e> <s> my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary and my right honourable friend the prime minister are entirely agreed on this matter that is to say that britain is taking part in the research programme into sdi which is what the americans are doing <e> <s> no one at all is talking about or taking part in deployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to confirm that mr terry waite was indeed the envoy of the most reverend primate the archbishop of canterbury and that there is no truth in the allegations that have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the right reverend prelate for his question <e> <s> i entirely agree with what he has said and i think that view will be shared by all of your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords the precise timing of the third united nations special session on disarmament due to be held in will be decided by the general assembly in the autumn <e> <s> it would be premature to predict what proposals we may put forward <e> <s> our overall approach will be positive and constructive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the conclusions of the first conference <e> <s> it is too early to say what if any british initiatives may be appropriate at a possible third conference <e> <s> the attitudes we may take and the attitudes of those attending the special session will be influenced by a variety of factors <e> <s> negotiations and discussions on arms control issues bilateral and multilateral are currently under way in a number of fora <e> <s> the progress of those negotiations and the general state of east-west relations are bound to have an effect on the climate of the special session <e> <s> it would therefore be futile to speculate at this stage on what specific proposals may be appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords the date of the conference has yet to be determined by the next session of the united nations in the autumn of this year <e> <s> it is too soon to give the names of the united kingdom representatives to a conference the date of which is not yet fixed <e>", "<cs> my lords as i hope i indicated when i answered the original question from the noble lord lord brockway it is too soon to say what if any british initiatives may be appropriate <e> <s> clearly that will depend on a number of factors including the international climate which may pertain in the run-up to any special session <e> <s> i can confirm that the government are approaching this event in a positive forward-looking manner <e> <s> the subject of his second supplementary is wide of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords as is usual the whole house has listened with appreciation to the common-sense point of view put by the noble lord lord mellish <e>", "<cs> yes i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> we all admire the sincerity of the noble lord lord brockway even if we do not agree with his opinions <e> <s> speaking for myself should i live to such an age as he i hope that i have that amount of energy to put the causes in which i believe <e>", "<cs> i can assure the noble lord that our aim will be to ensure that the meeting focuses on measures which might make realistic and concrete contributions to the arms control and disarmament processes <e> <s> i have no doubt that in the course of the run-up to the special session should it take place there will be opportunities to make the views of your lordships known <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that st april is the deadline <e> <s> if i am incorrect in that information i shall let the noble lord lord graham know <e> <s> however the fact is that the united nations general assembly meeting last autumn recommended that this years unga should identify a time during when the special session might be held <e> <s> it is therefore by no means clear what that date would be <e> <s> i do not believe that the noble lord lord hatch expects me to agree with his second statement <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting question but quite wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord molloy is anticipating the debate which will follow questions today when that issue and others i think will arise and there will be an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we should all like to thank my noble friend lord home for introducing this important and timely debate this afternoon <e> <s> he spoke if i may say so with his usual wisdom and clarity <e> <s> i should also like to add my congratulations to the noble and gallant lord lord bramall <e> <s> we all listened with great interest to what he speaking as an expert had to say we support his remarks about the importance and role of the british services <e> <s> we hope that we shall hear from him on many occasions in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord lord kennet but i really do not think that i can allow his description of what has happened to contadora to pass without comment <e> <s> i went to represent the british government at the european community central american contadora group meeting in guatemala about three weeks ago and agreed political and economic communiques were signed on both counts <e> <s> the british governments policy has been one of continual support for contadora and we hope very much that the process will continue <e> <s> it is continuing <e>", "<cs> my lords this has indeed been a timely and valuable debate <e> <s> it comes on the eve of the visit of my right honourable friend the prime minister to moscow <e> <s> i am sure that she will take with her the good wishes and support of all those who have an interest in building an understanding between the soviet union and the free world <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we shall both have to look at <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that there was no meeting between my right honourable friend the prime minister and mr casey and colonel north and i am glad to make that confirmation <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that a bilateral meeting is a bilateral meeting and the meeting is between representatives of the usa and the ussr <e> <s> the north atlantic treaty organisation provides the means by which the united states and its allies can hold regular consultations on arms control and other matters <e>", "<cs> my lords this is too important a matter to make jokes about <e> <s> i am not making jokes i am setting out the position as it is <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord had listened to my two speeches yesterday afternoon in the <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a little difficult to comment on a report which i have not seen for myself but we have welcomed the statement of mr gorbachev in introducing again the idea of the zero option and made the point that he was not including the independent nuclear deterrent of great britain and france <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not wish in any sense to speak for my noble friend lord carrington <e> <s> suffice it to say that the consultations that take place do so within nato <e> <s> the discussions on arms control take place between representatives of the united states and the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes two very good points <e>", "<cs> my lords as i made quite plain in yesterday afternoons debate we now have a new situation in which we are actually talking about a possible reduction in armaments <e> <s> our contribution is through the influence which we bring to bear on the americans who are party to these negotiations <e> <s> we shall make our influence felt wherever it is possible to do that <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> my noble friend makes a good point <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos and the noble lord lord gladwyn for their reception of the statement <e>", "<cs> it will be a bicameral legislature <e> <s> the legislative council will be by direct elections which we propose should take place in april or may with as under the present constitution the executive council being drawn from the legislative council <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord pitt for his reception of the statement <e> <s> i very much take the point which he makes today and which he has made to me on many occasions concerning the problems which confront small islands with limited resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe for his support of the statement and for his comment that democracy in the turks and caicos is fragile <e> <s> i am also grateful for his support of the use if necessary of the reserve powers of the governor <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord lord hatch is in general agreement with the statement <e> <s> with regard to the timetable on the elections it is true that it was originally hoped that the elections would take place later on in <e> <s> the report was received at christmas time and we wanted to study very thoroughly the recommendations of sir roy marshall <e> <s> we appreciated the great effort that he put into it but the situation in this dependent territory has proved to be very serious <e> <s> we wanted to make quite sure that we had ourselves considered the matters fully and were not looking as if we were not giving it a proper consideration before coming to parliament with our proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that the visit to moscow of my right honourable friend the prime minister confirmed to mr gorbachev that we support the zero-zero option in europe though we should still prefer a global ban <e> <s> that is conditional on agreement on vital details including verification and short-range intermediate nuclear missiles <e> <s> the main remaining areas of disagreement are over the western right to match soviet systems <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm to the noble lord lord cledwyn that as he would expect discussions are continuing among our nato allies and partners <e> <s> it is important that there should be cohesion in the west and that we should achieve the right answer <e> <s> as i have already answered in part to the noble lord lord hatch of lusby the soviet proposals to extend the zero option further down the scale to shorter-range missiles of approximately to miles are being studied by nato at present <e> <s> it seems clear that natos security will continue to require land-based nuclear weapons in europe as part of our response to the soviet unions superiority in chemical and conventional forces <e> <s> there is no question of our negotiating these weapons away <e>", "<cs> my lords i think from what the noble lord lord gladwyn has said that the points he makes are in many respects similar to the point i was making in answer to the earlier questions <e> <s> i would only add that we hope that agreement can be reached in this area of arms control in the near future <e> <s> if so it will be an historic achievement for the western governments and for our own people <e> <s> but it must be an agreement which enhances our security <e> <s> we therefore attach great importance to a number of conditions including of course verification <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the noble lord lord mellish makes a very important point both about conventional weapons and of course about chemical weapons in which the soviet union has a clear superiority <e> <s> that is why i said in the course of my remarks that there must be agreements on these matters as well <e>", "<cs> my lords what is very important is that the cohesion of the alliance should be maintained throughout these negotiations and of course afterwards <e> <s> on the specific point about the weu it has of course an important role in strengthening the european component of the us atlantic alliance and will have a chance to discuss arms control issues <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord jenkins will not be surprised to hear that i do not accept his statement <e> <s> nor i think would my noble friends accept what he has to say <e> <s> we have made a very positive response to the proposals that have been made <e> <s> what is of course very important is that the conclusions are right <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> as always the noble lord lord chalfont makes very important points <e> <s> i agree in particular about the importance of arms control both in conventional and in chemical weapons <e>", "<cs> absolutely not my lords <e> <s> my right honourable friend the prime minister has taken very seriously as do the government the offer of mr gorbachev which as i indicated in my first answer we are studying closely along with our nato allies <e> <s> as i should have thought the noble lord lord hatch must be aware from the other points that have arisen during this question we need also to consider natos overall deterrence requirements in the light of the totality of the threat that faces us that is to say from conventional as well as from chemical and nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is any doubt about that <e> <s> the conversations between my right honourable friend the prime minister and mr gorbachev were a very full and frank expression of views by both sides each contributing to the task of building greater trust and confidence between our two countries and between the east and the west which was in itself valuable <e> <s> as i said earlier we are taking the proposals that are before us very seriously indeed <e> <s> it is of course for the americans and the russians to negotiate those matters <e> <s> however it is important that the cohesion of the allies remains and that we consult fully with our allies <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> we have accepted the zero-zero option on longer-range intermediate nuclear weapons <e> <s> the two matters which now concern us are verification and short-range weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in the short debate this evening <e> <s> i am particularly grateful for the support that the bill has received from all parts of the house <e> <s> the noble lord lord prys-davies asked a number of questions and i was glad that we had had an opportunity to discuss the bill before we came to the second reading and to have some idea of the points about which he was concerned <e> <s> i shall try to answer all of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i confirm that the number of refugees in the camps is approximately as my noble friend has described but the total number is higher <e> <s> i should not want to speculate on whether or not the camps might be beseiged again as i believe my noble friend will understand <e> <s> the security council is fully seized of the problem <e> <s> we as the government <e>", "<cs> my lords we have argued and said to israel that she should complete the withdrawal from the lebanon to enable unifil to deploy to the international border because we recognise the valuable work that unifil is doing <e> <s> as i believe the noble lord lord cledwyn will know our own position and that of the community is based on the ministerial statement of rd february in which we expressed support in principle for an international conference as a framework for negotiations between the parties directly concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bottomley will be fully aware of the british governments policy which is based on the recognition of the state of israel and the palestinians right to exist <e>", "<cs> my lords as i answered in a previous question the british governments view is quite clear <e> <s> we have urged israel to complete withdrawal from the lebanon to enable unifil whose work in very difficult circumstances we admire to be deployed to the international border <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i would draw an analogy between the situation in the lebanon and that in afghanistan <e> <s> the position of the british government is as i have described it <e> <s> we do not in any way condone the israeli raids and the naval shelling of targets in southern lebanon <e> <s> the israelis are well aware of our view that such actions only add to the cycle of violence in the area <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with what the noble lord says about our wish for an international conference <e> <s> indeed we have made our view quite clear <e> <s> we want to encourage and assist the parties to narrow the gap both on participation in the conference and on modalities so that a conference can be convened with a realistic chance of success <e> <s> we have held important discussions with the parties and my right honourable friend the prime minister discussed the issue with king hussein on th april <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the noble lords point that unifil is not the right body to protect the camps in that sense <e> <s> its mandate does not cover their protection <e> <s> we all share his widespread horror at the suffering that has been inflicted on the civilian population by the violence in the lebanon <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will understand that i do not wish to get drawn further into this <e> <s> the position is as i have stated it and it is built on security council resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be glad to know that i agree very much about the importance of women as traders and thinkers <e> <s> he will be glad to know that we are well aware that almost per cent <e> <s> of food for domestic consumption in africa is produced by women <e> <s> the odas method of keeping statistics makes it difficult to provide precise figures on the amount of aid going to women in the developing world <e> <s> however all aid benefits women and some projects have special components for women <e> <s> we are considering ways to prepare statistics on the proportion of aid going to help women <e> <s> we want to do more <e> <s> we have produced a booklet of which i am sure the noble lord is aware which sets out projects designed specifically to help women <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the noble baroness makes a good point <e> <s> it is important that we should use our aid effectively and i can assure her that we take steps to monitor how it is used in the developing world <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords question begs a great many other questions <e> <s> it is not a matter on which i would want to pronounce this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm the importance of ngos in their work both at home and in developing countries <e> <s> it is something that we appreciate and have supported <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the noble lord is quite correct in what he says <e> <s> all aid affects women in one way or another <e> <s> the booklet to which i have referred a copy of which is in the library gives examples of projects <e> <s> a recent example is our major support for the open university in pakistan which helps to educate people excluded from formal education especially rural women <e> <s> this has been helpful <e> <s> i accept his point about recognising within our administrative arrangements the importance of monitoring the work that is being done <e>", "<cs> my lords the short answer to the noble lord is that i have always believed in the natural superiority of women over men and would not think of abolishing women <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not accept the remarks which prefaced the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> we do not believe that a womens unit would be helpful within the oda <e> <s> we believe that it would marginalise the issue and that women could be forgotten in many projects <e> <s> it is much more important to integrate womens interests in all development issues and to ensure that they stay in the mainstream <e> <s> that is our view about this matter and this is something to which i personally attach great importance <e> <s> i believe it is an effective way of helping women in the developing world <e>", "<cs> my lords

known <e> <s> it is interesting that during his visit to london last week president chissano from mozambique said that he knew that my right honourable friend the prime minister shared the aim of eradicating apartheid in south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> the answer to my noble friend is that her majestys government deplore the violation of human rights wherever they may occur <e>",

london but throughout the country as a whole <e>", "<cs> i too wish to speak against the amendment <e> <s> i should first of all like the noble lord lord sainsbury declare an interest as a non-executive director of marks spencer <e> <s> the concerns of marks spencer are very much the <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend convey to his right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer the fact that the proposals have been received with a great deal of pleasure by many womens organisations which have compaigned for a very long time <e> <s> i believe that in this field the proposals will provide a real measure of justice which has been long sought <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> in view of the importance to the national health service of the recruitment and retention of nurses can he say whether this is a matter which is being looked at by the internal inquiry which is currently being conducted into the national health service <e> <s> can the minister tell us the position regarding project <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> does she not agree that the problem identified in her reply is likely to increase post- when far more people will go to work in europe <e> <s> does she also not agree that some discussion between her department and the department of trade and industry on the real problems of children who need to follow a british curriculum for want of a better term should take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by congratulating my noble friend lady hooper on explaining so clearly this long complicated but very important bill before the house today and by saying to my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor that we look forward to hearing what he has to say in opening tomorrow as well as to the speeches by the two main speakers <e>", "<cs> i very much agree with what has been said about this matter by my noble friend lord eccles <e> <s> i should like to say to the noble lord lord callaghan that perhaps regrettably i never had the opportunity of sharing an experience with him in another place <e> <s> therefore i am speaking from my experience in this house alone <e> <s> i take my starting point from what was said by my noble friend lord eccles <e> <s> i believe that if the amendment were to be passed it would be a wrecking amendment <e> <s> the national curriculum is a major part of a major reforming bill on education in schools <e> <s> perhaps i may have the temerity to say to my noble friend lord joseph whose views on so many matters i greatly admire that i believe he is being slightly disingenuous to suggest that this is not a wrecking amendment even though he may turn to argue his later amendments which he undoubtedly will <e> <s> to undermine and remove the provisions as regards a national curriculum is to amend the bill in such a way that i believe it becomes a travesty of its former state <e> <s> it is a wrecking amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will be able to say that the amendment is not necessary <e> <s> i share with the noble baroness lady seear and with many other members the real importance of obtaining a greater understanding of what the government are trying to achieve in the bill through the teaching profession <e> <s> like many members of the committee i have not only received a large amount of correspondence from teachers but have also taken the opportunity to talk to a number of them <e> <s> i believe that a great deal of misunderstanding has arisen in respect of the bill <e> <s> i agree with the view shared on all sides of the committee <e> <s> if the bill is to succeed it will be through the teaching profession and it is important that it understands what is happening <e>", "<cs> we shall all listen with great interest to what my noble friend the minister has to say on this very important issue of testing and assessment <e> <s> we have not yet heard the response of the government to the report referred to by the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> the subject is of great importance to members of the committee on all sides and i hope very much that by the time we reach the report stage we shall have a clearer view of what it is <e>", "<cs> i think it is only fair that i should speak <e> <s> we always listen to the noble lord lord stewart with the greatest interest <e> <s> he once told me i think that he was a former headmaster or a former teacher and when he expresses himself that becomes very clear <e> <s> one has that familiar feeling of being under authority <e> <s> in this case we enormously enjoyed his jokes <e> <s> i quite agree about the mathematical problem it was the sort of thing which i always found extremely difficult <e> <s> however he is being less than fair to my noble friend the minister <e> <s> the truth of the matter is that this is a framework bill <e> <s> that has come out quite clearly <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may complete this argument <e> <s> i hope very much that the government will be able to bring forward a response on this before the report stage <e> <s> as my noble friend the minister said it will not be the -plus but it will involve teachers <e> <s> these are general statements <e> <s> we are looking for considerable detail and i should have thought that this met the conditions which would enable noble lords to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask my noble friend to clarify several further points <e> <s> i understand the point made by the noble lord lord peston about local education authorities <e> <s> anyone who has served in such an authority knows the value of local government <e> <s> one of the issues in education which has always worried me is that at the end of their school lives only those who obtain a national examination such as gcse or o- or a-level have a document which indicates their achievement <e> <s> it is a national examination although we can argue about variations between the boards and by and large it is accepted <e> <s> an examination which was not accepted so widely was the cse <e> <s> that was most unfortunate but this is not the place to examine all the reasons for that <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may ask my noble friend for clarification on a further point <e> <s> personally i am glad that she has agreed to consider the amendment tabled by the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> i do not necessarily require an answer this evening but perhaps when she comes back to the chamber she will explain the final phrase of subsection which reads <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can be clear that i understand the position because where assessment fits into all this is an important matter <e> <s> as i understand the bill and what my noble friend has said we shall have consultation by the working groups on the main aspects of what the curriculum will be and what is expected to be attained at the end <e> <s> i assume it is agreed that we are not now debating the four ages at which the assessments will take place and that we are assessing the content of the curriculum <e> <s> in a sense it is impossible to make an assessment until one knows what is in the curriculum and what should be attained <e> <s> therefore there having been consultations on this and with the teachers who will carry it out the assessment will follow from that <e> <s> i hope that will act as a reassurance that the professionalism of the teachers is taken into account the whole way through this extremely important process <e>", "<cs> we should in a sense be quite grateful to the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee for explaining so fully his arguments against this part of the bill <e> <s> we all listened with great interest to what the noble baroness lady david had to say although i am bound to say that in effect these amendments are wrecking amendments in relation to this particular part of the bill <e>", "<cs> let me say in response to the point made by the noble baroness lady blackstone <e>", "<cs> while my noble friend is contemplating her reply on this she might consider what i have seen as the way in which this might well work out <e> <s> after all let us take the moment of transfer from primary to secondary school where this is most likely to occur <e> <s> most parents will be contemplating where their children are going in the last year of primary school <e> <s> it will not be absolutely the case but i think for most parents this would be the big decision <e> <s> i have no doubt that under the arrangements they will be invited to express a preference <e> <s> they will have the appeals procedure and this opportunity to apply for entry to a school up to what would have been its limit <e> <s> in the course of all that there will be exactly the cases that the noble lord lord glenamara has identified <e>", "<cs> i suggest to my noble friend that this is a very important point which crosses all sides of the committee <e> <s> i hear myself arguing very much in favour of nursery education and the noble baroness lady seear has asked for an answer in plain terms and we should all like to know <e> <s> i fully appreciate the complexity of all the arguments about space standards numbers classes those who are pupils and those who are below age and so on <e> <s> if it is not possible to get an answer at the committee stage which may well be the case perhaps my noble friend will be good enough to write to me and to the noble baronesses lady david and lady seear before the next stage of the bill <e> <s> to have it set out would be very helpful <e> <s> in fact no one wants the nursery classes squeezed out where they are now playing a very important role <e>", "<cs> what the noble lord lord taylor of blackburn said about governors was important <e> <s> we shall come to his amendment with which i have very considerable sympathy <e> <s> however what is important about the change in the bill concerns the work of school governors <e> <s> like the noble lord i have served on a good many maintained school governing bodies and i must confess that it was not the most exciting of tasks <e> <s> suddenly there is an opportunity for real responsibility <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful to the committee that my noble friend responded to two amendments down in my name amendments nos <e> <s> a and b but which i have not moved <e> <s> i am happy to speak to them <e> <s> it was not my intention to press these two amendments <e> <s> i was very glad to hear what he had to say about the training of governors and that there will be million available for that <e> <s> i have read the relevant paragraphs and in this helpful advice which set it out in some detail <e>", "<cs> i too have attached my name to this series of amendments <e> <s> i have discussed this with the representatives of the national association of head teachers <e> <s> i entirely agree with what my noble friend lady carnegy has said <e> <s> indeed i believe all sides of the committee agree about the extreme importance of teachers under this bill and of head teachers in particular men and women <e> <s> i hope that there will be more women heads of school <e>", "<cs> is it not a fact that were these criticisms to be taken as they have been explained by the noble lord who has just spoken they would actually cut at the heart of financial delegation <e> <s> the fact is that broadly speaking the cost of teachers is some per cent <e> <s> of the cost of schools <e> <s> i may not be absolutely right about that percentage but that must be the approximate figure <e> <s> what we have had before in financial delegation is financial delegation as far as it goes but excluding the employment of teachers <e> <s> therefore if one excludes the employment of teachers one is not giving financial delegation to schools <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend can answer the specific legal points which must be covered otherwise this amendment would be quite inappropriate <e> <s> in its way this is a kind of wrecking amendment on financial delegation <e>", "<cs> if we return to the point made by the right reverend prelate the bishop of london when he moved the amendment i think it would clarify the position <e> <s> he said that he was only concerned with the voting of parents <e> <s> it is most important to consider all the stages which as i understand it must be gone through before a school can become a grant-maintained school <e>", "<cs> i hope the right reverend prelate will give way for one moment <e> <s> is he not himself confusing the two points the one about the vote that triggers off the process and the other being the whole process itself <e> <s> the whole process itself will be far more than just the vote of the parents <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord young of dartington identified a point about which many parents are concerned <e> <s> one of the schools he has in mind was established in cornwall by parents who decided that they would set up an independent school <e> <s> the points he made about parental choice and variety have a great deal to commend them <e> <s> what i suspect the government will say is that allowing this extension will be expensive and take up more resources and that one cannot be sure that it will fit precisely within the terms of the bill <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend the minister for her reply <e> <s> i think it is helpful that she has clarified one or two points about the committee that has been set up under the chairmanship of my noble friend lord elton and that another circular is to be issued this year on this important subject <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask my noble and learned friend who has i think responded sympathetically to this amendment whether perhaps he could look at the drafting of it <e> <s> we all recognise that the noble lord lord adrian has raised an extremely important point <e> <s> i share the view of the government that universities will have to raise private money and continue to do so for so far as one can see <e> <s> that is an inevitable fact of life and is something to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> the issue before the committee is whether there should be a delay in implementing this part of the bill <e> <s> my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter has made absolutely clear the great dangers of that move <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that there can be any disagreement between any of us in the committee this evening about the importance of adult education <e> <s> i entirely accept what the noble lord lord peston said about the invaluable opportunities it has given and will continue to give to thousands of people and indeed all the opportunities it gives to women and ethnic minorities <e> <s> we all know the arguments about training and retraining namely that such training is invaluable <e> <s> i hope that we shall all agree on its importance <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the noble lord lord peston on many occasions during the progress of this bill and have frequently found myself in agreement with him <e> <s> however i am bound to say that his last remarks did not reach the standard which i at any rate have come to expect from him <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down perhaps she can clarify one point <e> <s> a gap appears to have been identified between the dhss and the department of education and science <e> <s> we are all agreed that the amendment on the marshalled list is not correctly drafted <e> <s> however my noble friend lord swinton made a suggestion and the minister has agreed to look at it <e> <s> i believe that it will meet the needs of the committee if the minister agrees to look at it positively and perhaps brings back an amendment at a later stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful indeed for the support i have received from all parts of the chamber <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to the noble baroness lady david and the noble lord lord tordoff and to my noble friend lord reay who i think made an extremely important point about the government supporting the private sector particularly the smaller business and the self-employed who will be most affected <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house is grateful to the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos for introducing this important debate today <e> <s> i spoke on this important part of the world hong kong on a number of occasions as a minister in the foreign and commonwealth office <e> <s> however this is the first opportunity i have had to speak after a personal visit to hong kong <e> <s> once again i discovered the great truth that there is no substitute for a visit and a look for oneself <e> <s> i should like to start by placing on record my gratitude to the hong kong government for arranging such an interesting and valuable programme <e> <s> in saying that i am sure that i speak on behalf of the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs and my noble friend lord torrington <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble and learned friend for his reply and for his helpfulness on this subject <e> <s> is he aware of the real concern felt by a large number of women who spend a large part of their lives abroad with their husbands and who are therefore unable to work and accrue entitlement to a pension at the end of their days <e> <s> if he cannot bring forward major legislation will he consider an amendment to the present legislation to put that point right <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i am not alone in very much regretting that my noble friend lord joseph should have seen fit to put down at report stage an amendment very similar to the ones which we discussed at very considerable length on committee and indeed divided upon <e> <s> the committee took a very clear view on this matter <e> <s> i must therefore say as i said at committee stage that were they to be carried this afternoon the effect would be wrecking amendments on the whole of this part of the bill because both the core subjects and the foundation subjects stand together as a package and need to be so considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with what my noble friend lord carlisle said about the national curriculum <e> <s> will my noble friend the minister say that the point raised in her amendment by my noble friend lady faithfull about home economics or however the subject is described could be met by the use that is made of the time left after the core and foundation subjects have been completed <e> <s> that is a point to which a school must address itself <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour i shall speak only briefly <e> <s> i put down my name to this amendment because i think that it would be extremely helpful at this stage of the bill to have a much clearer definition of what is meant by music and art <e> <s> i agree very much with what the noble baroness lady birk said on the subject <e> <s> i am grateful also to my noble friend the minister for our discussion on this matter and for the copy of the letter she sent to me setting out the further views of the government <e> <s> i hope she will be able to elaborate on those views when she replies to the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords we have all listened with great interest to the noble baroness lady blackstone introducing this very comprehensive new clause covering two major aspects of the bill <e> <s> there are two comments that i should like to make on it <e> <s> the first concerns the first part of the proposed new clause which seems to be a kind of declaratory statement about what should happen <e> <s> it is extremely difficult to define what the circumstances are that would be required to be met before anything started at all <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may comment on the amendment <e> <s> there is a complete chapter in the publication of the task group on assessment and testing devoted to the relationship between the gcse examination and assessments <e> <s> clearly this needs to be worked out <e> <s> however i do not agree altogether with the argument put forward by the noble lord lord peston about this being a lot for children to undertake <e> <s> although the assumption has been throughout the discussion on this bill that children will suffer a great deal from all this in my experience children rather like to feel that they have accomplished something <e> <s> quite clearly as there will be levels at each grade of assessment they will accomplish the level at which they should accomplish it <e> <s> this could be a great incentive to children to go on <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we would all agree with the noble lord lord morton of shuna that it is not necessary to speak about the importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that when my noble friend responds she will give an assurance that the government strongly support nursery education <e> <s> i regard nursery education as a very important part of any childs education <e> <s> i am pleased to say that it has increased under this government <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend will not accept this amendment <e> <s> i share the view of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter on this <e> <s> it seems to me that this whole series of amendments has been designed to make it more difficult to opt out <e> <s> parents whose child is in the final year of a school should be entitled to a vote not only for the reasons given by my noble friend but also because they may be people who have always thought that the school should have opted out and have a great interest in the school in so doing <e> <s> as regards the pupils in the second part of the amendment those children may be leaving the school for all kinds of perfectly good reasons but again their parents may regret that they are leaving and may wish that they could go on into an opted-out school <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord has raised an interesting and important point <e> <s> when the minister replies can she expand a little on the financing of the schools <e> <s> as i understand the position on grant-maintained schools the government would pay a grant equal to the amount that would have been paid by the local education authority but would include in it additional money for the support costs which the local education authority would have from its various central services <e> <s> therefore the amount of money going to the school would be somewhat larger than that from the local education authority but that would be because it had increased expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords i can quite understand why the noble lord lord henderson of brompton has moved this amendment and why it has had the support that it has <e> <s> however i recall the act very clearly because i was then the minister in the department of education and science and i took the act through your lordships house <e> <s> i am not at all clear whether this amendment will help the act <e> <s> my noble friend lady faithfull says that the act has not been fully implemented <e> <s> in fact it created a framework which was going to move towards a set of circumstances <e> <s> therefore i am not surprised to hear that it has not been fully implemented in every authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene to say that i am grateful to see this advance on the act <e> <s> it is a very real measure of the influence of your lordships house on the legislative process <e> <s> i am very glad indeed to hear that it has been welcomed both by my noble friend lady faithfull and by the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth <e> <s> i too welcome it very much <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee i supported an amendment designed to achieve the same result as the present amendment that the noble lord lord adrian has moved and the amendment that he has coupled with it which applies to polytechnics <e> <s> i was not absolutely clear why my noble and learned friend was unable to accept in principle these amendments and if necessary bring back a government amendment to meet these points <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that all of us in the house are highly conscious that feelings run very deep on the subject of ilea <e> <s> we had this at committee stage and it has been repeated again this evening on report <e> <s> i am however hound to say to my noble friend lord alport that his amendment is in effect really one that is almost identical except on the length of time to that which was moved by the right reverend prelate the bishop of london which we discussed at very considerable length at the committee stage <e> <s> i do not say that it is identical but it is very similar and in effect it is a delaying amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say very briefly that as i intervened on a similar amendment at the committee stage i hope that my noble friend the minister will be able if not to accept this amendment then to come forward even on third reading with something that meets what was clearly not the intention of parliament originally <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all those who have supported this amendment <e> <s> i think i can really say that it has had very strong support from all parts of the house and i am very grateful to the noble lord lord tordoff on behalf of the social and liberal democrats to my noble friend lord montgomery who i think made the important point that the amendment has wide support from british business commerce and banking to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs who supported the proposal so ably at the committee stage and whose practical experience of the kind of problems faced by families who have to live abroad is very valuable to the noble lord lord benson who i believe made as a businessman the important point that if the united kingdom is going to hold its own in the highly competitive post- market we must not put our business people at a disadvantage to the noble lord lord greenhill who gave it his strong support and after all he is someone who both from his own experience and from professional life knows the kinds of problems faced by people living abroad and to the noble baroness lady david <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend places me in a considerable difficulty on this matter <e> <s> i should very much like to be able to withdraw the amendment because i should like to work with the government to find a scheme <e> <s> i very much appreciate the difficulty in which my noble friend finds herself in fact i have found myself in similar difficulties in the past <e> <s> so it is a true feeling from the heart <e> <s> i feel however that i should like to test the feeling of the house on the matter <e> <s> it is too important to leave to something which at the end of the day may not be satisfactory <e> <s> i think that this is very much in the interest of our effort in regard to <e> <s> however i appreciate all that has been done and said on behalf of my proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate my noble friend lord caithness on introducing this bill so clearly <e> <s> the bill provides for the deregulation of new private sector lettings for the strengthening of the law against harassment for the increasing of tenants choice and for the introduction of housing action trusts all policies foreshadowed at the time of the last general election <e> <s> i welcome the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would forgive me i did not say that we should not build houses <e> <s> i said that building houses by itself is not only the solution to the housing problem <e>", "<cs> my lords when we debated this matter very fully on th may i was one member of the house who supported the government in their original proposals <e> <s> but it was quite clear on that occasion and certainly on rereading the debate that there was a great deal of concern about the matter in your lordships house <e> <s> i think that that concern was echoed in another place when this matter went back for consideration on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened as always with great care to what my noble friend lady hooper said <e> <s> she will understand that to say the very least i feel greatly disappointed in the amendment that the government have brought forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord wyatt for giving way on this occasion <e> <s> feelings are running high and that is not surprising <e> <s> this is a matter about which everybody cares a very great deal <e> <s> like my noble friend lord thorneycroft i respect very much the sincerity and integrity of my noble friend lord cullen of ashbourne <e> <s> we worked together as close colleagues in government <e> <s> we stood side by side on various matters during the days of opposition <e> <s> we have often argued on the same side <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead for introducing the debate <e> <s> my enthusiasm for the debate is slightly tempered by a point which he made at the beginning of his speech as did the noble lord lord greenhill and i was not sure that i understood what his purpose was in putting down the motion in the terms that he did <e> <s> i therefore listened with great interest to what he had to say and now of course we know what his purpose was <e> <s> he identified and i think that i wrote them down correctly five guiding principles as to why he thinks that the prime minister has too much effect on our foreign policy <e> <s> he especially dislikes her style <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for introducing the debate this afternoon <e> <s> perhaps i may say that he spoke with his usual vigour clarity and wit and he introduced a subject which was very fully debated in your lordships house some two years ago <e> <s> however as everyone has made clear the problem will not go away and indeed the interest in this matter is shown by the number of speakers tabled to speak this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer bearing in mind that the department of energy is quite rightly conducting a considerable advertising campaign on energy saving <e> <s> can he tell us what the expected cash savings will be in the palace of westminster as a result of this work <e> <s> what does he expect this year and what does he expect when the report and the final arrangements are complete <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that the particular case which has been cited this afternoon is one that will cause everyone some concern <e> <s> as he said the matter is now before the secretary of state <e> <s> does he not also take into account whether or not this is a political matter <e> <s> is that not one of his considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords we should all like to thank the noble lord lord stewart of fulham for introducing this important debate this afternoon <e> <s> teachers are central to the whole education system implementing the education reform act raising standards developing the potential of individual pupils and preparing young people for the st century <e> <s> the supply of teachers is crucial especially in the core and foundation subjects and the supply must be spread throughout the country so that all pupils may benefit <e> <s> it is important that teachers should know that they have our support <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord stewart only in so far as i am aware from talking to a number of teachers that morale is low at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the debate and thank the noble lord lord cledwyn for introducing it <e> <s> he has touched upon what is clearly one of the more important political issues before this country namely <e> <s> it is an issue which could not be more topical <e> <s> i should like to start by sending my congratulations to my noble friend lord trenchard on a most thoughtful and interesting speech <e> <s> we all look forward to hearing from him on many future occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by thanking the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for introducing this important debate today and also by congratulating my noble friend lord willoughby de broke on his maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i should begin by declaring an interest as i speak as a non-executive director of marks and spencer <e> <s> however at this late hour i shall be brief in what i have to say <e> <s> i agree with the points which have been made by my noble friend lord lucas and by the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it that is how this part of the bill would have to work in order to achieve its objective <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late stage i do not wish to become involved in something which is clearly a point for the committee stage <e> <s> in order to fulfil this section of the bill it would be necessary to have some other point in order to make the situation quite clear <e> <s> i do not think it would be right to take up the time of the house on second reading with considering precisely how that takes place <e> <s> i am concerned only about the practicalities <e> <s> i am quite certain that the noble lord would not wish something to reach the statute book which would bring the law into disrepute because it was unworkable and would not deal wich the problem which both of us would like to see dealt with in an effective manner <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house must be grateful to my noble friend lady cox for raising this matter even at this very late hour <e> <s> i want to speak on this issue because looking at the evidence i too am most concerned at the outcome of what cannot be regarded as other than a most unhappy affair at the very least <e> <s> one of the three teachers involved as i understand it has found a suitable post in a tertiary college <e> <s> but of the other two to whom my noble friend referred mr mcgovern and dr freeman one is not doing any teaching at all and the other is teaching in a primary school <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether under the circumstances my noble friend will consider this suggestion <e> <s> every noble lord who has spoken this afternoon feels very strongly on the subject <e> <s> i appreciate that my noble friend is not a minister in the department concerned <e> <s> however we should like to have an undertaking from him that he <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much welcome the discussions which took place last week between britain and argentina not just because they established better relations between our two countries but because they are valuable confidence-building measures in a difficult area <e> <s> however will my noble friend bear in mind the concerns of the falkland islands people about the outcome of those negotiations and encourage them to believe what i am sure is true that it is in their best interests as <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming what my noble friend said on the steps which the government are taking to improve the teacher supply there is a real concern about shortages which needs to be met <e> <s> will he ask his right honourable friend to look at a pilot scheme being introduced in independent schools whereby second-year university students can do one months work experience in a school to find out whether or not they are interested in teaching <e> <s> that may be something which could well be used in maintained schools and would help to encourage able under-graduates and students to look at teaching as a possible profession <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by thanking the noble lord lord hunter for introducing this debate <e> <s> it is a valuable opportunity to discuss at this early stage the national health service and the proposed reforms <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure indeed to be able to be the first to congratulate the noble earl lord cairns on his maiden speech <e> <s> i know that he comes to this house as a distinguished banker <e> <s> i believe that his father was both an admiral and marshal of the diplomatic corps so his interests should be very wide <e> <s> i believe that all of us who take an interest in education are delighted that he should have chosen to make his maiden speech on this subject and particularly on the vso <e> <s> it is a most important issue <e> <s> i hope that we shall hear from the noble earl on many occasions in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to rise to support the government in this bill but in the time available and with the number of speakers on the list i shall not rehearse all the arguments in favour of it <e> <s> i think that these were clearly covered by my noble friend lord caithness <e> <s> rather i should like to concentrate on the effect of the amendment were it to be passed tonight and to hope that the house will not support it but will support the government in the lobbies when a vote is taken later <e> <s> as i am a reasonably regular attender of your lordships house i hope that i shall pass if i may call it this the lord peston test <e>", "<cs> i should like to start by thanking my noble friend lord caithness for accepting the principle of the amendments <e> <s> i am happy to withdraw the amendment on his word that he will bring back as i thought he almost certainly would want to do correctly drafted amendments <e> <s> we shall look forward to seeing the amendments at a later stage <e>", "<cs> time is not on our side as regards the bill <e> <s> i listened with great care to what was said by the noble lord lord jenkins in moving the amendment <e> <s> i was delighted by his speech particularly his early remarks about myself <e> <s> my only regret is that when he was being so flattering my dear father was not here to hear his comments <e> <s> he would have been astonished <e>", "<cs> when my noble friend comes to reply to this amendment i believe that it would be very helpful if he could set out in some detail just what will be the figures <e> <s> when i read this amendment on the marshalled list i could see the point which the noble baroness was making <e> <s> at first glance it appears that somebody will be disadvantaged <e> <s> therefore i wish to be sure that my own understanding of the position is correct <e>", "<cs> i believe that everybody in this chamber understands the point of the amendment of the noble lord lord peston and indeed the two preceding amendments because in a sense they all deal with a similar point namely access for women whether they are women undergraduates or women graduates who wish to return to full-time employment and who have families <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness leaps to her feet i was very interested to read in the oxford magazine which dropped through our letterbox on saturday that universities are now starting to worry about the number of students coming from the european community <e> <s> therefore all sorts of things happen and work out differently <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness lady seear replies perhaps i could clarify one point <e> <s> the comments of my noble friend lady blatch were extemely helpful <e> <s> however a very important point for the future and one about which people are very concerned is child care costs <e> <s> it was difficult to take in all the figures given on dependants allowances but i assume that they apply separately to the wife and do not include the salary of the husband <e> <s> if the answer is not available immediately i should be happy if the noble baroness gave it a later stage either in committee or on report to clarify the point <e> <s> i assume that that is the case because i think that that applied at earlier stages of the bill <e> <s> it is important that the assessment should be quite separate <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask my noble friend to consider a further point <e> <s> there could be one or two very hard cases indeed <e> <s> it is arguable that if one has completed one and a half years of a university course the chances are that one will get a better job <e> <s> but i can envisage the case of a student who has a terrible accident i do not know whether this is what the noble earl lord russell had particularly in mind and is therefore seriously handicapped <e> <s> such a student will not earn very much at all <e> <s> is there no provision within the bill or the regulations to remit a loan if it is clear that because of illness or accident it will not be possible to repay it <e> <s> i do not know the answer to that question but it is matter which should be considered at some stage <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has given us a lot of very useful information in the remarks that he has just made in answer to the noble lord lord peston and the noble earl lord russell <e> <s> between now and the next stage of the bill would he also consider the anxieties that have been expressed <e> <s> i felt that his answer on the question of confidentiality went a long way to meet fears on that point <e> <s> he was quite right to say to the noble lord lord peston that he could not have it both ways <e> <s> one cannot ask for information and then complain when one has the information as if the student loans company limited was going to behave in some improper way <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may complete what i was going to say <e> <s> it is a very important point <e> <s> my noble friend has quite properly explained the scheme <e> <s> that is very helpful to the committee <e> <s> if i have understood him correctly he stated that the student loans company limited will act as a responsible lending authority <e> <s> one of the concerns <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might see that i have understood the bill correctly <e> <s> i might be able to help the committee <e> <s> my noble friend lady blatch put clearly that it is not necessary to have the amount of the loan on the face of the bill because that will appear in the regulations which will be dealt with under the affirmative resolution procedure <e> <s> therefore there will be an opportunity to discuss them <e>", "<cs> like most speakers who have taken part in the proceedings on the bill i have received correspondence and a great deal of inforrr ation from vice-chancellors <e> <s> almost everyone <e>", "<cs> like all members of the committee i shall listen carefully to what my noble friend has to say when he replies to this series of amendments <e> <s> i wish to make two points <e> <s> it is unfair to suggest that my noble friend has not been helpful on a number of amendments today <e> <s> in our earlier discussions my noble friend gave an assurance that he would consider further the access funds <e> <s> he also gave specific promises on the whole question of disabled students <e> <s> that was helpful to everyone <e> <s> as regards the previous amendment from my noble friend lord haig the minister gave an undertaking to consider the matter involved <e> <s> i make those points because having been in a similar position on the front bench myself i often wish that i had been allowed to say as many generous things as my noble friend has been allowed to say <e> <s> in the past i frequently had to argue difficult cases in this chamber <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness rises to reply to the debate perhaps i may say in response to my noble friend lord beloff that once again he is being less than fair <e> <s> the government have agreed to the affirmative resolution procedure which was requested from all parts of the committee <e> <s> i have not the slightest doubt that when the regulations come before the house the usual channels will be perfectly well aware of the extensive debates which have taken place on the bill <e> <s> to the best of my knowledge and belief the original proposal was that there would be one committee day <e> <s> it is now two <e>", "<cs> there is no doubt that everyone taking part in these proceedings recognises that this <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with that <e> <s> there will always be hard cases <e> <s> what is remarkable is the number of people who succeed in getting a degree <e> <s> i have seen the figures from the open university <e> <s> i admire enormously anyone who decides later in life to undertake a degree course and to do so via the open university <e> <s> it is a remarkable achievement <e> <s> we ought to look at the successes of people <e> <s> we should look at those who are really motivated to do something to overcome a good many difficulties <e> <s> the point of our discussion is to see how the money that is available will be spent and how the figures really work out for that proportion of students who <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond to my noble friend although i realise that that is a job for my noble friends on the front bench <e> <s> the truth of the matter is that from next september students will receive more money in real terms than they receive at the present time <e> <s> they will receive a higher grant they will have a top-up loan and in some cases they will still have a parental contribution <e> <s> my understanding is that they will be better off <e> <s> that point needs to be made continuously <e> <s> that is what is to happen next september <e> <s> the anxiety is about how the scheme will proceed <e> <s> those who will be affected by the loss of housing benefit are by no means all students if those students are living outside purpose-built accommodation <e>", "<cs> it is valuable that even at this late hour the graduate tax point has been raised <e> <s> it has been uppermost in the minds of many members of the committee <e> <s> like others i have received a copy of the vice-chancellors memorandum setting out the graduate tax <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to put words into peoples mouths which are not true <e> <s> i take back anything which i have said which has implied that <e> <s> i accept that everybody agrees that there must be change <e> <s> we have discussed the bill at considerable length <e> <s> for students the present scheme is infinitely better than any future scheme of loans a graduate tax or anything else which may be devised <e> <s> therefore it is not surprising that they are unhappy about the proposals <e> <s> that seems perfectly reasonable <e> <s> they think that they will not be as well off in the future as they are today <e> <s> time will tell <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank my noble friend very much for his helpfulness <e> <s> no one knows better than i how much work he himself has put into the bill <e> <s> as one who in your lordships house has from time to time had to take through legislation for a department in which i was not a minister i know how difficult it is to pick up the detail of a bill in your lordships house when there are so many experts sitting around <e> <s> i wish to place on record my gratitude to my noble friend for his helpfulness and for the immense amount of work he has put into the bill <e> <s> i also thank his colleagues who have been helpful <e> <s> i am grateful for what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not anticipating what my noble friend lady blatch will say in response to the amendment <e> <s> like everyone else i have reread what was said in committee <e> <s> perhaps <e>", "<cs> my lords i raised the question of part-time students at second reading because i thought that was important <e> <s> i am sure that everyone who has taken part in this debate recognises the importance of part-time students and i do not intend to rehearse all the arguments this evening because they have been gone over so clearly <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend gets up to reply to the amendment can he tell us whether the relationship of the student loans company in this would be different from the relationship that would have pertained had the banks been running the scheme <e> <s> would institutions stand in the same relationship to the student loans company as they would have stood in relation to the banks <e> <s> i have always understood that to be the case <e> <s> it would be helpful to know whether similar businesslike arrangements will apply <e>", "<cs> my lords this is obviously an important subject to debate and we have raised it both at second reading and on the committee stage <e> <s> although i do not in any way wish to follow the noble lord lord peston in all his academic discourse on whether or not social security benefits were intended for students i must say that it is some while since i read my copy of the beveridge report <e> <s> i suspect that social security benefits came to be given to students because they started off with allowing unemployment benefit in the long vacation on a kind of assumption that a student was unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend rises to respond i should like to clarify various points because we all have very great sympathy with the disabled <e> <s> my understanding of the bill is that disabled students will be in a very special category <e> <s> as we have had explained on an earlier amendment the social security benefits will apply to them including the special disability allowance attendance allowance and housing benefit <e> <s> all those other benefits will continue to apply to them unlike other students <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the remarks of my noble friend lord jenkin that we need to keep the amendment in proportion <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall all listen with great interest to the answers that my noble friend gives to the noble lord lord peston <e> <s> he has raised at least four questions about the consumer credit act <e> <s> i rise to speak now because some parts of the answers were clearly given by my noble friend last monday night <e> <s> perhaps i may say to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter that it is a pity he was not here to listen to the quite lengthy discussion which we had on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i agree with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that it is unpleasant to have to sit on this bill or indeed on any other bills in the early hours of the morning <e> <s> it is not the first time that this has happened under any government <e> <s> i am quite certain that as on many other matters it will not be the last time <e> <s> if i may say so the noble lord is being somewhat disingenuous in using that argument on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for bringing forward this amendment which meets one of the anxieties i raised at report stage <e> <s> i have no doubt that it will be greatly welcomed by the universities <e> <s> i am very grateful to my noble friend for the work which i know he has put into the matter <e> <s> i hope that he will pass on my thanks to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for his support of these measures <e> <s> i am sure that i speak on behalf of the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale who may wish to say something further and my noble friend lord rippon in thanking my noble friend for what he has been able to do <e>", "<cs> we have had a very useful debate on this extremely important subject <e> <s> i begin by thanking particularly the noble lords lord walton lord dainton and lord adrian who attached their names to this amendment for all that they have said <e> <s> they have spoken from a wealth of expertise and knowledge of the relationship between <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened very carefully to the noble earl <e> <s> before attending the house this afternoon i took the opportunity to reread what he said at report stage when this matter was debated <e> <s> he referred to the amendment which i moved which was supported by my noble friend lord rippon of hexham and the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale and to which the government agreed <e> <s> he welcomed it as i think the whole house did it was a major improvement to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the noble earls pardon i misheard what he said <e> <s> the fact is that allowing the amendment would be an unfortunate course upon which to embark <e> <s> i hope as i am sure he will that when my noble friend the leader of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should simply like to add my support for the last remark of the noble lord lord peston regarding the importance of standing by the ruling of mr speaker <e> <s> were your lordships house to question that ruling not only should we find ourselves constitutionally very incorrect but it would also make the workings of parliament impossible were we to conduct ourselves in that way <e>", "<cs> it is extremely helpful to hear my noble friend the minister explain how the government see this amendment <e> <s> quite clearly from the discussion which has taken place it has considerable support in the chamber <e> <s> it is very helpful that the minister has set out the governments approach to the bill <e> <s> it is an evolutionary approach and on re-reading the bill and re-reading the white paper before the debate one is struck by that as the whole thread and principle behind the bill <e> <s> it is not as though everything will suddenly change on st april <e> <s> even if that were possible and i do not believe it is that is not the case <e>", "<cs> i take the point which is a matter of fact that health authorities will have to contract for services <e> <s> it is something new that they will do but that will not entirely change the health service it will change a part of it <e> <s> it is an evolutionary reform which will give them more responsibility it will give them in a sense more interest and at the end of the day it will not just obtain better value for money but help to improve patient care <e>", "<cs> i was very careful in what i said in my remarks <e> <s> i picked out that particular piece because it appeared in many national newspapers and a least one of the statements was completely untrue <e> <s> i could say a great deal more regarding the other statements but i will not take up the time of the committee <e>", "<cs> we have all listened with great interest to the debate on this important issue of principle which has arisen <e> <s> i fully recognise that the recommendation of sir roy griffiths was that there should be some such proposal for finance <e> <s> as we all know having received many letters from them the issue has been raised by voluntary organisations and others which would like to see something like that happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i am speaking to amendment no <e> <s> with if i may say so to my noble friend lady cox considerable unhappiness at the way the discussion has gone on it <e> <s> i am second to none in my admiration for the work done by the polytechnics <e> <s> though i cannot in any way equal the experience of my noble friend in a polytechnic perhaps i can show my credentials by saying that i was once a governor of a polytechnic though i am <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much regret that i was not able to be present at the committee stage of the bill when this matter was debated on an amendment moved by the noble lord lord seebohm <e> <s> however i read the <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i accept what the noble lord has read from the <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may complete my argument <e> <s> the amendment would have a counter effect on those functions which your lordships house does well <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble baroness that situation was quite different <e> <s> the issue was quite different <e> <s> that bill was not directly concerned with money <e> <s> before the noble lord lord carter says that the amendment is not about tax i recognise that we are arguing about an increase in national insurance contributions <e> <s> i am quite clear on that point <e> <s> nonetheless it would be seen as concerning tax in another place <e> <s> my firm advice would be for the hosue of lords to debate the matter <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness and the noble lord will not press the amendment <e> <s> however if they do i hope for those constitutional reasons that the house will reject it <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that the point made by the noble baroness lady masham is a very important one in regard to the care for those who are on drugs or suffering from problems with alcohol <e> <s> however i should like to ask the minister to clarify how the situation would work under the bill <e> <s> i may not be right in my reading of the bill but when social services departments draft their plans i understand that they would have to include provision where there are such services for the continuation of those services <e> <s> as i understand it they could not make a plan and decide to take them out <e> <s> that would be a serious matter <e> <s> clearly a provision which is extremely important would then disappear <e> <s> i cannot conceive that that is the intention of the legislation <e> <s> if that is the case in determining the amount of resources that are required the local authority must include resources that are required to look after various establishments wherever they may be <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour i shall be very brief <e>", "<cs> my lords it will not surprise noble lords to know that i take a somewhat different view from that in the speeches that we have just heard from the noble lord lord ennals and the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> i think that this debate raises two matters of principle <e> <s> the first is the issue of ring-fencing <e> <s> i listened to the arguments that were put when this issue was debated earlier and again this afternoon to the effect that it is in the interests of those who as the noble lord lord allen said are the most vulnerable members of society that the money that the government will give for community care should be ring-fenced so that it will find its way to the authorities responsible for caring for those members of society <e> <s> i can understand the argument which the noble lord lord allen put very clearly if i may say so <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it undermines the whole of my argument although we could debate that issue at length <e> <s> the point which i was making was that the other place having looked at the decision taken in this house and considered the views expressed in another place has come back with another amendment to meet those views <e> <s> i should have thought that that shows the value of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can help my noble friend who has been put in an extremely difficult position <e> <s> like my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter i picked up a set of these documents <e>", "<cs> my lords while this matter is being considered perhaps i may intervene once again <e> <s> the reason i have my properly printed copy is that having read the regulations yesterday i telephoned the des about one or two matters <e> <s> my copy arrived this morning unsolicited <e> <s> i certainly did not ask for it <e> <s> i was sent it as the up-to-date copy <e> <s> i am afraid it never occurred to me that it was not available in the printed paper office <e> <s> as i had obtained my own copy i naturally did not seek to find a second one which i did not require <e> <s> however the proper copies must be available <e> <s> i should have thought it would be possible to proceed with the business <e> <s> i studied yesterday the copy which appears to be available <e> <s> anyone else who has done so will know what the content is and what the principles are as set out <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend responds to the speeches that we have heard i should like to say how grateful i am that the amendment we had to the original bill allowing the regulations to be taken by affirmative resolution was agreed to by the government because it is valuable to have this further discussion <e> <s> i should again like to place on record my appreciation for that <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that response <e> <s> i fully appreciate the point that he makes about clause and the audience research <e> <s> however can he confirm that it has been decided to establish two channels before the audience research has taken place <e> <s> can he further say whether he is satisfied that before the research is carried out companies will bid for the licence in the belief that they will be able to make it pay <e>", "<cs> i shall read carefully my noble friends reply <e> <s> i am not absolutely sure that he has answered my point <e> <s> i accept the importance of diversity as regards radio and i have no reason to think that others do not because it is a valid point <e> <s> clearly the question is how that will be determined <e> <s> i do not wish to pursue the matter further this afternoon and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>"]
