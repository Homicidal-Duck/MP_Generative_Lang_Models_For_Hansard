["<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable and learned friend the secretary of state for education and science about the warnock report on the special educational needs of handicapped children <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both the noble baroness and the noble lord lord beaumont for the way they have received this statement today <e> <s> not unnaturally both have asked what is going to be the timing of both the white paper and the legislation <e> <s> i think it is only right for me to be quite frank with the house over this matter <e> <s> as noble lords will know and many in this house take a great deal of interest in this subject it is two years since the report of mrs warnock was received <e> <s> we have been carrying out extensive consultations <e> <s> as i indicated we have brought forward the statement particularly so as to have it before the committee stage of the current education bill <e> <s> i cannot anticipate what will be in the next queens speech but i should like to say that the statement refers to early legislation and that means that there will be no unavoidable delay <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord renton for his remarks <e> <s> i can assure him and other noble lords that there is no disagreement between us about the principle that he is evolving <e> <s> we should like to apply as far as possible the principles which are in our current bill to parents of handicapped children <e> <s> there are a number of difficulties of a legal nature in amending our bill to take account of the whole concept of what i would call the warnock framework <e> <s> it is for that reason that we believe that a separate bill is required <e> <s> we will certainly look at the point to see whether it is possible to amend our present bill to go part of the way but i think it would be wrong to say that we could at this stage introduce the whole of the warnock concept into our bill <e> <s> that must wait for later legislation <e> <s> the reason for bringing forward the statement today and indicating our timetable is i hope to assure the house that we have the needs of the handicapped very much in mind and wish to act on the warnock report as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord segal for his support of this statement <e> <s> my colleagues and i recognise the concern of parents of handicapped children <e> <s> it is for this <e>", "<cs> my lords i will note of course certainly what my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls has said on the whole question of tactics <e> <s> my own view about this and that of my colleagues is that this is an extremely important area which is of great concern to a lot of people <e> <s> i believe that it is very necessary to get it right <e> <s> i can assure the house that so faras i and my colleagues are concerned we do not wish for any more delay than the parliamentary timetable would require <e>", "<cs> my lords on this particular point the treasury allowed for additional expenditure on this scheme because it was a commitment in the party manifesto <e>", "<cs> my lords i will tell the noble lord lord davies of leek that in fact we agreed the principle of this scheme in when unfortunately his government decided to phase out the direct grant scheme <e> <s> it was included in our manifestowe included it in the queens speechand we are legislating upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read with great interest everything that has been said in the debate on the second reading of this bill and no doubt we shall have plenty of opportunity to debate it further in the committee proceedings next week <e>", "<cs> i listened with great care to what the noble baroness lady david said on this important matter <e> <s> she rightly said that this amendment and indeed a sequence of amendments has been tabled so this subject will occur from time to time throughout <e>", "<cs> i have been asked a number of very important questions <e> <s> the noble lord lord stewart asked why bring in this part of the bill dealing with school governors <e> <s> as a government we attach very considerable importance to this first part of the bill <e> <s> we are instituting for the first time governing bodies on all secondary and primary schools except that the small ones would be grouped together <e> <s> this seems to me a major advance <e> <s> i served for years on an education committee and i was fortunate to be in a local authority in which all secondary schools had governors and primary schools had managers although the smaller ones were grouped together <e> <s> i therefore grew up in a system in which the importance of school governors was recognised <e>", "<cs> i have not got the information as to whether that school had managers or not but i suspect that it probably did <e>", "<cs> thank you very much i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i believe this is the kind of matter that governors ought to look at <e> <s> we are hoping very much that as we come to discuss the later provisions of school government particularly where we are legislating there will be provision for a minimum of two parents and two teachers and that these people will interlock the local education authority the teachers and the parents in school government and therefore strengthen the situation <e>", "<cs> i agree that in that sense there would be fewer but what the government would be much more inclined to do would be to say that neither should be approved by the secretary of state rather than that both should be approved <e> <s> this would be an alternative which of course is not here <e>", "<cs> i should like to answer the two noble lords in reverse order from that in which they spoke <e> <s> the noble lord lord avebury asked me whether we could not get some kind of parity of treatment between primary and secondary schools and suggested that if we could not get any agreement on the powers of school governing bodies the matter should be left for the local education authorities themselves to decide <e> <s> if in fact that is the wish and it is certainly not a matter which we as a <e>", "<cs> i do not think that there is any disagreement between us on what the noble lords lord parry and lord taylor of blackburn are saying <e> <s> we all know that local government units became larger under the reorganisation of <e> <s> what was pembrokeshire is now known i think as dyfed and it consists of three counties <e> <s> my pronounciation may not be quite correct but i know where the area is <e> <s> the government absolutely accept the importance of the smaller unit the school unit the school governing bodies and that is what all this matter is about and bringing parents and teachers on to governing bodies for the first time <e> <s> i cannot see how government would become less remote if the secretary of state had to approve these articles rather than the local education authority which in this context is of course much nearer than the secretary of state <e> <s> therefore i think that we should all agree on this <e>", "<cs> i should like to say absolutely at the outset how important the government regard the position of special schools to be <e> <s> may i also make it quite clear that clause of course applies the provision of school government to special schools <e> <s> it also includes special schools where possible in a hospital with slightly different provisions because the circumstances are slightly different as everyone who is familiar with these schools will know <e> <s> however we have gone as far as we can <e>", "<cs> i think undoubtedly there was considerable consultation <e> <s> i was not myself a member of the warnock committee but i have no doubt that voluntary bodies gave evidence to that committee and that they were consulted <e> <s> but when the government come to legislate upon an important issue like this i think it would be wrong for us to agree to an amendment which concerns a non-maintained school which is run by an organisation such as doctor barnardos or the national institutes for the blind or the deaf without consulting them <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord lord taylor would accept that <e>", "<cs> may i first apologise to the noble baroness lady masham <e> <s> i am sorry that i did not answer her question <e> <s> the fact is that all non-maintained special schools must have governing bodies as a condition of being recognised as special schools under the handicapped pupils and special schools regulations of <e> <s> so i apologise to her for not giving that information <e> <s> of course i have listened very carefully to what she and the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth have said on this subject <e>", "<cs> and i think if i may say so that this is right <e> <s> we should be greatly criticised for introducing legislation and not having discussions with the bodies concerned which are obviously crucial to these schools <e> <s> we should be legislating upon the schools without discussing with the people most concerned with them <e> <s> but that is in no way to get away from the essential point with which the committee is concerned <e>", "<cs> no we have not had the discussions and i would not wish to pursue this matter further <e> <s> i am most grateful to my noble friend lord vaizey for agreeing to withdraw this amendment and i hope that with those assurances the committee will accept that we shall certainly take these points into consideration on a future bill <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to what the noble lord lord beaumont has said in moving his amendment which i understand is a paving amendment for no <e> <s> <e> <s> as he will know the model instrument of governors for county schools does in fact provide what he would like to achieve and this represents standard practice throughout <e>", "<cs> i intervene in this debate because i should like to make a <e>", "<cs> about speeches ago i was last on my feet arguing a point <e> <s> i will try to pick up where i left off <e> <s> i am perfectly well aware that this section of the bill does not deal with the school curriculum <e> <s> i made the point because it is the other half of the argument and we ought not to lose sight of what is going on and what the staff of the school could do <e> <s> i make it because i do not recognise that this section of the bill is concerned with school governors <e>", "<cs> if that is the case there is nothing in the bill to prevent that from happening <e> <s> what we are arguing for as my noble friend lord bellwin made perfectly clear in his remarks is the least prescription and the maximum flexibility <e> <s> what noble lords opposite are arguing for is a much more prescriptive form of governing body in which there would be less flexibility and in which local authorities would be bound to find these suitable representatives for every single school <e>", "<cs> i entirely understand the view of the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> it is her view that this amendment should be made and if she takes that view she must press it <e> <s> perhaps i used i accept the remarks of the noble viscount lord simon the wrong word when i said that the amendment was prescriptive <e> <s> at the risk of repetition i would say again what my noble friend lord bellwin said that in relation to school governors everybody has ideas as to who would be the right sort of representative person to have on a governing body <e> <s> it is perfectly clear from the later amendments that there are all sorts of other ideas including having a pupil on the governing body <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord beaumont is asking for two parent governors in voluntary aided schools <e> <s> subsection of the bill provides as in the case of county schools that only one of these parents needs to be elected from the body of the parents <e> <s> the noble lord <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to strengthen the point made by lord beaumont on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness lady david will accept that the bill as drafted ensures that there will be two parent governors in voluntary aided schools <e> <s> what she is saying is that the parent governor appointed by the foundation should be able to serve beyond the moment at which his child has left the school but that the length of time beyond which the parent should serve would be limited <e>", "<cs> we intend to see that it will be a short period of time <e> <s> however if we were to accept the amendment as drafted it would mean that a parent with more than one child in the school would have to cease to be a governor not more than months after the eldest child left the school notwithstanding the fact that one or more children were still in the school <e> <s> therefore the amendment as worded would not have the desired effect <e>", "<cs> it would not be done by identifying the particular parent <e> <s> it would be undertaken through the instruments of government which would lay down the period of time <e>", "<cs> i should make clear that in the case of voluntary schools the secretary of state makes the instrument <e> <s> he can lay down the period of time <e> <s> we are arguing a narrow point on which in principle we are agreed <e> <s> perhaps the noble baroness will allow me to write to her setting out how this matter will work <e>", "<cs> the way in which it will work is that the secretary of state will make instruments of government for voluntary schools <e> <s> we are committed to the principle of two parents on these <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether this is a convenient moment as we have just completed this amendment to adjourn the committee stage of the education bill for one hour <e>", "<cs> i can give the noble lord lord stewart of fulham an assurance on this point <e> <s> the amendment is quite unnecessary <e> <s> parent throughout the bill has the meaning ascribed to it by section of the education act which says <e>", "<cs> yes i am glad to give that assurance and i shall cover the matter in my letter <e>", "<cs> the particular point raised in this amendment is i think slightly different from the point upon which i said that i would write to the noble baroness <e> <s> however i can assure her that the amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> the bill as i indicated to the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley earlier provides that the governing body of a voluntary aided or special agreement school must include a parent appointed as a foundation governor under subsection <e>", "<cs> i must confess that when i saw this amendment i did not quite understand the purpose of the noble lord lord stewart in tabling it but i now understand that he wants an explanation as to what this clause really means <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord brooks of tremorfa seems to feel that i am unable to say anything on this amendment <e> <s> it is not that i am unable to say anything but rather than i feel that we have had rather a diffuse discussion <e> <s> it has gone backwards and forwards on a number of issues which are not really relevant to the point at issue <e> <s> the government have designed a bill in order to have by statute school governing bodies and we have decided as a matter of principle that there should be the minimum prescription about them <e> <s> we have proposed to include parents which the noble lord lord james of rusholme may feel is a little trendy but which we believe recognises what is a great social fact of today <e> <s> we have included teachers because we believe in the importance of the teachers as the backbone of the education system and we recognise for all the arguments that have been adduced on this matter the importance of the teachers as part of school life <e>", "<cs> i have of course listened very carefully to all the arguments that have been put up on this amendment <e> <s> may i say right away that the warnock proposals do not in fact apply to this amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth would appreciate when i made this point earlier that in fact we have included maintained special schools in the governing body provisions under this clause <e> <s> what we were talking about before were the non-maintained special schools and that is a quite separate issue one which would come under our proposals that we hope to present to parliament later in the form of a bill concerned with the warnock report <e>", "<cs> that is a very splendid welsh argument <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i would put it in that way <e> <s> however at this time of night i do not intend to debate greek logic <e> <s> in setting out all our proposals about government we have said that there should be two parents and two teachers and this will apply to special schools <e> <s> there would be two parents of children in the school who would obviously have first-hand and close experience of dealing with their own handicapped children who are in the school <e> <s> there would also be two teachers of the special school again two persons with close and very detailed knowledge of the school <e>", "<cs> the answer to that question is that our intention where possible is that there should always be two teachers <e> <s> perhaps i should write to the noble baroness if there were to be special schools of a smaller size than that but it would be our intention that every <e>", "<cs> first i should like to answer the point made by the noble baroness lady masham of ilton <e> <s> in fact i realise of course the question she was asking <e> <s> where it is a small special school under the provisions of clause there would only be one teacher governor because it has fewer than pupils <e> <s> that would be the position <e> <s> i am sorry that i misled her and i wish to correct that right away <e>", "<cs> i shall take it as a compliment that he thinks i am sufficiently clever to think of it but odd as it may seem to him and to other noble lords opposite i and my colleagues frequently listen to what is said in this house <e> <s> we listen particularly to the experts of whom there are a great many and i do not number myself as an expert on this subject but as somebody who is just very interested in it and particularly on the question of handicapped children and handicapped adults <e> <s> there are many people in the house who know a great deal about it and one theme which has run like a common thread throughout it is the idea that everybody should be treated as far as possible in the same way <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what the noble lord lord davies of leek has said on this matter <e> <s> if he looks further down clause he will see that subsection would of course permit the inclusion of a representative of the non-teaching staff or any other person who was thought appropriate to be a member of the school governing body <e> <s> i think that he would find that if the school governors or the local education authority wished to include a representative from the non-teaching staff they could do so under that particular subsection <e>", "<cs> it is very good of the noble lord lord davies of leek to enlarge my vocabulary <e> <s> i shall certainly read <e>", "<cs> in the provisions that we have made on school government there is nothing whatever to prevent any authority that wishes to have pupil governors from putting them on governing bodies <e> <s> the provisions have been so drawn as to allow this <e> <s> it is for the education authority to decide in its own local circumstances whether or not there should be pupil governors on the governing body of a school <e> <s> we left it in this way and i must say that i was surprised when i saw this amendment because it is directly contrary to the view taken by the last administration in the consideration of their education bill in committee last year when they did not support this proposal <e>", "<cs> i think i am quoting the noble lord lord davies exactly when i recall that he said i am dominated by the logic of this amendment and i only wish really that he was <e> <s> the truth is that i am not sure that he is from what he has said <e> <s> it is in fact not a permissive power he is asking for because as the noble baroness lady masham has quite rightly pointed out his amendment says shall include so this is not permissive but obligatory in this sense <e>", "<cs> it seems to me now that we have reached seven minutes to eleven oclock that there is not time to do justice to a further amendment tonight <e> <s> if it is the wish of your lordships therefore i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord stewart of fulham said that he wants to know what are the governments intentions in regard to this particular subsection of the clause <e> <s> the effect of his amendment would be to hasten the implementation of this part of the bill regarding changes in the government of schools <e> <s> if carried the amendment would have the effect of applying this part of the act immediately it is brought into effect <e> <s> in all the matters that we are considering in the bill we arc having regard to the effects of public expenditure and we recognise that there attaches to the school government provisions the possibility of increased expenditure by way of clerking of committees and so on i sec that we have other amendments on this matter <e> <s> it would only be right to draw the committees attention to this point <e>", "<cs> at this stage i would not wish to be drawn into stating a timetable on this <e> <s> we have said that we want to bring this provision into effect as quickly as resources will allow and we certainly would not expect it to drag on for several years with nothing happening <e> <s> clearly we shall move in close consultation with our colleagues with regard to how the local authorities wish to proceed on these matters <e> <s> i should not wish to go beyond what i have said <e> <s> we do not wish this matter to be unduly delayed but on the other hand with regard to all that we are to say on all the subsequent clauses of the bill we recognise the economic constraints under which we are all working <e>", "<cs> i understand perfectly the point the noble baroness lady david is making <e> <s> in inserting this particular subsection we have tried to ensure that governing bodies by having one parent and one teacher from each of a number of grouped schools will not become too large <e> <s> it is our intention eventually to move to the stage at which every school has its own governing body <e> <s> we have had this arrangement whereby two can be grouped together and if more than two are to be grouped together this can be done only with the approval of the secretary of state <e> <s> but it is possible under the proposals <e> <s> if the amendment of the noble baroness were to be carried this would then mean three parents and three teachers on the governing body and we would be getting a much larger governing body <e> <s> while i see the point she is making i hope she will accept that we hope that these are as it were transitional arrangements and that we do not want governing bodies which could become too large <e> <s> i hope that with that explanation the noble baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the position we should like to arrive at is that each school would have its own governing body but we accept that in the meantime there will be cases where it would be more sensible to group <e> <s> local authorities do not have to group <e> <s> there is no compulsion about it but under the bill they are allowed to group two schools together <e> <s> my noble friend lord bellwin identified the sort of situation we were thinking of in regard to an infant and a junior school which would be an obviously sensible grouping <e> <s> many of us can think of instances where it might be sensible to group for example an infant a junior and a primary school together <e> <s> this would be possible but it requires the agreement of the secretary of state because we do not wish to encourage larger grouping <e>", "<cs> under the terms of the bill there would be a governing <e>", "<cs> on this particular point i think the noble lord lord stewart would recognise that on these matters we should consult quite widely about the grounds on which the regulations would be made <e> <s> these would be subject to consultation with those who are concerned <e> <s> i think it would be difficult to lay down in statute form as the noble lord has suggested the list of matters that might have to be considered <e>", "<cs> it may be for the convenience of the committee if i speak <e>", "<cs> i wanted to clear this point with the noble baroness lady stewart but i will answer the point on clause <e> <s> the difficulty that we find ourselves in in this new clause that the noble lord lord mishcon has proposed is that he is laying down the duties in relation to school governors in the six different subsections that he has proposed <e> <s> when we introduced this bill my right honourable friend the secretary of state made it quite clear that we did not intend at this stage to legislate about the powers of governing bodies <e> <s> indeed he may recall that the former secretary of state mrs shirley williams acknowledged the difficulties about legislating on powers when she introduced the education bill in another place <e>", "<cs> i think the first and most important point to remember is that if this amendment were to be accepted it would of course apply both to county and voluntary-aided schools <e> <s> as the noble lord will appreciate the position of governors of county schools is rather different from that of governors of voluntary-aided schools because in particular governors of those schools are in law personally liable for their actions and could be thus held to have a pecuniary interest in almost any matter even though in most cases any cost arising would in practice be met by the maintaining authority or from trust funds or would be covered by insurance <e> <s> there is therefore a difference between the two types of governors <e>", "<cs> of course i am fully aware of the point made by the noble lord lord shinwell both about cases of corruption in local government and the issues that could possibly arise over school governing bodies though it is much less likely than other possibilities <e> <s> perhaps <e>", "<cs> as this discussion has progressed i have become conscious <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is quite right in saying this is an important amendment <e> <s> it does show the divide <e>", "<cs> yes i take that point but what we have done is not only give parents the right to express a choice but in clause we have given the right of automatic recoupment <e> <s> the noble baroness will be familiar enough with the difficulties of recoupment of costs from one education authority to another to realise that clause by itself would be quite ineffective without clause which gives the guarantee of automatic recoupment <e> <s> this will give a great deal of choice of schools to a number of parents <e> <s> that is the first group of parents <e>", "<cs> i am sure it is very unwise of me to embark on an argument about teaching in welsh with the noble lord lord heycock <e> <s> all i am saying is that i believe all parents in wales also ought to be able to express a choice and under our bill they will be able to do so whether in gwynedd or glamorgan <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord had restrained himself until i had finished my argument i would have answered this point and i will answer it now <e> <s> the parents who actually have choice at the moment are those who can afford to pay a point made frequently in your lordships house and one that no doubt will be made at greater length later this evening <e> <s> i have known rich parents sending their children to maintained schools who have decided to buy a house in the catchment area of the most popular school <e> <s> they too are in the fortunate position of exercising choice <e> <s> but a lot of other parents who are not well off and who do not choose to send their children to independent schools and are unable to buy a house and move where they wish surely are entitled to exercise choice <e> <s> i think it is a deplorable attitude to a lot of parents to take the view that they are unable to exercise choice <e> <s> if the noble lord lord brooks looks at clause he will see that subsection is qualified by subsection <e> <s> this answers the point made by the noble lord lord alexander <e> <s> subsection <e>", "<cs> i should be delighted <e>", "<cs> my lords clause the first of this whole sequence of clauses is designed to enable a parent to express a preference <e> <s> i have already indicated that because of the recoupment provisions the parents may express a preference in another authoritys area <e> <s> at the same time clause requires information about schools so that a parent can make an informed choice <e> <s> clause contains the appeal procedures <e> <s> i am very sorry that i have caused the noble lord lord donaldson to lose his temper <e> <s> indeed i hope that he will not do so <e> <s> i can assure him that i shall not lose my temper no matter how cross he becomes <e>", "<cs> first i should like to finish what i was saying to the noble lord lord donaldson <e> <s> i believe that we are fulfilling a commitment <e> <s> i accept and it would not be right for me to say other that we cannot provide complete parental choice for everybody but that does not prevent us from trying to give as much as we can <e> <s> there is no doubt at all that as parents nowadays take a much greater interest in their childrens education in a rather more professional and more sophisticated way than they did in for example it is quite right that they should have these provisions included in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i fully understand the question asked by the noble lord <e> <s> it is an absolute right of a parent to express a prefernce and that stands in clause <e> <s> it is an absolute right to have information about the school in order that the preference shall be an informed preference <e> <s> i have said that one cannot guarantee that every preference will be fulfilled but we are going as far as we can in that regard <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry to interrupt the noble baroness but when we discuss clause which deals with appeals procedure she will see that that is not the provision in the bill <e>", "<cs> the answer is yes because it would be contained under clause and the phrase <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure that i am with the noble lord lord taylor of blackburn over his question <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord taylor is quite right <e> <s> i thank him very much for drawing it to my attention <e>", "<cs> as i understand this amendment and i think there are other amendments linked to it what the noble baroness lady david is asking for is a return to the proposals on planned admission limits which were in her own administrations bill <e> <s> one of the difficulties which we found when looking at these proposals was that once the admission limits had been set to particular schools they were in fact unchallengeable <e> <s> we feel that this is not an acceptable situation for parents to be in <e> <s> we believe this to be arbitrary and contrary to the best interests of the parents <e>", "<cs> among the published provisions on schools which they will have to give will be the numbers of children that they admit and this will be one of the criteria <e> <s> everyone will know that this is one of the criteria to be laid down <e> <s> nobody is arguing that there should be sick schools <e> <s> no one would wish to have that at all <e> <s> but to argue to the contrary of that that every school should have a planned admission limit and that parents will not be able in any way to alter this limit once it is set regardless of any arguments that they may be able to adduce because the number is set is not a satisfactory situation <e> <s> i cannot believe that the noble baroness herself thinks that it is <e>", "<cs> my noble friends amendment is prompted by a concern which i recognise of some members of the local authority associations to ensure that they are fully informed where pupils from their area are being educated in the schools of other authorities <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will accept the explanation that we believe that his amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> authorities will know what their neighbouring authorities are doing because of the information that neighbouring authorities will be required to publish under clause of the bill <e> <s> it has not been a requirement of authorities before this bill and therefore it will be published and each authority will know what its neighbour is doing <e> <s> there is nothing to prevent local education authorities discussing further one with anotherbut <e>", "<cs> it may be for the convenience of the committee if the house do now resume <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i find it very difficult to add anything as regards this amendment to what i said when we discussed amendment no <e> <s> moved by the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> these are a series of linked amendments on planned admission limits <e> <s> i indicated then that our attitude to planned admission limits was not that of the previous government <e> <s> there are only two new points that i can contribute as regards this particular amendment <e> <s> for us there would be two difficult features of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> one is that the limits for aided and special agreement schools will be determined by the local education authority a restriction on their freedom which was rejected last year because of course under the terms of our bill admissions will be determined by the governors <e> <s> we feel that this is a desirable advance on the matter <e> <s> the second feature is that limits would apply <e>", "<cs> i think that there are two answers to the matters raised by the noble baroness <e> <s> the first is that under the provisions of clause dealing with information a school will give the numbers that it expects to admit <e> <s> that will be one of the characteristics of the school so that people would know it <e> <s> it is not an absolute number because a parent would have the right to go to an appeal committee on such a matter <e> <s> the local authority will also have to consider the efficient use of resources and theefficient use of education terms which i am sure will be familiar to the noble baroness and others because they are after all taken from the act <e>", "<cs> exactly but many of these matters are difficult to define <e> <s> i accept the other point that rolls will fall <e> <s> we all know that there will be a million fewer children in the school population between now and <e> <s> one of the consequences of that will be that many schools will have to close simply because the numbers inevitably fall <e> <s> what we are saying as regards this matter is that one cannot say as is sometimes said as regards these difficult decisions that if a school is over-subscribed and very popular we must either close it or split it up and distribute its pupils around a number of other places an argument that i have heard advanced in some of the school closure programmes when obviously these are good schools or schools at any rate that are greatly desired by the parents which suggests that the parents think they are good schools <e> <s> therefore i think that we should look at the whole question of closures and all these other matters on their merits <e> <s> we take into account the official information given about the school and we take into account the authorities efficient use of resources and efficient use of education <e> <s> this is not exactly a jigsaw puzzle that we are spelling out explaining or putting together in a bill but we are allowing a certain amount of flexibility <e>", "<cs> naturally we have given a great deal of attention to this clause and i can assure the noble lord that it has all been discussed with the local authority associations and that they have accepted it and the way in which it will work <e> <s> they think that it will enable local education authorities to plan sensibly <e> <s> it is for that reason that i think it is perfectly possible to give both a chance for a parent to express a preference and for the local authority to plan sensibly <e> <s> i am not at all sure that i followed the point about the comprehensive school in the <e>", "<cs> i understand from what the noble lord lord stewart has <e>", "<cs> having listened to the noble baroness lady david saying that we have gone too far and to the noble lord lord beaumont saying that we have gone nothing like far enough i think we may conclude that somewhere in the centre we have got it about right <e> <s> may i say that when the noble lord lord alexander said and i hope i am quoting him correctly that the main purpose of this bill is economy that is not quite true <e> <s> one of the purposes of this bill is to face the reality of our economic situation as a country <e> <s> to us the most important parts of the bill are those on school government and parental preference <e> <s> these clauses represent clauses and and it would be quite wrong to think that the bill is concerned only with economics <e>", "<cs> the intention regarding the appeals committee which is under schedule is that it will have an independent chairman and that those who serve on it will not be councillors who took the original decision although they could he other members of the education committee or other members of the council <e> <s> we must recognise that the decision of the appeals committee will be binding on the local authority and as in so many of these cases it would he quite wrong we believe to set up a committee with those powers which could override the elected authority in circumstances in which they were not in a position because they had to take ultimate responsibility for the education system to be a party to that decision <e> <s> we hope that in the <e>", "<cs> no it would notit would be a separate committee <e>", "<cs> i would refer the noble lord lord heycock to schedule which we shall be discussing and which sets out the details of this <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley <e> <s> i am very pleased that he and his colleagues recognise that there is a real purpose in this section of the bill <e>", "<cs> i have many more friends than that i am glad to say <e> <s> i hope we are friends but i have other friends as well <e> <s> this appeals procedure <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to hear it <e> <s> it is obviously a very good system <e> <s> when we are talking about large conurbations where there are a great many problems with a great deal of choice of opportunity of different types of school to go to parents feel strongly if they do not get an opportunity to put their case to an appeal committee <e> <s> i appreciate the sincerity of the noble lord lord boyle <e> <s> when he was minister he had to deal with these mattersbut he himself has said that that was in <e> <s> one fact is that as time has gone on more parents have become more involved in the whole question of the schools and when we have the question of a variety of comprehensive schools that in itself makes the whole issue of choice more important <e>", "<cs> if i may clear up a misunderstanding they are committees of the council they are not sub-committees <e>", "<cs> i should like to answer the rather narrower point raised by the noble lord lord davies of leek about the council on tribunals <e> <s> in fact this was added to the bill in another place and as i understand it the council on tribunals which consists only of about people in fact would be looking at the way the system works and would have nothing whatever to say on the particular merits of the case <e> <s> anything that it wished to discuss about any particular appeal committee and system and how it worked it would discuss through the local authority associations <e> <s> the chances that any one of its members would be visiting an appeal committee as there are only about members in all i should think would he very small indeed <e> <s> so i do not think one needs to feel that in any way we are setting up great legalistic committees <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the amendment seeks to require local education authorities and governors to give preference in their published policy to siblings and to those children who can most easily get to the school <e> <s> with reference in particular to the first part of the amendment dealing with siblings as a generality where there is already one child at a school schools tend to look favourably upon other members of the family <e> <s> this is a general rule with which i think we would all agree <e>", "<cs> my advice is that this amendment seeks to require local authorities to give preference <e> <s> they would not in those circumstances be compelled always to do this <e> <s> we are asking schools both county and voluntary to give information about themselves to parents <e> <s> what would be required would be information about their admissions policy <e> <s> it is not for us to lay down in statute what that policy should be <e> <s> this amendment is seeking to give information to the parents <e> <s> clearly the information would be different in the case of county schools and voluntary schools <e> <s> parents are interested in the variety of the schools and in the differences between them <e> <s> it is necessary that there should be a statement about admissions policy although not what that policy should be <e>", "<cs> i always listen with great care to my honourable friend dr boyson <e> <s> i do not think the serious point about this amendment is the drafting and for tonights purposes we could leave that argument aside <e> <s> i put it in because i thought it was only right to give the noble baroness lady stewart all the arguments that we were adducing about this amendment but i do not think the importance is in the drafting <e> <s> the important thing is the matter of principle <e>", "<cs> the amendment is seeking to find out what it is that we are proposing to put in the regulations and to debate generally the whole question of information that schools would produce <e> <s> what we are seeking in this clause is that information will be given to parents as a basis for their choice of schools in which their children will have to be educated and this should not be left entirely to the discretion of leas or governors in the case of voluntary schools <e> <s> at the present time this is in fact the situation <e> <s> the situation is not entirely satisfactory <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> the exact details of how it will be done will be still subject to consultation <e> <s> whether or not it was done by the local education authority or by individual schools i think would be a matter for discussion and the exact form is something we have not yet determined upon <e> <s> clearly we would need to discuss it <e> <s> certainly we have not ruled out that the publication would be by the local education authority <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord lord shinwell <e> <s> in fact what we are discussing is clause of the bill which makes the important proposal that schools must publish information about themselves and the amendment that has just been moved by the noble baroness lady david is asking for information about what will be contained in the regulations which will govern the type of information which the schools must produce about themselves <e>", "<cs> it might be for the convenience of the committee if i answered the point which was raised by the noble lord lord avebury on a former amendment because we did not conclude that discussion as the committee would have wished <e> <s> we are not suggesting the term raw results a term which was used by the noble lord lord stewart of fulham and the noble lord lord james of rusholme <e> <s> we have not yet reached any final conclusion on the form which the publication will take <e> <s> however we should like to do two things <e> <s> i entirely agree with the point which has been made on all sides of the committee that parents need to be informed about the staff of a school and the things which it feels it does well <e> <s> a school may have a member of staff who is particularly good at music or at drama or at sports <e> <s> if that is so it should say so <e> <s> that is the sort of information that parents like to have <e> <s> it should certainly provide information about the staffand we are over-emphasising examination results <e> <s> that is just a part of the whole and it would be quite wrong to think that that is the one thing that will be decisive <e>", "<cs> much of this information is in fact already published <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that the building would be a capital cost <e> <s> the capitation allowance is an annual sum which is allowable through the rate-support grant and partly through the rates for books and equipmentequipment is quite widely defined as the sort of <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lady faithfull for making this point because i entirely accept from the noble baroness lady david that it does seem unexpected that having asked for the publication of information about other schools we should have excluded nursery schools <e> <s> we have clone so because we have considered whether information about nursery schools should be published in some different form <e> <s> however we concluded after considering the matter that the balance of advantage would lie in not requiring local authorities to publish this information and we would take that view precisely for the reasons given by my noble friend lady faithfull <e>", "<cs> i must say that i had not noticed that the clock had not moved <e> <s> no doubt time has stood still during the committee proceedings on this bill <e> <s> we have all been so engrossed in what we are doing that at least we have not been watching the clock <e>", "<cs> may i say at the outset of my reply that i feel a great <e>", "<cs> i absolutely take that point <e> <s> i will try to explain in as much detail as i can why it is that we are in this particular position <e> <s> there are three parts of the education act which apply to special schools and special education <e> <s> they are sections <e>", "<cs> my understanding and again i must be very frank with the committee over this matter is that section of the act was inserted into that bill at precisely this kind of stage of the proceedings of the act <e> <s> it has led to a number of complications and as the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth rightly says it has not been implemented <e> <s> that is because the warnock committee has been sitting and furthermore as it stands it raises the legal complications i have outlined <e> <s> those remain with us and in fact putting that into the bill has not had the effect that was desired <e> <s> now that we have had this debate and everyone recognises the strength of feeling here and the points that have been made these will all be taken into consideration and i hope it will not be too long before the house is able to debate a white paper on the warnock report <e> <s> but the section proposals show the kind of difficulties one gets into by taking an amendment at a particular stage without going into all the consequences of it <e> <s> it is for that reason that i have tried to explain as fully as i can to the committee the situation as i understand it <e>", "<cs> it is not as easy as that <e> <s> it sounds as though it should be straightforward but if we took that course we would ignore entirely the conceptual framework of the warnock report <e>", "<cs> of course not <e> <s> it is quite possible for the local authority in the area of my noble friend lord swinton to undertake all these matters <e> <s> it is possible for an authority to produce information and to have the non-statutory appeals system <e> <s> that is permissible <e> <s> we <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry it i have not made myself clear to the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> what i am saying is that if this amendment is carried we shall he placing on local education authorities the requirements under clauses to in this bill at the same time as they also have a statutory requirement under the education act <e> <s> if <e>", "<cs> it is not at all surprising that the report of mrs warnock did not include the proposals that we have put into our bill in clauses to <e> <s> mrs warnocks report was concerned with the provision for handicapped children but she could not possibly have anticipated what we were going to put into our bill <e>", "<cs> and if i may say so to noble lords opposite they have just been very critical of them <e> <s> so i really do not think that they are in a position to criticise what i am saying at the moment <e> <s> in what i have called the warnock bill we shall be talking about the new conceptual framework of mrs warnock and we shall as i have already indicated in the statement that <e>", "<cs> may i say two things to the noble lord lord vaizey <e> <s> so far as the introduction is concerned he said that one could solve the problem of the contradictions by the date upon which the bill is introduced <e> <s> the fact is that so long as there are two contradictory requirements on local education authorities no one will benefit from clauses to whether in ordinary schools or in special schools <e> <s> that will be the effect of pressing this amendment <e> <s> i have given as much of an assurance to the committee on the warnock proposals as i can and i have said that i will look <e>", "<cs> this amendment which has been moved by my noble friend lord ridley would provide that the process of publishing proposals <e>", "<cs> we accept that there is a great divide between both sides of the committee on the assisted places scheme <e> <s> perhaps i may correct what i think are clearly two misunderstandings about the scheme <e> <s> it is not that i expect to convince the noble lord lord donaldson but i think it is right that it should go down on the record <e> <s> he first asked how this scheme would apply <e> <s> we have in fact published our proposals on the income scale and assisted places will be available only to parents who qualify for the income scale and there can be no question of anybody who does not qualify on the income scale having an assisted place <e>", "<cs> i am sorry for not giving the noble lord that information but it was not clear from his amendment that that was what he required <e> <s> we see the scheme working in this way at present a number of schools have applied to join the schemethey will be subject to approval by the inspectorate as having the right facilities and able to offer the kind of education we are talking about <e> <s> we expect the parents will apply when the schools are approved the list is published and the information is knownthat they will be subject to an income scalethat they will be subject to the test applied by the school to make sure we are talking about academically qualified children <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has asked me how we see children being selected for this scheme and how it would be known whether they were academically suitable <e> <s> we see the selection taking place through the school itself and its selection procedures <e> <s> we would recognise that its selection procedures were of a sufficiently rigorous standard because for the purposes of the scheme the school itself would have had to be approved by the department and in that sense it would mean the inspectorate <e> <s> clearly if for example a school did not have a sixth form it would not qualify <e> <s> similarly it might not have a good academic record it might not offer a good spread of subjects at a level it might not be the kind of school that offered what would be accepted as a high academic standard as measured by its examination results the a level subjects that it could teach and its record <e> <s> all these facts are available and can be sought <e> <s> attributes along those lines would be the kind we would he looking for <e>", "<cs> i do not think that we see there being in any sense a kind of national plus in this instance <e> <s> i think it would he found that the schools we are thinking of are not schools which are scratching around for pupils to go to them <e> <s> on the whole they are schools which are already well subscribedpeople think highly of them and they are therefore in a position to command a reasonably high entrance requirement <e> <s> we would see them as setting their own entrance requirementsand in this way we see the entrants being taken at the level of the school <e>", "<cs> i see the scheme working in the following way <e> <s> the schools will be selected and a very large proportion of those that have expressed an <e>", "<cs> we really ought to get the financing of this scheme straight <e> <s> the proposal under the bill is that it will start not before september which would he the earliest possible time at a level of million <e> <s> within the whole of the context of the public expenditure we have been discussing and within the whole of the context of the public expenditure in the bill this scheme is not operating at all <e> <s> i quoted in my second reading speech that this year we are spending million on those pupils who are still in the sixth form of the direct grant schools i am not sure that i understood the noble lord lord parrys last question but it is important to recognise that while we still have pupils in the sixth forms of direct grant schools no maintained school is currently being affected in any way by the fact that those pupils are still there and are being paid for <e> <s> therefore the whole question of whether or not these schools can exist side by side does not arise <e> <s> they are existing side by side perfectly happily <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure what the noble lord lord parry means by a school being enriched by the scheme <e> <s> the most the school would gain by the scheme would be to have one pupil or more pupils as the case might he <e> <s> suppose for the sake of argument the school decided and it would he for the school to determine how many places it would take up that it would take up pupils it would then have pupils paid for as assisted places <e> <s> the sort of schools which would he considered under <e>", "<cs> almost certainly the child who is going to be eligible for the assisted place will be in a primary school <e> <s> it could well be as the noble viscount lord simon has suggested that the school itself might suggest that the child should qualify for one or it could be the parent <e> <s> either route would be perfectly acceptable under the scheme <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord stewart is clearly determined to bring us back to the central matter of principle about the assisted places scheme <e> <s> he has explained why he dislikes it <e> <s> may i illustrate from my personal experience one reason why i think we should support it <e> <s> he will perhaps know that i indicated earlier that my husband was a don <e> <s> recently his college has spent a lot of time meeting heads of comprehensive schools in order to attract more children from comprehensive schools to his college <e> <s> at a recent meeting one head teacher said i am sorrywe cannot teach the children to the entrance requirements <e> <s> in order for them to be sent there you must lower your standards <e> <s> the outcome is of no concern to us <e> <s> i am saying that there are comprehensive schools which cannot meet these kinds of standards <e> <s> it does not matterwe are not concerned about the schools but about the opportunities for the child <e> <s> this does not happen all over the country <e> <s> i do not tell this to score points off comprehensive schools <e> <s> they have great difficulties which i am prepared to accept <e> <s> we are concerned about able children who are not getting always the opportunities that they should get <e> <s> i think it right at a time when we need to develop the best brains of our country that we should give everybody these kinds of opportunity <e>", "<cs> i have never denied it <e> <s> we have said consistently that when the scheme is fully operational we expect it will cost something like that <e> <s> but i was not prepared to accept from the noble lord lord parry that it was going to cost million next year <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> the point that was being made was that the school was unable to teach up to the standard that was required <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should say to the noble lord lord parry that i have not those figures with me <e> <s> there are two separate figures he is asking for one is what the government paid to the direct grant schools and the other is what the local authorities paid through the pooling arrangements for the take-up <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be for the convenience of the <e>", "<cs> yes i do apologise <e> <s> the answer is that we have not yet fixed an upper limit for the fee per year <e> <s> i hope the noble baroness will understand when i say that of course the amount which would have to be paid for an assisted place would depend upon the income of the parents <e>", "<cs> so it would not he the poorest who would have to pay the full fee <e> <s> but the answer is no we have not yet settled it <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord spens has said he was good enough to write to me on this subject and tell me that he would in fact be raising this matter on this clause in the bill <e> <s> the difficulty about this proposal is that the scheme that we have in mind is for children of high academic ability who would in fact benefit from the sort of academic education which the former direct grant grammar schools and other good non-maintained schools could provide <e> <s> the fact is that the direct grant scheme did not provide for pupils receiving primary education and much as i sympathise with the aims and achievements particularly of choir schools without which the whole country would be greatly impoverished i am afraid that i cannot hold out any hope of the scheme at this point being extended to choir schools <e> <s> i am quite sure that the noble lord lord donaldson does not support this in principle because of course his government have kept the direct grant scheme for the yehudi menuhin school and the royal ballet school <e> <s> so it is not in fact that he disapproves of it in principle but that he does not agree with applying it for academic talentsonly for music and dancing <e>", "<cs> wish to make it clear that boarding fees are not included in the scheme at all <e>", "<cs> i see that it would be difficult in these circumstances because the assisted place would be paid for on the day fees it would only be paid for a person who had qualified on the incomes scale and it would seem to be difficult for a person qualifying on the incomes scale to afford the boarding fees <e>", "<cs> no we have not said that <e>", "<cs> i feel that we have had one of these debates calculated even at am to stimulate the entire committee <e> <s> it is something about which we all feel strongly <e> <s> the assisted places scheme to which as i indicated at second reading we attach great importance was a commitment in our manifesto was repeated in the queens speech and is now translated into legislation <e> <s> i have listened with interest to all the speeches made about it <e> <s> i am very grateful for the remarks of the noble lord lord morison and grateful too for the remarks by the right reverend prelate the bishop of norwich who speaks from a great deal of experience in these matters and is very knowledgeable from his own personal experience of the maintained system the direct grant system and the independent schools <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i have not quite answered the noble viscount precisely <e> <s> at this hour it is sometimes a little difficult to have all the points correctly <e> <s> however what he is saying which i am sure is true is that whereas some inevitably do very well others do not do as well <e> <s> what we are attempting to do in this scheme is in fact to extend opportunity <e> <s> it is completely ironic when the noble lord wedderburn talks about class distinctions and divisive monopoly and all this particularly in the house of lords <e> <s> after all both he and i are life peers and no doubt some years ago never expected to find ourselves in this circumstance at all <e>", "<cs> as the scheme becomes known we shall of course publish the list of schools so the noble lord will be able to sec where they all are <e> <s> it is our intention that we should get a good geographical spread and that it will apply to both boys and girls <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may make an administrative point as it were <e>

the noble baroness lady faithfull on behalf of social workers and the importance of having social workers who have had some experience of life and who have been trained <e> <s> i understand the point made by the noble lord lord evans of claughton regarding barristers solicitors and other professional people including accountants <e>", "<cs> i have discussed this matter at considerable length with my colleagues and it would not be right for me to pretend to the committee that i could take this back and bring something forward on report <e> <s> i regret it for the <e>", "<cs> i must begin by answering the point of the noble baroness lady jeger about the information that east sussex has been sending out <e> <s> i was not aware of it <e> <s> there is nothing illegal in local authorities preparing for the legislation that might come <e> <s> if the legislation does not come and your lordships are perfectly entitled to vote as you think to be right in the course of dealing with this legislation then i recognise that it would be wasted <e> <s> we have said to local authorities that we are asking for economies this year and at their request giving them these powers over the non-educational parts of the budgetthat is school meals milk and transport <e> <s> so far as school meals are concerned which was the point of the circular which the noble baroness mentioned parents would rightly complain if they had not been warned that the price of the school dinner <e>", "<cs> i would have been prepared to answer the point <e> <s> but the amendment that covered this point was not moved and i thought there was an anxiety to get on so it would be right to leave it <e> <s> i will let the noble lord know privately before report stage <e>", "<cs> perhaps it will be the wish of your lordships today to debate the principle of clause and i should like to suggest to my noble friend lord morris that at this time he should not press his amendment and that other noble lords might agree not to move their amendments in detail this afternoon but of course to speak to them and then we can move immediately to the principle of clause and take this on the clause stand part debate <e>", "<cs> it may be for the convenience of the committee if i intervene at this point to explain at the start of this debate the governments proposals on transport and the reasons for them <e> <s> as there are many of your lordships in the committee today who were not in the chamber when we had a debate on the bill at second reading i will briefly set out the present position on school transport <e> <s> under the present law a local education authority in effect need provide transport only between home and school for a pupil of compulsory school age who attends the nearest available school and whose journey exceeds the statutory walking distance defined as two miles for the child under years of age and three miles for the older child <e> <s> it is a <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble baroness <e> <s> would she not agree that that is precisely the position as it is now <e> <s> children living in towns within the -mile limit have in some cases to pay or pence a day to get to school whereas others go free <e>", "<cs> this is such an important matter of principle that perhaps your lordships will forgive me for raising it again <e> <s> the noble viscount lord simon says that there is not much inequity in towns and that the schools are quite close that there are many schools in towns and it is not very far to go <e> <s> the fact is that an enormous number of children living in towns today have to travel two miles or more and the full economic cost of town transport is very great <e> <s> it can be p p or p a day for a two-mile journey <e>", "<cs> i did not like to <e>", "<cs> we have had a long and very important debate this afternoon and i wish to say at the outset how greatly i have appreciated the sincerity of everybody who has spoken particularly my noble friend the duke of norfolk and the noble lord lord butler of saffron walden and i accept too that others feel very deeply about this matter <e> <s> i will deal immediately with two points <e> <s> first the noble baroness lady trumping-ton asked me whether if there are transport charges that will lead to more administrators <e> <s> clearly if transport charges are imposed there will have to be somebody to administer them but we should keep the facts straight <e> <s> the noble lord lord butler has not told me from where he got the figure of but we have no evidence of any local education authority contemplating employing that number of people <e> <s> if it was cumbria which was referred to in the <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> i am saying that by the time the local authorities have paid the extra administrative charges which i accept they will still make a saving and i believe one must accept that <e>", "<cs> yes to special schools because they have a discretion and they can be trusted to use that discretion which they have always used <e> <s> there is nothing whatever in the act which compels them to take children to special schools except over the three-mile limit and they have always done so and i have no reason for thinking they will not do so in future <e>", "<cs> i imagine they would take handicapped children to ordinary schools as well <e>", "<cs> we are now getting rather wide of the mark i really just wanted to talk about handicapped children <e> <s> i would commend to your lordships the very important speeches made by my noble friend lord ridley and the noble viscount lord amory <e> <s> all that the local authorities have asked for is power to make a charge if they believe in their local area that this is the right place in which to make the savings <e> <s> that is what we are talking about <e> <s> it is not a duty to charge it is giving local authorities the option to charge if they believe it is the right thing to do in their authority <e>", "<cs> so you left it out <e> <s> yes you may well laugh now <e> <s> you criticised me at second reading and said how much the country had had to save on education under the conservatives and i was able to show <e>", "<cs> no you may not at the moment and i was able to show that the labour government cut far more in than the conservative government are

us that it is because you are supporting the rural lobbies or the churches <e> <s> when you were in power you would have done it had you had the courage but you lacked the courage and it is always the case when the chips are down you will fight us when we are left to clear up the mess <e>", "<cs> goodness me <e> <s> i have upset the noble lord lord davies of leek because the truth of the matter is that no one has an alternative policy to this <e>", "<cs> i quite agree i shall take the noble lords advice and leave it alone except in this context it would not reach million for five or six years and it would not even reach that it could be brought in by order of the secretary of state <e> <s> we would not get the savings that we are looking for in which is what we are discussing by abolishing the assisted places scheme <e> <s> another noble lord i think it was the noble lord lord stewart of fulham said that we would do better to save on the national health service <e> <s> as he probably knows my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services is in fact expecting to reorganise it to get rid of one tier <e> <s> so the savings will be made <e> <s> however we are not in any event discussing that budget but rather the education budget <e>", "<cs> is not the correct procedure now for the deputy chairman to put the next amendment <e>", "<cs> may i repeat the decisions that were taken at the beginning <e>", "<cs> i ought to make it clear that the government cannot accept this amendment <e> <s> what the noble duke is proposing goes far beyond what the education act says is required <e> <s> he is also committing the government to further expenditure which for the reasons i have already enumerated we are unlikely to acquiesce in nor could we do so <e> <s> the terms of the noble dukes amendment include the words <e>", "<cs> if it would be for the convenience of the committee as it is now five minutes to seven oclock before we start on another subject perhaps the house might be resumed during the committees dinner break <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i must first of all apologise to the noble baroness lady david for not being in my place when she began her opening remarks on this amendment <e> <s> the purpose of her amendment is to oppose changing the current duty on local authorities to provide nursery education into a power to do so <e> <s> let me say at the start that i am one who believes very firmly in nursery education <e> <s> i have myself brought up three children and they all went to nursery schools and i believe they all benefited from it <e> <s> i believe in nursery education from the point of view of education not because mothers need to go to work <e> <s> it stands or falls on the educational issue and to be perfectly frank i think those who argue that we need nursery schools to allow women to go out to work have not always benefited the cause of nursery education <e> <s> indeed my record will show that when i was in local government i cannot remember whether it was or years on an education committee that authority provided six purpose-built nursery schools which admitted rising-fives and which did a great deal for the under-five provision <e> <s> so i hope that my record both as an individual as a mother and as a local councillor will show that i am someone who believes in nursery education <e>", "<cs> they were not being used by the local authority because of the economic situation in the country <e> <s> the reality of the situation was that they went down <e> <s> let me give the noble lord lord donaldson some comfort in this respect <e> <s> in they actually went up to million <e> <s> in the course of the last year money for new nursery school places has been provided and are expected to be provided in the year <e>", "<cs> i always enjoy the remarks of the noble lord lord parry and i hope that he will show me the letter after the debate <e> <s> the answer to the noble baroness lady seear is not that i believe there is an alternative namely transport or nursery schools but that local education authorities will now have to reexamine all their budgets <e> <s> many authorities which have hovered over the question of nursery education will decide that this is an area because it is outside compulsory school ages in which they can economise <e> <s> i deeply regret that <e> <s> that is one reason why i have fought over these painful decisions <e> <s> however i accept the will of the committee the matter has been decided <e> <s> but i am merely saying that having decided such a thing it is no use thinking that one can ask for a great deal more expenditure <e>", "<cs> i see the point which has been put to me but the fact is that it has been a duty since <e> <s> it has not operated in that way because <e>", "<cs> yes but if i may say so the noble baroness lady bacon has missed the point <e> <s> the proposals under clause must be read in conjunction with our proposals under clause <e> <s> under our proposals local authorities cannot just close nursery schools <e> <s> they can no more close nursery schools and we have passed clause so i hope we are all agreed that it is in the bill than they <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge that the position has been misunderstood <e> <s> everyone outside has assumed that we now think that nursery <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may return the compliment i am pleased the noble lord lord ross of marnock feels i have some redeeming features <e>", "<cs> my lords when i first saw this amendment i was slightly puzzled that the noble baroness should have put it down because as she said clause is a copy of the clause in her governments bill of <e> <s> therefore it seemed to me that it would be unexceptionable <e> <s> but i now recognise there is a further point that she is trying to make <e>", "<cs> this is a very good example of where there has been a general power before and now that that general power will be repealed by the local government and planning bill now in another place the government arc seeking to put back the powers in a rather narrower form <e> <s> this raises a lot of issues including the one that we have just discussed and the one raised by the noble baroness <e> <s> the answer is that there will be consultation on all these matters with the relevant bodies before the regulations are laid <e> <s> i do not think there is any cause for the committee to be suspicious in any way <e> <s> the powers have existed before for a very long time as i understand it and because they are being repealed by another act they are coming back in this bill in a more restrictive form <e> <s> in a sense this has given your lordships the opportunity to raise detailed points which have probably passed unnoticed in the past under a more general power <e>", "<cs> we are dealing with two situations which i shall attempt to explain <e> <s> the first relates to amendment no <e> <s> which seeks to apply the recoupment proposals to further education <e> <s> the second relates to the situaton in london <e> <s> to deal first with the amendment clause applies automatic recoupment for students at primary and secondary schools <e> <s> it is part and parcel of our arrangements under clause for allowing parental preferences <e> <s> therefore if parental preference is for a child to attend a school in another authority and all the conditions have been agreed and accepted there is automatic recoupment instead of the rather complicated difficulties that one can encounter if this is not automatically the case <e> <s> clause is essentially to be taken with clause <e> <s> it will extend parental preference <e>", "<cs> the position is that the government do not have in mind another bill on further education <e> <s> the misunderstanding arises because clause is taking account of the new provisions for the sharing or pooling of expenditure by local education authorities on advanced further education <e> <s> these provisions are made in clause <e> <s> this is one of the provisions which comes out of the capping the pool a shorthand expression procedures <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can show to the noble viscount lord simon that in fact his amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> the effect of it would be that as adult education is part of further education whatever recoupment provisions apply to further education automatically apply to adult education <e> <s> in this sense therefore his amendment does not add anything to the present situation <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just say to the noble baroness lady david that we are of course looking at this matter <e> <s> that is exactly what the working party under my honourable friend mr macfarlane is doing <e> <s> they are looking at the whole question along with other matters in connection with the to year-olds <e> <s> we recognise that it is a prob <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord morris has said this in fact is a rather technical drafting amendment but i understand that although the noble lord is perfectly correct that the independent schools whose exemption from the requirement to register is being ended will be added to the register of independent schools kept by the registrar under section of the act there is nothing to be gained by specifying the subsection as well as the parent clause <e> <s> there is no other register mentioned elsewhere under section and therefore there cannot possibly be any confusion as to what is meant <e> <s> i am not a lawyer <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will accept this <e> <s> however if there is anything further perhaps he would like to talk to me about it before the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might deal first with the second question asked by the noble baroness <e> <s> i understand that because of technical difficulties it was not possible to amend the standards for school premises regulations and the further education regulations in the way envisaged by the then government <e> <s> however my department has issued guidance on the access of disabled people to educational buildings and i shall write to the noble baroness about thisshould we wish to discuss this before the report stage there will be an opportunity to do so <e>", "<cs> the whole committee will be very grateful to the noble viscount lord ingleby for putting down this amendment and giving the committee an opportunity to discuss this subject <e> <s> it is clearly one of great importance <e> <s> may i say right at the beginning that i have very great sympathy with the aims of his amendment <e> <s> i share the views which have been expressed on all sides of the house about the importance of the right kind of sex education <e> <s> by that i mean that the matter should be treated sensitively <e> <s> i believe that it should be discussed within a moral code and those of us who are blessed with a happy family life have so much to be thankful for that the experience of it is something that we ought to pass on to children <e> <s> i share very much the view of the noble viscount lord ingleby that the book that he described is deplorable and i do not think it helps children at all <e> <s> this is my personal view about it and i think it right to say this right away to the committee <e>", "<cs> the government accept the amendment <e>"]
