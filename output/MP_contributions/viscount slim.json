["<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord orr-ewing for introducing this debate <e> <s> it is timely <e> <s> i think he set the scene well and brought home the fact that we do not have much in the way of aircraft and if i may i should like to touch on that further in a minute or so <e> <s> he also if we were listening closely brought home to us that some of these enemy forces are going to get through and our nation and our land are not prepared to receive them <e> <s> our measures for defence against nuclear against conventional and against chemical attack are virtually nil <e> <s> little is being done about it even though we are conscious of the fact that the present government put forward some money for civil defence preparation <e> <s> but it was unwound and it has to be wound up again <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that lord mountbatten would expect this country to survive and win any battle upon which we are engaged <e> <s> i take completely out of context what the noble lord lord jenkins of putney has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful that though my name is not on the list of speakers i have been allowed to address your lordships <e> <s> i am particularly worried in this debate by a political problem and some practical problems <e> <s> if i may refer to the noble lord lord boston i should say that his gander round the daily press the weekly periodicals and the monthly reports that are made was to me a sadness <e> <s> i feel that her majestys opposition should have some clear-cut strategy should have some initiative and should have some criticisms of her majestys governments defence policy <e> <s> in the noble lords remarks i found very little criticism <e> <s> there were some side swipes at organisation or points about trident and matters such as that but i found that there was nothing real <e> <s> if there is an opposition party i look for clear directives from it i look for clear strategy and i look for clear criticism of her majestys government <e> <s> i did not find this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for raising that point <e> <s> i rather hoped that he would <e> <s> i so disagree with the noble lord that it is very difficult in some ways to answer <e> <s> i have had many discussions with the noble and gallant lord lord carver whom i very much admire and whose integrity and experience is without question in your lordships house <e> <s> however i disagree with him over the whole business of nuclear strategic and tactical deployment and operational use <e> <s> i have to say that to the noble lord lord boston <e> <s> i have not only read the three speeches i was in the chamber when the noble lords that he named made those speeches <e> <s> i am perfectly happy to argue with the noble lord lord kennet on any matter concerning the strategic nuclear deterrent <e> <s> i state my case quite clearly <e> <s> and if the noble lord should like to have a glass of whisky with me afterwards i would put him straight too <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to your lordships house that in my capacity as president of the burma star <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to make this known to your lordships as i think you will agree <e> <s> is it not a fact that the noble earl should have raised this question <e> <s> may i say as president that there is deep feeling <e> <s> we have done much to put it right <e> <s> i have myself written to the minister in another place to thank him <e> <s> but we are not there yet <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that with regard to recruitment of specials careful consideration should be given to recompense and to terms and conditions <e> <s> it is a voluntary force and i think that some expenses or something of that kind would be well deserved and should be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is some precedent for such action <e> <s> if he cares to look back to the times of british india and the old indian army he will find that gallantry awards included an extra pension and there was occasionally some land given <e> <s> therefore such awards have been made by the british in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords my experience does not perhaps go back as far as that of the noble lord lord mayhew but i also had the honour of serving with the territorial army many years ago <e> <s> despite the drastic carve-up of the old territorial army especially to the detriment of the teeth arms i commend the government for what they are doing and what they are attempting to achieve <e> <s> they have set themselves fairly tough targets and it will be interesting to see if those can be met <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the demographic problems of recruiting that will affect the armed forces in the future and the fact that the army already looks like being under strength should not the noble lord be advising his right honourable friend the secretary of state to retain every gurkha and not to consider slicing the numbers <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene <e> <s> i am sorry to harass the noble lord <e> <s> many noble lords have been on both sides of the negotiating table <e> <s> it strikes me that the weakness from the ambulancemens side stems from the fact that they are offering little or nothing <e> <s> surely we should see some approach with regard to better response time and better productivity and higher levels of skill and training demanded by the ambulancemen <e> <s> is it not a fact that the management on the ambulance side may be good on television but not necessarily very good at negotiating <e>", "<cs> my lords i take on board like the noble lord lord mason the figure of an per cent <e> <s> cut in both military and civilian personnel <e> <s> however perhaps i may remind the noble earl that it has been traditional whichever government have been in power that when the axe comes down it is the teeth arms within all three services that catch it <e> <s> perhaps the noble earl has looked at the figure in the last white paper regarding the size of the ministry of defence <e> <s> does he agree that when planning the reconstruction the same percentage if not more should also hold for the ministry of defence <e> <s> that is a large establishment <e> <s> does he agree that if we are to have fewer forces we can certainly cut the commands and the staff <e>"]
