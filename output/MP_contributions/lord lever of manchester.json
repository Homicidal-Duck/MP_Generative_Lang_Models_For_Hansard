["<cs> my lords the house must be increasingly fatigued by the cries of <e>", "<cs> in fact the germans got rid of their exchange controls just as speedily as they could and as a matter of fact the only capital controls they have at the present moment are to save them from the embarrassment of too great a flow of money inwards <e> <s> well i hope that we shall find ourselves similarly embarrassed in the not too distant future <e> <s> i must say however that the problem of ending our lack of investment or lower peformance in investment is a very grave one <e> <s> i have to tell the house a that i do not know the answer and b if i did i could not hope to explain it within the confines properly assigned to a maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all very grateful go the noble baroness lady sharples for enabling us to have this most rewarding debate <e> <s> i am a little embarrassed to pay that tribute in view of her overgenerous comment about the small amount of work that i did in trying to overcome the lethargy and indifference in government departments which over a long period has been their habit <e>", "<cs> just so that the noble lord is not misled my criticism was not that they had not spelled out their expenditure plans in real terms but that their monetary supply targets were expressed purely in monetary terms not in real terms <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves that point i am sure that he would wish to answer the question i directed to him and not one which he directs at himself <e> <s> the question i asked him was not why long-dated stock was issued but why if the government believe that their policies will inevitably reduce inflation long stock is issued bearing a coupon rate which will give a quite ludicrous return in real terms if the governments convictions have any validity about interest rates <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour i shall be as brief as possible <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord cockfield for the very lengthy exposition of government policy that he has given the house though i must confess that most of it struck me with something less than the shock of novelty <e> <s> however there were two novel points which i emphasise <e> <s> one is that it is the noble lords view and presumably the governments view that since there have been self-indulgent governments all over the western world who have been content to live with a modest rate of inflation with the disastrous consequences that we have witnessed of full employment in recent years trebled standards of living and trebled production <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> in the heat of the moment i forgot it <e> <s> i beg the leave of the house to withdraw my motion <e>", "<cs> i must say that the minister has made an absolutely unanswerable case for the <e>", "<cs> no of course it is tvt million but equally it is exceedingly unlikely that it is million <e> <s> it is a figure which on the face of it sounds incredible and not merely incredible in the sense that it is inadequate but that it is hopelessly wrong <e> <s> these houses cannot be looked at street by street they must be looked at individually their condition assessed and examined and argued about <e> <s> the notion that that can be undertaken in present-day conditions at a house is so absurd <e>", "<cs> my lords i detect in this debate a becoming and well justified note of modesty creeping into the economic argument <e> <s> granted it yet has not washed up on the government front bench <e> <s> but who knows <e> <s> with time it may <e> <s> the noble lord lord thorneycroft in particular impressed me by posing the notion that governments should not enter office with grandiose notions of overall strategies which will cure all our ills <e> <s> this argument is welcome to me for over the last years i have watched a number of governments entering office with enormous pretensions about how they in contrast with the previous government would remedy all the defects from which our nation suffers <e> <s> the truth is that these pretensions are not justified and must always lead to disappointment because there is a limit to the power that a government have in our society to achieve the kind of social and economic engineering which is always boasted before office is achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords a country which has achieved that can face the squeeze of a rising exchange rate <e> <s> a country in our lamentable competitive position at the moment cannot face a per cent <e> <s> artificial rise in exchange rate with all that that implies <e>", "<cs> well my lords so it was in except that we did not have the oil <e> <s> what the noble lord is saying so far as the oil is concerned is that as long as we have the oil it is inevitable that we shall have our parity at an uncomfortably high level not because people trade with us in a way which makes it high not because we are competitive but purely because of capital movements <e> <s> what i would wish to ask the noble lord is what happens if this inevitable passivity which he believes we have in relation to the parity sends the pound up to or beyond <e> <s> is he going to come to the house and say it is inevitable it is part of the price of having an oil discovery that is part of the price of having the oil is that our industry must be ruined <e> <s> it surely is an untenable position for the government to adopt to say that it is inevitable that our industry must trade on terms dictated not by economic fundamentals but by the political anxieties and the portfolio preferences of these vast mobile opec funds and their entourage that british industry must take the rate and make the best of it even though it is an impossible thing to do as it rises <e> <s> that cannot be right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord will not think me discourteous if i say that i would be trespassing on the very considerable indulgence of the house if i did not reserve this conversation to a private moment with the noble lord outside the chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords however terse the noble lord is in replying to my over-long contribution i hope that he will be accurate and not make statements which are so inaccurate as to be wholly without warrant <e> <s> at no point have i been a supporter of a policy of accommodating to labour lack of competitiveness by devaluation <e> <s> when the noble lord says that it shows that he is financially illiterate or has not listened to what i have said or has not understood it if he listened to it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord must not repeat that <e> <s> it is quite untrue to say that at any time i have advocated the devaluation of the currency to match a failure to achieve labour competitiveness <e> <s> what i urged today was that we should not have an artificial inflation of the currency out of control of the government due to no fundamental economic factors but brought about by portfolio movements of hot middle eastern funds <e>", "<cs> however high the rate goes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am an unadvertised nuisance but i say in mitigation that at best i can claim to bring a breath of refreshing ignorance to this interesting discussion <e> <s> i find that the house has a certain problem in having to choose between the recommendations of its select committee as expounded to us today and the very weighty words of the noble and learned lord lord scarman with his vast experience of the law <e> <s> i am myself deeply in the debt of lord plowden as well as his committee but particularly lord plowden because of the temperate lucid and persuasive way in which he presented this issue <e> <s> but i have to speak with timidity bordering on or more than bordering on trepidation in that i find myself preferring the recommendations of the noble lord lord plowden to the approach of the noble and learned lord lord scarman who has brought the weight of his immense standing and erudition to bear on this matter <e> <s> i should like to tell the house why <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me especial pleasure to follow the noble lord who is very welcome back to the house with this contribution <e> <s> the fact that i happen to be in almost complete and categorical agreement with every sentiment that he has expressed i do not think is alone due to the value which i place upon his contribution which i find to be very relevant to the subject which we are discussing <e> <s> of course we are all very grateful indeed to the noble lord lord plowden for his usual lucidity and the persuasive understatement with which he brought in his report and recommendations <e> <s> i think that few of us will be disinclined to disagree with him <e> <s> but i who may be pardoned if i do not stay within those limits of valuable responsibility for a few moments shall comment rather generally on some points <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i did not make it absolutely clear i thought that i had made it clear that i agreed with everything that the noble lord said and with the conclusions that lie reached that the logic of those who are passionate for additionality must lead to the concept of the enlargement of the non-quota contribution <e> <s> i do not want to press this in detail and i could hardly describe the conclusions which the noble lord reached as a passionate enthusiasm for demonstrative additionality in the impact internally <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought so myself too and i shall explore the supposed difference but elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend must not accuse me of urging back-pedalling on anything else <e> <s> i was merely seeking to point out that as long as there is a tug-of-war in community policies with some tugging in the direction against convergence and the community fund in favour and as long as you have a number of giants on one end of the rope and a shivering pygmy on the other you will not get the major advance that you want to convergence by merely giving a tonic now and again or a pick-me-up to the pygmy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the house is grateful to the noble lord for giving us an opportunity alas <e> <s> all too rare to debate europe other than on a degraded level of fighting over whether the halfpenny in the pound of our national income which we contribute to the european budget is being adequately returned to us <e> <s> there are very much larger issues involved and this is one of them <e>", "<cs> i wonder my lords what these two gentlemen will have to say to their socialist comrades about the shameful repudiation of the great and honourable tradition in the labour party of internationalism which is involved in their position on the european community <e> <s> i wonder whether their socialist comrades will draw their attention to the moral shabbiness of making large claims for international co-operation while combining them with hostility to every concrete opportunity in that area <e> <s> it seems that they are able without any intellectual distress to combine the rhetoric of internationalism and interdependence with the actual practice and support of policies which in this area are nothing better than the dangerous national chauvinism which has brought the world to its present great difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord help me to understand his argument <e> <s> as i understand it he is complaining of what he rightly describes as the disastrous effect of the parities achieved under the floating system as it now exists <e> <s> why is that an argument against going into a system which would eliminate or mitigate many of the movements which have produced these deplorable results <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall that the united states had precisely the same exchange rate policy of not intervening except <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all deeply grateful to the noble lord lord plowden and his committee for the careful consideration they have given to the problems which will arise in considering the new proposed directive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i did not make myself plain in detail <e> <s> in a year in which banking profits have gone up by the discount market normally by say or per cent <e> <s> if i am a discount house and have large secret reserves there is nothing whatever to show by taking a lesser amount than i have done in previous years to the secret reserves that this year i have made per cent <e> <s> nobody could complain <e> <s> i have made per cent <e> <s> the only difference is that i have not added my usual substantial wad to secret reserves but a very much lesser sum <e> <s> so the impression that those figures will give will be that i have made an outstanding profit in the discount market <e> <s> in reality because i have denied myself the usual million to secret reserves and only placed million no accountant or auditor would object to it if i reduced that amount because my secret reserves are ample by this time i give the impression of having out-performed everybody on the discount market <e> <s> when i made the point i think i did add relative to other people <e> <s> when you have done badly relative to other people when you are making only a per cent <e> <s> increase in your profits whereas the generality are making per cent <e> <s> you could shows <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not prudential <e>", "<cs> that is all i ask my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord concludes <e> <s> i should like to ask whether we are to infer that the erratic movements of sterling in the past two years are a measure of the unsatisfactory character of the government at present in office <e> <s> for my own part i would repudiate that argument but it seems to follow logically from what the noble lord said a moment ago <e>", "<cs> my lords let me say at once that the soundest banks in the world are the british banks under the leadership of the governor of the bank of england <e> <s> what i was saying concerned the world banking system <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord has studied the facts of the leading american banks and the relationship of mexican brazilian and argentine loans to their total capital <e> <s> if even a per cent <e> <s> discount were taken it would cause shall we say profound embarrassment <e> <s> as he accuses me of overstating perhaps he will comment on that <e>", "<cs> my lords there is the export credit guarantee system in every civilised country in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i made no reference to that distinguished person <e> <s> i think it was a noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord would not want to put up skittles to knock down <e> <s> the last thing in the world that i want to do is to have a committee of central bankers telling individual banks where to lend <e> <s> the proposal is rather on the lines adopted by every export credit guarantee system that this would be internationally arranged for limits of credit borrowing to particular areas so that we at least know broadly where the money is going and whether we want it to go there <e>", "<cs> i would not have missed them <e>", "<cs> my lords even in his absence i must put it on record how deeply grateful the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord saying that he is satisfied that the existing increase of the imf and similar funds is adequate to insure us against the developing banking crisis and to ensure the steady flow of the required funds to the previous borrowers <e>", "<cs> my lords i would very happily spend the brief minutes of my comments upon expressing my pleasure in the first instance at the chairmanship of the noble lord lord obrien of the committee of which i was a member but from which i was continuously absent though following closely and admiringly the labours of my colleagues which have been brought to fruition to some extent this evening <e> <s> the noble lord lord obrien and i have had dealings with each other over a long period of years <e> <s> i know him as a calm minded man of great experience of world reputation and of good judgment and good temper good temper strained with his colleagues in the central banking world only i believe on those occasions when he played tennis with the chairman of the federal reserve bank in washington <e>", "<cs> not the present one my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house is deeply indebted to my noble friend lord paget for provoking this stimulating debate and is deeply indebted to those who have followed him for their thoughts <e> <s> i do not say that i endorse every single word of my noble friends speech but i remain once again deeply in his debt because of his fearless assault upon humbug and his passionate devotion to presenting reality for our consideration <e> <s> i am even very strongly on his side with deep regret and a good deal of trepidation on the issue raised by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> i bow of course to the noble and learned lords views on all matters of law national and international but this is a political issue as he finally came to recognise <e> <s> my noble friend lord paget was right the noble lord lord home is wrong and the noble and learned lord lord simon is wrong in rebuking him for focusing the attention of the house upon the recognition of sovereignty rather than on the question of sovereignty itself <e>", "<cs> my lords yes they did this temporarily <e> <s> i am not saying that they should not do it i am complaining about the lack of coherence <e> <s> as it happens i approved the action of the united states but a great many people here did not and learned leaders were written condemning the united states as undermining the whole system of financial probity in that it had blocked the bank balances of the iranian government <e> <s> of course the british government did not do anything of the kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i will concede at once any historic fact which is adduced by the noble lord <e> <s> as a man who was brought up by his grandparents and parents with a fanatical affection for this country i still think that we have a deluding view of ourselves about how nice kind compassionate and moderate we always are <e> <s> we sometimes behave in a slightly different manner <e> <s> therefore i am sure that the noble lord is right in drawing my attention to the occasions when we have acted outside our traditional calm <e>", "<cs> my lords i must make clear that the code of conduct i want is a coherent one of the great powers for granting of full diplomatic recognition of these sovereign states not a pious affirmation by the recipients of it <e> <s> i want the great states to make up their minds on what they expect from states before they will grant or continue diplomatic status to them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i spare the noble lord <e> <s> i said nothing of the kind <e> <s> i merely said that we ought to have a coherent basis for conferring full diplomatic recognition on states <e> <s> i do not lay down any rule for anybody <e>

the delusion which could be readily brought about by reading the report of the noble lord lord plowden and his colleagues that i had acquired that expertise simply by studying the masterly report which they have presented to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords it must now become clear to all that the relatively high level of co-operation the worlds advanced countries achieved immediately after the war depended far too much on american dominance and not sufficiently on a shared <e>", "<cs> my lords not me <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is so can the noble lord tell us why we should ever go in

understand how a government who neglect important policy decisions affecting the banking and investment industry have time to concentrate on such an absurd detail which has no substantial merit but merely populistic merit <e> <s> of course i am not suggesting that it is an oppression where there is a genuine case of insider dealing that is worth investigating to have it investigated <e> <s> my objection is to the elephantiasis of populistic interest in an insignificant and rare occurrence <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not follow the noble lord in detail but i can at least congratulate him on an improvement on dr johnson who said that marriages would probably turn out just as happily if they were made by the lord chancellor and not by the individuals concerned <e> <s> the noble lords amendment is that the chancellor of the exchequer should be the major determinant of those unions <e> <s> although i am sometimes startled by the lack of realism shown by my colleagues on certain matters i must confess that it is something new to me to suppose that the majority of marriages even of those not endowed with large estates proceed only with such impetuousness as their chartered accountants will permit <e> <s> although i am very much with the noble lord on the principle that we should not be penalised by entering into that noble and i hope normally happy state of marriage it
