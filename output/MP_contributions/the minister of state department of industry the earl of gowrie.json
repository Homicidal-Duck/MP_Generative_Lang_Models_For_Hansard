["<cs> my lords i too should like to start by offering my congratulations to the noble lord lord miles who has appeared in a number of roles but never yet that of a lord he seemed to take to it extremely well <e> <s> it is conventional that one should not be controversial in a maiden speech and it was a splendid initial gesture of controversy to make ones maiden speech on a budget debate <e> <s> because the noble lord had the nerve to make this move i want to take up one point of issue with him <e> <s> he talked about how men with regional accents were making marvellous pop music and bringing glory to our exchequer <e> <s> one of the contentions of my noble friends and myself is that it is indeed splendid but that alas <e> <s> too often it brings glory to someone elses exchequer and we are going to try to do something about that <e> <s> on a serious note i was bowled over by the noble lords maiden and it will certainly be a difficult act to follow <e>"]
