["<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but it is on a point of some importance which i have not got clear and it may be the house has not got clear <e> <s> i understood the minister to say that the director general could not enforce a change this could only be done by the mmc <e> <s> that of course is technically correct <e> <s> but in so far as the director general can ask for an undertaking it is tantamount to enforcing is it not <e> <s> i know the company can say they will not accept it and then go to the mmc which would be the next step presumably <e> <s> but does not this mean in practice that the director general in a number of cases will be telling a company or at least agreeing with a company that a practice has to stop <e> <s> this is getting very near to the director general enforcing surely <e>", "<cs> y lords i am sorry to disappoint the minister but it seems to me that since as he says there are in any case a certain number of preliminaries to be gone into and we are not asking for a long delay the need to protect the individual organisation against what could be serious damage is such that i am afraid i must divide the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much regret that i cannot agree with that <e> <s> i worded this amendment in the way that i did because the noble lord said last time that the consumer councils as such were under consideration and so this is a more open amendment <e> <s> it does not refer specifically to the consumer councils <e> <s> i cannot see why because there is going to be a further review of the consumer position this clause cannot be written into the bill therefore giving status to consumer organisations <e> <s> i am afraid that i shall have to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the late hour and of the results of recent divisions i very reluctantly ask the leave of the house to withdraw these amendments <e>", "<cs> we should like to support this amendment <e> <s> we have an amendment down later which asks for much the same matters to be taken into account in a more specific way <e> <s> but on the belt and braces principle we would none the less support this more general <e>", "<cs> nobody is suggesting that the governors will do it all by themselves but if these people are on the governing body it prompts the work of the professionals who have to carry it out <e> <s> it is a partnership between the two <e> <s> it cannot do anything but strengthen the hands of the people who have to carry it out if those interests are also on the governing body <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness lady david looks at <e>", "<cs> beacuse we have already discussed this at some length i do not have a great deal more to say except to confirm what my noble friend lord beaumont of whitley said that if the government cannot accept the amendment i am afraid i shall have to divide the committee <e>", "<cs> i really must say to the noble lord lord james of rusholme that if one is high master of a school such as manchester grammar school one has happy relationships with excellent governors but some of us have had to deal up and down the country with schools that are totally unlike manchester grammar school <e> <s> the experience of many of us has been that there is not the necessary knowledge of industry in the teaching force <e> <s> the teachers have gone from school to college and then back to school <e> <s> there is a great contempt for industry among many teachers a contempt based to a considerable extent on lack of knowledge of what industry is like today <e>", "<cs> may i suggest that we now divide the committee <e>", "<cs> i am not clear what published means <e> <s> does it mean that the local authority would do the circulation of printed matter prepared by the aided schools or that they will prepare the printed matter <e> <s> this seems to he very different indeed <e> <s> i could well understand that there are aided schools that would want some other body to prepare the words <e> <s> if what is meant by published is that the local authority would prepare what is said would decide what is said about the aided schools then i can well see that the aided schools would go along with it <e> <s> if it is to take what the aided schools have prepared and simply do the physical job of circulating it the convenience of that seems to be self-evident but i am not sure what published means <e>", "<cs> we on these benches would like to support this amendment very strongly indeed <e> <s> the provision for under-fives is grossly inadequate now <e> <s> it gives the greatest possible help to many families and early education for children <e> <s> it is a preventive measure against all manner of subsequent problems which can arise and it is a very great help to many families <e> <s> it is a very false economy to cut down a provision of this kind <e> <s> we very much hope that the committee will agree to this amendment <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support the amendment moved by the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> the importance of mandatory grants for older people returning to take training of this kind cannot be over-emphasised particularly in relation to older women who have had inadequate training in their younger years but who as the noble baroness said are returning to the labour market and need training in order to do an effective job <e> <s> mandatory grants for courses of this kind would be of great assistance to a very important section of the community who have a very great deal to offer particularly in the field of social work <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i know that the noble baroness the minister has very great sympathy with the whole issue of nursery schools in many ways she would like to see the present position maintained <e> <s> of course it is true that we are nowhere near carrying out what is embodied in the existing legislation which this amendment hopes to maintain <e> <s> but surely the bill would be seen to remove the requirement for local authorities to provide nursery schools <e> <s> it will be seen in the country as a sign that the support for the whole idea of nursery schools is waning and it will give an even lower priority to the provision of nursery school education than it has at the present time <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to enter into a discussion on this subject but i would have considerable doubt about whether that is in fact absolutely accurate <e> <s> i hesitate to cross swords with the noble baroness on this matter <e> <s> i can only say that the mothers working in france are on a very large scale larger than in this country <e>", "<cs> the minister is trying to tell us that the choice has to be <e>"]
