["<cs> my lords at this time of night my most acceptable contribution no doubt would be to say nothing <e> <s> i should like first to make my apologies to the noble lord lord miles and to express my very great regret that i was at a committee in the house at the time when he was making his maiden speech so i cannot in sincerity congratulate him but i can offer my apologies and say how much i regret that i missed what on all accounts was a most brilliant performance <e>", "<cs> my lords we must all be grateful to the noble lord lord spens for introducing this debate this afternoon <e> <s> i would certainly support his plea to the government that they should undertake research into the implications of the pending changes to which his motion draws attention not least because at the present time we understand all too little about the situation and it is very easy to draw alarming conclusions or indeed even over-optimistic conclusions from the inadequate information we have at present <e> <s> i would not wish to be either panic-ridden or complacent about the new developments which are forthcoming which are both challenges and opportunities <e> <s> it may be that the coming of the micro-processor will cause very large increases in unemployment <e> <s> the kind of study which we ask the government to undertake should enable us to ensure that these inventions can be introduced without the dire consequences which have been forecast <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would also like to thank the noble lord for repeating the statement that has been made in another place <e> <s> we have always been particularly concerned with the interests of consumers in the post office and as noble lords will remember during the last administration we pressed successfully for the inclusion of consumer representatives on the post office board <e>", "<cs> my lords it only remains for me to thank noble lords for taking part in the debate this afternoon which i think we all agree has been an extremely fruitful and interesting debate <e> <s> i would like to say this to the noble lord lord trefgarne <e> <s> the economic and social policy research proposal is of course not really concerned with culture <e> <s> these are two separate matters <e> <s> the criticism made of cultural development <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief but having worked for years in an academic institution with a very high percentage of overseas students from all over the globe i feel that i simply must speak to urge the government again about this policy and at least if they have to make economies to make them in a rather different way <e> <s> i wonder whether these economies in the costs of overseas students have really been accurately assessed and i agree with the noble viscount lord craigavon that we need to look at these sums in a number of different ways <e>", "<cs> my lords there are the better off and the better off are there not and some of them are very wealthy people <e> <s> i agree of course that we do not get the sweepers from calcutta <e> <s> nor do we get the sweepers from the east end of london if it comes to that <e> <s> however we do get people i am sure that the noble lord lord vaizey has had the same experience from very modest families who have scraped together the money with fifth cousins putting up the money to make it possible for their relatives to come to this country <e> <s> the number of brothers who have been over here who are sending younger brothers to this country and paying for their education in this country out of their british earnings is in my experience considerable <e> <s> i do not have the <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not the purpose of our debate this evening to discuss the class structure of the london school of economics exciting though that would be <e> <s> i accept the point made by the noble lord lord vaizey that he said many and not most <e> <s> however we are becoming slightly purist in the distinctions that we are making <e> <s> a considerable number of overseas students do not come from the wealthiest classes and they would certainly find that it was very difficult to find this money <e>", "<cs> my lords any member of your lordships house who was in any way involved in the recent euro-elections will i am sure agree that whatever else is known or not known in this country about the european community there is widespread conviction held in many quarters on two matters first that the british pay far too much to the community and secondly that far too much goes to increasingly wealthy french and german farmers <e> <s> a number of times i have heard it said that it is now possible to run a mercedes on two cows <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> i should like to echo the noble lord lord melchett on one point namely the tremendous importance of maintaining the aerospace industry as one of great significance to this country with its very real need for further investment <e> <s> we should also very much like to know whether the government intend to retain a per cent <e> <s> ownership of the industry <e> <s> in our view this industry has suffered a great deal of disruption and it will be extremely unsatisfactory if it is felt that its future is once again in the melting pot <e> <s> it is very difficult for an industry of this kind to settle down to long term development if it does not know where it stands <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble viscount for repeating the statement and to deplore of course as everybody must the state of this once great industry <e> <s> we must also recognise however that it is inevitable that this industry should contract and indeed a realistic approach to this industry by previous governments over the past decade might have put us in a position much less severe than the one we are now in <e> <s> putting off the evil day does not help very much <e> <s> however we wish to retain a shipbuilding industry which has a future <e> <s> i too would like to ask what estimate has been made of the size of the shipbuilding industry which has a future which will endure after the serious impact of the present recession <e> <s> it is to that level but not beyond that level that a reduction should be made <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount give us a progress report <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that statements by the government however correct and however much reinforced by extracts from authoritative sources do not carry the same conviction as would flow from discussions with the people who are involved discussions of the kind proposed by my noble friend lord rochester <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not in the least intend to disagree with the substance of what has been said by my noble friend lord rochester <e> <s> i accept the reasons that lie behind these variations <e> <s> but i want to underline what the noble lord lord mccarthy has said about the profound ignorance among many small employers because they are extremely busy <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches thank the minister for repeating the statement made in another place and of course if that is the statement made by his right honourable friend there is nothing he can do about it except repeat it <e> <s> i am bound however to say that while one sympathises with the need for some cuts and we are the first to agree that there is overmanning and that there are sections in which economies in labour have to be made i must urge on the minister as some of us did in the house only yesterday that if these things have to happen the maximum amount of information and consultation is the only possible way to get them accepted <e> <s> if we are given statements of this kind when as the noble lord lord mishcon said there is great anxiety in the country it is bound to lead to misunderstanding and resistance to the changes that have to be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the minister for the statement that he has made this afternoon and i welcome it <e> <s> we believe that controls have been excessive and that this is a very desirable step in the direction of free movement of capital which is long overdue and which honours our eec commitments <e> <s> however i would ask the minister what the anticipated effect will be on the exchange rate of sterling and in what way if any the dollar premium will be affected by the introduction of this change <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would also like to thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> we take the line that we agree with the government in the pre-eminent need to control inflation therefore we accept that some cuts are essential and that no doubt considerable cuts will have to be made <e> <s> at the same time we do not consider that the cuts that have been presented to us are sufficiently discriminating <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl not agree that some of us would be extremely glad if we did not continue to have the type of bread which we customarily have <e>", "<cs> my lords in listening to the speech of the noble lord lord mccarthy i had the uneasy feeling that the house might think when i sat down that the lib-lab pact was still on <e> <s> it is always irritating when the first speaker says a great many of the things one had planned to say oneself <e> <s> however i would assure the house that the lib-lab pact is not on and i hope to make points which will demonstrate that there are differences of very considerable substance between the approach of the labour front bench and the approach we wish to put forward although in many ways the criticisms that we have to make move in the same direction <e> <s> i would also say i should have said this at the beginning that i much regret that i was a minute late and that the noble lord was at the dispatch box before i arrived <e> <s> also i fear that because of an engagement i made a long time ago in oxford i shall have to leave before the end of the debate <e> <s> i am very sorry indeed about that <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also wish to thank the <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be unwise for anyone speaking after so great an expert on this subject as the noble lord lord sainsbury to go in great detail into the terms of the directive for it is a highly technical matter and he has explained its limitations and its strengths in a way that no one else in your lordships house i think could rival <e> <s> i want to concentrate on the last point that he raised <e> <s> of course nobody can be against the idea of protecting consumers in the area of consumer credit <e> <s> the objectives of the directive must be unchallengeable <e> <s> but i think i have spoken in the majority at any rate of the debates on eec reports and on nearly every occasion i think we have had to say that the detail of the directive is absurd in relation to the objective to be achieved <e> <s> we have reminded ourselves again and again that a directive is not a regulation that if it is supposed to contain a great deal of detail this should be laid down in a regulation and that the whole purpose of a directive in the wording of the commission itself is that it should declare the intention and leave to the different countries the detail as to how that objective is to be achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord has misunderstood me <e> <s> i should hate him to bring pressure to bear for the reason that he gave <e> <s> the point of paragraph is to ensure that in fact the purpose of a directive is made clear member states then submit their proposals in line with what they are doing or intend to do and it is then agreed that those proposals adequately meet the objectives <e> <s> that is slightly different from what the minister said <e>", "<cs> my lords a few months ago i had the privilege of chairing the annual conference of asian women <e> <s> they were a most impressive group <e> <s> in the main they were intelligent sophisticated enviably elegant and as they made clear determined to keep their loyalty both to their own culture and to this country to which in statement after statement it became very clear they had great attachment and for which they had the very greatest respect <e> <s> they had of course understandably been shaken by the virginity testing episodes and who can blame them <e> <s> but women such as those are the best possible agents for good race relations in this country <e> <s> they have contacts with groups of people young and old newly come to this country and long established here who with the best will in the world those of us here cannot reach or who if we do reach we do so in a way quite different from the way of these women who were working in their own localities and on behalf not only of their own community but also this country which they saw as their country of adoption <e> <s> their work and their view of us is surely of the greatest importance in the maintenance of race relations <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that it is perfectly ridiculous to have three public holidays in a period of eight weeks most of which if one looks at the records are extremely wet <e> <s> one then does not get another holiday for three months or another one after that for four months <e> <s> is it not time that we brought a bit of common sense into the arrangements for public holidays <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support strongly the proposition that the government should take positive action to promote the full implementation of metrication in this country <e> <s> a few weeks ago the minister of state at the department of trade mrs oppenheim led people to believe that the government would go very slow on the whole issue of metrication <e> <s> i have no doubt that that statement was received joyfully by conservatives in all parties but to a very large extent that was the enthusiasm of ignorance the bliss of ignorance for i think it true that from the failure to educate the public in what is involved in the whole issue of metrication the idea has grown up that metrication would involve inconveniences and these have been stressed whereas the costs and losses incurred by the failure to metricate have not been made clear to the public at all <e> <s> whenever the subject is discussed in uninformed circles and those uninformed circles are very large indeed the only thing you get is a reference to what happened at the time of decimalisation <e> <s> i do not even know what happened at the time of decimalisation and nobody can tell you what it was <e> <s> they all refer to the fact that awful things happened then and therefore if we went into metrication the same thing would happen <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches give general approval to the objectives behind this bill <e> <s> my party has a longer and more consistent tradition of opposing monopoly wherever it is found than can be claimed by any other party in this house <e> <s> it is not surprising that a bill which is intended to attack monopoly is one which meets with our general support <e> <s> unlike the labour party we are perfectly prepared in certain circumstances to see the abolition of the price commission <e> <s> at the time that the price commission bill was going through this house we suggested from these benches that a prefereable procedure would have been to introduce a very much strengthened monopolies commission <e> <s> we did not see any very great virtue although we went along with it in the event in having a price commission a monopolies commission the restrictive practices court and the work of the director general of fair trading <e> <s> this seemed to be too much machinery to deal with problems which had a great deal in common and which would be better dealt with together by a smaller number of adequately-equipped and powerful institutions <e> <s> the actual abolition of the price commission is not something which in itself we regret <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that even if it is a small number of cases for the people concerned it is a very serious matter indeed <e> <s> we do not believe do we that the number of cases affects the justice of the issue <e> <s> would the minister not also agree that while an appeal is pending the widow should if not allowed pension at least be allowed supplementary benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to associate myself most sincerely with the tribute which the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale paid to the late lady summerskill <e> <s> any of us who have been associated in any way with work in connection with change in the position of women know how active she was in all spheres how much all of us owe to the work that she did and how she was particularly interested in the subject of the bill which tonight is before your lordships house <e> <s> it is very sad indeed that she cannot be here to see this bill go though your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should also like to thank the noble viscount the minister for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> we recognise of course the very considerable difficulties being experienced in the textile areas and in industry con <e>", "<cs> my lords when the previous administration introduced the national enterprise board we on these benches welcomed the general initiative welcomed the introduction of the board as we had considered that the abolition of the irc had in fact been a serious mistake <e> <s> but we did at that time feel that some of the powers of the neb were too extensive that they had taken on to do too much and that the provision for the extension of public ownership was a quite unnecessarily doctrinaire element introduced into the legislation legislation much needed in order to further the development of british industry <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord reads <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord was referring to the three previous speeches <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i did not imply anything to the contrary but will the noble viscount not agree that <e>", "<cs> my lords if one figure is going up and the other is going down would the noble lord tell us what the trend is <e>", "<cs> we also very much welcome the reference to caravan sites which is long overdue <e>", "<cs> surely the local health authorities have great spending powers and it is highly desirable that they as well as the local authorities should act in a competitive fashion <e> <s> i recognise as the noble lord has said that they are under the control of the department but nevertheless it surely makes it easier particularly at local level when issues of this kind come up if these powers are already in the legislation <e> <s> surely there is no harm occasionally in reinforcing what you wish to do <e> <s> the fact that it can already be done by a method which will not be clear to a great many people is no reason why it should not be also in the bill <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord jacques will not press the amendment <e> <s> it is my belief that anticompetitive practices are in fact very widespread and that we do not know the full extent of them <e> <s> in any case a code of practice confuses because it does not have the force of law <e> <s> certainly it strengthens an argument if the matter comes to an argument but it does not have the force of law <e> <s> it would be assumed by everybody that whatever was not in the code of practice was not an anti-competitive practice though investigation could well prove that not to be true <e> <s> those of us who want to get rid of anti-competitive practices and who believe that this bill is not strong enough and that is very much the position that we on these benches are taking would not like to see the list prescribed at this stage <e>", "<cs> i very much hope that the government will feel able to accept this amendment <e> <s> there is great anxiety about price increases and it is highly desirable that elected representatives consumer bodies and voluntary organisations of one kind or another should feel that they are able to play a part <e> <s> i strongly support what the noble lord lord wallace has just said if only to relieve the anxieties that people are experiencing in the face of price increases and the sense of impotence that they have in their inability to do anything about them <e> <s> it surely cannot do any harm to allow this amendment to be included and it would be evidence of the governments understanding of how anxious people are in this area <e>", "<cs> it cannot do any harm and may do some good <e> <s> what is the objection <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord lord mottistone really thinks that in subsection <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i do not agree with that and i think that some amendment of this kind should be included in the bill <e>", "<cs> we are still talking about the same problem namely that the ministers think that informal understandings are good enough and that we do not need to have these matters written into the legislation <e> <s> with the greatest respect i do not believe that that is so <e> <s> if the informal procedures work and they want them to work what harm is there in <e>", "<cs> i apologise for interrupting but i wonder whether the noble minister will agree that if firms refuse to give an undertaking they will know that they are going to be referred to the monopolies commission <e> <s> i should have thought that they would not be likely to refuse to offer an undertaking because as the bill stands the only option then would be for the director general to go straight to the monopolies commission which is precisely what they would wish to avoid <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i am afraid that i am not satisfied with that explanation <e> <s> i quite agree as the noble minister has said that the great majority of firms will play it straight and will not try to get round the intention of the legislation and that if they have been found to have indulged in an anti-competitive practice and have entered into an undertaking they will honour it <e> <s> i am sure that this goes for the great majority but in every pack or is herd the right term <e> <s> there are rogue elephants <e> <s> we know that in this country we have suffered very considerably from anticompetitive practices <e> <s> we want this to cease in the interests of consumers in the interests of competition in the interests of anti-inflation and control of prices all the things we stand for and i believe that these stronger measures need to be there in reserve to deal with the rogue elephants <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry not to be able to satisfy the noble minister on this point <e> <s> at second reading i indicated that i believe that the bill is too weak and that it needs to be strengthened <e> <s> that has been the theme of the comments that have been made from these benches on this legislation and i am afraid that i am not prepared to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> this of course is the heart of the disagreement between us <e> <s> we on this side of the committee do not share the ministers optimism as to the extent to which the measures proposed are in fact going to deal quickly enough though maybe in the very long run with the prices situation which is causing the very greatest concern at the present time both in general and in particular localities <e> <s> we therefore believe that it is necessary for the director general to have a function in relation to prices which will be something more than the very exceptional occasion when he has to intervene <e> <s> however at this late hour with the plain unbalance between the two sides of your lordships committee i do not propose to press this to a division at the present time but i reserve the right to bring the matter up again at the report stage <e>", "<cs> once again i shall withdraw this amendment at this stage but with the prospect of bringing it forward again later at report stage <e>", "<cs> i must support my noble friend <e> <s> it is quite different from the problem of the code of practice <e> <s> i was very much on the side of the noble lord lord trefgarne over the question <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour and after so many speeches your lordships will not want to hear very many more of great length and i will be extremely brief <e> <s> i should like first to apologise for the fact that i have had to miss so many of the speeches which have been made during the course of the afternoon i had to chair a committee which was fixed long before i knew that this debate was to take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose there never has been anything to stop governing bodies doing it but they do not appear to do it <e> <s> since we are writing into this legislation that parents and teachers should be represented why not write in that there should be people with knowledge in this particular area as well <e> <s> i do strongly suspect that unless it is written in these people will not appear in the future any more than they have in the past and i am convinced that the need for them is very great indeed <e> <s> the teachers lack of understanding about the world of work is a very serious handicap at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but it is on a point of some importance which i have not got clear and it may be the house has not got clear <e> <s> i understood the minister to say that the director general could not enforce a change this could only be done by the mmc <e> <s> that of course is technically correct <e> <s> but in so far as the director general can ask for an undertaking it is tantamount to enforcing is it not <e> <s> i know the company can say they will not accept it and then go to the mmc which would be the next step presumably <e> <s> but does not this mean in practice that the director general in a number of cases will be telling a company or at least agreeing with a company that a practice has to stop <e> <s> this is getting very near to the director general enforcing surely <e>", "<cs> y lords i am sorry to disappoint the minister but it seems to me that since as he says there are in any case a certain number of preliminaries to be gone into and we are not asking for a long delay the need to protect the individual organisation against what could be serious damage is such that i am afraid i must divide the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much regret that i cannot agree with that <e> <s> i worded this amendment in the way that i did because the noble lord said last time that the consumer councils as such were under consideration and so this is a more open amendment <e> <s> it does not refer specifically to the consumer councils <e> <s> i cannot see why because there is going to be a further review of the consumer position this clause cannot be written into the bill therefore giving status to consumer organisations <e> <s> i am afraid that i shall have to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the late hour and of the results of recent divisions i very reluctantly ask the leave of the house to withdraw these amendments <e>", "<cs> we should like to support this amendment <e> <s> we have an amendment down later which asks for much the same matters to be taken into account in a more specific way <e> <s> but on the belt and braces principle we would none the less support this more general <e>", "<cs> nobody is suggesting that the governors will do it all by themselves but if these people are on the governing body it prompts the work of the professionals who have to carry it out <e> <s> it is a partnership between the two <e> <s> it cannot do anything but strengthen the hands of the people who have to carry it out if those interests are also on the governing body <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness lady david looks at <e>", "<cs> beacuse we have already discussed this at some length i do not have a great deal more to say except to confirm what my noble friend lord beaumont of whitley said that if the government cannot accept the amendment i am afraid i shall have to divide the committee <e>", "<cs> i really must say to the noble lord lord james of rusholme that if one is high master of a school such as manchester grammar school one has happy relationships with excellent governors but some of us have had to deal up and down the country with schools that are totally unlike manchester grammar school <e> <s> the experience of many of us has been that there is not the necessary knowledge of industry in the teaching force <e> <s> the teachers have gone from school to college and then back to school <e> <s> there is a great contempt for industry among many teachers a contempt based to a considerable extent on lack of knowledge of what industry is like today <e>", "<cs> may i suggest that we now divide the committee <e>", "<cs> i am not clear what published means <e> <s> does it mean that the local authority would do the circulation of printed matter prepared by the aided schools or that they will prepare the printed matter <e> <s> this seems to he very different indeed <e> <s> i could well understand that there are aided schools that would want some other body to prepare the words <e> <s> if what is meant by published is that the local authority would prepare what is said would decide what is said about the aided schools then i can well see that the aided schools would go along with it <e> <s> if it is to take what the aided schools have prepared and simply do the physical job of circulating it the convenience of that seems to be self-evident but i am not sure what published means <e>", "<cs> we on these benches would like to support this amendment very strongly indeed <e> <s> the provision for under-fives is grossly inadequate now <e> <s> it gives the greatest possible help to many families and early education for children <e> <s> it is a preventive measure against all manner of subsequent problems which can arise and it is a very great help to many families <e> <s> it is a very false economy to cut down a provision of this kind <e> <s> we very much hope that the committee will agree to this amendment <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support the amendment moved by the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> the importance of mandatory grants for older people returning to take training of this kind cannot be over-emphasised particularly in relation to older women who have had inadequate training in their younger years but who as the noble baroness said are returning to the labour market and need training in order to do an effective job <e> <s> mandatory grants for courses of this kind would be of great assistance to a very important section of the community who have a very great deal to offer particularly in the field of social work <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i know that the noble baroness the minister has very great sympathy with the whole issue of nursery schools in many ways she would like to see the present position maintained <e> <s> of course it is true that we are nowhere near carrying out what is embodied in the existing legislation which this amendment hopes to maintain <e> <s> but surely the bill would be seen to remove the requirement for local authorities to provide nursery schools <e> <s> it will be seen in the country as a sign that the support for the whole idea of nursery schools is waning and it will give an even lower priority to the provision of nursery school education than it has at the present time <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to enter into a discussion on this subject but i would have considerable doubt about whether that is in fact absolutely accurate <e> <s> i hesitate to cross swords with the noble baroness on this matter <e> <s> i can only say that the mothers working in france are on a very large scale larger than in this country <e>", "<cs> the minister is trying to tell us that the choice has to be <e>", "<cs> if i understood him aright the minister said rather contemptuously that it was being suggested in this amendment that there was being written into the act where every bit of paper was to go <e> <s> i would say surely this is not a question of where every bit of paper is to go but where this particular very important piece of paper should go <e> <s> after all some of the most important legislation that goes through this house could be described asbits of paper <e>", "<cs> i wish strongly to support the amendment put forward by my noble friend lord amherst <e> <s> at present it is surely most important that the opportunities for employee share ownership should be spread as widely as possible throughout the country to give people a greater stake and a greater understanding of how industry operates and so that they can share in profits where there are profits and dividends where there are dividends and not rely entirely on their pay packet <e> <s> this seems to me a first-class opportunity for the government to take a lead to show that they really believe as i understand they do that the principle of employee share-ownership is one to which they give support <e> <s> they will do that in the most practical way if they write into the bill the right of the board to issue shares in this form <e>", "<cs> i must say that i was very unhappy about the reply by the noble lord lord cullen <e> <s> when an industry is being denationalised in this way it is no ordinary company which is being established <e> <s> the government have the right to lay down certain conditions which are appropriate for a company of this type in an industry of this kind <e> <s> if the government believe in the principle of employee share-ownership this is surely an opportunity to make it plain that in this particular case such a scheme is to be introduced <e> <s> if that is so it should surely figure in the bill <e> <s> i cannot understand why the minister says that it <e>", "<cs> my lords did the noble lord say he was careful when dealing with lawyers <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister seriously consider if the govern <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bellwin said that in the main this practice was carried out <e> <s> it has been the burden over and over again of the argument against this amendment and the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very briefly from these benches to support as strongly as i can this amendment <e> <s> in the many years that i worked at the london school of economics i saw a number of these older people come forward for training <e> <s> there is no doubt the good candidates take the training extremely well and make very good use of it <e> <s> the combination of maturity and training means that they can do a first-class job <e> <s> what is more they stick they do not leave <e> <s> the younger trainee works very well for a year or two getting experience and then very often is off whereas the older woman coming back will stay for the rest of her working life and that may be years <e> <s> it is a very good investment <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour i do not want to say very much <e> <s> i think there is very little between us and i am sure that the noble baroness really cares as much about nursery schools as we do on this side of the house <e> <s> however it seems the greatest pity that the duty should be removed <e> <s> had it not been there no doubt this would hardly have been the moment to introduce it but symbolically to remove it at the moment signals to authorities who are not very interested in it that it is not a good thing to do <e> <s> that is really what we are talking about <e> <s> it is a narrow point but leaving it in would make no difference and taking it out indicates to those who are not very keen on it and have done nothing that they can go along in their old evil ways <e> <s> i hope that the amendment will be accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much hope the government will feel able to accept this amendment for two reasons <e> <s> one is that in these days of unemployment among school-leavers it is extremely important that those youngsters who have left school with nothing to do should be taking classes of further education or adult education of a more general kind <e> <s> there never was a time when this sort of provision was more important <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that if it is quite impossible to get a sensible arrangement over the date of easter it calls for a further review of our public holidays <e> <s> next year easter falls on th april <e> <s> this means that we shall have four of our precious public holidays pushed into a period of seven and a half weeks <e> <s> for the rest of the year whatever seven and a half from is we shall have the remaining holidays spread out <e> <s> it is quite ridiculous to concentrate four public holidays good friday easter monday the may day holiday and the spring holiday in seven and a half weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords we might almost be in another place and how <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the government to look again at this amendment particularly in relation to people in the older age group <e> <s> the evidence not only for the future but and i know that the noble lord lord wellspestell will agree with me under the past government too was that people over who become unemployed have a very meagre chance of getting employed again particularly if they are unskilled <e> <s> we must face that there are going to be a large number some say a relatively large number of people in the older age groups for whom there is going to be no employment <e> <s> could not the government take this question back if only for the older age groups and have a look to see whether they would be prepared to modify this regulation <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very rarely indeed that i disagree with a single word said by my noble friend lord wigoder <e> <s> on this occasion i do not so much wish to disagree with him but rather to put a different emphasis on what he has said <e> <s> i think perhaps because he has never been in the ranks of the despised academics attempting to do research he is not fully familiar with the material provided by the census for really necessary study <e> <s> if social policy is not based on accurate information then it is based on inaccurate information and we have suffered over and over again in this country from social legislation based on inaccurate information <e> <s> so i think we can agree that the census should include what is necessary but with a rather different interpretation as to what is meant by what is necessary <e>", "<cs> i should like to add to what my noble friend has said <e> <s> the noble viscount lord trenchard in his summing-up speech said that this was going on in any case <e> <s> i think that he said that every company of which he was aware was doing all that it could to see that all important information got through to the whole of the staff <e> <s> the noble viscount lord trenchard moves in the best circles <e> <s> i do not <e> <s> i frequently talk about these matters on managerial courses at which i get rather a different clientele from that with whom the noble viscount mixes <e> <s> i can assure him that there is no such widespread conviction that this is what we ought to be doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very strongly to support this amendment <e> <s> it is certainly in line with the spirit of the directive <e> <s> of course the directive in article provides loopholes but it is very much to be hoped that this country which after all took the lead in europe in developing sex equality will not hide behind this article and drag its feet <e> <s> it is as the noble baroness lady fisher has said only a relatively small number of people and the costs would be slight <e> <s> surely on this point the government can meet the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house may i ask the noble lord the minister whether if he does not know how the arithmetic is done he will ask his department and let us know <e> <s> because it is rather taxing our faith to ask us to believe that it really amounts to so high a figure as the noble lord has given <e> <s> one would like to know on what assumption that is based <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will remember that when the invalid care allowance was introduced an attempt was made to include married women in the benefit <e> <s> the government at that time the government of the party now in opposition said that they could not see their way to do it but that they would look at it <e> <s> surely the time has come when as the noble baroness lady fisher has said this plain discrimination against an important section of women should be removed <e> <s> the allowance is an economy to the country because by having someone staying at home to look after a person who is severely ill and it is only if someone is severely ill that the invalid care allowance can be paid that invalid person is kept out of a very expensive institution <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i make a comment on a remark made by the minister <e> <s> he said that a married woman who was giving up work would not be very much better off because the person for whom she was caring could get additional payment <e> <s> i think i understood aright <e> <s> the noble lord said that the invalid not because the married women had given up work would get an additional sum <e> <s> he said that the married woman would be no better off by getting a grant because the invalid would have received it <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord would look at what he said <e> <s> i think what he said was to that effect <e>", "<cs> my lords as one would expect the noble baroness lady young has made the very best of what i still think is a rather bad job <e> <s> what she is trying to tell us i think is that a negative resolution is almost as good as an affirmative resolution <e> <s> but the difference is made and it is clearly understood that affirmative action is stronger and gives more parliamentary control than a negative procedure <e> <s> that being so i am afraid i cannot accept the explanation given by the noble baroness and i must divide the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to prolong this discussion but i cannot resist the challenge that this is a platitudinous amendment it is nothing of the kind <e> <s> if it is platitudinous it is rather surprising that at present the cbi never loses an opportunity to say to its members that they should develop participatitive practices and give far more information to employees <e> <s> the cbi knows perfectly well as the minister is apparently not prepared to agree that there are a great many backwoodsmen around who are doing absolutely nothing of the kind <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that in thanking the civil servants for the effort that they have made to come in we would like specially to mention the staff of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise to your lordships house that i was not here at the beginning of the debate and i apologise particularly to the minister as i did not hear his opening speech <e> <s> unfortunately i had a longstanding engagement in nottingham which it was not possible for me to break <e> <s> i am particularly sorry that i was not able to hear the maiden speech of the noble lord lord keith of castleacre but i understand from my noble friend lord rochester that it was a very considerable contribution to the debate in your lordships house this evening <e>", "<cs> i very much hope that the noble lord lord wedderburn will not press this amendment <e> <s> i entirely agree with him that it would make for the most frightfully confused bargaining if people joined what was not the right union for the bargaining unit that they should be in and that it is highly desirable that the objective which he seeks should be followed <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble and learned lord to think again about this amendment <e> <s> it is a matter of fundamental importance especially as unionisation reaches higher levels and includes people with very heavy professional responsibilities <e> <s> i know that the noble lord said that it will be considered <e>", "<cs> surely it is stretching language somewhat <e>", "<cs> i am as will be expected not in agreement with the main thrust of the arguments of the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> however there is one point which he raised which i would ask the noble earl to examine very carefully that is the point which was raised recently about the position of a convenor <e> <s> as i understand it it is highly desirable that there should be responsible people on the picket line who will order the picket line <e> <s> i am sure it is not intended that the convenor should be excluded because the people to do this are not trade unionists or officials brought in from outside <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the minister but i cannot have made my point clear <e> <s> the convenor himself may belong to union a whereas as convenor he speaks for a whole group of unions <e> <s> therefore if he wants to control order then technically under the bill as it stands and not as i think is intended he would not be able to picket alongside people involved in the picket of the establishment who were in a different union from the union of the convenor <e> <s> that is the point that i am trying to make <e>", "<cs> we on these benches cannot support these amendments <e> <s> indeed my noble friend and i are somewhat surprised at hearing the group referred to as an all-party group <e> <s> certainly neither my noble friend nor i are in any way associated with it <e>", "<cs> is that agreeable to the noble lord lord mccarthy <e>", "<cs> this would be convenient and useful because it is clear that there are overlaps between these two amendments and to some extent although not entirely so their purpose is the same <e> <s> i will confine myself to the amendment which is down in my name and in that of my noble friend lord rochester although we are also interested in the whole issue of the terms and conditions of the restoration of section <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble earl <e> <s> i want to make it quite clear that i am in no way defending schedule <e> <s> what i am asking for is something quite different from the preservation of schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl not agree that he could add to his list of the ways in which unemployment could be reduced the speeding up of the rate of conversion of the unskilled to the skilled and encouraging skilled men to work wherever possible with men who have been trained in skill centres for skilled work <e>", "<cs> my lords is it impossible for the noble earl to think again about this matter <e> <s> is he aware that this museum has been used most effectively for training in industry and for training students from all over the country for many years <e> <s> it is a quite invaluable exhibition the loss of which will be greatly regretted <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that the extent to which people do not return to work suggests that it is ridiculous to ask them to say in writing before they leave whether they intend to return <e> <s> any sensible woman when asked will say that she will return she does not know at that stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to go on about this matter but will the minister agree that if he wants to give employers certainty it is absurd to ask women to write letters to the employers to say whether they are going back before they have had their baby <e> <s> because the one thing that the employer does not get from that is certainty <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says the government are issuing a leaflet explaining in detail how the unfair dismissal provisions work but it is a great pity they do not wait to see whether when the small firms have this information it relieves their anxiety <e> <s> there is a great deal of evidence everybody is quoting evidence tonight and we have all got our evidence that the objection to the unfair dismissal clause in the minds of many small employers is based on a misconception <e> <s> up and down the country we are told that we cannot dismiss anybody <e> <s> nothing will persuade people that the fact of the matter is that far more employees lose cases of unfair dismissal than win them <e> <s> this is a fact that simply has not penetrated the minds of a large number of small employers <e> <s> if we could get that into their heads i believe that any need that may exist for the relief of these provisions would fall to the ground <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful <e> <s> i only wish to rise to support this amendment or at least to support the suggestion that the noble earl the minister should look at it again <e> <s> as he has said this is not a matter of great importance but it is one that can be of quite significant importance in individual cases <e> <s> if it is really covered already in the act then of course there is no point in covering it twice <e> <s> but if there is any doubt as to whether it is covered then surely the shorter period which is proposed in the amendment has much to recommend it <e> <s> it would do little harm to have it incorporated and it would be extremely welcome in many quarters if the government were to see their way to think about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not being present at the beginning of the debate on this amendment and therefore did not hear all that the noble lord lord mccarthy said <e> <s> however i have listened very carefully to what the minister has said in reply <e> <s> i hope that i have understood him correctly <e> <s> did i understand him to say that the convenor would be able to go on the picket line in his own place of work although it might not be the picket line manned by people of his own union <e> <s> was the noble earl saying that the convenor would not be able to go on the picket line of a union <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house could the minister not look again at the possibility of the convenor being able to picket not only immediately in his own place of work <e> <s> which is what i understood the minister to say because of course nobody is in a better position to know what management is thinking and what managements problems are than the convenor <e> <s> he has the closest contact with management <e> <s> it is much more likely that the convenor will be able to convey the correct story and the correct impression than if he has to pass it through another shop steward <e> <s> we all know that as a message passes from person to person something is added or subtracted and it is a very different story that arrives on the line <e> <s> the convenor is by far the best informed person and i suggest that it is in the interests of industrial peace to enable him to have the fullest possible access to pickets whether or not the people picketing are directly in his union because he speaks for all the unions when he is dealing with management <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches will certainly vote against this amendment and in favour of the retention of this clause <e> <s> we believe that this is a bill which makes it possible for people of varying shades of opinion to agree that we have the legislation that is required as a basis for good industrial relations <e> <s> we are opposing and will continue to oppose amendments which have come from sections of the conservative party which express principles with which in some ways we have sympathy but which we believe if they found a place in legislation would make the unity of opinion as a broad basis of support which is essential for good industrial relations impossible <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches wish also to thank the noble lord the minister for repeating this statement <e> <s> in principle we are not averse to the idea of sales of elements of nationalised industries <e> <s> however we are bound to say in relation to this statement as the noble lord lord underhill has said that it is extremely difficult to see what the government intend <e> <s> in these circumstances we cannot make a response which has any great meaning <e> <s> we must instead ask the noble lord to answer certain questions <e> <s> for instance it is not plain where the controlling interests will ultimately reside <e> <s> there is a phrase in the statement which suggests that it will he with the private enterprise sector to whom the assets are sold <e> <s> but this is by no means clear <e> <s> it is also not clear whether this is a once-and-for-all sale or whether there will be continuing instalments of private money into these undertakings <e> <s> further what kind of management is proposed for the assets when they are sold <e>", "<cs> like the noble baroness lady phillips as an englishwoman i hesitate to say anything but the question of mobility is most important and like lady phillips i was extremely surprised to hear the noble earl say that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> would he recognise that many womens organisations not covered by the womens <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement which has been made in another place and to ask him to confirm what i take to be the fact from the statement that the monopoly in the provision of the network will be maintained intact <e> <s> that seems to me an essential requirement <e> <s> with that proviso however we would very much welcome the opportunity for private sector initiatives in the provision of equipment <e> <s> the monopoly on equipment has without doubt slowed down the development of what should be a rapidly expanding industry <e> <s> those of us who have attempted for example to get an ansaphone and have been told that the post offices charge would be a week for what is a glorified tape recorder must be very glad to hear that there is to <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to intervene for a very short time to make what many people would perhaps regard as a committee point rather than a matter for a second reading debate <e> <s> however it certainly is worth raising at second reading because there are general issues connected with it which need further examination <e> <s> i am referring to the questions raised in clause which imposes a requirement of provision for training <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by saying how much i agree with the sentiments expressed by the noble lord lord beswick when he said that the problems facing this country are far too serious and far too complex to be solved by the application of what are very largely out-of-date dogmas <e> <s> if we are going to get anywhere on all sides of this house progress has to come from a rejection of the over-simplification of dogmas however dear those dogmas happen to be to the hearts of members in all parts of this house <e> <s> in the same spirit the noble lord he said that what was needed today was the getting together of those with the greatest ability and goodwill those with the greatest knowledge and insight in the country in an attempt to find solutions to the overwhelmingly difficult problems that face us <e> <s> it is surely one of the great merits and advantages of your lordships house that i think we find it with perhaps a few rare exceptions rather difficult to keep the party adversarial game going <e> <s> we are at our most natural best when we are being least partisan and if there were no other reason for keeping your lordships house in existence it would be desirable to have it as a counterpart to the dogfights which take place in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it that the million limitation has been chosen because the government assume that at that figure it would be very unlikely that an organisation can dominate the market and that therefore ordinary competitive processes will work <e> <s> while i imagine that in most cases that would be true there is the question which think arose when the bill was going through the house of what is virtually a monopoly or indeed completely a monopoly in a local area although the actual turnover may be very low and indeed would be much lower than the million which appears in the order <e> <s> the minister said something about this when he was going through the order just now but it would be helpful if only for the record if he would tell us a little more about the situation where there is a monopoly in a local area albeit involving a small turnover yet none the less a monopoly <e> <s> such would be quite possible for example with the provision of a service <e> <s> if it seemed to some people that that monopoly was being exploited how could action be taken with the present provisions to have that checked <e>", "<cs> my lords it was not the level so much as the difficulty of getting at it <e> <s> i can envisage a situation in which a local monopoly is going on and in practice it might be very difficult to bring it to book <e> <s> that is what i am after <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to say how many other government departments made economies similar to those of the equal opportunities commission about which he has told us <e> <s> would he not agree that in any case the equal opportunities commission was provided with a budget cut to the bone when it was set up <e>", "<cs> certainly <e> <s> obviously there is an overlap between the two amendments <e> <s> i was waiting to see what happened to amendment no <e> <s> before deciding how i would handle amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however i think it would be very much for the convenience of the committee if we took the two together <e> <s> when it comes to voting we can consider how we will deal with the amendments <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the minister for making this suggestion <e> <s> i think it is much the best way to handle these two very similar amendments <e> <s> i had two major reasons for putting down my amendment <e> <s> in dealing with the first one which is the general case for strengthening training in the television industry i shall be responding if that is the right word to the points put forward by the noble earl lord de la warr <e> <s> i must say i was astonished that the noble earl took the line that the establishment of an itb was a socialist measure since the itbs were established by a conservative government under the industrial training act <e>", "<cs> i think the committee will agree that the purpose of the conservative act of was inter <e>", "<cs> i have not had discussions with the authorities but i have had discussions with a number of their employees <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl not agree that training represents an essential investment yet one which at the moment a great deal of industry simply cannot afford <e> <s> is there not a considerable difference between cutting current consumption and cutting investment of a vital kind <e> <s> the case for investment in training surely continues <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not surprised but i very much regret the reception which has been given by the minister and i shall reply briefly despite the lateness of the hour to one or two of the other remarks that have been made <e> <s> of course if the sex discrimination act and the race relations act were working as intended there would be no need to do anything more about it but they are not so working <e> <s> we have already sufficient evidence from work that is going on in this field that it is far better that individual industries should really launch effective schemes for themselves <e> <s> this is what this is intended to do <e> <s> it is to give an impetus to the ia to take the initiative using section of the sex discrimination act which allows discriminatory training or preferential training <e> <s> unlike any other kind of preferential treatment the training is permitted under section to groups which are under-represented in particular occupations <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first apologise sincerely to the house because owing to a prior engagement from which i cannot escape it will be impossible for me to stay to the end of the debate <e> <s> i apologise particularly to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate who is to reply <e> <s> clearly we are at the beginning and not at the end of a discussion of this very complicated and important subject <e> <s> some of us certainly see the issue primarily as an issue to improve the position of consumers needing a defence in a complicated and developing economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to pick holes in any particular part of these codes of practice nor do i propose to vote against them if a division is called <e> <s> but i want to voice a certain unease about the increasing use of codes of practice <e> <s> i do not think we are clear about what nature of instrument codes of practice <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends who is going to agree which raises another issue does it not <e> <s> the agreement is with people who are outside the legislative assembly and that raises another set of issues <e>", "<cs> my lords to my great disadvantage i missed the maiden speech of the noble lord lord weinstock from which i know i would have learned a very great deal <e> <s> so may i congratulate him in the certain knowledge that it was a very useful speech indeed <e> <s> may i also congratulate the right reverend prelate for what i think was a really inspiring speech an extraordinarily informed and incisive speech for which i think the whole house will be grateful <e> <s> the trouble with speaking at this time of night is threefold first the speaker is nearly asleep second the audience in your lordships house wishes it was asleep and third everything worth saying has already been said <e> <s> i propose to cut down very considerably what i had originally intended to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i said billion <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise to your lordships house as i have already apologised <e>", "<cs> my lords i am fully aware particularly in the case of the noble earl lord gowrie that he is

of it <e> <s> this is something to which the government should be giving the maximum publicity <e> <s> within the ranks of the conservative <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we also wish to thank the noble lord for repeating the statement and we also regret the reason for the absence of the noble viscount lord trenchard <e> <s> unlike the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede we do not regret the fact that the government do not intend to apply for a continuation of quota <e> <s> we do not believe that british industry is best maintained by a continuation of quota and we recognise

prepared to press the united <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble earl whether he would agree that the energy being consumed in your lordships chamber is grossly excessive <e>", "<cs> i must say that the noble earl can never have lived on his own if he thinks that it is not in the interests of consumers to have meter reading done outside the building <e> <s> as the noble lord lord tanlaw has said it is a source of constant irritation to people who have to go out to work and if the occupants are couples often they both go out to work that it is not possible to get their meter effectively read <e>

ago it seemed to possess <e> <s> it now has an opportunity if it will take it to show how relevant the community can be to the problems which confront ordinary people in this country and it is only by establishing its relevance to the problems of the ordinary people that the imagination of the voters and therefore the enthusiasm of governments can be recaptured <e> <s> it is perhaps sad that that relevance springs from the horrors of unemployment which we are enduring today and which there is little doubt we shall continue to endure for months and probably years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble earl the minister but i wonder whether i may have a direct answer to this question <e> <s> the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would also like to thank the minister for repeating this statement this afternoon <e> <s> as a policy we are opposed to pouring money into industries for which there is no likely successful future and this is a very great deal of money million over a period of four years or something of the order of for every man woman and child in the united kingdom over that period <e> <s> therefore we need to be satisfied that this money is going to be used to good purpose <e> <s> we recognise of course that the future of bl is not concerned only with bl itself but will have a great effect on employment in the very large number of suppliers where jobs would be lost on a very large scale if bl were unable to continue in business <e> <s> therefore while having reservations about the wisdom of investment of this kind unless there is true security we recognise that it is not unreasonable that the government should attempt to keep the more viable parts of bl alive and to see them flourish <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to underline and reinforce what the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill said about the present inadequate approach to education in relation to the community <e> <s> when the treaty of rome was passed there were perhaps reasons why it was not seen fit that education should be included as a matter for concern within the community on the very narrow argument that education was not a matter which directly affected the relative competitiveness of the countries of the community <e> <s> both in relation to the immediate problems which the community is facing and in relation to the development of the community as a true community nothing could be further from the truth than that education is not a matter of central importance in the community <e> <s> one <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that raising the vat level would be a contribution to encouraging entrepreneurs in the hidden economy to come out into the open and that that would be of great assistance in a number of directions <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also wish to thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> i am sure he will agree that it is so much an interim statement there is so little flesh on the bones that it is virtually impossible to pick the bones with him <e> <s> however we are glad to hear that some further information will be forthcoming shortly <e> <s> we must wish

additional amount of taxpayers money going into this enormously loss-creating enterprise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt but the support we were giving was to the social democrats inside the labour party and that is why the lib-lab pact was such a huge success <e>", "<cs> my lords it was i suppose inevitable in discussing so sensible a document as my right honourable friends -point programme that a great deal of the criticism should have been beside the point because it is criticising my right honourable friend for <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord himself must know that this depends upon the kind of proportional representation that you have and whether you put on a limit as in west germany <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also thank the minister for introducing the bill <e> <s> but it seems somewhat unreal to be discussing this in the light of the statement that is to be made in a few minutes time and the bill that that statement heralds <e> <s> i shall be very brief indeed <e> <s> reluctantly we accept that this bill must go through because it appears to be the case that if it does not the british steel corpora <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i wish to thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> i am afraid i cannot entirely go along with the noble lord lord beswick when he refers to the million as a welter of words about the taxpayer <e> <s> it seems to me that this is per head per person in this country which is something rather different from a welter of words <e> <s> may i ask the minister how much collaboration there has been with the trade unions in working out these new plans and what commitments have come from the unions about ensuring that in fact everything possible will be done to see that this industry an essential industry granted does not lose any more of the taxpayers money <e> <s> if i may revert to the discussion we had previously on the bill may i ask the noble earl to comment on ravenscraig and why it was impossible to get the supplies through to shotton <e> <s> this highlights the kind of problem which taxpayers need to understand when they are asked to finance an industry to this extent

there is deep anxiety about the level of unemployment <e> <s> it would be absurd to imagine that the government are not as concerned about the issue of unemployment as are any other group in this country <e> <s> they would be <e>", "<cs> my lords it is ironic to be discussing the competitiveness of british industry the day after the budget when there were so many lost opportunities to improve that competitiveness <e> <s> there was no reduction in the national insurance surcharge virtually nothing was done to change the level of the exchange rate of the pound which appears to be practically as high today as it was yesterday and nothing has been done to increase the flow of money into the investment which industry so badly needs <e> <s> was it really impossible to extend the use of the indexed bond which is being offered to the pension institutions to a far wider public what is so special about the age of <e> <s> in order to raise money which would have been used for the investment of industry <e> <s> if the government believe in their anti-inflation policy they need offer a very small return on top of indexation and the cost of the borrowing of that money would be very little

satisfactorily and to remain in business <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise from these benches to give general support to the governments policy in this bill in particular to the intention to extend privatisation if we have to call it privatisation <e> <s> i suppose that is the word though i should have thought that the noble earl lord gowrie with his skill with words would have been able to devise a better term <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also wish to thank the minister for repeating the statement <e>", "<cs> for making the statement one gets into the bad habit of saying repeating the statement <e> <s> we are glad that he has not given way to pressure to increase the amount of money to be paid to the civil servants <e> <s> we believe that it is extremely important that public opinion should be fully informed about what is really involved <e> <s> therefore i would ask him once more to repeat what the civil servants have received in the last three years which i consider ought to be very widely understood <e> <s> after all there is nothing sacrosanct about the period of one year <e>", "<cs> my lords it remains only for me to thank all those who have contributed to this interesting debate and in particular to the three noble lords who made their maiden speeches <e> <s> the house will not want me at this hour to detain noble lords for long but there are a few points i feel i must make <e> <s> first i would assure the noble prelate that i am well aware that it was not the fault fo the house of bishops in the synod that further progress was not made nor indeed to the house of laity it was i understand the recalcitrant clergy who held up progress in this regard <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i apologise to the house in that because of an engagement i entered into long before i knew about this debate it is now highly improbable that i shall be able to be here at the end of it <e> <s> i should like in particular to apologise to the minister who will be replying to the debate <e> <s> i should also like to declare an interest <e> <s> i notice that in this i am in good company in that about two-thirds of the speakers this afternoon also have spent at least two-thirds of their working lives in higher and further education and have a considerable interest if not a stake in what happens in the higher education field <e> <s> along with the noble lord lord crowther-hunt i <e>", "<cs> my lords as i listened to the noble earls opening remarks before he started talking about this bill i felt a great deal of sympathy with what he had to say and i began to believe that he at any rate was very much on the right lines <e> <s> it is true that our training of young people and indeed of older people lags sadly behind that of our competitors <e> <s> it is true that in many ways our training methods are grossly out of date that we need to think anew and to think radically about the kind of training we need starting with what goes on in schools carrying through the bridging period between school and work and going into training while people are at work and indeed the retraining which is needed as the rapid change in labour market demands means that new skills must be learned and new knowledge acquired <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to hold up the noble earl but he is assuming that the standard would go on if the boards were not there to prod them <e> <s> after all exemption is conditional on the continuation of the standard and the boards are there to see that the standard is maintained <e> <s> if you remove the boards you remove the prod and the noble earl has not told us why he thinks that without the possibility of the disappearance of the exemption the same work would go on <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also feel considerable concern about this transfer to lonrho and about the conditions which have been given to us this afternoon <e> <s> it goes without saying that the freedom of the press and particularly of a great newspaper like <e>", "<cs> potentially how many people are we talking about <e> <s> surely a very small number of people will use this <e> <s> let us suppose that everybody who is interested in working overseas fiddles a bit what is the right expression <e> <s> it would only amount to a very small number of people getting british citizenship who would not get it if this clause were included <e> <s> does it really matter <e> <s> you do not have to plug every hole <e> <s> i do not think that the problem is big enough yet to elaborate the bill in this way <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble earl accepting that he has the very great concern that we know he has if we abolished training boards what mechanism is to be used to see firm by firm that in fact these schemes are operating <e> <s> i cannot see how it is going to work on the ground <e> <s> i do not believe that the noble earl believes that if we just leave it all to the market the market forces will be making them do all the right things <e> <s> the noble earl is far too intelligent to believe that <e> <s> but it does need some prodding mechanism and i cannot see in the structure that will be left behind when the training boards have gone where the prodding mechanism would be found <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble earl the minister will consider the amendment very seriously indeed <e> <s> i feel sure that he is to say that it is quite unnecessary to have these criteria spelt out and embodied in the bill because he has said this already twice this evening the secretary of state will produce a negative resolution a negative resolution mark you <e> <s> not even an affirmative resolution and we can then all pray <e> <s> well i am all for praying but i do not believe that on this occasion prayer will be very much good <e> <s> as the noble earl the minister knows perfectly well the resolution cannot be amended <e> <s> either we have to accept what the secretary of state says or reject the proposal completely <e> <s> therefore it is very unlikely that we would be able to bring about any alteration at all <e> <s> it really is not quite up to the ministers standard to pretend that that is any kind of defence or any adequate substitute for having criteria built into the legislation <e> <s> that is the first reason why we cannot really accept the idea that there is no need to have criteria built into the legislation itself <e>", "<cs> if i may finish before my noble friend or anybody else interrupts me we do need to have criteria of this kind <e> <s> may i make one further point as to why we need to have it spelled out in detail to be operated at local level <e> <s> i am really back to the point i made earlier this evening about the need for mechanisms to make sure that the system is working <e> <s> everything that has been said by the noble lord up till now has it seems to me a static note about it that you get a report from the msc and on the basis of this you decide what is going to be done <e> <s> it is the essence of the training problem that it is in a continuous state of change and you need to have a mechanism close to the ground which can be in very close touch with what are the changing needs and feed that knowledge of changing requirements into training requirements <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will agree that what the country needs at the present time like a hole in the head is a knock-about party political battle between the two front benches <e> <s> if retribution is coming i suggest that they look to warrington to see the direction from which it is coming <e> <s> having said that i have no intention of going back into the past <e> <s> it is surely clear that the issues that we face today need a collaborative effort and not mutual attacks and recrimination <e> <s> they are serious enough in all conscience and in some directions at least they are certainly getting worse <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to point out to the noble lord that i specifically limited the allowance to particular areas of high unemployment where there was inadequate public transport <e> <s> i fully realise that otherwise the cost is out of this world <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment and to ask the minister to clarify what the governments intentions on expenditure on training really are <e> <s> if the government want more money to spend on training it is an odd way to start to remove quite a lot of potential money in order to pay redundancy payments for people in training boards <e> <s> in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much hope that the house will support this amendment <e> <s> i think we would all be encouraged by the latter part of the noble earls speech in which he was indicating to us a real concern about the standards to be applied by the voluntary bodies and for this i am sure we shall be grateful <e> <s> but i do not think that that answers the point that we have made requiring these standards to be embodied in the legislation <e> <s> the reason why i say that is that i ask the noble earl to think ahead as to what is likely to happen after these bodies have been established <e> <s> the fact of the matter undoubtedly is that inside industry there are some people who have been leaders in training inside each sector some firms which have been leaders which have pioneered new training and who care a great deal to see that this should go on <e> <s> there are others who do not care at all who would have done nothing unless they had <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene for a moment of course liberals and even his great master adam smith always accepted that there were circumstances in which intervention had to be supported <e>", "<cs> my lords do not the figures that we have had and the question raised by the noble lord suggest that the percentage of people being trained in that industry is grossly inadequate <e> <s> this may account for the fact that there are so few of our own youngsters going into it <e> <s> further would not the noble lord agree that that probably being the case there is a very strong case indeed for maintaining the training board in that essential industry <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister give the house an assurance that the expansion of the youth opportunities programme proposed in the new initiative will in fact contain a greatly increased training component agreeing very strongly with what the noble lord lord orr-ewing has said <e> <s> this inevitably will be more expensive <e> <s> will the noble viscount say that the government will not stint the money required to make a very much better training job of the youth opportunities programme than has been possible before now <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add to the congratulations which have been offered to the two noble lords who have made their maiden speeches tonight <e> <s> they were such informative and delightfully delivered speeches and we shall look forward to hearing from them very often in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister comment on a point raised by my noble friend lord avebury about the governments role as employer <e> <s> there have been questions raised about this matter both in your lordships house and in the select committee report in another place <e> <s> it would be reassuring to know that the government were reviewing their own policy as an employer a matter which has been open to criticism on a number of occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall resist the temptation which is not very strong to enter into the punch and judy show between the noble lords lord mccarthy and lord spens <e>", "<cs> it has a very familiar ring to me my lords <e> <s> i seem to have heard somewhat similar arguments advanced in the select committee on unemployment and it is less than exhilarating to hear them rehearsed once again on the floor of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords only last week there was agreement between the government front bench and speakers on this side of the house that the core problem in this country is the uncompetitiveness of british industry <e> <s> if that is common ground between us it seems extraordinary that the government should be cutting back the investment in people without whom we do not have a hope of making ourselves more competitive <e> <s> it will be very interesting indeed to hear from the noble viscount lord trenchard how he reconciles these two positions the need to be far more competitive than we are about which we all agree and this reduction in the money being invested in people <e> <s> because this is what it is of course an investment in people <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would also like to thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> obviously the objective must be with our partners in europe to move towards a smaller more efficient more competitive steel industry <e> <s> but given the state of the steel industry throughout the community at present it is sadly inevitable that this means assistance to the industry in order to be able to reduce capacity to the state at which it will be possible to build up that more efficient and competitive industry <e> <s> therefore we very much welcome the fact that the government have decided to take this step <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree before he gets too enthusiastic about our high level of employment that our figures are swollen by the fact that they include a very large number of women working only part-time who cannot really rank as part of full employment <e> <s> that is the reason why the figures in denmark are so high because so many of their women also work part-time <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that it would be appropriate for those of us who were foolish enough to pay on demand to withhold payment of the next bill that comes in until we have earned so to speak the interest due to us by delaying payment for that amount of time <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches are also glad to see that this matter has been brought before your lordships house today <e> <s> as the two other speakers have already said it is long overdue that we should review the shops act <e> <s> in particular the whole pattern of living of women has changed <e> <s> a very large number of married women now go out to work <e> <s> ft is extremely inconvenient and hard on them that shops should close as they stop work <e> <s> therefore shopping has to be done at the most inconvenient times at times when they would like to be at home catching up on the work that they would be doing at home if they were not out at work <e> <s> the ability to do your shopping on the way home from work because the shops stay open would undoubtedly be of very considerable <e>", "<cs> my lords before considering the merits or otherwise of the bill before your lordships house i should like with your lordships permission to take up one or two points which the noble lord lord spens has made <e> <s> first i think that it is a pity and it is becoming something of a practice in certain parts of your lordships house to use the term quango as a term of abuse <e> <s> there have been many quangos which have done extremely useful jobs <e> <s> a quango is in fact despite its rather unfortunate name a way in which jobs can be done in a more expert way and often a great deal more cheaply than if they were done through ordinary bureaucratic machinery <e> <s> all the quangos that i happen to sit on are unpaid but that does not make them any less useful <e> <s> i am a great supporter of the quango in its proper place <e> <s> so every time anybody uses quangos in that way i intend to defend them <e>", "<cs> we on these benches greatly welcome the amendment <e> <s> the reservations we expressed on second reading were due to the fact that we were not sufficiently reassured about the position of workers <e>", "<cs> i should like in general to support this amendment <e> <s> i think however that it is somewhat defective <e> <s> it refers to sundays christmas day and good friday but we are a multiracial society with a number of different religions and if we are to have a clause of this kind in the bill and i hope we shall it should be drafted in such a way that all religious scruple should be taken into account that of jews moslems and the other religions which we now have in this country <e> <s> i believe that the purpose of this bill is correct but i believe also that it should include a clause to make it possible for those people who on conscientious grounds feel they do not wish to work on these days not to do so <e>", "<cs> when i hear that the employers and the trade unions are in agreement about something i know that there is a snag in it and that somebody has to say that there is another interest which needs to be defended <e> <s> the noble lord lord jacques said that we need to have an inquiry <e> <s> we have been pressing for changes in the shops acts for at least <e>", "<cs> we on these benches also welcome this amendment <e> <s> one month was undoubtedly too short for consultation <e> <s> this is a great improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house will be grateful yet again to the noble and learned lord lord scarman and sub-committee e for the very lucid report he has given to your lordships and if i dare say so for the brilliant exposition we have just heard of the content of that report <e> <s> reading the report one is struck as a non-lawer looking at it primarily from a political point of view by the great change in attitude a change by no means for the better which has taken place since the treaty was signed to the present day <e>", "<cs> my lords the hour is late the list of speakers relatively long and i shall be extremely brief <e>", "<cs> my lords after that panoramic view of the problem which has been put before us by the noble lord lord davies of leek i wish if i may boringly perhaps to concentrate on one or <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble ally the noble lord lord kilmarnock for introducing this debate this afternoon <e> <s> i should also like to take this opportunity of paying tribute to the noble lord lord scanlon who is about to relinquish his responsibilities as chairman of the engineering training board for sweeping away in that industry so many deeply conservative ideas about training which have bedevilled the industry in the past and for giving the new ideas embodied in this report and in others a chance for development in what is still after all britains premier industry <e> <s> we owe him a very great deal <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government prepared to study the loi monory scheme in france which would make a very considerable extension of share ownership throughout industry to people who do not at present have the advantages of sharing in the profits of industry <e>", "<cs> my lords the hour is late and nearly everything that could possibly be said about the bill has already been said several times <e> <s> so i shall be brief <e> <s> certain noble lords have said they do not understand why it is called an employment bill <e> <s> there is a good reason why it should be called an employment bill or there could be if it were a rather different sort of bill <e> <s> industrial relations certainly have a close connection with employment <e> <s> bad industrial relations undoubtedly reduce employment opportunities <e> <s> they reduce the efficiency of industry <e> <s> they reduce mobility of industry <e> <s> they reduce willingness to collaborate <e> <s> therefore there is a close connection between industrial relations and employment <e> <s> but i am afraid that i do not think that this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad the noble lord lord campbell reminded me of that <e> <s> i had made a note to say something about it as he spoke <e> <s> my own view and i am sorry to say this to an eminent lawyer is that the less the judges come into industrial relations and indeed the less lawyers come into industrial relations the better we shall all be <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would also like to thank the minister for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> we too must of course deplore the initiation of strike action and its continuation on the part of the health service workers <e> <s> we recognise the difficulty in which the government find themselves in that they have an incomes policy for the public sector but no incomes policy throughout the country as a whole <e> <s> i know that the noble lord will tell me the government have not an incomes policy for the public sector but a rose by any other name and this looks more like an incomes policy than most incomes policies that we have had in the past <e>", "<cs> can the minister give us some information about the relative costs <e> <s> speaking from memory it costs over a year to keep a person in gaol <e> <s> what are the relative costs for these different approaches <e> <s> the minister may not be able to be exact but following on what the noble earl lord onslow said i should have thought that we could be fairly lavish on supervision compared to the amount it costs to keep someone in gaol <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would also like to thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> we agree of course with the policy of concentrating resources where the need is greatest <e> <s> that must be right <e> <s> is the noble lord really satisfied that the present approach to identifying the areas where need is greatest is satisfactory in the light of the present pattern that has emerged with the growth in unemployment <e> <s> i refer to the emergence of black spots which are scattered in all the regions <e> <s> it is perfectly possible today to identify black spots in areas which are not in regions which attract support and in other parts where unemployment is by no means so serious although they are seen as being areas of high unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would like to thank the minister for repeating the statement and say that of course we agree it is deplorable that so much disruption has been caused and that there has been so much trouble to the travelling public <e> <s> we take the line that there can be no compromise on the productivity agreement that the productivity improvements must be implemented and that there can be no exception to that <e> <s> we also agree that the negotiation procedures for london transport should not have been abandoned <e> <s> once procedures agreed to are not allowed to operate then a state of anarchy in industrial relations results <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> we would also like to be associated with the expression of relief and appreciation that the nur representatives in plymouth had the good sense to call off the nur strike <e> <s> we obviously also deplore aslefs decision without any further reference to its membership to call an indefinite strike <e> <s> on the other hand unlike the noble lord lord underhill we take the line that the british railways board cannot negotiate under duress <e> <s> it cannot go back on its productivity proposals <e> <s> there has been almost unending consultation about this stretching back into the dim distant past <e> <s> there has been an arbitration decision on it and if there is to be any order in industrial relations then that must be taken into account and the strike must be called off before any more negotiations can take place <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise a point a narrower point but one which i should have thought would be dear to the hearts of members of the front bench opposite <e> <s> in the reference in the explanatory and financial memorandum of the bill to the amount of public money to be spent it is stated that it is proposed to pay out up to million <e> <s> it is then stated that it will cost a quarter of a million pounds to pay out million <e> <s> that seems to be an enormously high <e>", "<cs> i should like very much to agree with the noble lord lord aylestone that it will be extraordinarily difficult to track down this information if one feels that one needs to have it <e> <s> in response to some of the remarks made by the noble lord lord mccarthy and to the query who is professor gennard <e> <s> let me tell the committee if it is any help that professor gennard was at one time a colleague of both professor wedderburn and myself <e> <s> i do not know what light that throws on the matter <e>", "<cs> we on these benches are unable to support this amendment <e> <s> nobody in your lordships committee knows better than the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> we on these benches should like very much to support what the noble lord lord mottistone has said <e> <s> we believe that this is dealing with a very real point i do not want to enlarge what the noble lord lord mccarthy has said and that it meets a problem <e> <s> i very much hope that the government will take it away and think about it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that it would have been rather a good idea to have done these studies before and not after the telegram service was removed <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow up the point made by the noble lord lord jenkins and to ask before dealing with the amendment whether some special provision is being made in the case of actors <e> <s> there was a special case for seamen in the act but i do not recall similar reservations made with regard to acting and to merchant seamen in this bill <e> <s> i should be interested to know what the noble lord has to say about that <e>", "<cs> my lords while we wish to thank the minister for repeating the statement we should like to say that we find very little in it to welcome beyond the fact that the local boards will be smaller than the previous ones <e> <s> that at least is a step in the right direction <e> <s> the idea that these local boards should all be appointed by the secretary of state with no democratic control at all over them seems to us a most retrograde step <e> <s> now that the water rate has been separated out from other rates and has grown enormously in the process surely it would be possible to have a degree of direct election by the people who have to pay for the water to the bodies which control it <e> <s> following what was said by the noble baroness lady birk i deeply regret that the government have seen fit to set up yet more of these ineffective advisory committees and in so doing to keep the interests which are concerned with the operation of the water bodies off the decision-making bodies <e> <s> surely the consumers and the major industrial and union interests should be directly represented on the bodies which make the important decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl if he does not like the appointment <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would like very much to support the noble lord lord davies of leek in his suggestion that this matter should be debated in your lordships house <e> <s> it has been brought about with the minimum of consultation <e> <s> there was a consultative document but there has been no general discussion <e> <s> it is a matter of very considerable importance for a large number of people and the questions raised in your lordships house this afternoon have not with all respect been answered <e>", "<cs> in order to get it on the record may i ask the minister whether the protection which he thinks is already available for these persons is protection of their jobs or only protection that they will get compensation <e> <s> what matters is to be certain that they will not lose their jobs <e>", "<cs> surely the last thing one wants to do is to prolong the debate at this time of night <e> <s> but if i may i should like very briefly to say something which is perhaps in support of what i understand the noble earl lord gowrie to be saying and against the step-by-step interpretation which i think some people feel implies that there is a plan of course i have no knowledge of what plan the government may have and that somebody knows precisely where we have got to be by the year and that we are reaching that point step by step <e> <s> this seems to me to be an appalling approach to any development in industrial relations and not in the least to be encouraged by anyone who wants better industrial relations in this country <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i accept the comment that there is no possible proof that any particular figure is absolutely right but since i consider and as people who have spoken on this side of the committee consider that this figure of is an improvement on the existing figure of i wish to test the opinion of the committee and will divide <e>", "<cs> my lords may i <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord implied that the government might set up such an inquiry <e> <s> may i very strongly urge that they should do so and should do so reasonably quickly <e> <s> there are an increasing number of people who are very worried about the implications of these practices and would very much like to see a thorough authoritative well-informed investigation taking place <e>", "<cs> may i ask what would now be the maximum rate for unfair dismissal if the figure that was paid in the conservative governments act which first introduced the unfair dismissal award had been indexed to keep up with inflation <e> <s> what would now be being paid <e>", "<cs> following what the noble lord lord harris has said would the noble earl look at his approach again <e> <s> there are a number of issues <e> <s> there is the question of the deterrent <e> <s> there has to be a degree of deterrence <e> <s> we accept that <e> <s> there is the question of the absolute amount to be paid <e> <s> this is in relation to the small business in particular as the noble lord lord harris has said <e> <s> there is the question of the level in so far as it encourages people to suddenly discover a conscience <e> <s> i do not suppose that there will be a lot of them but i am sure there will be some <e> <s> with a large sum of money if one is just wavering on the brink it encourages one to discover suddenly that one has never thought much of being in a trade union <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise another matter which is germane to the other questions which have been raised <e> <s> would i be right in thinking that if the clause goes through it would still be open to any local authority for example to use the fair wage regulation which does not require union membership but which requires conditions no less good than union membership and that in that case to use a rather extreme example they would then be in the clear <e> <s> they could then employ ibm because it certainly has no less good conditions whereas if there is a ban on contracts where there is not union membership they would not be able to employ ibm <e> <s> am i right <e>", "<cs> does the noble and learned lord see any distinction between the offences referred to under subsections <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> we want trade unions to be responsible but it is no part of our policy to cripple them or to take away the reality of the right to strike <e> <s> the level of damages here means that for a great many unions strike action will be so financially perilous that they will be prevented from taking it <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down may i ask him to clear up one point <e> <s> it may have been dealt with already and because of the lateness or should i say earliness of the hour depending on ones point of view i may have failed to appreciate it <e> <s> if there is a dispute in one country can the employees of that company in another country strike in support of the initial dispute in the foreign country <e> <s> they have a common employer but the dispute is outside the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister accept that there really is a very great sense of urgency about this <e> <s> where the nationalised industries are concerned they are dealing with commodities of very great importance to everybody in the country and there has been great concern about price increases and the lack of consumer protection in these industries <e>", "<cs> my lords we from these benches should also like to thank the noble lord for the statement that he has made in your lordships house this afternoon <e> <s> we regard it as a statement of very great importance and seriousness <e> <s> we support the government in attempting to avert the high protection that the united states is imposing against the steel industry but we very much hope that every possible step will be taken to avoid a trade war breaking out between the united states and this country and the countries of the community which could have only the most devastating effect on both sides <e> <s> can the noble lord elaborate somewhat on the defence of the british case in saying that the restructuring costs do not amount to unfair competition <e> <s> that seems to be a sound argument so far as it stands but in the view of the americans are other payments being made which cannot be so defended <e> <s> will he demonstrate to the house that our case is in fact watertight against the criticisms made by the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened to the speech of the noble lord lord jacques with interest but also with some degree of sadness <e> <s> it was the same old mixture as before the same adversarial attack on what is going on the same absence of any realisation of how deep-seated our problems are and how far back <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not at the moment take any responsibility for what mr roy jenkins did in another place at another time and in another party <e> <s> the failure to emphasise right through the country the importance of profit has been one of the real reasons why we are in so poor a state <e> <s> the labour party as a whole not just during recent governments but over decades has contributed more to the decline of this country by denigrating the activities of business in wealth creation than any other single factor <e> <s> that is more among the intellectual radical chique element of the party not thank heaven <e> <s> over-represented in your lordships house than it is among the trade union movement as such and the industrial wing of the party <e> <s> but failure to appreciate the importance of <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl forgive me for interrupting him <e> <s> i think in fairness one ought to make the point that lord vaizey did not agree with some important points in the report <e>", "<cs> mr jenkins policies in a previous incarnation <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord howie of troon i am very glad that the government have been able to go this far but regret that the question is only one of unfair dismissal and not of retention of the job <e> <s> it seems to me that where the professional code or the statutory duty conflicts this should take priority <e> <s> it remains to me monstrous that a man in that position is going to lose his job albeit he is going to be compensated <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very strongly to support this amendment <e> <s> i understand that the reasons given for the very high levels of payment in the closed shop cases were first that there should be a deterrent and secondly that such cases were in breach of a piece of legislation and contrary to the law <e> <s> both those arguments apply in relation to offences under the sex discrimination act and the race relations act <e> <s> it is embodied in acts of parliament that there should be no discrimination <e> <s> so to that extent closed shop considerations are on all fours with being embodied in an act of parliament <e> <s> similarly and i would argue even more strongly than in the case of closed shop cases there is a need for deterrence in relation to both sex discrimination cases and race relations cases <e> <s> we know that the law in this country is much weaker in both regards than the law in the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl lord ferrers to say what he means by compel <e> <s> if you offer somebody a lower level of pay which is not a nice thing to be offered it might induce them to go without compelling them to go they could still take a lower level of pay if they wished to do so <e> <s> you may be inducing them or motivating them in that direction but not compelling them <e> <s> may i ask the noble earl to explain that rather more fully <e>", "<cs> my lords we too would like to support this amendment and to express our great concern that the fair wages resolution has been abolished since we met here earlier and discussed the clause which had to deal with union-only labour contracts <e> <s> your lordships may remember that on that occasion i made the point that one did not have to have union-only contracts in order that decent standards of employment should obtain in organisations to which local authorities and others give contracts <e> <s> i made the point that that was so because there was a fair wages resolution <e> <s> since that time that has been abolished <e> <s> i feel that to some extent we supported the government on that occasion somewhat under false pretences <e>", "<cs> my lords we also wish to thank the noble lord for making the statement in your lordships house and to say that we support the action taken in rejecting the american embargo and in the instruction that has been issued to the four named companies <e> <s> the employment consequences of any such embargo would of course be serious <e> <s> we also support the whole idea of the development of the pipe-line <e>", "<cs> my lords surely everyone in your lordships house agrees that we do not want situations in which peoples life and limb is endangered <e> <s> there is no argument about that <e> <s> that is not what the discussion is about <e> <s> nor with all respect is it about the particular cases where somebody not medically qualified makes these decisions <e> <s> we must all deplore that <e> <s> this amendment is much wider than dealing with such cases and it is not basically about that <e> <s> while agreeing that we want to avoid imperilling cases of that sort there are two points in connection with this amendment which make it unacceptable to us on these benches at any rate <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to concentrate on one particular aspect of this problem and on one facet of that problem <e> <s> it is the issue of unemployment <e> <s> in the scarman report the point was made that at that time and we have been told this evening that the figures have worsened since that date per cent <e> <s> of young blacks in brixton were out of work <e> <s> many speakers have deplored this in our debate today <e> <s> however i want to underline that this is not only a problem for the present and not only in brixton but in many other parts of the country where the same figures could be repeated but that it is building up a tremendous problem for the future <e> <s> not only are these young men out of work but they are among the unskilled <e> <s> because they have not had work because they have not had training they will continue to be unskilled <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin with no fewer than three apologies apologies because i was unable to be here at the beginning of the debate being engaged on a matter connected with the business of this house an apology because i cannot stay till the end in that i have to catch the pm train to glasgow and at our present rate of progress it does not look as though we shall have completed the debate in time and thirdly and this of course is very much my own loss i did not hear the maiden speech of the noble lord lord gormley <e> <s> i greatly regret that i did not <e> <s> i would have enjoyed hearing it i would have learned a great deal from it and i would have been particularly glad to have been able to join my congrat <e>", "<cs> my lords one thing of which i am certain is that at this late hour the house does not want another speech from me <e> <s> i will make the customary winding up speech as briefly as i can and if i do not comment on some points which have been raised i hope it will be realised that this is out of consideration for the desire of the house to rise rather than out of any disrespect for the people who have spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl what provision if any is being made to reinforce the staffs in the benefit offices since they will now be the only people who automatically have contact with the unemployed as the unemployed are no longer required to register at the job centres <e> <s> seeing <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with more than the conventional expression of pleasure that i congratulate the noble lord lord russell of liverpool on a remarkably well researched and presented maiden speech <e> <s> he has obviously taken a quite exceptional amount of trouble to put together a great deal of information compressed into a mere nine minutes <e> <s> it is a speech which will very much repay re-reading and we must be very grateful to him <e> <s> i think that we should be grateful too that he chose such a particularly appropriate debate in which to contribute <e> <s> after all he is able to demonstrate what our very ablest young are like and with all respects to my colleagues he is i <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but we have asked so often and received no reply why it was that the technology universities of aston and salford let us be specific about them suffered a disproportionately heavy share of the cuts <e> <s> the government have repeatedly <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches are grateful to so many members of the house who have expressed appreciation of the motion put forward by my noble friend lord banks <e> <s> in particular i should like to thank the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos first for giving us a preview of the labour party manifesto plainly on all sides of this house we are working up for an election before so very long and for reassuring us that as one would expect the labour party has definitely come down on the side of shores madness rather than howes meanness <e> <s> we are also grateful to the noble lord lord cledwyn i am sorry that he is not here at the moment for the fact that his enthusiasm for his fellow countryman lloyd george overcame the labour partys usual antagonism towards the point of view of people on these benches <e> <s> i notice that his generosity did not extend to reminding the house that lord beveridge too was a liberal <e> <s> the noble lord lord cledwyn went on to claim for his party credit for most of the development of the welfare state ever since the year <e> <s> however be that as it may <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise to your lordships because owing to an engagement entered into long before i knew about this debate i shall not be able to attend very much longer after i have spoken <e> <s> i would also like to thank very much the labour front bench in general and the noble lord lord mccarthy in particular for arranging for the same reason for my personal convenience to reverse the normal procedure whereby he would have spoken after the noble lord lord glenarthur <e>", "<cs> while i absolutely agree with the noble baroness lady birk that it is essential that <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble baroness is not asking for absolute security of tenure which to a very large extent the civil service still have <e> <s> i know that there have been some exceptions but when you look in detail at the changes that have taken place they are still having the benefit of considerable security of tenure <e> <s> in the academic world which is the other close parallel i venture to say that security of tenure has gone too far <e> <s> a good many people recognise that security of tenure has gone too far for the real benefit of the universities and the people in them <e>", "<cs> is there no grievance procedure <e> <s> this seems the ordinary case where there is some grievance about terms and conditions you go through the grievance procedure <e> <s> there must be some grievance procedure <e> <s> you do not go to the industrial tribunal <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise to the house that because i have to attend a committee of your lordships house later this afternoon i shall not be able to be here throughout the course of the debate but judging from the length of the list of the speakers i shall certainly be able to return long before the end of it <e>", "<cs> my lords we also thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> we too have to say that we have not had the opportunity to see the littlechild report which makes it difficult to comment on the statement except in a superficial way <e> <s> the report contains a great deal of detail not all of which is entirely clear as to its full implications <e> <s> we on these benches take a non-doctinaire view towards the case for privatisation but we see no virtue in privatisation unless it improves the service and the choice available to the consumer <e> <s> to that extent therefore we welcome the recommendations of the littlechild report and the governments proposals to increase the opportunity for choice for the consumer and also for the extension of competition <e> <s> there is very little virtue in creating a private monopoly simply to take the place of a public monopoly <e> <s> some of the provisions in the statement before your lordships certainly seem to move in the direction of reducing the monopoly that seemed to he inherent in the british telecommunication programme <e> <s> like the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede i am left with some questions about the position of the rural areas <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would also wish to thank the noble minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> we must of course as everybody in this house must deplore the continuation of this <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would take the view that the common agricultural policy has been at one and the same time one of the greatest successes of the eec and one of its greatest liabilities and problems <e> <s> it has been one of its greatest successes undoubtedly because it has increased the output of food to near if not total self-sufficiency some might say perhaps it has gone too far in that direction in the light of the full possibilities of world trade <e> <s> it has been one of its greatest successes because it has enabled a reorganisation of farming to take place and in the poorer farming areas of the community a consolidation of holdings and a building up of a far more economically viable agriculture than could possibly have existed without the intervention and the methods of the cap <e> <s> it has done this without basically harming the nature of the countryside and of rural life in those areas of the community <e> <s> a more drastic and less generous reorganisation system could have led to extremely harmful social results which would have been underlined today with the unemployment that has developed in the industrial sector and which would have been made far worse had the reorganisation of agriculture been handled in a less constructive and less socially acceptable way <e>", "<cs> my lords in the statement as i understand it a considerable amount of the increase is to be given in exchange for increases in productivity and changes in working practices <e> <s> can the minister assure us that we shall have evidence of the increases in productivity and changes in working practices before payments are made or are the increases being made in anticipation that these desirable consequences will follow <e> <s> further the press has used the figure of a per cent <e> <s> increase <e> <s> is it the ministers calculation that this is in fact what the settlement amounts to <e> <s> if that is true we have paid an extremely heavy price for this settlement <e> <s> it is nearly half as much again as the increase in average earnings over the past year and is practically double the inflation rate <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not a member of sub-committee d and i approach this subject from the point of view of the consumers who were not represented on this committee <e> <s> i think it is a pity that the committee was so heavily dominated by people with agricultural interests not because that has biased their judgment but because in the discussions taking place on matters of this sort it seems to me desirable that other interests should also be heard not after the report has been prepared but at the time when the thinking is being done on the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand corrected <e> <s> but they do not seem to have appeared in the debate this afternoon <e> <s> perhaps they are coming on later or perhaps they were frightened off by the preponderance of the agriculturalists <e>", "<cs> my lords this is like being told that the workers of rolls-royce will hold back their claims for more pay because they are so interested in purchasing the product <e>", "<cs> my lords i still stick to the point that they do not seem to have appeared in the speakers list of the debate this afternoon <e> <s> perhaps i may get started as the lone voice of the consumer <e> <s> i fully accept that the cap has in the past done a good job <e> <s> i am not decrying the work that has been done up till now <e> <s> we covered these points only a week or two ago <e> <s> the cap has of course fed the eec <e> <s> it has made for a restructuring of agriculture which was very much needed and which has been highly successful <e> <s> but that does not mean that it has to go on as it is at the present time <e> <s> it does not mean that consumers interests are not now of greater importance than prolonging the emphasis on agricultural requirements which has been categorised by the work of the cap in the past <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord explain why knowing about bees prevents the ncc from knowing about human beings <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise to your lordships house that i had to leave the debate earlier this evening because i was attending a committee of your lordships house <e> <s> it is particularly unfortunate from my point of view because i missed the speech of my noble ally lord diamond which i am sure would have been extremely beneficial for me to hear not least in order that i can be sure that i agree and do not in any way contradict anything that he said <e>", "<cs> my lords inflation has come down more than per cent <e> <s> if the noble baroness does not recognise that when inflation comes down it is advantageous i personally do especially when prices do not rise as fast as they have <e>", "<cs> my lords may i follow the very serious letter from the bma read by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and ask the minister whether the implication is for example that the records of psychiatrists and psychoanalysts could be laid bare for the benefit of the courts <e> <s> if so it seems to me that it undermines the whole prospect of treatment of that kind <e> <s> can the minister reassure us <e> <s> i am sure that a great many people would be extremely concerned at the possibility <e> <s> can we get it on the record one way or the other <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody in their senses in can seriously imagine that we can run the affairs of a still great and very complex industrial country <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mccarthy was ever a good politician <e> <s> i will not press him as to what his own view may be on this matter <e> <s> but whether the figures on page are accurate or not seems to me to be entirely beside the point <e> <s> it surely must be right that people can decide whether they want to pay a political levy or whether they do not <e> <s> you do not need to go back into all the history of it or to examine the credentials on page and indeed perhaps it was something of a hostage to fortune to put it in at all because somebody was bound to pick holes in it <e> <s> how much further do you need to go <e> <s> in whatever might have been appropriate at the time when the trade unions were struggling for existence and when the labour party needed to have the trade unions behind them in order to maintain their struggling existence that is all ancient history <e> <s> today with the numbers and strengths of trade unions with trade unions in a wide variety of occupations and professions where trade unions never thought to penetrate years ago when the legislation was passed surely it is appropriate that people should say whether they want to pay a political levy and not have to contract out if they do not want to pay it <e> <s> nobody in their senses if they were inventing legislation now would put it in any other form <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble earl for that reply may i ask him to answer the last part of my question which is that when the health standards are satisfactorily established the government will make it possible for the public to buy this milk <e>", "<cs> i believe i did refer to a man or a woman but more usually it is a woman <e>", "<cs> the only two objections raised to this amendment are to head <e>", "<cs> i hope that the government will feel able to accept the amendment <e> <s> the fact is that over very recent years social custon and practice in this respect have changed rapidly and as a result there has been created a situation with which current legislation does not adequately cope <e> <s> the amendment is an attempt to bring legislation into line with the needs of today <e>", "<cs> my lords i may have misheard and i am sure the noble lord the minister would not want to mislead the house but did he not imply that the scheme was for unemployed -year-olds in the main <e> <s> i thought it was to apply to all -year-olds who were to benefit from the youth training scheme <e> <s> surely the point of the scheme is that it is not to be confined to the unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that my name is not on the list of speakers but i hope i may be permitted to intervene briefly <e> <s> i should like to say that while i welcome this bill there are one or two questions i should like to ask in connection with it <e> <s> the noble lord lord john-mackie has put the point of view of the producers <e> <s> i want to stress very much the standpoint of the consumers in the regulations in relation to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i should have apologised when i spoke earlier because i was not here when he made his opening speech <e> <s> i am afraid i was caught up in the election campaign <e>", "<cs> my lords as you will know i also propose to move an amendment at the end of this debate <e> <s> i do not intend to read the amendment as time is already passing very swiftly <e> <s> i will speak to it now and it will be taken at the end of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords temporarily this may be so but the best hope for getting any kind of stability in exchanges rates is for countries to work together on it <e> <s> of course we should like them to work on a wider scale even than the ems but that is not open to us to do at the present time <e> <s> we have the option here and now to go into the ems and that at least is a step in the right direction and a step which in our view should now be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords that is perfectly true but that does not mean it might not be right <e> <s> the government were claiming it was on the basis of their mandate <e> <s> i would say to the noble lord lord vaizey that he anticipates me <e> <s> i have not yet mentioned an incomes policy and i was about to say something which he might not expect from me in respect of incomes policies <e> <s> the alliance believe and i believe that some form of incomes policy in the future will be necessary but let me say immediately that i think it will have to be a great deal more flexible than the incomes policies that we have known in the past <e> <s> the aspect i wish to stress because i know perfectly well that the government will not take the slightest notice of what anybody says about an incomes policy is that the best way to control increases in wages is to see that the highest number of people possible have a real stake in the undertakings in which they work because they then do begin to realise that putting wages up does not give them any benefit in the long run <e>", "<cs> my lords i promise not to interrupt the noble lord more than once <e> <s> i should like to point out since he is opposing my amendment specifically that at no point did i mention exchange control and in fact at no time has the fact that my party opposed exchange control ever come into the argument <e> <s> i am glad to hear that he marginally agrees with my arguments about the ems <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to move the amendment standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord gowrie spent a good deal of his time on the broader economic issues before going on to deal with particular employment issues which are the main focus of todays debate <e> <s> it is tempting to follow him in that direction <e> <s> i shall resist that temptation partly because of the time and also because after all we debated economic issues only last week and there would be risk of considerable repetition <e> <s> i should like only to make one point that we made last week <e> <s> a carefully planned and job related expenditure on capital projects would give more encouragement to those coming off the youth training scheme that they would be able to find a job at the end of the training period <e> <s> as so many speakers have remarked it is highly desirable that there should be confidence among a high proportion of those coming through the youth training scheme that there will be the chance of regular paid employment that is not of a limited term the weakness of all the special schemes in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should also like to thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> i should like to begin by saying that there is one item one item alone in this statement with which we heartily agree and that is the reference to the increased end-of-year flexibility <e> <s> it seems extraordinary that this has not been done very much earlier <e> <s> if it is going to save i think the figure is million because of what we are all aware of as being the anxious necessity to get rid of money by the end of the year whether you need to buy things with it or not because you know perfectly well that if you do not spend it you are going to lose the money then it is quite extraordinary that this ridiculous state of affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord really saying that when he cannot think of a solution to a problem he will suggest an inquiry <e> <s> i find that absolutely terrifying <e> <s> i have great confidence in the noble lord <e> <s> there must be a large number of matters on which he cannot think of a solution <e> <s> are we to have an inquiry into all of them <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that so far as the youth training scheme is concerned it is a foundation year and therefore the question of whether they are qualified does not really arise <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister satisfied with the information and support being given in schools and colleges for youngsters to take part in these schemes <e> <s> secondly to what extent are the unemployed year-olds being recruited into schemes to fill the gaps which are not being filled by the year-olds <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that the cutting back of grants to overseas students in fact began under her governments predecessors under the labour administration <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches entirely agree with the noble lord lord gray on the importance of controlling inflation and getting the economy working again and we fully recognise what this can do long-term for job creation <e> <s> where we disagree with the government is that we do not think that a single-minded concentration on the control of inflation is an appropriate response to the total situation in the country today which is one in which inflation needs to be controlled but is also one in which we have a mammoth problem of unemployment which has most important consequences both economic and social <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that one of the best ways of publicising the social fund would be for the government to make use of section and to provide some women-only training among their own employees <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that there is no truth in the rumour that the urban aid programme is likely to be reduced in the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to say something about the areas in which he proposes to reduce expenditure <e> <s> it is very assuring to be told that expenditure is going to be increased on health the social services and education but is it really sensible <e> <s> what is the thinking behind the reduction of the home improvement grant a method for maintaining the value of capital in housing and also an exceptionally good method very frequently of job creation in the private sector which with the present possible financing increases could have been expanded rather than reduced <e> <s> as to the reference to reduction in expenditure on employment presumably this is not a very optimistic forecast <e> <s> does it mean a reduction of the number of people unemployed and therefore of unemployment benefits <e> <s> does he imply any cuts in the job creation scheme <e> <s> what is the thinking behind those two areas chosen for reduction <e>", "<cs> my lords should first like to join those who have congratulated the noble lord lord maude on his maiden speech tonight and on his emphasis on the development of and help for the small business which has always been a subject of great concern to members on these benches <e> <s> your lordships will be pleased to hear that i shall be very brief partly because of the late hour and the number of speakers still to come but even more because much to my alarm the noble lord lord barnett in the second half of his speech and with a great deal more eloquence than i could command <e> <s> said nearly all the things that i wanted to say <e> <s> this is a fate which sooner or later befalls all speakers coming later in the list but it is slightly disconcerting when you believe that you have points to make which other people are less likely to bring forward <e>", "<cs> i had that in my mind my lords as one possible way of dealing with the question but i did not want to say so in precisely those words <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches may i thank the noble lord the minister for repeating the <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the question of travel arrangements it was suggested yesterday that perhaps a special train was being run presumably by british rail to take pickets to warrington <e> <s> did that in fact happen and if it did is it going to be repeated <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> ivery much agree with the noble lords lord seebohm and lord dean of beswick that the amount of money in the social fund is far too small to cope with the problems with which it is faced <e> <s> i urge once again i know that it has been urged so often andthat repetition becomes wearisome that some of the money going to the cap should be diverted to the social fund <e> <s> whether or not additional money is going into the eec there is plenty of room to reduce the cap and increase the social fund topay somewhat less attention to the agricultural policy and a very great deal more to the industrial policy and to the social aspects which flow from it because that is the genesis of the social fund <e> <s> the so-called social fund was introduced to deal withthe inevitable consequences of the restructuring of industry which was being undertaken with a view to increasing the overall efficiency and wealth creating capacity of member states <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that is an adequate answer <e> <s> we are being put under great pressure because these forms have not come <e> <s> it is not the fault of the people who want to apply <e> <s> if the date of th march is immutable i accept that it has to be i think this is one of these exceptional occasions when the authorities have to put themselves out so that the general public can get a decent deal <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that there is very considerable concern not least among employers operating the mode a scheme of yts at the failure to take up places <e> <s> will he say what steps are being taken by the government to make sure that the public has a much better understanding of the difference between yts and yop and in particular that the schools have much better information <e> <s> it is now quite clear that schools did not fully understand and were not in a position to pass onto their pupils the real advantages of yts <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that while we are all glad that there are more jobs it is highly undesirable to encourage youngsters to take up jobs which have no training element and will only lead to further unskilled work which is likely to diminish rather than to go into yts <e> <s> this is not widely understood and government encouragement here is badly needed <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble earl lord gowrie for introducing these regulations and for his explanation of the changes that have taken place in the procedural rules <e> <s> there is no doubt that mark which we have now arrived at in these regulations is a very great improvement on mark and an improvement on mark <e> <s> in particular we are very glad that the government have seen fit in the procedural regulations to make it possible for plaintiffs to cross-examine the expert <e> <s> the extraordinary proposal under the previous arrangement that an expert should give a report but should not be cross-examined by the tribunal was i believe contrary to all precedents as to the use of specialists in british tribunals or courts <e> <s> so far so good but i fear only so far <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to concentrate for a short time only on one aspect of this issue the aspect of employment mainly because this is the only subject on which i am in the least qualified to speak but also because i believe that if we could improve the employment position many of the other problems would begin to fall into place for it is central to the whole question of race relations in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl saying that although there was a vote in this house which made it quite clear that these regulations as they stood were not acceptable and were not in conformity the decision of your lordships house is being ignored by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that a high level of numeracy is not necessary for people to take advantage of the courses in this high tech training and therefore they should not be put off because they believe that their level of numeracy is inadequate <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord the minister but is he really saying that he is taking no notice of the express opinion carefully rendered of the commission on racial equality <e> <s> this is after all the commission set up by the government to examine questions of this kind and to give an authoritative judgment on how clauses of this kind appear at any rate to those directly concerned with race relations in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount not agree that since there has not been full take-up although we know that recently the take-up has somewhat increased there is a very strong case for extending the offer of places to the year-olds who are unemployed <e> <s> such an offer would not involve more money since the money is not being fully utilised <e> <s> this would help to fill the places and to reduce the number of unemployed in the year-old age group <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount not agree that it is not only the local authorities which are in a bad way <e> <s> they are making a great <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble earl the minister says that the year-olds would not be included but that the effort would be made to improve the quality does he mean that therefore more money will be spent on a smaller number of people which will be of benefit to the yts the number not being as large as was anticipated <e>", "<cs> my lords liberals backed the idea of the european community right from its earliest inception <e> <s> we backed it because we believed that it matched the economic social and political realities of the second half of the twentieth century <e> <s> when we backed it we knew that it involved some sacrifice of sovereignty or rather a recognition of the diminution of sovereignty which was in any case taking place <e> <s> we certainly did not back it to create a <e>", "<cs> my lords is it correct as i understand that the germans have withdrawn their opposition and that we remain the only people who are holding the programme up <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble earl lord gowrie for the attention he has given to the points and the replies he has given <e> <s> i am sorry that he feels as apparently he does rather hurt that we have not adequately appreciated the efforts he has made since th december to improve on past performance <e> <s> but as a former don he will know that there are no marks for trying there are only marks for producing a better result <e> <s> i am sorry to say that i am unconvinced that the noble earl has produced a better result <e>", "<cs> does the minister as a spokesman for the government receive instructions <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that the purpose of the youth training scheme was to get its target this year and that the msc is committed to raising quality as its top priority next year <e> <s> the very points which have been made will surely be taken up in the commissions pursuit of quality <e>", "<cs> the minister has not answered this question if the disabled person leaves the house to an able-bodied spouse or son does that spouse or son have to offer it to the local authority for sale or may they keep it <e> <s> if they can keep it the house has gone out of the stock for the disabled <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to thank all those who have so graciously congratulated me on my election to the leadership of the party in this house <e> <s> may i urge because time is short that those speakers who follow would take as said what they were going to say on that <e> <s> it does waste time if everybody feels that they have to follow the example that has been set and add to the kind comments that have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords given that we have had the coopers and lybrand report even if it does not totally please the minister would it not at least be possible to have a debate in this house in which the findings of that report could be discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that the evasiveness of his replies has left in a great many peoples minds a suspicion that was not there before and that it would be greatly to the benefit of the house if he would give us more precise information in reply to precise questions <e>", "<cs> my lords anyone who like myself has spent a number of years working in a university must i think accept that there is plenty of need for change and room for reform and a good deal that can be criticised as well as much that can be praised and admired in the way that universities have been running and are running at present <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches have been dyed-in-the-wool supporters of the community since the day when monnet and schuman were first bringing the community to birth <e> <s> first in many ways this report and this evenings debate have been a cause of very great encouragement <e> <s> the speech of the noble lord lord cockfield brought applause unexpected perhaps from the noble lord lord molloy and also applause from these benches <e> <s> we are not often all three in agreement <e> <s> that makes for a pleasant change <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also wish to thank the noble viscount the leader of the house for repeating the statement but we hear it with the very greatest alarm <e> <s> it is presumably an exercise in brinkmanship but those who practise brinkmanship run the risk of falling into the abyss <e> <s> it seems to us that the position of the european community is now very serious indeed <e> <s> it is of a quite different order from the difficulties that we had in the past which involved all-night sittings but which led subsequently to agreements <e> <s> this problem today is of a quite different kind <e>", "<cs> my lords at this time of the night hemmed in as i am on all sides by working farmers <e> <s> i do not intend to deal with any of the technical agricultural proposals in this report <e> <s> instead i should like briefly to turn to some of the political aspects which are raised by the points made in the report <e> <s> in the first place it is extremely refreshing to see the emphasis placed upon the consumer point of view in relation to agriculture and food prices <e> <s> the treaty of rome requires the cap to operate so as to give a reasonable level of prices to consumers <e> <s> and there are though sometimes one would not think so more consumers in the european community than there are farmers <e> <s> therefore reference to an adjustment in favour of consumers is long overdue <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i agree with the noble earl lord gowrie and the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour that this white paper is one of the most important which has been debated in your lordships house <e> <s> in it the government are attempting to tackle a problem which is very complex and greatly important both for individuals in this country and for the present and future health of the economy of the country <e> <s> hardly anything could rank as of greater importance than that <e> <s> in the white paper the government are attempting to draw together into a comprehensive whole a number of different initiatives which have been taken <e> <s> just because there are so many and the initiatives have been taken at different times they are often very confusing for people and they do not fully understand the overall objective or the route by which we are to try to achieve that objective <e> <s> for the strategy which lies behind the white paper the government rate <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not apologise for delaying the house still longer <e> <s> this is a matter of very considerable importance <e> <s> it is clear from the attendance in the chamber that it is not realised on all sides of the house how significant this is <e> <s> i am bound to say that in the speeches of the lord advocate and of the noble lord lord underhill i had rarely heard a better example of straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel <e> <s> the defence of the re-drawing of the boundaries was so elaborate as was the discussion of lord underhill as to how those boundaries had been drawn <e> <s> it is utter hypocrisy to go into details of that kind when large sections of the electorate are being disfranchised in this election as they were disfranchised in the election of <e> <s> it leaves one with little but contempt for the way in which this whole debate is being conducted <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl whether he will not agree that in view of the exceptional experience of the noble lord lord ezra in this field the difference between the estimated figure which he gives and the figure to which the government are working is somewhat alarming and needs to be explored <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches wish to be associated with the message to be sent to lady bishopston <e> <s> we very much appreciated the work that he did in this house <e> <s> may i also say that some of us at any rate very much appreciated the fact that lord bishopston was an ardent supporter of womens equality when it was very difficult to find male supporters to give the kind of help that lord bishopston so unstintingly gave influenced no doubt by the fact that he had four daughters <e> <s> but we were extremely grateful for that <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord agree that the labour government were also elected time and again on a minority of votes and they referred without stopping to the importance of their manifesto and the mandate of their manifesto <e> <s> does not the noble lord further agree that this underlines the width and not the narrowness of the gangway between us <e>", "<cs> when the minister says that they will increase their efficiency and earn that amount of money does he realise that in the case of morley college for instance over per cent <e> <s> of the people are on special-aided fees because they are unemployed or suffer in some other way which qualifies them for very much reduced payment <e> <s> this is why it is of such great importance at the present time that these colleges should be kept open <e> <s> you are not going to increase their income from the people who are already being paid for because they are in such great need that they are being paid for out of public funds <e>", "<cs> ilea <e>", "<cs> i am sorry the minister cannot move on this <e> <s> it is different from the others for the reason that the noble lord lord briggs has given and which i tried to give when i initially spoke to the amendment <e> <s> it is its vulnerability because it is a non-statutory service <e> <s> unless we protect it in some special way in many parts of the country adult education will virtually disappear at a time at which it ought to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise for the fact that i have been very erratic in my attendance at this debate for reasons which are almost entirely outside my own control <e> <s> they relate to engagements which had been fixed before i knew the debate was taking place and perhaps at this late hour i can best make amends by being as brief as possible <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i ask him what meaning he attaches to the phrase must have regard <e> <s> is it not perfectly clear that this in fact has no force <e> <s> what is the meaning of the word must <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister consider abolishing it in part <e> <s> if the government cannot abolish it straightaway they should reduce the age at which people can start earning <e> <s> at least that would be cheaper and would be a beginning <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first apologise to the house and especially to the noble lord lord wilson of rievaulx and the minister that because of a long-standing engagement at this evening it will not be possible for me to be here at the end of the debate to hear the reply <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the place for a discussion on motorways is a debate <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister satisfied that these regulations which i have not had the benefit of reading conform with the sex discrimination act <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble viscount agree that public opinion polls have shown that there is a very strong feeling that the system should be changed <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord accept that the house would not be bored by the detail since it is the detail which determines the substance of the answer <e>", "<cs> lords we on these benches would also wish to thank the noble viscount the leader of the house for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> as i think the house is aware we too were not happy when this invitation was issued <e> <s> we should like to know whether the government feel that the publicity which mr botha is already extracting from this visit is being sufficiently countered by international publicity covering the statements made by the prime minister so that the impression is not given that in fact mr botha was received with less criticism than appears to have been the case from the statement that has been made <e> <s> surely this is a matter of international publicity of considerable importance <e>", "<cs> my lords do we understand from the noble baroness that no students from the african continent are benefiting notwithstanding the enormous contribution we have made in the past to the education of african students <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also wish to thank the noble viscount the leader of the house for repeating the statement <e> <s> of course there are in the statement many things with which we certainly agree such as the desire to reduce interest rates the attitude towards iraq and iran and the desire to reduce war <e> <s> with all these we would go along <e> <s> but i am bound to say after listening to the statement that in the face of the acute and terrifying problems which are facing the world at the present time it seems a remarkably complacent statement to come from a summit of the leading countries of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that it is of the greatest importance that the youngsters coming out of the youth training scheme should get employment <e> <s> would it not be possible for the civil service to set an example by taking on more than one youngster perhaps at the rate of one and a half or two for each job while they continued their training which they will need to continue after the one year of the youth training scheme for the remainder of the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to apologise to the house for the fact that for the reasons that i have explained to the minister it will not be possible for me to stay until the end of this debate <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has demonstrated the folly of having strike ballots at all <e> <s> by imposing a time limit whether it is four weeks or six weeks and having a strike ballot the noble lord has shown that it will be much more difficult to bring the process of proper negotiation to a satisfactory solution <e> <s> i do not support this amendment in that i think that the whole process of using a ballot to negotiate is folly because as the negotiation goes on it is possible to modify the decision in the negotiating process <e> <s> if you say you have to reach a final point and then put it up for a ballot which will last four weeks or will last weeks you have then closed the options to negotiate at the very time that they ought to be kept open and fluid <e> <s> it is nonsense to have ballots for strike purposes for this reason <e> <s> if you must have strike ballots to have any time limit at all seems to be folly because what you are doing is saying to the unions your time is running out boys <e> <s> youve either got to settle now and have your strike or you have no chance of doing it all over again <e> <s> this is bringing in a new dimension which will make industrial relations far more difficult to operate and will not improve them <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble minister not agree that those figures greatly understate the extent of female unemployment because a very great many women are not entitled to benefit and therefore do not register and others have given up all hope of getting a job <e> <s> would the minister also confirm the possibility that in view of the desirable increase in part-time employment and we are glad to hear that it is increasing in some areas the government should take the lead in finding ways within the civil service and in encouraging ways in local authorities to employ more women on a part-time basis particularly in basic domiciliary services provided by local authorities which have been cut at a time when they need to be greatly extended <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not a minister in a department that is trying to encourage women into non-traditional jobs <e>", "<cs> if the noble earl <e>", "<cs> surely the noble earl is on rather dangerous ground in saying that the noble lord lord dean of beswick was wrong in drawing attention to <e>", "<cs> the noble earl surely is not saying that because shareholders disapprove very strongly of their money being given to the conservative party they should get rid of those shares <e> <s> they have put their money into that company for the development of that company of which promoting the conservative party is in no way a proper part <e>", "<cs> my lords may i remind the noble lord the chief whip that we on these benches have no responsibility whatsoever for anything that is said by a labour member in another place <e> <s> to be told to get our act together with them is something we do not accept <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord when on first installing this equipment it was expected to be completed and what is causing the hold-up <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord rejects the analogy with the contributions made by companies <e> <s> of course it is not a precise parallel but why should the shareholder who strongly disapproves of money being paid to a political party by the company in which he invests either have to put up with that or else sell the shares in a company which is profitable to him and in which he wishes to invest <e> <s> it is surely not part of the purposes of a company or i would not have thought it was a proper part of the purposes of a company to support political parties as such <e> <s> quite apart from that argument if as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter says he disapproves as we on these benches disapprove of contacting out we would prefer to see contracting in surely it is obvious that to be even-handed with employers even if the parallel is not precise is going to have a far greater impression of fairness to people to whom you are appealing to make this change than if you say you are applying it only to the trade unions <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the point which has been made by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> but surely one has to make the point to the noble lord lord mccarthy as well as to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that the law of this land is not made by agreements between the government and anybody else outside parliament but is made inside parliament <e> <s> therefore the whole basis of the argument of the noble lord lord mccarthy falls to the ground <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and speakers on the government side have all emphasised that this is only for months <e> <s> both the noble baroness and my noble friend lord evans questioned whether it is possible to do a transfer of this scale in months and surely the burden of proof is on the government to show that so large an undertaking can be undertaken in so short a time <e> <s> if that is not so then the argument based on months which was the burden of the speech of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter falls and surely the obvious thing is that it will not be done in months <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has assured us that the government recognise the importance of grants under section for the collaborative work between voluntary bodies and statutory bodies at local level <e> <s> one had believed that the government were very strongly in support of schemes of this kind and the noble lord has assured us that this will continue <e> <s> judging from the correspondence that we are all receiving the voluntary bodies are very far from assured that the position will continue as it has in the past <e> <s> i know the minister accepts the fact that this collaboration is a most important development <e> <s> the extent of it is new <e> <s> it is a real growth point <e> <s> it is providing real jobs in areas where but for it they would not exist and any setback to this new development would be disastrous <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very much to support what my noble friend has said and to add one more point to the reasons why it is so undesirable that there should be this degree of interference from the centre <e> <s> i know it is an unpopular point but the fact is that our civil service is not trained and equipped professionally to make judgments of this kind <e> <s> one is constantly finding oneself in the position in which people who have a great deal of knowledge often backed with proper professional experience are being judged by people who have no such knowledge <e> <s> this is an outrageous way in which to conduct affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would wish also to thank the noble viscount the leader of the house for repeating the statement <e> <s> i personally must make my apologies for not being in my seat when he began his speech but i had seen the previous legislation come on the screen and assumed that the statement was not going to be made immediately <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also wish to thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> i should like to ask him whether there is any truth in the rumour that a northern british firm was prepared to offer million for the sealink purchase <e> <s> if that is an incorrect rumour it would be useful to have it dispelled <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that <e> <s> i take it that that offer was from a british firm <e> <s> is the noble lord satisfied in view of what he told us that british rails statement of accounts is a correct representation of the position <e> <s> he has now told us that the assets are worth about half what they were stated to be worth in the accounts <e>", "<cs> my lords for the reasons put so impressively by the noble and learned lord lord denning we on these benches also hope that the government will accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that we on these benches want as much as anyone to see a quick peaceful settlement of this dispute but that we are also very much of the view that the dispute must be settled by sensible negotiations and not as the result of capitulation to what amounts to force <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister consider that a moderate further fall in the value of sterling would do less damage to british industry than an increase in interest rates <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much hope that the government will find a way to consent to this amendment as well as the one that follows <e> <s> the new pattern that is emerging of local activity based on a mixture of statutory and voluntary effort is one of the really encouraging signs of the times but it has had a douche of cold water because of the difficulties which the msc has had in relation to the community projects <e> <s> a great many voluntary organisations have been discouraged from relying on public funding <e> <s> i know that the msc is doing the best it can to put this right but it is putting back the voluntary-statutory collaboration which is the most important growth point that we have <e> <s> if this goes through it will be seen as yet another undermining of the position of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister realises the trouble that is going to be caused by this additional layer of inspection <e> <s> it is a question of delay <e> <s> those of us who have struggled with getting grants for various organisations know that you can be given a verbal go ahead in february and not see a penny by july <e> <s> i am quoting actual cases <e> <s> small organisations which are struggling to do a good job cannot live with this kind of uncertainty <e> <s> one is always extremely grateful to the sf but it is nothing to have to wait until after your project has finished before you see the colour of their money welcome though it is when it comes <e> <s> if we are going to have a further layer of approval people will not enter into projects because in doing so they will be bankrupt before the money comes <e>", "<cs> my lords on this occasion from these benches the customary congratulations on the maiden speech of the noble lord lord king are far from formal <e> <s> the noble lord must have been brought up on the liberal yellow book and he will i hope accept it as a compliment as it is intended if i say to him that his kind of speech not only could have been but in fact has been heard at every liberal assembly in the last years <e> <s> plainly the noble lord has taken his seat on the wrong benches <e> <s> we hope very much that we shall have even greater support from him in the future for the policies of profit sharing employee share ownership and wider share ownership generally which we have advocated over so many decades <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that the date was not of our choosing <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may <e>", "<cs> my lords those of us who are in many ways deeply critical of the governments policies and practices do our cause no good by denying the achievements which the government have to their record <e> <s> it is a great achievement that inflation has been reduced to the extent that it has and i very much agree with the noble baroness lady elles that it is easy to forget past pain and to forget the grip of fear that millions of people felt as inflation rose and rose and as resources to meet those increasing prices seemed to get fewer and fewer <e>", "<cs> my lords would your lordships not agree that this discussion has now gone on long enough <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not possible to find words to express fully the feelings aroused by the statement that the noble viscount the leader of the house has given us this afternoon <e> <s> may i nonetheless endeavour to express on behalf of all members of the alliance on these benches our horror at the barbarous and hideous act that took place last friday in brighton as well as our horror that human beings can behave to each other in this way our deep respect for the way that members of the government and people attending the conference faced the horrors of that morning our profound sympathy for the people who are still suffering loss and deep pain as a result of the bombing and our great admiration for what the public services the police the hospital and fire services have done since friday morning under the most difficult and challenging circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches join wholeheartedly in saluting the noble lord lord shinwell and congratulating him most sincerely on his long parliamentary career and on his th birthday <e> <s> speaking for myself i did not have the honour or the opportunity to work with him in another place either as a colleague or as an opponent but i did share one experience with the noble lord lord shinwell which showed the nature of the man and the appreciation of his qualities which i should like today to reveal to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me very special pleasure to congratulate the noble lord lord young of graffham on his maiden speech on a subject which we have discussed in one way or another in this house on a number of occasions and which has occupied the minds and indeed the hearts of many of us for many years <e> <s> it gives me very special pleasure in addition to those more general considerations because i have had the privilege of sitting under the noble lord lord young as chairman of one of his area boards <e> <s> i have seen him in action spurring the msc on with new ideas and with a great determination to achieve results <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour the house will be looking first and foremost for brevity <e> <s> but may i say in thanking the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for launching this debate that she has in fact raised a vast question <e> <s> it has been raised in the form of an unstarred question but it is an issue which needs a great deal of thorough investigation indeed some kind of select committee would not be inappropriate for examining the implications of the matters which have been raised tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of being classified as one of the dinosaurs may i ask the <e>", "<cs> my lords can the government as an employer themselves say what evidence there is of the results of their own equal opportunities policy which i think they produced in <e> <s> what evidence have they to show that this policy is achieving results <e> <s> in particular have the government at any time as an employer made use of those sections of the race relations act which allow special training for members of ethnic minority groups for areas of occupation in which they are greatly under-represented <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that he did not really answer my question <e> <s> perhaps i did not make myself clear <e> <s> i was concerned to find out what the government as a direct employer inside the civil service have done to promote the employment and promotion to appropriate levels of members of ethnic minorities and whether they have made use for their own internal purposes of the special training facilities <e>", "<cs> my lords can there be a distribution of wine at christmas <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that progressive organisations such as for example <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl not agree that when a very well-informed critic such as mr henney is not reappointed to his position it at least raises the suggestion that the government are not interested in informed criticism on behalf of the consumers <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl the minister for that reply <e> <s> is it not very disappointing that for so long we have been told that at the right moment the government will become a full member of the ems <e> <s> what is really holding it up at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking for the alliance benches i should like also to congratulate the noble earls on the way in which they have spoken to <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all deeply indebted to the noble earl lord stockton for a most moving address a great house of lords occasion <e> <s> in many messages that he gave to your lordships house there was surely a clear message to the government front bench a message which it seems strange for a great conservative leader to have to give to a conservative front bench do not get hooked on any dogma <e> <s> he did not of course put it as crudely as that but that message was plainly there <e> <s> do not get hooked on any dogma and certainly not on the dogma of monetarism <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl not agree that the real distinction today is on the one hand between those who have maintained their jobs and increased their income and those who are out of work and on the other hand between those who have indexed pensions and those who have not <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that his reply is slightly complacent in view of the very low percentage of girls in fact taking these subjects <e> <s> would he tell us what steps are being taken to follow up the researches <e> <s> it is all very well to have a research programme but i should like to ask whether anybody is doing anything as a result <e> <s> it has been shown that some influences in the schools are adverse to girls taking these subjects <e> <s> finally would the government consider taking positive action to increase the number of women physicists as is permitted under sections and of the sex discrimination act <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that now this matter has been settled we hope once and for all we should hear much less about these shop-keeping arrangements and more about the development of a really effective community <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should like to thank the noble lord for repeating the statement being made in another place <e> <s> in view of the fact that as the statement says discussions are going on about the proposals put forward to the commission we would like to stress again the tremendous importance we attach to a rapid increase in facilities for training for skilled trades which are in short supply <e> <s> it is becoming increasingly clear that such recovery as this country is having will be retarded because we are already unable to fill key jobs through lack of skilled personnel <e> <s> there is an urgent need as in wartime that it should be regarded as a matter of high priority to speed up the training of such categories of people so that this obstacle to recovery does not continue <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the effect of the changes that are to take place that more and not fewer people are going to be trained <e> <s> it does not seem to me to be of any significance

propose to repeat those policies <e> <s> instead i want to concentrate on one group of the unemployed to whom i attach the greatest importance the long-term unemployed <e> <s> i agree with much that the government are doing to make industry more efficient <e> <s> i agree that if we have the changes in industry and if we have training of the labour force which the government support then for many people in this country the prospects of employment can be quite good <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us how these efficiency checks are carried out by the post office <e> <s> is he aware

fact yet expressed a view on it <e> <s> if the noble viscount will forgive me for saying so it would be to mislead the house to give the impression that the archbishop has in any way accepted that report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am more glad than i would usually be that it has fallen to me to congratulate the right reverend prelate the bishop of ely on his maiden speech on a subject perhaps more peculiarly appropriate to the maiden speech of a bishop than are many when right reverend prelates make their first speeches in your lordships house <e> <s> i should like also to thank him for the generous tribute to the report <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would of course also wish to join in the tribute to sir david house and to thank him for all that he has done for this house

lords would the noble lord not agree that some are more extraordinary than others <e>", "<cs> my lords if i am correct in understanding the minister to say that the government were prepared to intervene to do what they considered necessary that presumably implies that they have some definition of what is necessary and that is the core of some sort of policy <e> <s> from what the noble lord has told us we can only conclude that the governments position is not that they do not have a policy but that they are prepared not to be pro-active about it but merely to react normally too late

statement <e> <s> like the noble lord lord dean i wish to ask what is meant by the phrase that no individual closure should take place until satisfactory alternative provisions have been identified

this you are not going to leap into action on a saturday afternoon if they start rioting <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to keep popping up but the noble lord has said of the negative procedure that the whole

speaks of the importance of sustained reduction in unemployment <e> <s> it is the words sustained reduction on which i wish to put particular emphasis <e> <s> it is because it is worded as it is that we on these benches will be supporting the amendment put forward by the noble lord not because as a speaker on the opposite side of the house implied we endorse in the least his partys other policies <e> <s> but as i understand it we are not tonight debating the whole of the labour party policy for which your lordships will be very thankful <e> <s> we are in fact debating this particular amendment

severe cuts <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness not agree that if she had been of a different sex the noble lord lord cledwyn would not have said that her replies were being made very agreeably <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that about six weeks ago under the auspices of the british institute of management an organisation was set up at a meeting held at warwick

lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> does he not agree that what he has said casts doubt on the voluntary nature of the scheme <e> <s> does he not agree that where it is a question of joining a training scheme it may be appropriate for youngsters to consider that what is being put forward for them in terms of training is not what is suitable for them <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour the best thing i can contribute to this debate is brevity <e> <s> however i should like to reaffirm what was said by my noble friend lord donaldson a long time earlier this afternoon that for once we have the unusual pleasure of being wholeheartedly behind the government in what they are trying to do on this occasion <e> <s> the prime minister obviously decided and how right she was that it would not be right to let matters drift any longer as drifting they had been because there was no sign whatsoever that they were drifting towards any kind of satisfactory solution <e> <s> left to themselves they plainly were not going to come right <e> <s> it was a very courageous decision on the part of the prime minister to get in touch with dublin and to be prepared to go against what she knew would be the views of many of the people who supported her in northern ireland and indeed in this country by taking the initiative that she did <e> <s> it was perhaps equally as brave or even braver of dr fitzgerald to make the agreement which he has made <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that with regard to the category of youngsters to which the noble lord lord gisborough referred those who find it difficult to learn the youth training schemes in category b particularly those run by a number of voluntary organisations are particularly appropriate <e> <s> will the noble lord assure the house that there will be adequate resources for that category in the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that he could not reply to his noble friend lord bruce-gardyne <e> <s> however can he confirm that it has been four years in the planning process <e> <s> if so is it not also true that the government bear considerable responsibility for any breach undertaken by this company <e>", "<cs> my lords how long will it be before the noble lord can give a direct answer <e> <s> we were certainly under the impression and i think the country as a whole was under the impression that the banning of the purchase of krugerrands would come about very quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords as the th speaker in this debate your lordships will not wish me to be lengthy and i have not the slightest desire myself to be <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness agree that some of the so-called scandals in connection with social work which are doing no good at all to the profession of social work probably derive from this unfortunate change in training <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down if the statement on the european council meeting is not to be repeated here can he say whether we shall have an opportunity to discuss it quite soon because many of us are deeply concerned at the outcome of that meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to thank the most reverend primate the archbishop of york and others who have paid tribute to <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether he is aware that the late sir george baker who had many years of experience in the family division dealing with matters of this sort and who was a member of the committee which produced <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour

a number of very important points have been raised particularly points that i myself did not raise in the time allowed to me <e> <s> one was the importance of continuing education emphasised first by the noble baroness lady lockwood and then taken up by speaker after speaker <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl responded but he gave no reply except that which we have heard over and over again when these issues have been raised <e>", "<cs> i am extremely sorry to disagree with my very much more experienced ally the noble lord lord sainsbury but it really seems a pity to treat the auld report with all its virtues as if it were holy writ <e> <s> it is perfectly possible to be critical of the findings of the auld report and if ever there was a case for local decision it is this <e> <s>

think is a practical amendment <e> <s> but could i pursue the point made by the noble lord <e> <s> is the minister determined that this bill will go through the whole bill and nothing but the bill <e>

going to oppose all amendments that will be put forward <e> <s> or is it possible that on the basis of discussion with him we could see in what ways something less than total deregulation could be devised between us <e> <s> on this side of the chamber both the alliance and labour party do not have a whip on this matter because we regard this basically as a matter of conscience <e> <s> but are the government going to be absolutely intransigent or can we not get together and see whether there is some way in which some reasonable degree of deregulation can take place but not the whole total deregulation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord consider the possibility since there will be an increase in unemployment as a result of this run-down of allowing people on unemployment benefit to earn a higher amount than is at present allowed while still keeping their benefit bearing in mind particularly the shops bill which is going through the house at present <e>", "<cs> after the brilliant line of lawyers who have spoken in their legal way about the amendment i hesitate to come in on the debate <e> <s> however it seems to me that they have been concentrating on the inadequacies of the machinery for getting us to the place where we want to be <e> <s> this is a committee stage <e> <s> i cannot believe that the advisers behind the government indeed the government themselves with all the skill which they possess are incapable of devising the appropriate machinery for getting us to the goal of local option if it is local option that we want <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord afraid that a change of government might lead to a change on a much larger scale than would a change of local government <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that giving only two figures does not show a trend of any sort <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness would like to have figures which show a statistically sound trend <e> <s> two figures do not show a statistically sound trend <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness not agree that non-smokers who are now the majority are entitled to some protection from the pollution caused in public places by smokers <e> <s> this is particularly so in places of work where people simply cannot escape drawing in other peoples smoke <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that in fact it is not so much the payments in industry high though they are in some cases but quite extraordinarily high salaries that are being paid often to very young people relatively young people at any rate in the city of london which are having an extremely disruptive effect on higher levels of pay throughout the civil service and industry <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl the minister has still not given an answer to the question which was put by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> either the government are collecting tax on these goods or they are not <e> <s> which is it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that the problems of the c unit is by no means only a matter of bricks and mortar and that it is putting an intolerable burden on prison staff who are not and cannot be expected to be trained at present to cope with the kind of problems they meet there <e> <s> does he agree that any changes that are made should include changes in the nature of the staffing as well as in the nature of the building <e>", "<cs> my lords could the minister explain to us how in the process of renegotiating the multi-fibre agreement they intend to safeguard the position of the developing countries

fact that i am coming into the committee as i recognise at a rather late time <e> <s> unfortunately i was held up with obligations i had entered into before i knew that the committee was going to be held today <e> <s> we must be extremely grateful to the noble and learned lord for elucidating the legal points and raising possible legal problems <e> <s> but we are not really talking about the refinements of law in this matter <e> <s> what we are talking about is whether a woman who goes into the retail trade after the introduction of this act is going to be forced by the terms of her

been listening to this debate <e> <s> i refer to the assumption that provided an employee is protected against unfair dismissal at a tribunal he is all right but the fact is that reference to an industrial tribunal rarely results in reinstatement <e> <s> it results in some degree of compensation but if ones livelihood depends on having a job in the retail trade winning an unfair dismissal case does not help <e> <s> it tides you over for a while but it is rare that an unfair dismissal case results in reinstatement <e> <s> it is no good saying that an employee will be protected by an industrial tribunal and that it deals with the matter <e> <s> it does not <e>", "<cs> i follow the noble lord in that sense but we have all been arguing for the protection of women in the opportunity to refuse to work on sundays <e> <s> the argument refers to where a woman refuses to work on a sunday and is unreasonably denied the right not to work on a sunday as was said perhaps when there is a bad time at home and she does not want to work on sundays and the employer instead of saying that it is all right and it will not be held against her says sorry we cannot employ you any longer if you cannot work on sunday <e> <s> it is no adequate compensation to that woman to say that in those circumstances she will win an unfair dismissal case because she does not get her job back <e> <s> that is the argument <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord for information <e> <s> my memory is beginning to fade with old age but i think that at one time it was possible that if a tribunal ordered reinstatement an employer could avoid reinstatement by paying additional compensation <e> <s> i am speaking absolutely from memory and such a course may never have been possible or may have ceased to be so but i think that it is rather important in this context <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment moved by the noble baroness lady turner <e> <s> i accept that there are aspects of employment protection which in general terms need looking at again <e> <s> it is not all holy writ it could well be revised in some respects <e> <s> however the way to do it is not to allow people to contract-out in as the noble and learned lord lord simon has said agreements between unevenly weighted parties <e> <s> i do not think that that is the right way to modify employment protection legislation because it leaves people open to very considerable exploitation <e>", "<cs> i was referring to the difficulties on the following mondays <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down are the

that is what i am saying <e> <s> it has been the practice in this country for over a hundred years and the government are not as i understand it leaving the hours of work in manufacturing industry to be determined entirely by collective bargaining <e>", "<cs> i am not saying that individual bargaining does not take place but i am saying that the law limits what you can agree in individual bargaining about womens hours of work in factories and has done for well over a hundred years <e> <s> the noble lord is trying to pretend that to put any restriction at all on hours of work in the retail trade would put women in an exceptional position <e> <s> i am saying that so far as womens employment is concerned not having restrictions puts them in an exceptional position <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord any information as to whether the take-up is influenced by the capital charges for putting in the meter which some people think quite considerable and whether any experimentation in lower capital charges would lead to much wider introduction of the metering service <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside

interfere with scottish law will be strangely at variance with the position in england <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to prolong the discussion but this is i think a record figure <e> <s> i should like to urge as a matter of urgency that we discuss through the usual channels how we might deal with it <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches wish to thank the minister for making a statement in reply to the private notice question in another place <e> <s> but i am bound to say that the statement is so brief that it gives us no information at all as to the reasons for the action that the government are attempting to take <e> <s> could the minister not enlighten us as to what has led to the decision to make or to negotiate this sale to general motors <e> <s> we can scarcely discuss this matter as it stands because we have no data on which to discuss it <e> <s> can the minister also tell us how far these negotiations have gone whether any alternatives were considered a management buy out for example or whether the staff have been consulted about the proposal to sell this part of british leyland to general motors <e>", "<cs> may i say to the noble baroness lady phillips that perhaps because the noble baroness is not a member of the anglican church i think i am right in saying that she has not whiled away the time during tedious sermons reading parkers list <e> <s> otherwise she would understand why this is necessary <e>", "<cs> there have been few speakers in support of the amendment and i do not intend to speak any longer about it because i think that i have raised all the points already <e> <s> i should however like to test the opinion of the committee <e>", "<cs> may i ask the right reverend prelate whether his opposition would be maintained if the bill were limited to the deceased sons wife and if there were no question of the divorced sons wife <e> <s> in the event of the son having died and the father-in-law himself being a widower would the right reverend prelate continue to believe that marriage should not take place <e>", "<cs> if i were to withdraw the amendment at this stage and to return at report stage with this alternative would that meet the approval of a large number of members of the committee <e>", "<cs> my olive branch having been rejected <e> <s> i do not propose to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to divide the committee <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to oppose the question that clause shall stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to oppose the question that clause shall stand part of the bill

dark to look for coins at night would be greatly helped if we could recognise a diamond as against an octagon and as a consequence we would know what the coin was <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also wish to thank the minister for making the statement in your lordships house <e> <s> it is gratifying to have the opportunity on these occasions to get at the minister with direct responsibility <e> <s> we should like to see recognition of the need for a change in the governments macro-economic policy <e> <s> we have long been urging that what is required is carefully targeted expenditure on infrastructure and particularly on housing and housing repairs <e> <s> in the areas with which the statement deals housing and housing repair developments would be particularly welcome and would make a substantial contribution both to the environment and to job opportunities <e> <s> having said that one recognises that this is a new initiative modest but nonetheless useful <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness the minister believes that help in the carers home is what is required and it may well be that this is right are the government prepared to consider any financial contribution to it because this is not a cheap thing to do <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that there is a great deal of anxiety possibly some of it exaggerated about the effect that the changes are going to have on the voluntary bodies <e> <s> can he make much clearer than has so far been the case i say this in no criticism of anyone because it is not a matter that it is easy to make clear how the premium places will work and the extent to which they will meet the needs of the voluntary bodies <e> <s> i find that there is a great deal of anxiety <e> <s> some of it i suspect is felt far more than is necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak in support of this amendment moved by the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> it seeks to continue the protection given under the act <e> <s> i do not quite understand why the noble lord lord campbell has said that this protection is peculiar to people working in the retail trade <e> <s> the details are peculiar to people in the retail trade but for over a century there has been comparable protection for women working in industrial employment <e> <s> there is nothing unique in the fact that these provisions give protection to women working in shops <e>", "<cs> my lords far from making a special case this legislation in itself is unilaterally varying the contract of employment which has been entered into between the employer and shopworker by making it permissible for them to be required to work on sundays <e> <s> this is the point which is being corrected by this proposed amendment as i understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords i must take issue with the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls <e> <s> i do not think that he is arguing about the realities of the position <e> <s> he says that people take on work voluntarily and they know that they are engaged to take on sunday work when they take the job but the kind of people who enter the retail trade are women for whom alternative work does not exist in the great majority of cases <e> <s> if they want to have a job the retail trade is the obvious place for them to go <e> <s> if they have no alternative but to work on sunday or not have a job they will work on sunday because they want a job but not because they want to work on sunday <e> <s> it is fanciful to argue that they will weigh up the pros and cons and will do something else if they do not like the conditions of sunday work <e> <s> it is not that at all <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is correct <e> <s> some people thought that was too few but they covered all of industry in this country <e> <s> there do not have to be hordes of inspectors <e> <s> we have heard far too much about the problems of enforcement <e> <s> there has been enforcement in the factories because if a person feels he has been injured because of the misbehaviour of an employer he has himself written or asked a friend to write to the factory inspectorate and an inspector has then taken up the case <e> <s> there have not had to be hordes working <e> <s> i was for years in industry and used to deal with the factory inspectors myself <e> <s> they came rarely but sometimes they came because somebody who felt he had been injured had been in touch <e> <s> this is an easy way of enforcement <e> <s> we have heard far too much about the difficulties of enforcement <e> <s> such a method of enforcement is not difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness speaking of the bill which comes up the week after next <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment moved by the noble and learned lord lord denning and time off in lieu is one day off in lieu of sunday work <e> <s> my proposal is two days off <e> <s> this would be unfavourable for employers and the point is to discourage them from employing people on sundays who have been employed during the week in order that this is the big principle we should seize the opportunity which the bill gives us whether we like the bill or not it is going to become law to develop a useful means of job sharing which we have all said we want as a useful way of getting into work some longterm unemployed people who will not otherwise get employment unless we use these opportunities <e> <s> it is the principle of taking the opportunity which the bill presents to get more people back into work that i am asking the government to consider <e> <s> i do not think that we shall get very far with further discussion but i should like to test the opinion of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister agree that there is a close connection between the level of oil prices the sterling exchange rate and the level of the interest rate and that being so the government cannot fail to have a policy about oil prices <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that anybody would challenge the statement that over the last twenty years there has been a fundamental change in the position of women not only in this country but in all the advanced industrialised nations <e> <s> i shall not go into the reasons for this they are very widely known <e> <s> i myself would say that probably more than anything else it stems from our now almost complete control over fertility by which women can control not only the numbers of their children but also the times when they shall have them the timing of their families <e> <s> this has given women a freedom which they have never had since the days of eve <e> <s> whatever the reasons <e>", "<cs> does not the noble lord who has just spoken agree that the remarks of david blunkett would have been caught by the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords although the noble lord has told us that we have created more jobs than the other nations in the european community will he tell the house how our percentage of unemployed persons compares with the percentage in those other countries in order to complement the figure <e>", "<cs> my lords if the community medicine specialist is in fact the same as a medical officer of health what was the point in changing the name <e>", "<cs> my lords did the noble baroness say director of planning <e> <s> planning what <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we would like to thank the minister for making this brief statement <e> <s> i must say that the secretary of state must be aware of the very great interest taken in this house on all questions concerned with unemployment <e> <s> the number of questions and debates that we have had on this subject should have left him in no doubt whatever about that <e> <s> it therefore seems really extraordinary that he did not find an opportunity to make this statement to your lordships house rather than leaving us to see it in the press <e> <s> it is a matter of the position of both houses of parliament and too frequently <e> <s> this is yet another occasion on which the press outside has been given information which should come first to at least one house of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully admit that this may not be a perfectly drafted amendment <e> <s> as has been pointed out private members bills do not have the full help of a parliamentary draftsman <e> <s> although i really did not follow the full party list-like combinations which the noble lord put forward i can see that there might be some misunderstanding in the wording though i think there is no misunderstanding at all in your lordships house about the intention <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter does his usual magnificent defence of the government <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord lord glenarthur really needs to call in aid his support however he certainly had it but we can always rely regularly on the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter to come in to do his well-understood act of support for the government <e> <s> when he says however that it is radical and courageous of the government to have proceeded with this bill i should like to suggest that there is no particular virtue in being radical a point i have sometimes made to some of the more muddle-headed members of my own party <e> <s> there is no particular virtue in being radical in itself it is what one is being radical about that is important <e> <s> the same can be said of being courageous <e> <s> being courageous in a wrong cause is an unfortunate misuse of a virtue <e> <s> so if i may say so to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter his was a somewhat irrelevant dissertation in our discussion of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely sorry to interrupt the noble lord in his most interesting speech but will he explain why he used the word allowed which seems to me to be extremely important in this context <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord used the word allowed he said that his permanent secretary would not have allowed the minister <e> <s> it seems to me to be the crux of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for answering this question in your lordships house this afternoon <e> <s> the judgment raises a number of questions <e> <s> as the noble lord lord wedderburn has already pointed out the questions relating to private employers must quickly come to the forefront now that the issue of retirement age for women in the public sector has been dealt with <e> <s> although as the minister has said only retirement age is dealt with and not entitlement to pension it will be impossible to continue ignoring the question of the pension age if the later retirement age is to be permitted <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government do not think that national advertising has any advantage and effect what on earth do they do it for <e> <s> it is done on a large scale by the party opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords there is another obvious reason for that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that at that time mr gladstone was a conservative <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to give a welcome to the general intention as i understand it of this bill which is intended to give equal treatment and to extend the sex discrimination act in certain areas in which it was defective <e> <s> to start with i should like to look at the question of extension to the small firm <e> <s> unlike the noble lord the minister i do not in the least regret the extension to the small firm <e> <s> as i understand it that exemption was given not because at the time of the passing of the sex discrimination act anybody really thought that there was any difference of substance between what was required in a slightly smaller firm and what was required in a large organisation but simply on the argument of practicality and enforcement that when legislation was bringing in a totally new concept of equal opportunity it was going to be extremely difficult with any sense of reality to contemplate enforcing it right throughout all premises in the whole breadth of the land <e>", "<cs> my lords well i am extremely glad to hear that <e> <s> if the noble minister is saying that he accepts that what we now need is not the total abolition but rather following the abolition of the protective clauses in the factories act a serious examination of what at the present day is appropriate protection for both men and women then indeed this bill will be a very great advance <e> <s> of course the best example of it would be to start straight away did i misunderstand the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords the best example of it would be to start straight away on the baking regulations which give us the best illustration of the error that the minister is making and of the argument which we are putting forward <e> <s> it is not the only case but it happens to figure in this bill so let us take it as an example <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recognise that in some parts of the country such as buckinghamshire where i am the msc area board chairman there have for months been job vacancies that we are unable to fill because people coming from areas of high unemployment are unable to obtain housing <e> <s> that matter must be a priority in any <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that better insulation of houses would contribute greatly to energy saving and would be extremely job-creative if money could be forthcomig to help people who are in a position to do this work <e> <s> is the minister aware that only this morning i visited a company which was started and is run entirely by young blacks whose efforts in this direction are being held up by red tape so that it has taken them several months even to get a form answered <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that a great deal of future development if it is to be successful needs to be on a european scale and that a narrowly nationalistic approach to it will not help us in the longer run <e>", "<cs> i very much support what the noble lord lord mccarthy has said in relation to small firms <e> <s> i can see no reason whatsoever why there should be this exemption for small firms <e> <s> it is totally arbitrary to take the figure of five persons <e> <s> i repeat what i said at second reading that i am pretty certain that that was only introduced into the original act because of the size of the case load if we were to try to enforce it throughout <e> <s> i think that in the minds of many at the time the act was passed it was taken for granted that sooner or later that exemption would go <e> <s> i must say that i find the wording with regard to private households extremely unsatisfactory and i would support the people who ask the government to look again at this curious subsection i the degree of physical or social contact with a person living in the house etc <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord really suggesting that women are incapable of obscene language <e>", "<cs> i had never previously thought that the minister could be naive but i find it astonishing and it is easier perhaps for me to say this than it is for the labour front bench to say it that he should have such touching faith in the attitude of trade unions toward sex discrimination and the belief that one can leave it safely to trade unions and employers in negotiating collective agreements to make sure that no discriminatory elements occur particularly if indirect discrimination is taken into account <e>", "<cs> i sincerely hope that the government will take heed of this amendment <e> <s> if they cannot accept it will they at least say that they will take it away and look at it the minister is something of a polymath which we know in that he appears here talking about defence one day foreign affairs the next and industrial relations and discrimination the next <e> <s> this is asking a bit much of anybody as i would be the first to agree <e> <s> but there is a breath-taking simplicity about the governments attitude to this whole question <e> <s> i agree absolutely with what the noble lord lord wedderburn said about the protective legislation <e> <s> in my view it is high time that it was revised and revised in a non-discriminatory way <e> <s> does the minister really understand that there are years of experience behind this that there is a great volume of scientific work behind it <e> <s> has he consulted with the occupational medicine people <e> <s> has he consulted with the industrial nurses <e> <s> has he read the reports of the factory inspectorate <e> <s> there is a long history of working at what is appropriate protection for people at work <e>", "<cs> in a previous discussion i said that the noble lord was being somewhat naive <e> <s> i was making something of an <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord understands that the noble lord lord wedderburn i believe and certainly we on these benches do not wish to retain indefinitely that protection of women <e> <s> we have been against the continued discrimination in favour of women which in fact is a handicap <e> <s> the noble lord lord wedderburn the noble baroness lady lockwood and i have said so <e> <s> we are not asking to go on as we have before <e> <s> what we ask and what the success that we have had with the amendments surely underlines is that we look at what new protection should be given on particular points such as those <e>", "<cs> when the minister says that everything can be left to negotiation i hope that he will take on board that though a great many matters can be left to negotiation this is only an appropriate way of dealing with a situation when it is negotiation between equally weighted parties <e> <s> the whole crux of the doctrine of collective bargaining in this country is that it has to be between equally weighted parties between a strong trade union and an employer indeed sometimes the scales are weighted in favour of the trade union and then one does not necessarily achieve very good agreements either <e> <s> but if it is between a very weak and a very strong party negotiations are a farce <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord does not understand <e> <s> perhaps he was not present when i explained the matter in rather more detail or if he was here perhaps i did not make myself clear to him <e> <s> however if he reads <e>", "<cs> yes go ahead <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the minister to look again at his argument that it is not necessary to have the legislation because collective agreements are as i understand him to be implying following the same line in control over hours <e> <s> but of course they are only following this line because the legislation is there <e> <s> if the legislation were removed the collective agreements might over time and perhaps not over a very long time take on a different complexion altogether <e> <s> you have to see the two things together <e> <s> the way in which collective bargaining has developed is because of the existence of the legislation <e> <s> if you remove the legislation in five years time collective agreements will probably read quite differently <e>", "<cs> while i very much support the idea behind the code of practice i see a problem in connection with a point upon which i should very much like the minister to elucidate <e> <s> as i understand it codes of practice are related to legislation <e> <s> they are interpretative of legislation <e> <s> as we know they do not have the force of law but they are interpretative of legislation <e> <s> if the amendments that have been passed this evening are accepted and remain in the legislation then the code will of course be interpretative of the law including those amendments <e> <s> but since the government are set to remove the fat of the legislation i fail to see to what legislation the code of practice will relate <e> <s> i know of no precedent in which there is a code of practice not related to any substantial legislation <e> <s> can the minister clarify that point <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister saying that a capital asset has been sold in order to put the proceeds into current consumption <e> <s> is that not very bad housekeeping <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be permitted to intervene so that the noble and learned lord can clarify a point for me <e> <s> all the matters mentioned here are based on legislation which has been through parliament and therefore must be assumed to be for the public good <e> <s> this is a genuine question and i am not trying to score a party point <e> <s> does the noble and learned lord make any distinction because i believe the distinction sometimes is made between propagating things which are based on law as being objectives which should be pursued and objectives which are simply matters of party policy <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that there will be even more vacancies if the present cuts continue in the universities and polytechnics <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to thank my noble friend lord meston for steering this bill through <e> <s> it seemed a small bill to start with but it has had an inordinately long life so far <e> <s> it seems a long time since the noble baroness lady wootton first produced a bill to deal with this subject and i am glad that we have now been able with the support of the bench of bishops to get as far as this bill has taken us <e>", "<cs> my lords there must have been a moment and a reason why the government suddenly decided to make the decision that they made <e> <s> when was it <e> <s> what caused it <e> <s> that is what your lordships house is asking <e>", "<cs> my lords is the secretary of state satisfied with the training provision in the tourist industry in relation to catering service and knowledge of languages for the people who will be serving our visitors in this coming year <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord find out whether the french are in fact subsidising the electricity and reply to the question asked by my noble friend lord mackie <e> <s> it is a matter of considerable importance <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that we have had that answer every time the queston has been raised over the last three years and that we are getting a little tired of it <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord a precedent for his phraseology <e>", "<cs> my lords last year at the request of the howard league i had the privilege of carrying out a small study much aided by professional assistance into the question of women in prisons <e> <s> i am not suggesting that the problems of women and the problems of men are in this matter necessarily identical but i doubt whether the differences are really very great <e> <s> until that time though i was chairman of apex and therefore at second hand had some knowledge of these questions i frankly would claim to have no knowledge of this subject <e> <s> as we would say in the academic world crime was not my subject <e> <s> what struck me overwhelmingly was the difficulty of finding out what we thought we were doing by locking up so many people in prison <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that while this document would no doubt be an excellent subject for a debate it is scarcely a matter for questions especially as so many of us do not know whether it is going to be discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords i was interested to hear what the noble lord said about the questions arising from the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not the noble lords noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much regret that the minister does not feel able to accept this amendment <e> <s> i have listened with great care to the arguments that he has put forward but i am afraid that i find them totally unconvincing <e> <s> if i may say so with respect they are based on a view of what goes on in industry which is not quite realistic <e> <s> the noble lord referred to the idea that everybody will take a case to the industrial tribunal and that industrial tribunal results will be published and will be available <e> <s> it is not every woman it is very far from every woman who in these days of unemployment is really prepared to take her employer to a tribunal <e> <s> it is a difficult thing to do <e> <s> and as for the idea that the law reports will always be read by all and sundry up and down the country that seems to be an unrealistic assumption of a very extreme order <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mccarthy has quoted me from a previous stage of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will forgive me for interrupting him <e> <s> i must draw his attention to the fact that this simply says consider <e> <s> it does not say that they have to negotiate or agree <e> <s> the noble lord can do that in five seconds in the bathroom in the morning <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also wish to thank the noble viscount for repeating this very serious statement <e> <s> but we must say categorically that we as a whole alliance repudiate the action which has been taken by the united states <e> <s> we do not consider that it has been justified in the circumstances and we deeply deplore the support that has been given to it by her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords we should also like to thank the government chief whip for arranging the debate <e> <s> we are very grateful that he has been able to put it on so speedily since it is a matter of great urgency <e>", "<cs> i expect i shall be ruled out of order but i have been listening to this criticism of negative amendments a criticism with which i very much agree <e> <s> i should point out that amendment no <e> <s> a in the name of my noble friend lord ritchie is trying to say what has been said in the negative amendments in a positive way <e> <s> when we considered this in our party meeting we took the line that the proposed amendments were too negative and so we took the negatives out and tried to make the amendment positive <e> <s> it may not be as strong as some people want but would it not save time if we considered amendment no <e> <s> a along with the others so that the committee can have the opportunity to consider whether it might be preferable <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that when the dust has settled and the governments irritation at what has happened has had time to subside they will recognise that there remains a problem that there was ground for compromise that the auld report was not written on tablets of stone and that it will be possible to look at this again in a calmer atmosphere and come to a reasonably satisfactory conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should also like to thank the noble viscount for making it possible to have this debate so soon after we called for it last tuesday <e> <s> we thank him too for giving us the deeply grievous news that he gave this morning about those men who have been hanged or executed by terrorists <e> <s> sympathy must go out to them and to their relatives <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that it is almost impossible to draw sensible conclusions from any one set of figures and therefore questions of this kind must be of very limited usefulness <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but if i understand him aright he is talking about consultations over the bill <e> <s> my noble friend lord diamond was talking about consultations over the appointment which is totally different <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord the minister will not give us the same answer as on the previous amendment <e> <s> it must be apparent to the government that there is grave concern about the position of the consumer when an industry which is either entirely or very nearly a monopoly is being privatised <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord will also agree that nobody seriously thinks that under the old nationalisation acts the position of the consumer was adequately dealt with <e> <s> i know there have been occasions when consumer councils have done well but nobody pretends that we have ever found the answer for the proper protection of consumers under nationalisation and where there is a monopoly either private or public <e>", "<cs> i spoke of the benefits but i was also underlining the dangers <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has asked us to believe that this paragon will exercise strong control over the industry <e> <s> as i listen to this debate i become more and more pessimistic and feel that this device for protecting consumers is eyewash <e> <s> i simply cannot believe it <e> <s> like most of the members of this committee taking part in the debate i know and <e>", "<cs> i listened very carefully <e> <s> it was what the noble lord lord belstead said that finally got me to my feet <e>", "<cs> i think that the whole proposal is eyewash <e> <s> that is the point i am making <e> <s> we are being asked to discuss the details of a proposal that as a proposal is useless in my view <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness agree with me that the noble lord lord molloy needs no encouragement <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say from these benches that on the whole we welcome this bill <e> <s> we welcome the extension of non-discrimination to small firms and partnerships <e> <s> i would again underline that this was omitted from the original legislation only because of administrative difficulties and not because at that time anyone thought there was any good reason for indefinitely excluding the small firm <e>", "<cs> my lords on reflection will the minister agree that his comment on the industrial training boards was certainly less than generous and certainly less than accurate having regard to the fact that the engineering industry training board managed to bring about a major modification in engineering training and was responsible for introducing quite revolutionary training for women <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have told us on innumerable occasions that they will join when they consider that the conditions are right <e> <s> will the noble lord define what the right conditions are <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that we have already spent some considerable time talking about gas that we are all going to spend a great deal more time talking about gas and that this very important subject of ownership is best dealt with then <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me to thank all those who have taken part in what has been an interesting debate with a number of extremely well-informed speeches based on a great deal of personal experience <e> <s> having said that i am afraid that it is the last agreeable observation it falls to me to make <e>", "<cs> my lords if the customers are not supposed to use the addresses in the telephone directories why on earth are they put in <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord the minister whether analogous to is bureaucratese for the same as or is he implying that there is in fact some difference <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount at the same time going to look at the track <e> <s> personally i find the sprinting on some of our tracks at present quite frightening enough without having any faster trains on them <e> <s> ought they not to get the track right <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that the figures he has given us depend entirely on what is the level of unemployment in a given country at the time at which that figure is measured <e>", "<cs> how can the noble lord the minister say that market forces deal with competition between these industries when two of them are under government control on pricing <e> <s> we know perfectly well that there have been occasions when as a result of government requirements prices have been both held down and put up in nationalised industries <e> <s> where are market forces in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> that may well be the case in particular circumstances but the noble lord the minister has not answered my point <e> <s> you cannot have genuine market forces at work between industries when the pricing of two of them is controlled by what the government tell them to do <e> <s> there are no market forces there <e> <s> it may be the only way to do it and it may be a bad way to do it but there are no market forces operating <e>", "<cs> the noble lord referred to artificial constraints under which british gas as a public sector industry labours <e> <s> in doing so he is admitting that coal gas and electricity are operating under artificial constraints and therefore cannot be in a market relationship to a privatised gas industry <e> <s> that is what i am trying to say <e> <s> i could not have put it better <e>", "<cs> i think one must challenge the remark of the noble lord the minister that once british gas is privatised you just leave the matter to the good sense of the privatised company <e> <s> this is a great national asset which is being sold <e> <s> it is of great importance to the industry and to the private consumer and surely we are entitled to write certain conditions into the deal being done between the now public industry and the privatised industry <e>

absolutely entitled to put in conditions as parliament sees fit <e> <s> we should not say that it is just like any other private company and it can do what it damn well likes <e>", "<cs> i do not share that folly but i do share that point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that if the noble lord lord rodney has any evidence whatsoever of any cult taking advantage of yts in the way that he mentioned he should report it immediately to the manpower services commission <e> <s> nothing could do more harm to yts than for such activities to develop <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that in some parts of the country certainly in hertfordshire and buckinghamshire with which i am concerned no less than per cent <e> <s> of those coming off yts schemes get jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches very much regret that the government do not see their way to accept the amendment <e> <s> as the noble iord lord mcintosh said it is extremely difficult to see what harm it could do and it cannot but he advantageous to have this on the face of the bill <e> <s> the noble baroness said that the government have many extremely good ideas and recommendations as to what should be done <e> <s> but over the past years we have all been anxious to see improvements in race relations <e> <s> it is difficult to believe that the position is getting better in our schools as a result of this <e> <s> something much more definite needs to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the noble baroness to think again and perhaps explain this to us again <e> <s> she said that there was something incongruous about the headmaster having a right of appeal against the decision of the lea because the lea was the employer <e> <s> after all in all industrial disputes where there is an appeal to a third party it is the employee against the employer taking the dispute to a third party <e> <s> that is the nature of an appeals procedure <e> <s> what is so different about a headmaster against a local authority and an employee in the ordinary sense appealing against a disciplinary decision and taking it to an industrial tribunal <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also wish to thank the secretary of state for giving us this statement this morning <e> <s> far be it for me to attempt to imitate the inimitable style of the noble lord lord bruce but i would agree with him that the noble lord the minister doth protest too much on behalf of small businesses when he claims as he appears to be claiming that the development in small businesses and the changes he proposes are going to be a major contribution to an improvement in the employment position <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that the range of questions which has come up in response to the statement underlines my request that there should be at the proper time a debate on this white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches understand the problems of the government <e> <s> at the same time it remains true as the noble lord lord shepherd said that this amendment came out during the recess and we have had no proper opportunity to consider it <e> <s> it is not a minor amendment <e> <s> it is a very important issue <e> <s> many of us have received letters from the vice-chancellors who are not a frivolous committee and who are deeply worried about it <e>", "<cs> my lords as i observe the marshalled list i do not think there are any amendments from the back bench <e> <s> they are all from the front bench <e> <s> there may be one exception but the reference was to back-bench amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord kilmarnock is one of the alliance front bench speakers on education <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the secretary of state tell us to what extent the training payments being made for adults in the tourist industry are going to people who are unemployed as distinct from payments for further training of people already <e>", "<cs> my lords having been somewhat connected with this whole procedure and in view of the limited nature of lord mestons bill i feel that this is by far the best arrangement that could be made to deal with the residual cases which will not be covered by what is now that act <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord the minister think again about his comments on paragraph <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> frankly what is understood by welfare under the health and safety at work etc <e> <s> act is something quite different from what is meant by welfare in industry <e> <s> if one looks at the composition of the health and safety executive one will not find there people who are expert in the other matters referred to in this paragraph <e> <s> these are matters of welfare efficiency and training <e> <s> the word welfare is extremely vague <e> <s> i do not believe that anyone in industry would say that the act covers what is generally understood as welfare <e>", "<cs> on a rather different approach it may be that at this late hour i am getting befuddled but i do not think that the drafting of this clause is really very clear <e> <s> you have as the noble lord lord ezra said the use of the words economic and economical in these two paragaphs <e>", "<cs> the last thing that i want to do is prolong this discussion goodness knows it has gone on for long enough but we really must get on to the record that the minister i say this with the greatest respect is deeply confused about this matter because it is a theory of consultation that is practised throughout industry that it does not interfere with the executive responsibility of the director <e> <s> it is consultation and not negotiation <e> <s> there is an absolutely fundamental difference and there is no infringement of the proper role of the director <e> <s> he is only asked to seek comments <e> <s> that is consultation <e> <s> he is not asked to negotiate <e> <s> he has the final say <e> <s> it has nothing to do with infringing the role of the director <e> <s> we really must get that clear and on the record <e>", "<cs> has the minister not now said that in certain circumstances the fixing of the tariff would be transferred to the director if he was not satisfied and so on <e> <s> if it is to be transferred to the director it must be transferred from someone <e> <s> that someone i understand is the supplier <e> <s> that is the point that we have been trying to get clear <e> <s> the supplier therefore fixes the price initially <e> <s> that is what we were told he did not do <e> <s> so he does fix the price that is what we have been trying to get clear <e>", "<cs> my lords would the secretary of state confirm that the restart scheme is genuinely intended to get people back to work and is not as is unfortunately and in my view mistakenly in many quarters believed a way of finding people who are in fact drawing benefit when they should not be doing so <e> <s> i ask this because the scheme is being damaged by rumours to that effect <e>", "<cs> some of us on these benches are rather concerned at the frequency with which the minister says to reassure us that the gas corporation has given assurances <e> <s> however the board in five years time may be made up of totally different people <e> <s> an assurance is not binding and has no standing in the future <e> <s> we find it difficult to feel that this answers issues of the kind for which we feel some legal protection is required <e> <s> what strength can one attach to an assurance <e> <s> i am not questioning the good faith of the people giving it at the moment but in the nature of things those people will not be there in the future <e> <s> the assurance then may be worth no more than the paper it is written upon <e>", "<cs> that is some reassurance which we are glad to have on the record <e>", "<cs> would the minister accept that it is most reassuring to be told by a minister that he does not know <e>", "<cs> since we on these benches have been advocating these schemes for the past years we find it extremely gratifying that the conservative benches have at last seen the light <e> <s> i also wish to say what a relief it is to hear from the lips of the minister himself and to have it on the record that the government do not intend to sell the royal navy <e>", "<cs> for the record may i ask the noble and learned lord to tell us whether the european court findings had to deal with the compulsory retirement ages of men and women or with the age of pensions because it is not the same <e> <s> i think that the noble and learned lord referred to the pension age <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the minister will bear in mind that some of the old-fashioned apprenticeship schemes are not necessarily what is required in the light of modern needs and modern training programmes <e> <s> in fact a great many people would rather see a much revised form of training than the perpetuation of old-style aprenticeships <e>", "<cs> my lords in the list that the noble lord gave us he did not mention the elected members of local authorities <e> <s> there are a great many distinguished women on the local authorities <e> <s> how many of the people who were doing the selection from this list and who made these sweeping judgments were women <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the secretary of state agree that probably one of the most hopeful ways of dealing with the problem is a full development of the chancellors ideas which were of course other peoples ideas too on increasing the profit-sharing element in the return to labour <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the secretary of state agree that since he has now admitted that the problems in australia are in no small part due to the fall in commodity prices it is not accurate to say as he has done on a number of occasions that those problems arose from the fact that australia was investing in the infrastructure <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount whether the privatisation of catering services that he mentioned has extended to the buffets <e> <s> as a practically permanent traveller on british rail i have not noticed the slightest difference in the food at the buffets <e> <s> they have the same sandwiches <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord houghton should remember that we are dealing with this particular bill <e> <s> we on these benches in all our pronouncements have said that we want a completely different sort of bill <e> <s> we have asked for income support based on a tax credit scheme <e> <s> we have asked for it for years but we have not got it <e> <s> if that was the kind of bill we were dealing with we could go along with every word that the noble lord lord houghton has said <e>", "<cs> on the hoof i did not invent the phrase <e> <s> the bill is being reformed as we go along <e> <s> but some reform is better than none <e> <s> we do not like this bill but it is the bill we have in front of us <e> <s> we on these benches have said for decades though we have not had the opportunity for reasons to which the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter referred this afternoon to put this into practice that it is right to have the kind of principles that the noble lord lord houghton has mentioned <e> <s> but we have to deal with what we have now and try to improve this miserable bill and remove its worst defects <e>", "<cs> my lords how does the noble baroness reconcile what she has just told us with a greatly increased anxiety about drugs and a greatly increased anxiety in the prison service about the number of people passing through the courts on drug offences <e>", "<cs> since we are repeatedly told that wages councils are manned by men and women with many other occupations and who are certainly not lawyers does the minister agree that they should attempt to draft provisions in language which is reasonably comprehensible to reasonably ordinary people <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord asking us to believe that to write into the bill that people must have four weeks holiday is so complicated that it will put industry into a straitjacket <e> <s> that stretches our belief beyond endurance <e> <s> the noble lord keeps on telling us that such matters must be left to negotiations between employer and employed <e> <s> surely he knows that to be fair negotiations must be between evenly weighted parties <e> <s> that is what makes for respectable collective bargaining people of even strength negotiate quite properly and come to a proper decision <e>", "<cs> i am genuinely very confused about this matter because if one has a single wages council figure then it is illegal if anybody falls below it <e> <s> i think that is agreed between us <e> <s> but anything that is above that figure is what the employer has seen fit to pay <e> <s> however i do not see where the low pay comes in <e> <s> except by breaking the law one cannot be below what the wages council has laid down <e>", "<cs> there is genuine confusion over this point <e> <s> i ask the minister whether he will please take this matter back and look at it again because in industrial relations terms it does not make sense <e> <s> honestly it does not make sense <e> <s> we have a great deal of sympathy with the minister <e> <s> his mind is on defence and that is enough to keep anybody very busy <e> <s> he cannot be expected also to be a great expert on wages councils which is an irritating and fiddly subject as we all know <e>", "<cs> we do not go along with the drama that has been unfolded before us by the noble lord lord stoddart <e> <s> i agree with the government <e> <s> we on these benches have always argued in favour of an incomes policy because we agree that wage increases which greatly exceed the level of productivity affect our ability to increase our market share <e> <s> that is an argument for a sensible incomes policy to prevent excessive increases such as we experienced in the days of very high inflation <e>", "<cs> i believe that the minister believes what he says because i am sure that he is an honest man <e> <s> if i may be blunt i do not think that he understands the intricacies with which we are dealing <e> <s> in the past i have operated a wages council system <e> <s> i agree that there were certain unhelpful complexities with which one was better without <e> <s> but the government are going to an absured extreme now in saying that all we need is a minimum rate and protection of the overtime rate <e> <s> i agree that we do not want to return to all the detail <e> <s> it was a confounded nuisance <e> <s> i often said that about the detail that was woven into the wages council system <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i find it very difficult to follow the ministers logic <e> <s> you have a wages inspectorate here in order to enforce the legislation just as you have a factories inspectorate in order to enforce the factories legislation <e> <s> in both cases one of the only ways in which it can operate is for people who think an offence is being created to go and tell the inspectorate <e>", "<cs> once again i find it extraordinarily difficult to follow what the noble lord the minister is saying <e> <s> we understood that the government wanted to get off industrys back <e> <s> the government claim that they are not a centralising government but my experience has been that they are an extremely centralising government <e>", "<cs> as a very brief supplementary point to what my noble friend has said may i ask the minister whether he will give us a clear statement in answer to this question <e> <s> i am sure that there must be an answer and it would be valuable to have it on the record <e> <s> it is accepted on all sides that employers and employees have paid into the fund <e> <s> as i understand it this is a form of insurance they pay in advance when times are good so that when they are confronted with redundancy they can take some money out <e> <s> it is now normal suddenly to say that the insurance will not pay <e> <s> what is the governments legal justification for denying employers the right to draw out of the fund into which they have paid when they are faced with the circumstances for which the fund was created <e> <s> that is the first question i wish to ask <e>", "<cs> the noble lord really has not answered the point that employers have paid into this fund <e> <s> it may well be that an employer has paid into this fund for years <e> <s> now for the first time he needs to draw out <e> <s> what legal justification is there for denying someone who has paid into what is virtually an insurance fund any right to draw out from that fund <e>", "<cs> could the noble baroness not look at the wording of this again even if she will not remove it <e> <s> the way it reads at the moment as the noble lord lord ennals has said is that the officer shall have regard to <e>", "<cs> do i understand that maternity and funeral benefits are safeguarded but other things are not <e>", "<cs> then why did the noble baroness mention maternity and funeral benefits if they come under a different heading <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry to come back to this <e> <s> i do not want to be contentious about it <e> <s> but i think the noble baroness does not quite understand the reason for the anxiety on this side <e> <s> we are dealing in the social fund with people who are at the very bottom of the pile and in the greatest need <e> <s> of course we appreciate that over a whole range of matters there have to be cash limits but is the noble baroness telling us that there can be people in the position outlined by my noble friend lord banks who are desperate to have a new cooker because otherwise they cannot cook and where it could arise that the answer would have to be no because of cash limits <e> <s> it is to that that we want an answer because we are dealing with the most necessitous cases in the country <e> <s> we are not trying to plague the noble baroness <e> <s> we are trying to establish that there is a fundamental principle of meeting the wants of people in real need <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness does not know what the cost of the governments scheme is going to be how does she know whether it is more or less than the scheme proposed by my noble friend lord kilmarnock <e>", "<cs> my lords is it possible that the minister will think again <e> <s> we keep getting into a situation in which because easter moves about so rapidly we have in a period of six or seven weeks four bank holidays mostly when it is raining and cold and then we do not have another through june july and august until the very end of august <e> <s> it seems absolutely crazy to continue with the present distribution of holidays <e> <s> everybody would love to have a holiday in june and july but we have them all in chilly april and may <e> <s> it is four years since the last consultations <e> <s> the british public take a long time to change their minds and would it not be worthwhile looking at the matter again <e>", "<cs> my lords we can give the minister some probabilities <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also wish to thank the leader of the house for repeating this important statement about a full meeting in the hague covering issues of the highest importance <e> <s> like the noble lord lord cledwyn i think that as we are to have a debate on africa on friday it would be inappropriate to raise a large number of issues but there are of course certain matters that we shall have to raise immediately as a result of this statement <e>", "<cs> my lords can i ask the noble lord lord belstead why it is right to have a multi-member board to run the gas industry but wrong to have a multi-member commission to run the regulatory body <e>", "<cs> my lords can he appoint other commissioners if he so wishes <e> <s> if he finds faced with a multi-member board of expert people working in a number of different fields that he himself does not command the degree of expertise that is required to deal with this wide range of expertise with which he is confronted will he be able then to appoint commissioners people with power <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends point is that there should have been <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that when he said that we want the best people for the armed forces the record of the ethnic minorities in the wars that they have fought with us suggests that people of considerable suitability for the armed forces are to be found among members of the ethnic minorities in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches wish to thank the secretary of state for giving us this report this afternoon <e> <s> we welcome the content of the report <e> <s> i am glad that there is to be a further extension of the tvei scheme <e> <s> i have had the opportunity to see the scheme in operation <e> <s> in many ways it is a model for the way in which changes of this sort can be brought about <e> <s> the essential change is the development of much better collaboration among educationists and industrialists in the bringing together of education and training to make for good education and to make it vocationally relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords the secretary of state did not reply to my question as to what extent girls were taking part in tvei <e> <s> may i say to the noble lord lord glenamara that in my view and the view of a great many people i remember it was the view of sir fred clarke of the institute of education so-called educational subjects can be vocational and so-called vocational subjects can be educational <e> <s> it is a question of how they are taught and whether the youngsters can be excited by what one is teaching them <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that although he says he has answered every question he has not explained the increase at all <e>", "<cs> my lords it is common ground between us on all sides of the house that we abhor apartheid <e> <s> let us remind ourselves that apartheid is not an old cultural pattern in south africa <e> <s> it was invented and introduced as late as although it is true that it was built on the great discrimination before those days <e> <s> it is also common ground between us that we abhor the intolerable bloodshed the police action and the action of the armed forces which is taking place in south africa at present and which appears week by week indeed day by day to be deepening and becoming ever more serious <e>", "<cs> my lords because it has gone wrong in other places is no reason why we should not continue trying elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to ask the noble lord to consider again whether he really needs both economical and reasonable <e> <s> if it is really uneconomic other things being equal to do it it is not reasonable to do it <e> <s> why does one need to have economical as well as reasonable <e> <s> on the other hand if you leave in economical as well as reasonable then it could be that it was not really within the powers of the gas company to put in a gas pipe where they might well think it was sensible and desirable to do so because they are restricted to it being economical in the narrow sense of the term although they could see that it would be reasonable and even in their long-term interests to do it <e>", "<cs> but the principle is the same my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords with all due respect to the noble lord who has just spoken i should have thought that in his previous speech the noble lord lord ezra had made it very clear how in fact he had taken the interests of british manufacturers into account <e> <s> he explained what they did and to me it sounded as though it were a perfectly reasonable approach that was easy to understand <e> <s> if as the noble lord appeared to be suggesting one were to write into the bill a percentage of preference then in my view one would very quickly get into deep trouble with the treaty of rome <e> <s> it has to be worded in this way in order that one can give due encouragement and go out of ones way to do precisely the sort of thing that the noble lord lord ezra mentioned which is to take prospective customers along to the suppliers and along to the pits to see what is required so that they can get their designs right and be in a good position to compete <e> <s> that is what he was saying and it seemed to <e>", "<cs> my lords before he again gives us that answer as to the reason inflation has fallen will the secretary of state do a calculation as to how much the fall in inflation is due to the fall in oil and commodity prices and how much it is due to monetary policies <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put to the noble lord the minister a more general point <e> <s> the minister is an honourable man <e> <s> does he not accept that if an individual has a legal right to protect himself in a particular way as is laid down in this clause he cannot be penalised for doing what the law of the land specifically has allowed him to do <e> <s> it is a more general point than just whether the individual can go to a tribunal <e> <s> it is said on the one hand that there is a legal right and on the other that he will not be protected at all if he makes use of that right <e> <s> what does the minister say <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the secretary of state to comment on the point that i made to the noble lord lord trefgarne but made i agree somewhat out of order because the motion had been withdrawn <e> <s> it seems to me that it raises a much more general point <e> <s> the noble lord will surely agree that if an individual has a legal right to do something and that is embodied in the law of the land-never mind for the moment the extent to which it refers to this bill-it is not proper that he should be penalised by any other person for using that legal right which the law has given him <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept that the noble lord has answered my point <e> <s> he quoted the fact that people have a right to ask for time off <e> <s> certain <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to ask the secretary of state to look at this amendment and to look again at his present suggestion that payment should go to firms where there are nine or fewer or is it <e> <s> employees <e> <s> what is the logic of limiting it in this way <e> <s> we know the secretary of state is deeply fascina-ted by smallness but surely it does not logically follow that the undertakings which employ a very small number of people are necessarily in the worst position financially <e> <s> if you have a capital-intensive small business in which labour costs are a very small proportion of your total costs you are a great deal better off than if you are in a labour-intensive business in which labour costs are a high percentage of your total costs and you are employing perhaps or people <e> <s> i totally fail to see that capacity to pay is automatically linked to the number of employees <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls has overlooked the fact that since the day when he sat in another place with my noble friend my noble friend has suffered a sea change and a very good one <e> <s> he has joined the alliance which in no circumstances is opposed to the idea of privatisation as such <e> <s> what we are concerned about is protection for the consumer and that is why we support this amendment <e> <s> this is privatisation making a private monopoly and it is the monopoly element that we oppose not the privatisation element <e> <s> this amendment is about trying to protect the consumer by ensuring that there is efficiency and that the benefit of that efficiency goes to the consumer <e> <s> the noble lord must not recall the regrettable past of my noble friend he must look at his entirely acceptable and agreeable present <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any reason why the rights for employee share-owning are not on the face of the bill <e> <s> the noble lord has made the announcement that this is the governments intention but it is not embodied in the bill <e> <s> we are concerned that there should be reference to this in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this amendment <e> <s> i welcome it not only from these benches but in my capacity as chairman of the national council for carers and their elderly dependants which fought for the initial invalid care allowance in the legislation <e> <s> at that time such allowances were not contemplated <e> <s> it was breaking new ground <e> <s> we were grateful to the new labour government <e> <s> the minister at that time recognised the problems of married women but with new allowances of this kind felt that it was not possible to go the whole way and make a grant to married women as well as to single carers and to men married or single <e> <s> the amount of money involved in making the payments to men married or single was very much smaller than the amount of money involved in making payments to women <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very much to support this amendment <e> <s> it is many long years since i was dealing with cases of this kind but i very much want to endorse what the noble baroness lady turner said <e>

those of us who are now thoroughly confused by the whole thing whether she could tell us accurately and authoritatively what section of the act says and means <e> <s> i am completely lost now as to what it is all about <e>", "<cs> my lords would the secretary of state reconsider the governments attitude towards adult training <e> <s> while the government have put a great deal of money into the training of school leavers and the yts there is a tendency is there not <e> <s> for the government to say that a great deal of the burden of adult training should be borne by employers <e> <s> would it not be appropriate that more government money should go into adult training having regard to the fact that while employers will train and should train their own labour force it is improbable that

from these benches we also should like to thank the noble viscount for making this statement and to say that we agree that this is much the most appropriate way of dealing with the slightly absurd situation which has arisen <e> <s> nonetheless perhaps i may ask the noble viscount whether this means that the per cent <e> <s> that we had agreed will in fact come into force as arranged or whether we shall have to wait until the tsrb produces its report in january <e> <s> may i also add not as from these <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps he will accept that it goes further than simply weddings and funerals <e> <s> for example quite a few churches process on various occasions particularly at whitsun <e> <s> there are also pilgrimages and processions of that kind and groups of people who go in procession on armistice day <e> <s> do all these people have to inform the police that they are going to process <e> <s> there are quite a few events of that kind going on <e>", "<cs> my lords while wishing no disrespect to the noble lord the secretary of state may i beg if he must keep whistling in the dark to keep his spirits up that he will find a new tune <e> <s> the budget and therefore the finance bill which gives expression to the budget is a major instrument of economic and directly and indirectly of social policy <e> <s> so one would expect to find some economic analysis of the present situation and of the future and to see in what way the budget is being directed and the finance bill has been drawn up in order to further the policies that such a programme requires <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord recognises that i do not see it reflected either in the finance bill or in the speeches he has made to your lordships house and yet it is crucial to his whole policy of developing small businesses and self-employment <e> <s> the two things are tied up together <e> <s> the one cannot possibly succeed without the other and there will be a large number of people whose employment will be of a part-time kind <e> <s> if that is to be the pattern we have to face the fact that that is what life will be like in this country <e> <s> that is why i said at the beginning that the budget should be concerned not only with the economic realities but with the social realities that are linked to those economic realities <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that the vice-chancellors have so accused the government <e>", "<cs> my lords while similarly recognising the reason that the government wish to introduce the regulations we also

not selling it to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> this is not a field in which i can claim any expertise but i wish to put on the record a protest against the last argument that the minister used when he suggested that a professional body should make it a condition that members should not exercise the very proper right of suing if they are in a situation in which they need to sue <e> <s> that seems a totally improper suggestion from a representative of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> i should like very briefly to say on behalf of my noble friend lord ezra who unfortunately is not able to be present that i know he would wish to join in the thanks which have been given to the noble lord the minister and to all who have taken part in this committee stage <e> <s> i am sure he would also

lordships house wants to see an end to apartheid <e> <s> it is perhaps a pity that we have not focused on that aspect of the problem and talked less about the rights or wrongs of people who are

the total number of those who have been unemployed for over six months particularly the disastrously high number of people under who have been unemployed for over six months these new schemes are

writing english <e> <s> it says an authority who are <e> <s> is that the normal practice <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to my noble friend lord wigoder the noble baroness said that the government would give every encouragement to employers to have screening carried out at the place of work <e> <s> this undoubtedly makes it easier for women to attend to be screened than if they have to take time off to go to their practitioner <e> <s> can this encouragement not take a financial form <e> <s> there are costs involved for companies who are laying on private screening through their health departments <e> <s> these include tax liable expense and women lose time <e> <s> a lot of costs are involved in putting on a service of this kind <e> <s> can the government not be more practical in their assistance <e>", "<cs> my lords that does not answer my question <e> <s> that is a completely different point <e> <s> my question suggested that employers who are laying on the service through their medical department should have some financial encouragement for so doing <e> <s> apart from anything else it is much easier for women to attend <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that many of us believe that these matters are better settled by a responsible committee at local level representing local views which are bound to vary in different parts of this now

the world service was a veritable lifeline to them for news and encouragement and that they had no difficulty whatsoever in distinguishing between the world service and moscow radio <e>", "<cs> my

country <e> <s> it is the need for rented accommodation to give mobility that is the whole point <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister i am sure will correct my ignorance but is it right for us to be discussing this case if it is subject to a judicial inquiry as i understood him to say <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble baroness agree that in view of our notorious incompetence in foreign languages and the importance of developing people who can speak foreign languages if we are to promote markets in the ec where we are not doing as well as we should this would be a very important investment and might merit a little extra cash <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to present a petition from deaconesses of the church of england which prays that your lordships will support the deacons ordination of women measure currently before parliament in order that deaconesses should be accepted into the historic ministry of the church as deacons <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain your lordships house very long as the case for this measure has been put in such detail and so adequately by the right reverend prelate and it has already gone through another place with an overwhelming majority <e> <s> however i should just like to make two points and restrain myself from saying what i should wish to say about the very limited nature of the advance which is embodied in this measure

rejoice is being financed by excessively easy credit and a very large increase in personal indebtedness <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so sorry to come back to this but the minister really has not answered my point at all <e> <s> how can he claim that the monetarist policy of controlling the money supply is in place when it is in fact being refuelled by consumer credit which is outside the control of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that it falls to me to be able also to congratulate the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton and the noble earl lord arran on the speeches they have just made <e> <s> the noble lord lord mowbray has given a great contribution to this house in very many ways and also to the country in the military service that he undertook during the second world war from which he came with the disablement that he bears for the rest of his life but bears with a courage and a lightheartedness that all of us most greatly respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that the fact that it is i who am making this response to the noble lord in some ways represents the great capacity of your lordships house to combine tradition with radical change i a life peer and a woman congratulating the noble lord who i understand is no less than the th baron of his family <e> <s> we have heard in the past about the th viscount but when it gets to the th the inadequate computer in my head is quite unable to work out where back in the middle ages that great <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware that the house wishes to adjourn very quickly but i must say from these benches how glad we are that the noble baroness lady serota has agreed to take on this post <e> <s> i cannot resist pointing out that this will be the fifth appointment to the chairmanship of the select committee on the european communities and that four of the incumbents have been women <e> <s> it may well be though there might be other views that that is why the reputation of your lordships

other way <e> <s> so we are glad that yet another very distinguished woman is to fill this role <e>", "<cs> my lords we cannot let the noble lord get away with that <e> <s> the alliance has no intention whatsoever of indulging in unilateral nuclear disarmament will he please record that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that in view of the growing burden of debt which is becoming a very great problem in many areas people should not be encouraged to borrow in order to invest <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord will agree that the elimination of the labour party does not automatically bring about the one party state <e>", "<cs> my lords the gracious speech this year was somewhat shorter than usual <e> <s> the result is that nearly everyone led of course by the media is assuming that we are on the verge of a general election <e> <s> i am not totally convinced that this is so i speak for myself <e> <s> i believe that the prime minister who whatever else she is not is an acute politician will want to reduce interest rates and mortgage rates before she goes to the country and will certainly want people to have the benefit of any tax cuts in their pockets so that they can spend the money before she tries to reap the benefit of those tax cuts if that is what she will do at the ballot box <e> <s> however when i listened to the two opening speeches i began to think i was at the hustings rather than in your lordships house <e> <s> whether the election comes soon or whether this government run their full length which in my view is not impossible it will be the greatest possible pity if your lordships house with its increased reputation for dealing sagely and impartially with urgent political issues and indeed with long-term political issues were to start indulging in electioneering <e>", "<cs> my lords what additional resources will be made available for in-service training since appraisal schemes without provision for training to deal with defects that are revealed is not much use <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that this is the sort of statistic that parents would wish to have when choosing a school for their children and that figures should be available before they choose a school <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that the alliance would be greatly strengthened by a stronger european pillar but that such a european pillar for defence needs to be preceded by a well organised european foreign policy <e> <s> does she also agree that this enthusiasm for the european contribution coming from the labour front bench though somewhat unexpected is very much to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would also wish to thank the noble viscount the leader of the house for repeating the statement <e> <s> i realise it is conventional practice to make polite remarks about statements but on this occasion i find it very difficult to conform to that practice

by two <e> <s> there is the immediate issue of the emergency indeed i would say the scandal of our present housing position <e> <s> it is the scandal of people queueing for homes in the council sector the scandal of homelessness and the scandal of the decline of our housing stock due to lack of repair <e> <s> i would add the serious fact that the housing position leads to an immobility of labour an immobility of people <e> <s> with housing cheaper in the north and in the west people cannot move to the south and the south-east where the jobs are <e> <s> this hampers the development of our industry and prevents the development of our education service <e> <s> for example it is well-known that teachers cannot take jobs in london because they cannot afford the housing and they must live somewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords on that important point and with regard to the shocking case related by the noble earl we take it that the people involved will be allowed to stay where they are until the ombudsman is satisfied <e> <s> is that right <e>", "<cs> my lords could the secretary of state for employment tell us in what ways from his department rural employment is being encouraged <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the silence of the secretary of state for employment do we conclude that his department has nothing to say about rural unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to speak but as there is an invitation to do so i shall take it up <e> <s> the people may receive answers but if they are deeply dissatisfied with those answers what will the department do then <e> <s> to be given answers which simply are totally unacceptable does not really get one very far <e> <s> that is not consultation <e> <s> people are asking for the opportunity to have a proper inquiry <e> <s> that is not in the least met by being told that there will be a meeting at which they can ask questions be given answers and then be sent home <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that a considerable amount of the increased demand is being financed by debt and that this not only creates serious problems but to some extent makes nonsense of the governments claim to be able to control liquidity to control the money supply <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be permitted to follow the question of the noble lord lord campbell of croy as to who is doing the muggings <e> <s> one fully understands that the noble baroness cannot give us figures for cases which have not been reported <e> <s> however i take it that cases have been reported <e> <s> who are the people who carried out the attacks in those cases <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise to your lordships house for the fact that i shall be forced to be away for a considerable time i hope not too considerable during this debate because i have an appointment in a government department which could not be arranged for any other time <e> <s> however i am certain that i shall be back in time to hear the reply from the government front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble and learned lord has told us he was not at that time a member of the cabinet does that not dispose of the whole question <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the minister for not being in my seat when he began to speak on these measures <e> <s> as the sole occupant of these benches at this time i should like to welcome this order and say how glad we are that it is going through and that the building industry is putting this money into training <e> <s> we particularly welcome the reference to the money being put into the two-year yts <e> <s> it cannot be said too often that the future of the trained manpower in this country depends on the success of the second year of yts <e> <s> the first year is a foundation year but it is in the second year that trainees will learn the techniques and specific skills required to begin to be effective in the building industry <e> <s> therefore we greatly welcome the governments commitment to the second year of yts <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble baroness says that the views of parents will be taken into account will they be the views of parents who already have children in those schools or the views of parents who do not have children in those schools <e> <s> since it is a borough decision should not the views of all parents be taken into account <e>", "<cs> it is all very well for the noble lord to say what he has said but the fact is that what he has said tonight is not going to be available to the people who will have to read the act in the future <e> <s> he has explained it to us and quite intelligent people in this committee cannot understand what is down here without the gloss that the minister has put on it <e> <s> the public who have to deal with the act will not have the benefit of the gloss and that gloss needs to be translated into english which is intelligible to the people who have to use the act <e>", "<cs> i speak as a former president of the british standards institution <e> <s> i hope that in making the statement that he has just made about british standards the noble lord lord lucas did not intend to give the impression that in setting british standards the bsi was not careful about standards of safety <e> <s> tomorrow if he reads what he has said he will see that there is some implication which i think will be very damaging to the bsi that safety is not a prime consideration when standards are being set <e> <s> i hope that he will make it quite clear that that was not in his mind <e>", "<cs> let me say in reply to the noble baroness lady gardner yes of course it is highly desirable that for instance good cheap drugs which are no longer of the level of sophistication that we use in this country should be exported abroad because they are cheap but are still perfectly good to use <e> <s> however that is not the argument <e> <s> the argument that is under discussion is whether they are safe <e> <s> an item can be simple and unsophisticated but still safe <e> <s> i cannot see why one cannot use items that are not of the latest fashion but still safe <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that it would be much easier to get a large-scale response to mature recruitment and a return to nursing if much better child care facilities were available and if perhaps there were some tax concessions for women who have to make use of child care facilities <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord for the advance publicity <e>", "<cs> i have been asked to reply to a number of points <e> <s> let me say straight away in reply to the noble lord lord elton that at this stage we do not intend to put the amendment to the vote <e> <s> i do not agree with him that it is therefore a waste of time <e> <s> this is an attempt to discuss a proposal which we believe may be most appropriate when developed and discussed in detail as we intend to do in the later stages of this bill <e> <s> at this stage we are discussing the principles that we are putting forward and the reasons for putting them forward <e>", "<cs> one of the great objections to the governments proposals was that the people who are to be on this council were not people who would be recognised as being knowledgeable in the field <e> <s> if such a body were established and there are a number of ways in which it could be done the teachers knowing that they were not representative knowing that it was not a negotiating body would at least know that people experienced in this field and with knowledge of the various aspects involved would be sitting on the body <e> <s> they would not be a group of people brought <e>", "<cs> where the amendment says bodies representing the interests i believe i have explained that it is

body can refuse it <e> <s> if within those parameters the negotiating bodies reach agreement the review body cannot refuse it <e> <s> it then becomes a negotiated and accepted settlement because all the bodies concerned have agreed to it <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> they could have this immediate money because we want to get on with it now <e> <s> we can set up this arrangement quickly if we want to <e> <s> the secretary of state knows that he has to set up something and it is a matter of the speed at which he decides to work <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but the teachers will not get their money any quicker if we put this amendment to a vote now or if we do so on report because the bill will not become an act before then <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support this amendment moved by the noble lord lord mcintosh for two reasons <e> <s> the government are continuously doing things by negative resolution which reduces the power of parliament again and again <e> <s> it is all part of the tory partys arbitrary centralising way of dealing with matters <e> <s> the noble baroness said that it is sufficient that the secretary of state does not vary the recommendations from the committee <e> <s> then he can just put them through <e> <s> we feel that this gives practically no say whatever to anybody except the secretary of state and this committee which is to be set up from people of his choosing <e> <s> this is a totally unsatisfactory way of dealing with matters of this very great importance and it will only reinforce the feeling of the teachers the bad feeling that the government have generated by pushing this bill through <e>", "<cs> i must intervene to protest against the statement by the minister that amendment no <e> <s> was so absurd that it was laughed out of court and was not even moved <e> <s> it contained a great many ideas some of which were difficult for people to take on board as i fully understand <e> <s> perhaps

it down again in greater detail at report <e> <s> at that time perhaps the government front bench will understand it <e>", "<cs> it is very odd that the noble baroness should say that parents have no interest in the conditions of service <e> <s> conditions of service as i understand them cover such things as the teachers obligation to stand in and take a class if somebody else is ill <e> <s> when

lines that he and the conservative front bench think their independent opinion will be precisely the opinion that he wishes to get <e> <s> it is this that we have been trying to say repeatedly to the noble lord all the evening <e> <s> but if he finds our comments fatuous perhaps it is fatuous to go on repeating them <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has not helped me at all <e>", "<cs> i fear that the noble lord does not give us evidence he gives us assertions <e>", "<cs> given that the bill will no doubt go through soon surely the minister can give us an assurance that there is no reason why the order cannot be laid early in the summer <e> <s> is there anything to be done once the bill has gone through <e> <s> what could possibly delay it until the autumn <e> <s> i accept the point that if it does not come in until september then there would be problems <e> <s> is there any risk that that will not be done by the summer <e>", "<cs> i also should like to support these amendments <e> <s> our opposition to the bill is based on our scepticism as to the truly temporary nature of this bill <e> <s> if we believed that it was going to disappear quickly that it was as temporary as we have been told we should feel much less strongly against it because we recognise the differences that exist <e> <s> if we could have the amendment which has been moved by the noble lord for months and then for the measure to he renewed only on an affirmative resolution it would take a great deal of the animosity against this bill away from these benches <e> <s> i hope that this amendment will be accepted

system for the european parliament no doubt the noble baroness would be there herself to ask the questions <e> <s> that would relieve him of a great problem <e>", "<cs> my lords will the secretary of state agree that the figures show that under any government the unemployment figures tend to fall for the few months before an election <e>", "<cs> my lords is part-time employment reckoned as a

at this stage to return to a burnham mark ii however much we might like to see that in future and we hope that it will be the near future <e> <s> however we accept that at present it is not a practical proposition <e>", "<cs> my lords in replying briefly to this debate we accept the proposal put forward by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey that at the last stage the secretary of states right to override through affirmative action should be confined to pay and not to conditions of employment <e> <s> that perhaps would simplify the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should very much like to speak in support of these amendments <e> <s> failing the amendments i have put forward they would be my choice <e> <s> i am particularly pleased to see them here because as the noble lord lord

objected to it say it does not protect the position of the secretary of state <e> <s> it is surely to be assumed that the government in putting forward proposals which would in effect restore negotiation rights would incorporate into those proposals the proper position and power of the secretary of state as was included in the amendments that were put forward at report stage in order to

rights and we accept that these are rights of the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that some of the overcrowding concerning people held on remand is due to

requirement that they should be eligible for unemployment benefit <e> <s> will the minister look into that <e> <s> it is a restriction <e> <s> it was challenged in the community programme but the challenge was lost <e> <s> it means that many women who would like to come back into the labour market and who would like to take part in the job training scheme are excluded <e> <s> it is a rather big question <e>", "<cs> my lords i was paying the noble baroness the compliment that she knew the benefits <e> <s> i did not really believe it and she is honest enough to admit that she does not know

have at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that if community care is to be the preferred way of dealing with some patients it would be sensible to start up community care services before hospitals begin to be emptied <e> <s> what has happened to the numbers of home helps who are absolutely crucial to any effective community care <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble and learned lord agree that the daffodils on the labour front bench become them much better than the roses which they recently donned <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be extremely brief because most of the points that i wished to make have already been made either by the noble baroness lady jeger or by my noble friend lord kilmarnock <e> <s> should however like again to underline the question of the mother aged under who at present will not receive the grant the grant going to her parents if and only if the parents are on supplementary benefit <e> <s> i can see the administrative neatness of this arrangement and i can see the argument that it is desirable that such a girl herself little more than a child will be looked after by her parents <e> <s> but the reality is that it will not be like that for a considerable number <e> <s> as we know a number of these girls break away from home and they are on their own <e> <s> there are not a very large number <e> <s> as my noble friend lord kilmarnock pointed out whether they are under or not they have full responsibility for the well-being of that child <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to thank the noble baroness for repeating the statement but to say that like the noble baroness lady jeger we are deeply concerned that the government should immediately leap in to override a decision of a commissioner <e> <s> the decision of a commissioner should surely be regarded as an independent judgment made by the commissioner and we are moving into a very dangerous situation indeed in which either legal or quasi-legal procedures in this country can be overruled by the executive with very little time intervening between the decision of the commissioner and the governments action <e> <s> it is a well-established principle in this country that judicial or quasi-judicial decisions are independent of government and if they are not independent of government they lose a very great deal of their benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords how can the noble baroness say that the government are not interfering with the commissioners if in the next breath she says that they are laying regulations tonight tomorrow or whenever it is in order to do precisely that <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness expect anything intellectual from the labour shadow cabinet <e>", "<cs> my lords all noble baronesses speaking this afternoon must feel a distinct sense of <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give an example of that <e> <s> in the past there was a singular absence of such schemes <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me to intervene how can it be adequate if it is not proper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that there is a strong case for giving special encouragement to part-time students <e> <s> not only do they make better use of facilities as has already been said but they do so under great pressure and in difficult circumstances and are therefore a self-selected sample of very determined people who should be encouraged and not discouraged <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> would he not agree however that he cannot be entirely happy about the conclusions he has drawn from the statement he has made about the increase in productivity despite the decrease in the number of persons employed which is no doubt true unless he also takes into account the extent of capital investment and the return on the capital invested <e> <s> you may be getting the results you say but unless you take that other item into account you do not know whether you are doing well or not <e>", "<cs> my lords does the secretary of state agree that the main criticism of restart is not that it is now doing the job it is but that it was not begun a very long time ago <e> <s> is it not extraordinary that the long-term unemployed were left without this kind of contact for so many months <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not agree that unless this report is published we are all bound to assume that there are things which the government do notwish the public to see <e> <s> would that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that if we are starting from such a low base it is not really very surprising that the increased rate was as high as it was <e>", "<cs> my lords why is the noble earl so anxious to have consensus when in respect of every other bill he has put through the house there has been no consensus <e> <s> i thought that he did not like consensus <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also wish to thank the noble baroness for repeating the statement which in general we welcome <e> <s> but even now the scale of the changes proposed does not begin to meet the need <e> <s> the type of universities at the present stage is such that only a quantum leap is adequate for making up the deficiencies <e> <s> when the statement says that we hope to get one in five of school-leavers into some form of higher education we still shall not be up with the level which is adopted by our major competitors and this is only a step in the right direction <e> <s> it is not by any manner of means what we should like to see if we are to meet the needs of this country and to give the opportunities that we would wish to give to people seeking higher education <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to apologise to your lordships house for the fact that owing to an engagement which i had accepted long before i knew that this debate was to be held i shall not be able to be here for the reply from the government benches later this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be allowed as i happen to be the treasurer of the all-party committee on soviet jewry for both houses to express our very great appreciation of the way in which the prime minister went out of her way to meet the jewish refuseniks and as i understand it to present the committees award to josif begun a particularly outstanding dissident who suffered very greatly indeed <e> <s> we are most grateful for her efforts in that regard <e>", "<cs> now that we know that we are not to have an election on may th does the minister agree that it would be rather a good idea to take the bill back and have it carefully thought out and rewritten in plain english or even in plain scottish so that some people have a chance to understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is all very well for the minister to say that there is no direct link <e> <s> research findings may not have established it but common sense and knowledge of what young men between the ages of and are like surely tell him that if those young men have nothing to do and have no money they will get into trouble <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should like also to wish everybody a very happy easter <e> <s> i think we are all ready for it <e> <s> it is the latest easter that i can remember and it has been a long road since christmas <e> <s> we are all very glad to be getting away <e> <s> of course we should also like to join in the thanks to the staff who attend in this chamber <e> <s> i should particularly like to mention the catering staff who do an extremely good job and without whom life in this house would be very difficult indeed <e> <s> we are very grateful to them <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord tell us what criteria are being applied <e> <s> we have had this answer to the question at least times and we have never been told how the government are making their judgment <e> <s> will he please enlighten the house <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord assure us that the building programme is not being carried out at the expense of smaller hospitals some of which have been either shut or had beds removed which are greatly valued by local communities and badly needed for the community care that we have increasingly to provide <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord and perhaps other noble lords including the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter agree that we should get on rather more swiftly if we deferred blatant electioneering at least until we know the date of the election <e>", "<cs> my lords with supporters like the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls who needs an opposition <e> <s> surely we need to be more specific than this <e> <s> the register could be used by malevolent people <e> <s> after all i suppose that the bill will be on the statute book for some time and we cannot open the books to anybody who wants to come to look at them <e> <s> we must have much more specific information as to who is going to be allowed to have access to this material <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say as an old lady living alone that i entirely agree <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendments that i am putting forward stand on their own <e> <s> i intend to move amendments nos <e> <s> a and aaa <e> <s> i shall not be moving amendment no <e> <s> aa <e> <s> i hope that that clarifies the position for the noble lady <e> <s> she is doing fine <e>", "<cs> my lords

no <e> <s> aaa <e>", "<cs> i shall not be moving amendment no <e> <s> aa my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with very great interest to what the minister said and also to what the noble lord lord campbell of alloway and the noble lady lady saltoun <e> <s> this amendment is a compromise it is not what we would wish if we could have our own way <e> <s> i fully accept that it would be much more desirable if the system could be regionally based for the reasons which baroness carnegy gave <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there are skillcentres in the south-east which have been unable to provide courses due to lack of instructors <e> <s> in one area with which i am familiar a young man tried last october to train in painting and decorating <e> <s> the skillcentre accepted him but he has not yet been offered a place because there is no instructor <e> <s> that is becoming a common situation in the south-west and south-east <e>", "<cs> my lords how mean can we get <e>", "<cs> my lords in the opening pages of the government white paper the authors state that the higher education system in this country is one of the best in the world <e> <s> one is therefore tempted to comment if it is not broken dont mend it <e> <s> why meddle so much with a system which is said to be one of the best in the world <e> <s> that is not of course to say that there is no room for change and development quite plainly there is <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down can she really not tell us anything more about the nature of contract <e> <s> after all she has been pressed on this point from all round the house and it is of the greatest possible importance <e> <s> she has really said nothing about it at all <e>", "<cs> if there is no emergency what justification is there for retrospective legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that his real objection to the term poll tax is that it would be very unpopular at the polls <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that the figure he has just given us of per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be highly improper for them to invest in this venture <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches hope that the noble lord lord bruce will take his message to the hustings over the next three weeks <e> <s> the budget is a major instrument of economic policy <e> <s> as such it is based on assumptions about the state of the economy and predictions of its future development <e> <s> i did not agree with a great deal of what the noble lord said but i agreed with his reference to the highly selective figures which had been given to create the impression of great success in our economy at present <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord deny the position in the league tables that i quoted from the <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me very great pleasure to support the motion for the adjournment and in so doing to congratulate the two noble peers who have moved the humble address <e> <s> there is much to be said for and against and there is much argument about the hereditary principle <e> <s> however one undoubted thing that the hereditary principle does for your lordships house is to bring to its benches members young enough to be the grandchildren of most of us who occupy the remaining benches <e> <s> that is at least refreshing and encouraging <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that i am making this speech because i wish to say how much women in this house have appreciated the example that the noble baroness lady young has set <e> <s> encouragement has been given to women in this house and far beyond in seeing that it was possible for the noble baroness to hold the position that she has held and to do it with such distinction <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that in the interests of freedom of speech it would be a good thing if fewer inquiries were made into the goings on of the bbc and its allied bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness look into the possibility that in the quite exceptional circumstances of aids it might be suitable to modify the normal requirements for the testing of drugs which in other circumstances would be quite inappropriate <e> <s> it could well be that someone with aids would prefer to have a drug which has not been perfectly tested than not to have a drug at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot allow the minister to get away with the idea that we supported the community charge <e> <s> is he not aware that these benches have always put forward the idea of a local income tax instead <e> <s> there was no such support <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree on reflection that he told his noble friend lord onslow that he was perfectly correct in saying that it would not be illegal for example but that does not mean that the system is not unjust which was the point made by the noble earl <e> <s> it can still be very unjust <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the noble baroness recognises that the brain drain had started long before the change in the tax system to which the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter referred <e> <s> therefore that cannot be the reason <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord must accept that he has not answered the questions put by my noble friend lord bonham-carter or the question put by the noble lord lord ardwick <e> <s> during this discussion he has merely fallen back again and again on saying that he has exercised his powers <e> <s> surely he recognises that it is the job of the opposition to probe the exercise of those powers <e> <s> that is what we have been attempting to do <e> <s> the minister has given us no satisfaction in the exercise of our duties as the opposition <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also wish to thank the noble viscount the leader of the house for repeating the statement <e> <s> we agree that something has urgently to be done to deal with the financial position of the community <e> <s> we are also <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to the noble lord the secretary of state on his new appointment should he regard it as promotion from the department of employment to trade and industry or perhaps he regards it as new fields to conquer <e>", "<cs> they are temporary difficulties my lords temporary difficulties <e> <s> i had to be away <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord been told as i have that the difficulty in movement across boundaries is largely a matter of financial bureaucracy <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the secretary of state agree

treaty <e> <s> if this person is appointed in the way in which judges are appointed in that they cannot be removed whatever they do except for gross personal misconduct and so on it would give independence if that was undertaken in the appointment <e> <s> would that be in conflict with the treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords as the leader of the house said in response to a <e>", "<cs> my lords when the bill was going through the house the government must have assumed that some money was going to be spent on it even if it now proves to be more than was expected <e> <s> could not that money be allocated now <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that except in the most short-sighted accountancy terms to give people alarms so that they can stay in their own houses which is what a great many of them do instead of having to be moved into public housing would be a very great economy <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us how many of these new hospitals include secure units of the kind to which courts could send people whom they now send to prison not because they think that is the right place but because there is inadequate secure unit accommodation in hospitals <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to comment on the assumption that the ferries will disappear <e> <s> surely all those who use st malo cherbourg and le havre to travel south-west and to visit spain and portugal will continue to use them <e> <s> we are not burying the ferries are we <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the noble earl will agree that because your first attempt at reform is not satisfactory that does not mean that no reform will be satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that if one has that kind of wastage rate to there must be something seriously wrong with the way in which one treats them <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord reassure us that there is no intention of privatising the legislation in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords while i welcome the statement i want to express some disappointment that there is no reference in it to the question of prisoners on remand <e> <s> it was stated in a debate only the other day that some per cent <e> <s> of the prisoners on remand i give that figure from memory do not get custodial sentences <e> <s> this seems a totally unnecessary loading of the prison population with people who ought not be be there <e> <s> surely there are steps that could be taken an increase in the number of bail hostels is only one to cut down the number of people on remand who are taking up places in prison <e>", "<cs> my lords while it is perfectly true as the minister says that british telecom is privatised albeit it is privatised monopoly the post office is not <e> <s> if this service could be arranged through the post office over which the government still have some degree of control it would give a very great deal of assistance <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be allowed to support this question <e> <s> i speak having an interest because i am chairman of apex which works closely with phoenix house <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister to look again very carefully at the whole question of core funding because monies made available and this applies also to apex frequently do not carry core funding <e> <s> however without adequate headquarters support it is impossible to maintain the work going on all over the country to deal with drugs and rehabilitation work <e> <s> all grant bodies seem to ignore the fact that core funding however economical one is is absolutely essential <e>", "<cs> my lords the secretary of state will perhaps be pleased to hear that from these <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already said that unit costs have not gone up as much as we feared they might but if the trend on pay continues increasing at its present rate this position cannot continue <e> <s> i imagine that the noble lord believes and hopes as does the chancellor of the exchequer that profit-related pay will provide a curb on wage increases and therefore will have a highly desirable effect on unit costs <e> <s> that may well be so and it has always been one of the reasons why one has believed in the advantages of profit-related pay <e> <s> however we on these benches who have always supported profit-related pay have always said that it has to be done in a climate of a high degree of collaboration and consultation with labour and labour representatives <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the noble earl does not defend the ridiculous position in which in this year in a period of seven weeks we had no fewer than four public holidays and none throughout the remainder of the summer until the very end of august the very time when people would like public holidays <e> <s> there may be the difficulties that the noble lord experienced with the churches but there are four holidays to be considered <e> <s> is it not time that we took a serious look instead of always repudiating the suggestion at a more intelligent arrangement of public holidays than we have in this country <e>", "<cs> is it not possible to take a little further what the minister has said <e> <s> the federal government cannot do it on behalf of the state government but could it not obtain an agreement from the state government and pass that on as the federal government <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord inform his colleague the secretary of state that we much regret his absence when a matter of such importance is being discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also wish to thank the noble lord the leader of the house for repeating the statement <e> <s> there are certain aspects of the statement with which we concur for instance the general approach towards fiji in that there is a desire

accommodation for holding women on bail <e> <s> you can get houses you can convert houses <e> <s> i was visiting the griffin societys provision only the other day <e> <s> it is true that it is for after-care but it is the same principle <e> <s> you can convert houses into bail hostels <e> <s> there is totally inadequate provision both for holding women on bail under reasonable conditions and for after-care <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the right reverend prelate <e> <s> the noble lord lord sudeley made an interesting point and i do not think that the right reverend prelate has answered it <e> <s> the point was that the parochial church council is now free to use that money if this measure passes not for the poor it could go to pay the electricity bill and do the roof <e> <s> must it earmark that money for local churches to give to the poor or to individuals or can it pay the electricity bill <e> <s> the pccs have troubles with electricity bills like everyone else <e> <s> i can see the money going quickly into paying church bills rather than to the relief of the poor <e>", "<cs> the minister has said that the government have sympathy with the proposals for local authority care and accommodation for young offenders and that in the days of mr brittan the home office was considering such matters <e> <s> i do not have the dates of the various moves of mr brittan clear in my mind <e> <s> however it must be many months since he was in the home office <e> <s> can the minister say how many youngsters we are referring to <e> <s> i cannot believe that if the government had really wanted that to be done the accommodation could not have been found <e> <s> if it was a matter of high priority in the governments programme that would have been done <e>", "<cs> my lords can the secretary of state confirm that he has no intention of undervaluing the work done by <e>", "<cs> my lords why did the minister say that the community cannot spend money that it does not have when it has already done so <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble lord lord graham one question <e> <s> i entirely agree with what he says in this amendment about the rights of

am sure that he is that it is possible that people with family responsibilities who go on an msc training course can be worse off on the training allowances than they were on the accumulation of benefits they had before going on the course and that that has the effect of making it impossible for some people who wish to take training and who would be useful when trained to start or to continue on the courses <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> for the record would he agree that it is a very real economy to keep people in their own homes <e> <s> therefore the

sorry to see him going and especially sorry because of the reason which causes him to resign <e> <s> however it is an easy task to pay tribute because and this is not always the case we can have no

amendment and indeed the other amendments connected with contract compliance to remember that one of the greatest benefits of contract compliance as a method is that it is accompanied by skilled advisory services to help people to carry out those obligations <e> <s> i would not support contract compliance unless it were accompanied by skilled advisory services because it is by the use of the advisory services that one gets it right when employing disabled people for example and also women and members of ethnic minorities <e> <s> it means that the job will be done really well <e> <s>

experienced in local government and a former member of parliament <e> <s> i assure your lordships that what he says will be accurate <e>", "<cs> my lords genuinely seeking information i would ask the minister if he could explain to us what the process would be for doing this <e> <s> if we want to make allowances if the secretary of state has the right to say that the additional expenditure is

opportunity so far to debate the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would very much like to support this amendment in the form that it now takes <e> <s> i was in support of the previous amendment but i can well see that the new amendment is likely to be more acceptable to the government and half a loaf of bread is better than no bread <e> <s> it would be a great pity if the noble earl now told us that we cannot even have our half loaf <e>", "<cs> my lords i was present in committee and i heard what the noble lord said but i wish to stress this point which i think some noble

inquiries into training <e> <s> the building industry and notoriously the construction industry have a wide range of suppliers from those who train well to those who do not train at all <e> <s> if anyone in your lordships house were to have building work done surely it would be reasonable to discover whether one was hiring a properly trained labour force <e> <s> one would not know that merely

earl who drew up those questions <e> <s> i confirm what the noble lord lord mackintosh has said <e> <s> if a student doing a survey had produced those type of questions one would have failed him <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has made it plain as we have always known that he enjoys a jibe at proportional representation and does not understand its significance <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to carp about the wording of paragraph b <e> <s> but even taking account of the changes that have been made and the fact that the wording now stops at the word relationship it is most confusing <e> <s> the term pretended family relationship is still most unsatisfactory <e> <s> i do not like the clause <e> <s> however if the minister insists on saying what he intends to say would he not agree that some such words as <e>", "<cs> my lords i am astonished to hear a lawyer say that it does not matter whether or not the words are precise <e> <s> i thought that that was the whole purpose of legislation to have precise wording so that it can be properly interpreted in the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has told us that there is

friend lord diamond has indicated that we on these benches are interested and have considerable sympathy with the objectives of this report <e> <s> perhaps i may be allowed to refer to the yellow report and to the paper accompanying it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not answered my question <e> <s> we are having two changes simultaneously both of which disrupt the operation of the employment service <e> <s> why on earth does the employment service have to go back to the department of employment in order to be taken out again <e> <s> why can the government not wait and simply take it from the manpower services commission into this new agency in one jump because these changes disrupt <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to be able to say as is not altogether common from these benches that there is much in the white paper to which we can wholeheartedly give our support <e> <s> this has been said on all sides today which must be no <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord renton expressed surprise that we on these benches having supported many aspects of previous trade union legislation were not wholeheartedly in support to put it mildly of the bill that has come to your lordships house today <e> <s> i do not know why he should be surprised <e> <s> the government talk about a step by step approach but it is possible to go along step by step with the government and then to decide that enough is enough <e> <s> i shall come to the reasons why i believe that enough is enough in a few moments <e>", "<cs> my lords the secretary of state told us that there has been a great increase in productivity which is very welcome news <e> <s> can he tell us how that productivity compares with that of our major competitors for example germany and france <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us when the promised bail hostels will come on stream and whether in view of the kind of information we have had today the government will consider increasing the number of bail hostels to be provided <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down perhaps she can confirm on reflection that she did not intend an attack on the late ian ramsey who was to many of us a guiding theologian and guide <e>", "<cs> my lords i too briefly on behalf of these benches thank the minister for the very agreeable way in which he has conducted the bill through this house a way to which we have now become familiar in respect of the various bills loaded upon the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that care in the community for whatever group we are talking about requires that there should be good local hospitals which can act as day centres provide respite care and provide short-term nursing care <e> <s> why is it that there is so marked a tendency either to shut or to reduce in size local hospitals which have formed part of their community for a long time which are well supported locally and which are very much loved <e>", "<cs> my lords the response from the govenment benches to the criticisms and indeed the attack from the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead has been carried out by four noble lords <e> <s> the noble lord lord colnbrook in a very elegant and moderate speech spoke in the manner that one would expect from anyone making a maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will however agree that he mentioned all the other matters <e> <s> the government have controlled pay largely through unemployment <e> <s> the noble lord shakes his head but he would hardly deny that a big increase in unemployment is likely to say the least to modify pay claims <e> <s> the noble lord again shakes his head but i believe that he would not find many people who would shake their heads with him except in disapproval of what he has said <e> <s> again that is an example of the fact that what appears to be freedom to some people is not freedom in the eyes of others <e> <s> as regards exchange controls i agree that there have been some actions in the economic sphere which have had the effect of decentralising and creating freedoms but the range is very limited <e>", "<cs> my lords i point out to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that i am not dragging it in <e> <s> i am mentioning it because it is highly appropriate to the matter we are discussing and i can think of no better way of controlling extremism in local government <e> <s> the heart of the argument is that extremism in local government had to be curtailed <e> <s> i am saying that there was no need for the government to diminish the powers of all local authorities in the way in which they are doing when there is another instrument to hand which they are afraid to use because if it were proved to be valuable in local government someone might say it might be a good thing to have at westminster <e> <s> i look firmly at the labour benches when i say this because their enthusiasm for changes along those lines has not been conspicuous <e> <s> so the attack on local government has been an attack on democracy and that we regard as very serious indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble and learned lord but since he mentioned me on the question of deregulation perhaps i may say that i admitted that this increased freedom for some but i also made the point which was the substance of my argument that it limited freedom for others <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister explain what he meant by duplicates <e> <s> you cannot sell duplicates of the original <e> <s> did he mean that <e>", "<cs> we on these benches had originally intended to support the government on clause <e> <s> however for two reasons regretfully we find ourselves unable to do so unless the noble lord lord trefgarne will say that he will look again at some of the controversial points which have been raised this afternoon <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the minister four questions <e> <s> do the government believe that good industrial relations are essential to the economic development of the country and of companies <e> <s> does the minister believe that responsible trade unionism and responsible trade unions are essential for good industrial relations <e> <s> does he believe that responsible trade unions playing their part in industrial relations require that there should be an equilibrium between the power of the employers and the power of the union not unduly weighted on one side or the other <e> <s> if he believes that does he believe that the clause will not upset that equilibrium taking into <e>", "<cs> why are the government so resistant to the belt and braces approach occasionally <e> <s> if there really is any doubt in peoples minds what harm does it do to put something into this act so that people do not have to go to a number of different acts to find out what their position is <e> <s> it cannot do any harm and it could well do some good <e> <s> can the government really not accept this <e>", "<cs> i do not understand why the government are treating the trade union movement as if it were totally different from any other kind of organisation in the country <e> <s> i do not know what <e>", "<cs> will the noble earl please explain whether he intends to bring in similar legislation to stop companies paying parking fines for their employees <e> <s> if not why is sauce for the goose not sauce for the gander <e>", "<cs> where in the bill does it say that this exemption could be made <e> <s> the noble earl said that there are some circumstances in which it would not apply <e> <s> is that in the bill <e>", "<cs> i speak in support of the amendment <e> <s> those people who attend and have a right to speak or who speak on occasion are virtually the civil service of the trade union movement <e> <s> it would be very odd to suggest in this chamber that civil servants should be elected by the general body of voters <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will permit me <e>", "<cs> i am really extremely confused <e> <s> that is probably my fault <e> <s> but let us suppose that the executive committee is considering whether or not to take strike action and it turns to the legal adviser and asks whether such action would be within the law <e> <s> the legal adviser then gives his opinion <e> <s> is that to be regarded as incidental <e>", "<cs> the noble lord seems to think that a decision is taken at a particular moment on the clock <e> <s> but of course it is a process <e> <s> that opinion is a very important part of the process of making the decision <e>", "<cs> but really if the lawyer says if you do this you will go to jug one cannot say that that is incidental in the process of making the decision <e>", "<cs> is it impossible for the minister to look at this matter to see whether the issues can be clarified <e> <s> if the engineering employers federation which is not a rabid left-wing body ranged to attack the government the institute of personnel management which is made up of people who spend their lives interpreting these matters day in and day out and the noble lord lord wedderburn with whom i disagree on many occasions but who is an expert lawyer in these fields and widely accepted as such all say that this is not clear will the minister not have the modesty to admit that there may conceivably be something lacking in the drafting of this clause <e>", "<cs> i ask the minister also to recognise that it is not the opinion only of the noble lord lord wedderburn with whom as i said i frequently disagree <e> <s> it is the view of bodies like the engineering employers federation and other people who are very much more expert in this field than is the noble lord himself <e> <s> i am sorry to have to say it so bluntly but that is the position <e> <s> if those people are experiencing serious difficulties we are once again in the position of passing legislation which will cause a great deal of confusion for the people who will have to operate it <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble earl has not understood what it is that we are after <e> <s> he said that it was not part of the functions of the commissioner to adjudicate <e> <s> of course it is not part of the functions of the commissioner to adjudicate but in any difficulty as the noble lord lord renton was implying it is sensible to attempt to conciliate which is something quite different from adjudicating <e> <s> by saying that the commissioner should not adjudicate the noble earl has not answered the case for saying that he should have a conciliation role <e> <s> they are two quite different functions <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the minister mentioned an establishment for transport police of officers in post <e> <s> is that on a three-shift basis <e> <s> if so that means that there are only officers on duty at any one time for the whole of the underground network <e> <s> is that the position <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister told us that the government would consider the position at the end of april if there had been a successful conclusion to the negotiations <e> <s> can he tell the house how he will judge whether or not those negotiations have been successful as they affect the taxpayer <e>", "<cs> i want very strongly to support this amendment <e> <s> for the past four years i have been chairman of a local board and through all the difficulties of ensuring full support for the yts trade union loyalty to the scheme has been absolutely essential <e> <s> in the case that i have been concerned with and i believe throughout the country trade union support has been very good indeed <e> <s> after all these measures have to operate at local level <e> <s> if the trade union representatives feel that inevitably they will be outnumbered and down-graded on the committees one does not vote very often but it happens from time to time one runs the very considerable risk of losing that absolutely essential trade union support <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness will agree surely that there is a grave danger that the new job training scheme efforts will not be accepted because of failure of trade union co-operation <e> <s> the amendment is an attempt to stop the possible ruining of the new job training scheme <e>", "<cs> will the noble earl say to whom he was referring when he said that it would have the blessing of the almighty <e>", "<cs> again i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> the whole idea of the establishment of the manpower services commission which was after all created by a previous conservative government <e>", "<cs> not every amendment <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord not waste the time of the committee by discussing my relations with the labour party <e>", "<cs> does the minister agree that by including women and girls he has already offended in that way <e>", "<cs> coming from the noble lord that offer is most gracious indeed <e> <s> i shall therefore be extremely glad to withdraw the amendment on those conditions <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment but not for the reasons that the minister implied previously <e> <s> employers do not want conscript trainees <e> <s> those who have been involved in running a training course know that anyone who is there against his or her will is an extremely disruptive element <e> <s> it is highly undesirable that people should be pushed into training programmes in which they do not wish to participate <e>", "<cs> i was extremely interested in the comments of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter who told us that this proposal was intended to make the scheme more efficient <e> <s> he said that it was an expensive scheme and that the government needed to make it more efficient <e>", "<cs> i very much hope that the government will agree to look closely at this amendment <e> <s> we are all extremely anxious and it is common ground between us that the reputation of the yts should be high and that potential trainees should see it as a desirable opportunity <e> <s> one only needs a few cases in which it is felt that a job has been lost and the traineeship has been lost without consideration of fairness to prejudice a great many people against it <e> <s> that makes the headlines and it is very bad for the scheme particularly now that the penalties are tough weeks is a very long time it is half a year <e> <s> a per cent cut in benefit reduces the young persons benefit to a very meagre amount of money to spend <e> <s> that is a very serious penalty <e> <s> surely it is in nobodys interest and certainly not that of the government that it should be possible to say that a young person suffers these penalties without having the opportunity to have his or her case independently looked at <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will take that on board <e>", "<cs> we are most grateful for the good publicity on the excellent record of the liberal party <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the minister one thing <e> <s> in plain straightforward english does he or does he not think it fair that a young trainee should lose his job for misconduct and suffer serious penalties as a consequence without having the chance of having his case heard independently in some way <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord irvine explained why that was an inadequate <e>", "<cs> does the minister agree that there are not adequate training places available for the desirable jobs <e> <s> the training places at the top of the list this is common to all of us working in the <e>", "<cs> is the minister not being overoptimistic <e> <s> i do not know where he obtains his information that there will be a large number of extra courses <e> <s> the government are rightly busily trying to obtain extra places for the new job training scheme for older people <e> <s> my information at local level is that officials are extremely worried about whether they will be able to find all the yts places in addition to those for the job training schemes if all the job training schemes are taken up <e> <s> i hope that the minister is right when he believes that there will be this large number of desirable courses <e> <s> that is not what i am being told and i should like to know from where he obtains his information <e>", "<cs> i do not hold out much hope that the minister will be accommodating <e> <s> however i shall repeat what i said a few moments ago <e> <s> he is greatly over-estimating the ability to offer suitable training programmes <e> <s> i should rather see on three occasions than good cause written into the bill if it were a matter of changing the wording <e> <s> the noble baroness lady carnegy was correct when she said that a young person who on going into a training programme finds that it is not what he or she wants moves to another <e> <s> if that is not what is wanted he or she moves to another <e>", "<cs> as has been said what is good cause is highly subjective <e> <s> three times is a fact <e> <s> one can say you have turned it down three times and that is it <e> <s> one can be as tough as one likes after that <e> <s> that would be more efficient economical and fairer to the youngster <e> <s> i can see that we shall not have the amendment accepted at this time of night having regard to the preceding results and i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the minister is not prepared to accept this amendment <e> <s> although i accept what he said in some respects in our view these categories should be protected by being put on the face of the bill and not have to rely as he suggested on the existing provision in the regulations of the social security bill <e>", "<cs> through all these discussions it comes over very strongly that what the government really believe is that there are a very large number of people who are trying to avoid getting jobs and who are skiving on benefit <e> <s> let us not pull our punches over this matter <e> <s> we do not believe that the evidence supports that view <e> <s> we recognise that there are some but what appears to us to be happening as regards this legislation is that the whole approach to training and employment is overshadowed all the time by the conviction of the government that there are a great many people who do not want to work <e> <s> i challenge the government to produce evidence of this <e> <s> i ask them to look at this bill as something which is genuinely trying to establish good training and we should not be setting traps for people who try to evade it <e> <s> can the minister please comment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the change which many of us welcome in the mortgage interest relief limiting it to the house and not to the number of persons is likely to have a very serious effect on nurses who are having difficulty trying to get housed in london and who have been getting together in twos and threes in order to make purchases <e> <s> i should have thought that this will be a matter of very considerable concern to the noble lords department <e>", "<cs> the minister has not really answered the point <e> <s> are the powers to be unlimited in time or does the minister accept that there must be a limit even if the limit quoted here is not the right one <e>", "<cs> why cannot the minister say if this is what he is trying to convey to us that the proposals to be brought to parliament are for privatisation and the establishment of a national rivers authority <e> <s> why cannot he put that in and then we shall know what he is talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that in many of the boroughs where the need for youth service is at its very greatest for example brixton lambeth and tower hamlets the financing of it will be an almost impossible burden for those boroughs <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches see no reason whatsoever for changing the view that we held at committee stage and subsequently that this amendment should be accepted <e> <s> i find it very odd that any peculiarities expressed by miss richardson in another place should have influenced the noble lord lord campbell <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister surely does not think that it is a case of either/or <e> <s> one can do both <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond to the noble earl lord onslow <e> <s> surely we are not talking about letting large numbers of people come into this country <e> <s> we are talking about spouses and other family members which i understand means husbands wives and children <e> <s> there is a limit to the number of husbands wives and children that anyone can have so that we are concerned only with restricted numbers <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord lord renton will take note of the number of asian people who have come to this country and have increased the number of jobs very considerably <e>", "<cs> to some extent this argument about the european community is not the centre of our discussion <e> <s> we are talking about the ability of immigrants to this country to bring in their wives and children <e> <s> that is the heart of the argument <e> <s> the government either accept that it is desirable that those immigrants should not be separated from their wives and children or they are prepared to continue to exclude them <e> <s> it is in the interests of the family and i should have thought stability among the immigrant community to have their families with them as is normal and with all that that entails rather than for them to be separated <e> <s> that is the heart of this amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond to the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> it is true that when any resolution reaches this chamber there is very little that we can do about it <e> <s> however we are not legislating just for this chamber <e> <s> this will be the law which governs both houses when it goes through <e> <s> therefore if we believe that the affirmative resolution is valuable because of what can be done about it in the other place it is perfectly proper for us to move to put it in the bill as a whole <e>", "<cs> one could say the same thing about the whole process of the commons <e> <s> with the present majority and we will not go into the reasons why there is such a big majority one could say that the whole legislative process does not make sense <e>", "<cs> if that is so why do we have the two procedures if there is no difference between them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister what financial assistance is being given to women who want to take the back to nursing training programme <e> <s> is the minister aware that i was informed not long ago of one woman who had taken it and who had to pay all her own expenses <e> <s> surely this is no way in which to encourage people into a very under-staffed profession <e>", "<cs> my lords we recognise that in the application of the old regional development grants there has inevitably been a certain amount and perhaps a considerable amount of waste in that money has gone to organisations that would have gone ahead in any case and in some cases it has certainly not been used as well as wisely and as productively as it might have been <e> <s> we are certainly ready to consider changes in the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord apparently seems to have disposed of me will he answer my question about the complete absence of consultants in human resources particularly on the training side <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister answer a terribly important point <e> <s> companies will carry out a great deal of in-service training and i am sure that he wishes that to be so <e> <s> however they will need help if they are to carry out training on the job <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to ask the noble lord lord mottistone whether the cases that he has mentioned occurred before the introduction of ballots for strikes <e> <s> the introduction of the ballot which we all support surely alters the position substantially <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell us whether he accepts that the union should be able to discipline members who when the ballot has gone against a strike continue to strike <e> <s> will he be evenhanded on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the government will accept the amendment <e> <s> it is of great importance that unions should be given impartial and professional advice and that the people giving the advice are not swayed in any way by seeking or losing popularity with the members of the union <e> <s> that could well be the case if they were to stand for election <e> <s> their independence and the high quality of their advice is in the best interests of all of us <e>", "<cs> my lords as the mover of a similar amendment in committee i should like to thank the noble lord for accepting this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we should also like to support anything that clips the wings of the treasury <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i have not understood the minister <e> <s> i should like to ask <e>", "<cs> my lords had the noble baroness withdrawn the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the employment of the long-term unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also wish to thank the secretary of state for making the statement in the house this afternoon <e> <s> we have also frequently been critical of the government for selling the family silver <e> <s> we are even more critical of them for giving away the family silver even if on this occasion it is somewhat tarnished <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should also like to pay tribute to john grey <e> <s> we very strongly appreciate the work that is done by the clerks and realise how difficult it must often be to guide us in the direction in which we ought to go when our enthusiasms exceed the rules of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords as the judgment was announced in the press before the recess is it not rather peculiar that the minister saw it only on friday <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble earl will explain to us why he is so certain that after seven years one has acquired so many more commitments and be in so much greater need of consideration than after three years <e> <s> a man who lives in this country with his family and who is established here with his children at school and his wife possibly working has acquired residence after five years and all those circumstances are just as important after three years as they are after seven years <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister take into account the significance of the international baccalaureate in respect of this question <e> <s> can she say whether the proposed national curriculum will make it easier to qualify for that <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i am right in concluding from the answer which the noble baroness gave to my question that the national curriculum will make it more difficult for pupils to take the international baccalaureate <e> <s> that is a straight question perhaps i can have a straight answer <e>", "<cs> my lords before i commence my speech i should like to apologise to your lordships house that owing to circumstances totally beyond my control i was not able to be present to hear the very distinguished speeches this afternoon as i ought to have done since i am winding up from these benches <e>", "<cs> i do not retract what i said <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl accept that this matter is of the greatest urgency <e> <s> i speak as the chairman of the national council for carers <e> <s> the effect of removing people from institutions and dealing with those still inside is putting a heavy burden on people who are finding it difficult to handle such burdens <e> <s> we cannot delay <e>", "<cs> my lords i too must apologise for not having put down my name before the start of this debate and also for having compounded my offence by coming in a few moments after the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne had risen to his feet <e> <s> i must say that your lordships have got through todays programme with almost unprecedented speed <e> <s> i was extremely surprised to find that we had arrived at this part of todays business quite so soon <e> <s> i have no claim whatever to be knowledgeable on the subject of the aircraft industry in general or airbus in particular <e> <s> i once worked for the ministry for aircraft production but not in a technical capacity needless to say and it was a very long time ago <e>", "<cs> as a complete sassenach i enter this discussion with the greatest hesitation <e> <s> however unless scotland is far and away ahead of england and wales and i accept that that might well be the case i can only say that as the report by sir roy griffiths on community care has made plain already in england and wales the policy of returning people to the community from institutions has far outrun the provision being made in local areas for receiving <e>", "<cs> or scottish <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> like the noble lord lord joseph i am very much in favour of the objective of an improved level of education for all our children as i am sure we all are <e> <s> i also go a long way with the noble lord when he says that he wants the core subjects imposed <e> <s> however i cannot but believe that in practically every school those core subjects are already being taught and will continue to be taught without their being imposed <e> <s> i believe that this is almost a distinction without a difference between us <e> <s> no one is going to say that one should let loose into the world young people who are not competent in english maths and science <e> <s> whether there is the staff to carry out the obligations laid down in this bill is another matter which noble lords will discuss on another clause <e>", "<cs> i must interrupt the noble lord as he dragged me into his speech <e> <s> the noble lord has given away his own case <e> <s> he says that the gifted children would be given different subjects <e> <s> that is precisely what those of us pleading for flexibility should like to have <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but this is the third second reading speech that we have had this afternoon <e> <s> we have a great number of amendments to get through <e> <s> many of us have our names down to amendments to be taken later <e> <s> perhaps i may move that the noble lord be no longer heard <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble baroness <e> <s> she used a phrase that interested me <e> <s> she said that the secretary of state might wish to allow brighter pupils who had achieved the levels required before the age of to go on and study other subjects <e> <s> surely there will at least be flexibility when you have achieved the standard to do what you or the teachers choose that you should do rather than that the secretary of state might allow you to do it <e>", "<cs> i should like <e>", "<cs> i should like to suggest to the noble lord lord trafford that if your father happens to be alf garnett you would need rather a lot of education at school to counteract what you have learned at home <e>", "<cs> i am not surprised by that reply and i cease to be disappointed because i do not expect anything now <e> <s> as the noble baroness must know the fact remains that a great many members of the teaching profession are extremely disillusioned with this bill and the attitude of the government and some gesture of encouragement built into the bill would be of the greatest value <e> <s> however the government are adamant and it is quite clear that they are not giving anything away <e> <s> they believe that they are right although people all over the country are telling them that they are wrong <e> <s> however at this time of night i shall not divide the committee and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that we are in order to protest very strongly about the confusion in this committee <e> <s> i have been in the chamber since <e> <s> i have never heard such a muddle from start to finish <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to rehearse the arguments which we had earlier today and which both noble lords have put so ably <e> <s> i merely wish to say that i support the amendment very strongly indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i too like to thank the noble lord lord joesph for introducing this debate <e> <s> for two days running we on these benches have had reason to be grateful to the noble lord lord joseph <e> <s> we are grateful to him first and foremost for his frank presentation of the position on productivity in this country <e> <s> the secretary of state tells us he will forgive me for saying this repeatedly about the great increases in productivity <e> <s> what he tells us is of course true and much to be welcomed <e> <s> however the noble lord lord joseph put that into perspective when he emphasised how far there still was to go <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so the secretary of state was probably prompted into making that statement by the information that the noble lord lord joseph had already given us in some previous presentation <e> <s> we have not had the point made quite so clearly before <e> <s> it is valuable that it has been done today <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down perhaps i may say that i am afraid i am not passing the test <e> <s> i do not understand what she has told us <e> <s> what i wish to know because i am genuinely confused now and what a great many people want to know is simply this <e> <s> is she saying that she accepts diagnostic assessment provided they are looking at the criteria or are these little year-old children plus or minus a few months according to when in the calendar they were born going to sit something like an old-fashioned examination which some of us would have called an exam on a particular day <e> <s> that is what we want to know <e> <s> is the answer yes or no <e> <s> are the children going to be diagnostically assessed or are they going to be diagnostically assessed and given the test exam <e> <s> which is it to be <e> <s> i simply do not understand <e>", "<cs> did i understand the minister to say that some of the foundation subjects need not be <e>", "<cs> i want to assure the noble baroness that we are not trying to be difficult we are trying to get the matter clear <e> <s> the noble baroness said that the teachers will take a considerable part in it and that is reassuring to us <e> <s> however clause a says <e>", "<cs> that was such a long time ago and at such an appalling hour that i claim my right to debate the amendment again <e> <s> there can be no improvement in standards in schools unless the level of teaching is such that those standards can be reached <e> <s> there is no doubt that we are lacking today in teachers and equipment to teach the subjects which are prescribed in the bill <e> <s> it seems to us that it presents a false prospectus to parents and teachers to say that certain subjects are compulsory if at the same time there are not enough qualified teachers to teach those subjects <e> <s> the kingman report which has already been quoted today says specifically that of those teaching english in our schools per cent <e> <s> have no qualification above o-levels <e> <s> it has also been repeatedly said that something like per cent <e> <s> of those teaching mathematics have no proper qualifications <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness said that the local education authority would have an advisory role <e> <s> perhaps she could spell that out <e> <s> if by that she simply means that the local authority could make a few suggestions which the secretary of state can then override that will not take us much further but perhaps she has something else in mind <e>", "<cs> the bill says quite clearly each of the foundation subjects but the minister said core subjects <e> <s> what are we talking about <e>", "<cs> even if it were a misunderstanding the bill refers to foundation subjects <e> <s> we really do have to come back again and again to what the bill says because that is all we are interested in <e> <s> we do not mind very much what it is but we would like to know <e>", "<cs> this is the committee stage of a bill which is going to become an act of parliament <e> <s> it is really not good enough to be told that the government will make up their mind after the committee stage when we have no more opportunity to amend it in detail and will then tell us what they want in the bill <e> <s> we are putting a potential act of parliament through this chamber and we should know what is in the governments mind now not at a later stage <e>", "<cs> what is the point of having the two words <e> <s> if that is the position there is no difference between the two words <e> <s> why have core and foundation <e>", "<cs> i find the answer extremely unsatisfactory once again <e> <s> however i shall read <e>", "<cs> with all due respect to both the noble lord and the noble baroness there is nothing in the amendment about whether members are representative <e> <s> it is simply a question of the number of people on the councils <e>", "<cs> we too are extremely concerned that the noble baroness should turn down the amendment in this way and should claim that the fact that the secretary of state is to make all the appointments personally will ensure that the councils are independent <e> <s> i have to tell the noble baroness that that really gives me absolutely no assurance whatsoever on that matter <e> <s> how are we to know that the secretary of state will not appoint all his cousins and his sisters and his aunts which is perfectly possible under the bill as it stands <e> <s> what guarantee is there that because he appoints the members personally it will be an independent council <e> <s> that is a most astonishing statement <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we really are in a great state of confusion about the difference between core and foundation <e> <s> the noble baroness has just this minute said that welsh is a foundation subject but clause says that it is a core subject <e> <s> is it just possibly true that there is no difference between core and foundation <e> <s> if that is so we had better say so and get it put into the bill <e>", "<cs> but the noble baroness told me not so long ago that all the foundation subjects had to be continued until pupils were <e> <s> that is another distinction between the two which has apparently gone <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene very briefly <e> <s> my knowledge of parental choice is strictly <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment and also amendment no <e> <s> which is tabled in my name <e> <s> there is no question but that the need for adult education provision increases not decreases and any change in the availability of accommodation in schools which has an adverse effect on the availability of adult education would be extremely unwise at present <e> <s> we are constantly pressing the need for making provision for the less well educated and the less successful <e> <s> as we understand it that is what lies behind this bill <e>", "<cs> i believe the noble baroness said the draft notes being drawn up by the department will deal with this matter <e> <s> we are getting that answer rather often <e> <s> it would be very much more reassuring if the legislation made it clear that the department was expected to draft something along those lines <e> <s> we are being asked to take on trust that the department will do the right thing <e> <s> we should much prefer to have a general indication in the bill that required it to do so <e> <s> after all it is still parliament and not the civil service which decides what should be done in this country <e>", "<cs> the committee will not be surprised to hear that i find the ministers answer very unsatisfactory <e> <s> she is committed to this total support of parental choice regardless as if there were only one consideration to take into account <e> <s> she repeats that with every amendment that is put <e>", "<cs> we want to be told in quite plain english because that is what we are concerned with that the nursery classes will not get pushed out <e> <s> let us not use the language of the bill <e> <s> we want to be sure that nursery classes will remain whatever is done with standard numbers and in particular that they will be there when the primary numbers start rising again which they will <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for putting the matter in a much more conciliatory way than i did <e> <s> i must say to the noble baroness lady hooper please do not tell us that it will all be in the regulations <e> <s> in this particular matter we need something on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> we do not quarrel with the idea of financial management but with the speed of introduction <e> <s> i am only trying to save time <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble lord is right <e> <s> will he tell us what his belief is based on <e> <s> it is good to know that he has such faith but it would be nice to have it backed up by facts <e>", "<cs> from what the noble lord has told the committee i hope that this will be additional money from the centre and not a reallocation of already allocated resources because that is a trick with which we have become all too familiar <e> <s> i am glad to have the noble lords assurance that this is new money <e> <s> it is quite impossible to know whether that amount of new money will be just about right too much or too little <e> <s> one suspects that it will be too little but at least it is good to have an assurance that there will positively be new money which in itself is a recognition of the need to provide these services <e> <s> that seems to me to be at least a step in the right direction <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed that the minister is not prepared to incorporate the words into the bill <e> <s> we said earlier in this session when he was not with us that we would be very much more reassured by finding these essential items on the face of the bill and not merely in circulars and recommendations <e> <s> once they are on the face of the bill people who feel that they are not properly dealt with are in a much stronger position to raise an issue <e>", "<cs> i too should like briefly to support these amendments <e>", "<cs> the minister made the extraordinary suggestion that as matters stand the board of governors could appoint staff without consultation with the head teacher <e> <s> i cannot imagine anything more ridiculous <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has missed the point <e> <s> it is not just being or not being a member of the board of governors the head teacher in her role as head teacher and not because she is a member of the board of governors should be consulted and involved in all these decisions <e>", "<cs> i very much want to support what has been said from these benches and the caveat from the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> i hope that the government fully realise how important community groups are with the variety of work carried out by the voluntary bodies on which we rely increasingly and how valuable they are to the people who take part in such activities <e> <s> without access to free or nearly free accommodation a great many of these groups would never be able to start and many of those which have started would fade away <e> <s> therefore i hope that the government will agree to the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not find that answer satisfactory in the least <e> <s> the noble baroness is <e>", "<cs> may i ask for clarification <e> <s> technically under financial delegation who will be the employer of the teacher or non-teaching staff <e> <s> with whom will the contract of employment be made <e> <s> will it be the local authority which does the actual paying or with the school <e> <s> this is of extreme relevance to the point made by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the last thing i want to do is argue this matter at this time of night but the minister has said that the amendment is not compatible with the authority necessary for the governing body under local financial management <e> <s> what she has not answered because it has not been thought out is how <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord beloff is skilful at defending the indefensible <e> <s> he is underlining the fact that the powers of the secretary of state in this matter are once again very considerable and that there is a greater concentration of power in the hands of the secretary of state than many of us are prepared to accept <e> <s> it has been denied that the bill gives more powers to the secretary of state <e> <s> this is a good example of the way in which it does <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will not have forgotten that that was obtained in the london parents ballot <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support this amendment to which i have appended my name <e> <s> those of us who have had experience of students sitting on governing bodies and sub-committees know that they make a very valuable addition <e> <s> it helps the non-student members to have some idea of what is going on whether or not it is totally representative and it has a very good educative effect for the young people concerned <e> <s> i hope that this modest suggestion of one student governor will be accepted by the committee <e>", "<cs> i think the minister somewhat gave the game away when he used the analogy of the doctor to cure <e> <s> the assumption is that the secretary of state always knows best <e> <s> there is nothing written into these amendments to allow anyone to challenge his decision that the school governors are not acting properly <e> <s> it is a one-sided arbitrary decision that can be made by the secretary of state with no rights of challenge <e> <s> i do not think that the present secretary of state would be likely to do this and to act in an arbitrary way because he disapproved of the views or experimental interests and approach of the existing board of governors or for any other reason <e> <s> i do not wish to drag in names but if the secretary of state was mr ken livingstone would the minister have the same confidence that the secretary of state would never intervene with a governing body behaving in a way which did not conform with the kind of approach to education that he might wish to introduce <e>", "<cs> in addition to that i should like to make a point to the minister so that he can perhaps comment on both questions in his reply <e> <s> as i understand it the rights of appeal are largely centred on the failure to be admitted or being wrongfully removed from the school whereas there can be other matters about which parents feel strongly the way the curriculum is being covered the behaviour of the staff or the physical standards of the school <e> <s> one could think of a whole range of issues in the actual running of the school about which parents may wish to make complaints <e> <s> we want to be satisfied that if they feel something is serious it can be taken up as a matter of bad administration through the commissioner <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord that the vast majority of these cases will be dealt with in <e>", "<cs> the noble lords enthusiasm for the sweetness of human nature is very unexpected <e> <s> he has not given us any sound grounds for believing that we shall be sharing that faith with him <e> <s> as i understand it the whole point of the amendment is that there are now arrangements between some local authority schools and some schools which will become grant maintained where they share playing field arrangements gymnasiums use of language labs and so on by agreement <e> <s> that is very sensible and economical <e>", "<cs> too much sweetness and light for the world in general but not enough by half to us <e>", "<cs> the noble lord does not understand the principle <e> <s> this has nothing whatever to do with proportional representation <e>", "<cs> i find that a most extraordinary answer <e> <s> the minister says that this is freedom <e> <s> freedom is also the freedom rationally to change your mind on occasions especially if the circumstances change and the position is quite different from that in which you made up your mind in the first place <e> <s> i remind the noble lord that if it is necessary to have more than per cent <e> <s> of all the parents entitled to vote he now understands what that means it cannot be undertaken lightly because he would need to have the consent of that proportion of all the parents <e>", "<cs> the government are incurably perverse so far as concerns this bill <e> <s> the minister has made it quite clear that the position can be very confused <e> <s> of course the right course of action depends very considerably on the amendment which the minister agreed to take back and look at which concerns whether it is to be one vote for one child and therefore only one parent <e> <s> if that is to be the case and surely common sense dictates that it must be one can foresee all manner of difficulties about who can claim to be a parent <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister recognises i am sure that she does the importance of teaching staff in making the schemes work <e> <s> if teaching staff see this list of groups of people who have such a right and they are not included on it they are bound to feel that they are not being given the same kind of consideration accorded to the groups mentioned on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> what is not clear from the ministers reply is whether the voluntary organisations have any rights in the matter <e> <s> i understand him to say that the government would expect and encourage the grant-maintained schools to continue the kind of obligation that existed before they became grant-maintained <e> <s> i will read carefully what the minister said but i did not understand him to say in his reply that they would be in any position to demand that they should have access or continue the access which they have already <e> <s> they are very much suppliants are they not <e> <s> under the new scheme <e>", "<cs> in view of the ministers comments i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i may perhaps bring it forward at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i very much hope we shall support what the right reverend prelate has said <e> <s> he has been working on this problem for a long time he knows far better than any of us what the complexities of this issue are <e>", "<cs> my lords we are glad to hear this announcement from the leader of the house and we thank him for repeating it <e> <s> there is no doubt that for those who are actively engaged in the house the work continues outside the normal days of sitting <e> <s> it is therefore very desirable that there should be this extra payment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down will he clarify a point which is not clear to me although perhaps it should be and which also arises in connection with the contribution made by the right reverend prelate the bishop of manchester <e> <s> in amendment no <e> <s> tabled by the noble baroness lady cox she says specifically <e>", "<cs> i should like to respond to the noble baroness lady blatch although she is no longer in her place <e> <s> it seems quite extraordinary to suggest that in a foundation subject children should be means tested for that is what it amounts to for the wherewithal in order to study the subject <e> <s> where does one stop if one starts means testing for the equipment for a foundation subject <e> <s> i cannot imagine <e>", "<cs> i want to speak very briefly in support of this amendment and emphasise the importance of the strategic role in the new situation in which we find ourselves as a result of the developments in the msc <e> <s> if the msc plans for the yts second year are to be successful they must be developed in close co-operation with the colleges <e> <s> the colleges have to be able to make a strategic plan and the provision which is required if the yts year two is to be successful should be clearly in those plans <e> <s> the leas should be able to forward the plans as they had originally intended <e>", "<cs> i was not intending to intervene in the discussion <e> <s> however this is a matter of considerable importance to a large number of people <e> <s> i am not entirely clear as to the the governments thinking <e> <s> why is it necessary for the secretary of state to decide the matter <e> <s> in a changing scene at local level we are encouraging more employers to send people for part-time education on day release <e> <s> they should be going to colleges for that day release <e> <s> it is highly desirable that such programmes should develop quickly <e> <s> what is the objection to a local authority saying it believes that a certain college can best serve the local community and meet local demands through being able to develop as a tertiary college <e> <s> why should that matter go to the secretary of state <e> <s> i cannot see that anything is gained other than delay by putting that matter to the secretary of state when a local authority local employers and local people have decided that that is what they want <e>", "<cs> we are not satisfied with those answers <e> <s> the government do not seem to appreciate the fluidity of the position or the importance of getting the matter right in line with their own policies in other directions <e> <s> i do not wish to keep harping on the importance of part-time education <e> <s> however the whole programme for training to year-olds will fall unless there is good part-time education available <e> <s> much depends on the success of that phase of the governments plan <e> <s> the tertiary colleges <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i very much want to agree with the government in wishing to keep the representational element <e> <s> colleges are essentially places in which it is the staff who determine whether the colleges will be successfully run and will meet their primary objective which is to provide good courses and good research <e> <s> there is a tendency at the present time to overdo the managerial element in the running of colleges and not to recognise sufficiently that unless the staff have a very considerable say on a collegiate basis in the way the institutions are run those institutions will suffer very severely <e> <s> i am very glad indeed to hear that the government intend to keep the representational element for the staff and for the students <e> <s> that is essential in the running of the college <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i do not feel that the government have catered for this in the way described by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> community interests will not necessarily be represented either through the people who come in under the classification of industrial commercial or professional or through the local authorities <e>", "<cs> i think the noble and learned lord has concentrated too much on the issue of the confidence of the student coming into the group of mature people <e> <s> he may not be over impressed by the mature people in fact students were not always so in my experience <e> <s> however the much more important point is when a student is party to a board decision which is an unpopular one <e> <s> that is a most <e>", "<cs> is what it means this that if there is this change there are certain rights that the employee would have had if there had been a detrimental change in his conditions <e> <s> are there certain rights which he would have had but which he forfeits <e> <s> is that what the subsection means <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask what sounds to be a stupid question <e> <s> we are told that the body will deal with general principles <e> <s> i am not sure what that means when it comes to acting on a body <e> <s> there are not many general principles and once they have been laid down i do not see what the members of the body will do <e> <s> if they do not have enough to do they will start interfering in things that are not general principles <e> <s> are we clear as to what the provision means <e> <s> members of the body will deal with general principles and the other people will do the work <e> <s> may we know what members will do on this body as regards general principles <e>", "<cs> i shall refrain from making a long speech but there are questions i wish to ask the noble baroness and i shall limit myself to asking questions <e> <s> if it is so urgent that these measures should be carried out because the state of ilea is so bad why and we have had no answer to this was

may say to the noble lord before he says too much about disagreements on these benches i find them hard to identify that he should take note of the number of occasions during recent weeks when very distinguished members of his party including eight secretaries of state put down amendments criticising the governments proposed legislation <e>", "<cs> i speak as an ignoramus on matters of local

through <e> <s> they are highly controversial and a great many of their provisions are very badly drafted <e> <s> it is not good enough for the noble lord to put the blame on the opposition parties

that the government had presented this house with two absolutely outsize bills to run concurrently and it is quite unreasonable for them to complain when there is delay that the fault lies with the opposition parties <e>", "<cs> my lords as instructed i shall be brief but i want to emphasise two matters in particular <e> <s> one is the total irrationallity and unfairness of asking the teaching profession to teach a curriculum if there is not adequate provision of teachers equipment and resources generally <e> <s> there should be no compulsion on the schools to deliver unless the materials are there to make it possible so to do <e> <s> it cannot be right to ask the education world to make bricks without straw <e>", "<cs> my lords as we are in the business of clarification and definition

two different things <e> <s> however they are nowhere defined in the bill nor are we clear what differentiates a core from a foundation <e> <s> it may be an academic point but given two different terms any court of law will say that parliament must have intended a difference i think i am right in saying that otherwise it would not have used two different terms <e> <s> by what criteria does a core become a core and by what criteria does a foundation become a foundation <e> <s> will the minister please tell us <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the chief whip for making that timely statement and also for the acceptance of the fact that there was a very long debate on religious education which was largely conducted between the bishops bench and the back bench of the conservative party which

the great powers that the secretary of state has taken to himself <e> <s> the councils represent a way of feeding into the secretary of state the views of people who do not necessarily share the views of the secretary of state <e> <s> they can therefore bring fresh air into his discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendments most strongly <e> <s> following on from what i said earlier the value of the councils is their independence from the secretary of state for the reasons already mentioned <e> <s> they will inspire no confidence whatever in the general public if the people appointed are seen to be clones of the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i am totally unconvinced by what the minister said <e> <s> he admits that there is a grave misunderstanding as he calls it let us hope that he is right in calling it that about the implications of clause and that people fear that there will be a degree of regimentation <e> <s> given that we have been told this evening that the national curriculum council will be comprised of people hand picked by the secretary of state this will not give confidence to the professionals who hope that independent opinions will be given to the secretary of state <e> <s> it is all the more important therefore that there should be on the face of the bill the reassurance that experimentation of this kind is permitted <e> <s> it can do no harm it could do good <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord morton but with considerable regret <e> <s> i had hoped that after the points which were raised rather late one night at committee stage about the problem with which this attempts to deal the government would produce an amendment

promotion of good race relations <e> <s> i entirely share the feelings of the noble lord lord beloff about the burnage report <e> <s> i too wish that it could be published as soon as possible <e> <s>

cluster of people are claiming to be a parent and each is clambering for a vote surely as in the french elections we should let them have a run-off as to who is to be the chosen candidate <e> <s> that

of a school is of paramount importance to the teachers <e> <s> surely in terms of morale and heaven knows morale in the teaching profession wants a bit of a boost for that interest to be recognised on

really not reconsider <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to say from these benches how seriously we take this whole question <e> <s> there is something farcical about all of us sitting here night

should like to know whether there are any facts that indicate that there has been a drop in truancy since its introduction <e> <s> i think it would be more to the point if we were to be given some facts rather than statements of belief <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches do not like the ctcs <e> <s> we have made that quite clear and i hope that will relieve the mind of the noble lord lord peston <e> <s> however if we are to have them we would rather have them as colleges of art and technology than as purely colleges of technology <e> <s> we would rather not do it this way at all but to

phrase includes adult education as normally understood or an appropriate form of words which i shall not try to produce now that would be altogether a different matter <e> <s> however she has not answered the point which is of the greatest urgency and importance that everybody has accepted that there has been no statutory obligation to provide adult education as it has normally been understood <e> <s> if that is not the intention of the noble baroness then it would be extremely helpful if this were made clear on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i strongly support the amendments <e> <s> it is very important that nothing should be done to stop or to make more difficult the development of tertiary colleges <e> <s> the amendments are not in any way an attack on sixth form colleges <e> <s> however they express our belief that tertiary colleges have a great deal to offer a great many people <e> <s> youngsters leaving school at the age of often feel they wish to mix in the more adult world of the tertiary college <e> <s> those of us who are in contact with them will know that they very often say that the mixture of people on part-time courses studying all manner of things which youngsters may not be aware of when they leave school can be revealing and stimulating <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an entirely scottish campaign but perhaps i may say that i support the amendment not least because in the house and elsewhere we english spend a great deal too much time on scottish affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord alport <e> <s> what we are really considering is not the goodness or otherwise of the ilea it is the goodness of the education provided for londons children <e> <s> the importance of ilea is the extent to which it contributes and can continue to contribute or not to the good quality of london education <e> <s> that is what it is all about <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that the noble baroness feels no such thing <e> <s> the brief contained no answer to the points that i raised <e> <s> i must therefore divide the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support this amendment <e> <s> i have already spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble baroness giving way <e> <s> is she not aware that for children of school age it is the lea that provides the <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house the noble baroness said with reference to the careers service that it was the responsibility of the department of employment <e> <s> for children of school age it is an lea responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down again this means of course the department and not the secretary of state <e> <s> will she tell us why she thinks that the department is competent to make these decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords there is another argument about consistency <e> <s> if as the noble lord lord renton said an important part of the process is breeding for sale overseas surely this is more akin to industry than to agriculture and should be treated as an industrial and not an agricultural interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble baroness said that some people might be tempted to move because they would receive p extra when they went into a new area <e> <s> as one who is involved in moving at the moment i can tell her that it will take a long life to pay the cost of the moving <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> over the past years we in this country have built up a solid basis of research to underpin our social policy <e> <s> we see the effect in such useful government publications as <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches wish also to thank the noble lord for repeating the statement on this very important report <e> <s> we should like to add our congratulations to lord justice butler-sloss on the work that she has done which i think will command great admiration everywhere for its skill and thoroughness in an extremely difficult situation <e> <s> it must have been a very difficult job both intellectually and emotionally to tackle the inquiry and report <e> <s> we should like to pay a tribute to her <e>", "<cs> my lords even though i should like to express my support for the amendment i do not wish to detain the house <e> <s> this is obviously not a party political point <e> <s> however as i understood it last time it was perfectly possible for one child to be represented by four votes and another child to be represented by one vote <e> <s> in any sane world that is alice in <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add a few remarks <e> <s> when i inadvertently spoke out of turn previously because i thought we were moving all these amendments together i said that there should be only two votes for the child <e> <s> the minister answered me by saying that by my logic if there were four children the single parent would get four votes <e> <s> i put it to the minister that it is four childrens education we are talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware of the balance of knowledge on educational matters on this side of the house in comparison with the balance of knowledge on educational matters on his side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords we are also deeply concerned about the accumulation of powers in the hands of the secretary of state in this bill and the excessive centralisation which goes with it <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should also like to protest <e> <s> the whole handling of the bill has in our view been extremely unsatisfactory and this is just a culmination of a very bad phase <e>", "<cs> my lords i deeply regret the reply of the noble baroness <e> <s> the adult education world does not understand the position as she has described it <e> <s> it would have given the greatest support to it if she had confirmed what she believes to be the case by writing it into the bill <e> <s> however at this time of night i am not proposing to press the amendment although i would dearly like to <e> <s> i must with the greatest regret and it will be widely regretted throughout the adult education world withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble baroness trusts in vain <e> <s> i am not in the least reassured <e> <s> it needs only one or two boroughs not to co-operate and some of these services research for one will be wrecked <e> <s> if one or two boroughs do not pay or pay inadequately then the research findings will be of very little value <e> <s> i am sure that most noble lords opposite understand that <e> <s> i shall not waste the time of the house <e> <s> i shall divide straight away <e>", "<cs> my lords let me briefly say that we from these benches wish to give our full support to the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches first wish to say that we appreciate that this bill has put a very great burden upon the noble baroness lady hooper <e> <s> we respect and admire her stamina and her good temper <e> <s> i believe that very few of us could have kept our tempers as well as she has done throughout the long days and nights on this bill <e> <s> i hope that in what i am about to say she will take it from me that it is in no way a personal criticism <e> <s> i am hound to say that i found the passage of this bill through this house a deeply disappointing experience <e>", "<cs> my lords but if interest rates lead to an increase in the mortgage rate and that feeds through to the retail prices index and then through into wage claims how will the government prevent wage pressure which will be highly inflationary <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that we on these benches are very glad to hear him confirm his acceptance of our membership of the common market and of the obligations that go with it <e> <s> will he also answer think he did not the question that came from my noble friend or it may have been the noble lord lord williams on these other conditions that british aerospace is considering to which he referred in his statement <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches arc very glad to welcome the governments acceptance of the amendment of the noble lord lord hayter <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a fairly technical point but it surely must be right that where a doctor is going to do something which can have serious implications such as registering a person as severely mentally disabled it should he done by someone fully qualified in the area in question <e> <s> medical training being what it is that cannot be said of all general practitioners <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that there should be some relationship to capacity to pay <e> <s> although we have not been able to have this included in the bill in general to the extent that the amendment involves a relationship to capacity to pay we support it <e>", "<cs> my lords with very little hope that the noble earl will agree i shall make one last attempt at shifting him <e> <s> considering the present state of our prisons it is ridiculous to continue and even <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt and i suspect that i am out of order <e> <s> however it must be apparent to the noble earls scottish soul that it is more sensible to get someone to do some work in the community in exchange for not paying the poll tax than to send him to prison which places a heavy burden on the community <e> <s> presumably he is thinking about money <e> <s> in that case his argument seems most extraordinary <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to echo what the noble lord lord mcintosh has said about the way in which the noble earl lord caithness has handled the bill from the government benches <e> <s> there is no doubt that he is a listening minister a compliment that i do not always pay to government spokesmen but he does listen <e> <s> on a number of occasions he has heard what has been said by the opposition has taken back the suggestions and has come back though not always of course agreeing mostly not agreeing <e> <s> the list of changes which have been made as a result of debate in this house is a tribute both to the way the noble earl has handled the bill and to the way in which your lordships house works <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for the noble lord lord ross of newport who is unable to be here tonight <e> <s> i am standing in for him <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene to remind the noble lord lord st john of fawsley that nineteenth century liberals did not always take the view that he expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords in considering his original answer will the noble lord not agree that the interests of the ratepayers which i believe was the phrase he used does not necessarily exclusively mean the immediate financial interests <e> <s> they may have an interest also which they have not been asked to express about what becomes of historic buildings of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches are not in favour of this compromise which the government have put forward <e> <s> the proposal about the ballot still makes it possible that it could get through on per cent <e> <s> plus one <e> <s> that for what is an irreversible decision we think is nowhere near enough <e> <s> if the government had been prepared to make the decision reversible this might be a different matter <e> <s> but we are forced to believe and this is confirmed by the report coming from the centre for policy studies this morning that the government are determined to have grant-maintained schools and to undermine the position of local authorities in relation to education <e> <s> that being so we are extremely unwilling to accept this compromise <e> <s> after all the second ballot could be done on a very small number of people indeed <e> <s> so i am afraid that we cannot accept the advice put forward by the right reverend prelate the bishop of london <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we strongly support the noble baroness lady young in the amendments that she hopes to bring forward <e> <s> i am extremely glad to hear that she intends to pursue them later in whatever way is open to her <e> <s> we on these benches have been unswerving in our support of the development of the ec since the days of the treaty of rome <e> <s> i do not believe that anyone else in this house can say the same <e> <s> we are also unswerving in our support for the improvement of education opportunities <e>", "<cs> i want strongly and briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> i am president of the national council for carers and their elderly dependants and i am very well aware of the problems which arise over succession in these cases as the noble lord lord dean has said <e> <s> people who take on caring and move in with their parents or elderly relations in order to do so make a very great personal sacrifice <e> <s> it is a severe hardship if they cannot then succeed to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may raise a question for genuine information related to the return to us by the commons of this amendment <e> <s> we are told that the commons reject it because the amendment affects local taxation <e> <s> i am extremely confused as to the criteria on which the commons turned down our amendment on the ground that it affects local taxation <e> <s> i should have thought a great many of the matters we have been discussing throughout this long cold summer have affected local taxation in the field of education and many other fields <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us how this is done <e>", "<cs> my lords let us go onwards from to the finance bill of <e> <s> as i was partially responsible for raising the storm yesterday it is reasonable that we should have the consequences today <e>", "<cs> my lords when i sat down i remembered that it was the other thing that i wanted to say <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for giving way <e> <s> on a point of information i believe he said that tenants would be chased up by the electoral reform society <e> <s> that seems to me to be very odd <e> <s> surely the electoral reform society as the impartial handler of the vote would not be in a position to chase up voters <e> <s> i very much doubt whether it has the staff to chase up voters <e> <s> is what the noble earl said really correct <e>", "<cs> the ministers analogy with a trade union is a false one <e> <s> it is fine for a trade union as such to pay the electoral reform society it is not right for one of the contestants to do so <e> <s> that is the difference <e> <s> in this case <e> <s> one of the competitors pays the electoral reform society <e> <s> it is the union as a whole that pays not mr scargill against whatever his name was <e> <s> it would have been extraordinary if it had been mr scargill who paid the electoral reform society <e> <s> the minister is proposing that mr scargill should pay the electoral reform society <e> <s> the whole of this bench would object to that <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the noble earl on this question of assured tenancies <e> <s> is it not the case that they are only assured if the tenants can pay the increase in rent which the landlord is entitled to introduce after a short period of time <e> <s> that is assured in inverted commas if i may say so <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to ask him for the sake of my education whether he is speaking for his party when he expresses those views <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that the noble lord is too trusting as regards the behaviour of officials <e> <s> those of us who have experience at a lower level know that the doubts that he expresses can be justified <e> <s> in my own experience i recall a case where the writer of a report was told by the officials that they did not much like it <e> <s> the author then asked have you read it <e> <s> to which the official under pressure was ultimately forced to reply no <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say if an englishwoman dare intervene on such an occasion that it seems to me to be an extremely important amendment which raises a very difficult point indeed <e> <s> the minister said that the headmaster was advisory to the board <e> <s> it seems to me that it is the board that should be advisory to the headmaster because if the headmaster is answerable to the local authority then at the end of the day the local authority is the body which he must obey <e> <s> he cannot obey two masters <e> <s> if the board does not agree with what the local authority wants what does the headmaster do <e> <s> the board gives its views and tells the headmaster surely it advises the headmaster that these are matters that he should take into account <e> <s> the headmaster cannot be responsible to both bodies <e> <s> those of us who have been involved in organisational questions know that one will be creating an absolute mares nest for the headmaster <e> <s> surely the board advises him it is not the other way round <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches are grateful to the secretary of state for making this statement but we are handicapped by the fact that we have not seen the actual report and have only the statement no doubt a correct statement but we do not know how full a statement from the secretary of state <e> <s> we understand that the report will be fully published although there is a reference to certain omissions for legal reasons <e> <s> we should like to know how extensive those omissions will be when the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord saying that the sum total of decisions by consumers in this country necessarily adds up to what is best for the economy as a whole <e> <s> surely there is a strong argument for saying that the balance of payments deficit is largely as a result of too much credit and too much money in peoples pockets <e> <s> while i am on my feet may i through the minister inform the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that most regrettably the noble viscount lord hanworth went somewhere else <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble earl <e> <s> unless i have misunderstood him does he realise that what he said very much encourages people when they split up to go straight for divorce proceedings when there might well be a possibility of reconciliation if they did not have to take such action at that time <e> <s> surely that is the effect of what he said one can only attain ones rights if one starts legal proceedings <e> <s> i thought that the best practice was to encourage people to have a period during which they can attempt reconciliation but this procedure works in the opposite direction does it not <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount accept that the financing of students is a serious issue <e> <s> will not the governments proposals on fees and on the question of loans make this position very much more difficult <e> <s> as the government are so keen to encourage industry to make a bigger contribution to higher education and indeed of many other good causes will he look again at the system under which scholarship funds set up by companies to help their employees children to go to university are taxed <e> <s> that used not to be the case <e> <s> in line with their policy of urging industry to spend money on causes such as this can the government consider whether that tax position could not again be reviewed <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble lord what he meant when he said that the governments objection to the amendment of the noble lord lord banks which was carried in the house was tautological <e> <s> what did he really mean <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the point that we must not diminish the stock of houses which have been specially equipped very expensively for disabled people <e> <s> is there any way whereby a disabled person could buy a house and the local authority would have the right to buy it back when that person died rather than it passing to his heirs who may be fully able-bodied <e> <s> the local authority would therefore be able to take full advantage of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the noble earl to think again about that <e> <s> by definition the effect of this act will be that there will be far less local authority housing available than there has been in the past and <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government prepared to take notice of the differential performance of girls and boys in mathematics and of the urgent need to bring pressure to bear to improve girls performance if they are to have any hope of playing a part in the economy in future <e>", "<cs> my lords based on previous statistics can the minister tell us how many of those people now held on remand are not expected to receive a custodial sentence <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl agree that one is just as cold if one is homeless but not within the definition in the act as under such definition <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that it does not matter that we were losing out in the share of world markets if our volume of exports is rising <e> <s> does that not bode ill for our future competitive position because it must mean that our competitors are doing even better <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl again consider the reply he gave to the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> a great many of us are extremely concerned about the increase in crime especially among young people <e> <s> we know that the age at which there is a serious likelihood of crime being committed has fallen and that has extremely serious implications <e> <s> the minister should again consider what the noble lord lord mishcon said <e> <s> at the same time i ask the minister to consider better aftercare provision for young people on completion of custodial sentences <e> <s> it makes the greatest possible difference if there is adequate aftercare <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also wish to thank the noble viscount for repeating the statement <e> <s> we do not take a doctrinaire view of the question of loans for students but our test is whether in fact it will have the effect of increasing access to higher education for a larger proportion of the population than at present <e> <s> of course that means increasing access for people from working class families especially social classes four and five who are greatly unrepresented in the universities at present <e> <s> it also means increasing access for women and girls and also for mature students <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount has not answered my question about the repayment <e> <s> if at no time people reach a high or adequate level of earning in order to repay the loan is the debt ever cancelled <e> <s> do they carry the debt to the grave <e> <s> that is the point i am trying to get at <e>", "<cs> my lords the griffiths report is a very short report <e> <s> can the minister tell us how <e>", "<cs> my lords in many ways this has been a curious debate <e> <s> it is largely an amalgam of a debate on the environment and a debate on the economy <e> <s> as my noble friend lord ezra said the two are linked but they are of such great importance that we surely need more time than we have had to do justice to both subjects <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that the noble viscount and i are very far apart <e> <s> i am trying to make the point that we distract our attention by separating them so much when in fact they are interlocking <e> <s> i certainly take the point made by the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my lords having spoken for minutes i do not think that i would like to comment on that <e> <s> the productivity rates are very much better <e> <s> i should say that under the labour government there was a great deal of concealed unemployment which we needed to get rid of and we have <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will forgive me <e> <s> i shall not give him a lecture on the matter now but the institute of fiscal studies will be very glad to correct his views about that <e>", "<cs> my lords first i apologise to the house and in particular to the noble earl lord ferrers that i shall be unable to stay throughout the debate <e> <s> before i knew that i wanted to take part in it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord gave us the overall figures of posts that have been transferred <e> <s> can he give us the percentage of the total strength of the civil service that has been transferred <e> <s> the global figure does not tell us very much in terms of progress <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister gave me the percentage figure for jobs in the region <e> <s> what i asked for was the percentage which had been transferred <e> <s> that is what we are interested in how many are being moved out of london <e> <s> we know that there are many jobs in the regions <e> <s> what percentage has been transferred from the centre to the regions <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister include in the list of exemptions people who are being looked after with great difficulty by their families in their own homes <e> <s> if the government do not give more assistance soon and if on top of everything else such people have to find the poll tax to pay for those whom they are looking after they will break and it could well be the last straw <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not in the least wish to delay the house but in making his statement the noble lord said as is so often said from the government front bench that he was confident and that he believed <e> <s> in fact he made assertions <e> <s> we are always hearing assertions of faith from the front bench <e> <s> it is the noble thing to do but it does not give us the reasons or the facts to back up the faith <e> <s> can he tell us why and what his evidence is that all will be well in the future and not merely that he has faith that all will be well <e> <s> i fear that our faith wears a little thin <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to know what is the evidence about them having done well <e> <s> if the noble lord were to say that such-and-such a research foundation gave up a levy and since this and this has happened that would be credible <e> <s> merely to be told that they have done well does not tell us anything <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that family credit is paid to the man whereas an enormous advantage of child benefit is that it is the woman who receives it <e> <s> unless she receives it quite a lot of the money will never go to help the children <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that it is in the cases where it most needs to go to the mother that it is elected that it should go to the father <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say what improvements have been made in the training of counter staff who have the very difficult job of face-to-face relationships with people who are often very disturbed and anxious <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also wish to thank the noble baroness for repeating the statement <e> <s> however we wish to ask her a number of questions <e> <s> according to the press discussions have been going on between the department of health and the ministry of agriculture for a number of years long before this particular incident arose about the whole question of salmonella and health <e> <s> we are given to believe the noble baroness may be able to contradict this that there have been interdepartmental conflicts on this matter from which the general public is now apparently suffering severely <e> <s> can the noble baroness tell us when the discussions first started to take place because that must mean that there were people in authority who long before these recent incidents were already anxious about the whole question of salmonella <e>", "<cs> my lords called is what i have in my document <e> <s> i cannot imagine a more entertaining sight that million hens called <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness really telling me that there was no discussion and no anxiety about salmonella until this summer <e> <s> that is not what is alleged in the press <e> <s> is she refuting all those press statements <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord lord renton consider himself safe against salmonella <e> <s> i think the people who have had it are the only ones who are safe to eat eggs <e>", "<cs> my lords if the answer to the question which the noble baroness put to me is no i would not have informed the public health service what she is telling us is that the position is very much worse than we thought <e>", "<cs> we also wish to support these amendments <e> <s> but in response to the very interesting point just made by the noble baroness lady faithfull as regards a national plan i should say that many of us have been pressing for a very long time for an extension of nursery provision <e> <s> however would the noble baroness and the noble lord not agree that though a national plan should be drawn up in terms of a declared policy and standards the application and the responsibility must be carried out by local authorities at local level and within the framework of the plan <e> <s> it is surely not being argued that responsibility should be taken away from the local authorities as regards carrying out the plan <e> <s> it sounded rather as if that was what the noble baroness lady faithfull was asking for <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell us what progress has been made in the work of the national council for vocational qualifications <e> <s> i am sure she will agree that once youngsters know what qualifications they can get by staying on at school they will be greatly encouraged to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl explain a little further his answer to his noble friend <e> <s> the noble lord asked about the use of moneys from selling council houses <e> <s> it is not at all clear to me why the noble earl thinks that placing more money at the disposal of local authorities for them to spend would not be a means of increasing the stock of housing <e> <s> on the face of it that seems self-evident <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of recent events is the minister not somewhat relieved and perhaps surprised that the price of eggs has gone up <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister explain to us what he means by keeping the social workers under constant review <e> <s> it is one of those bland phrases that we constantly hear <e> <s> what on earth does it mean <e> <s> there are thousands of social workers <e> <s> what is the secretary of state going to do <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches thank the secretary of state for making the statement in this house this afternoon <e> <s> our position might have been a little easier if the statement had been provided earlier <e> <s> however i do not know whether on a technical subject a little more time would have made me much better informed <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord williams of elvel said that he was perfectly prepared to include charitable contributions indeed i think that it would be highly desirable to do so <e> <s> the government never stop saying that industry should make a contribution to every conceivable good cause in the country <e> <s> i often wonder when this free market capitalist government will realise that the purposes for which money is put up to industry is the development of industry the reduction in prices and the payment of dividends and of wages <e> <s> if the government have their way a great deal of the money would go to all sorts of extraordinary places <e> <s> if the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is saying that he will support the amendment if charities are included with political contributions i am sure that most of us on this side of the committee would be only too pleased to agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us what evidence there is contrary to the evidence of the doctors that it was not chemical weapons which were used against these people <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that the most recent issue of the <e>", "<cs> my lords today and this is itself a revolution

years ago that would not have been the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief as many of the points i intended to make have already been covered by the noble baroness lady cox <e> <s> i found myself in agreement with most although not all of her points <e> <s> this evening i wish to speak not so much about old people themselves but about carers <e> <s> i am the president of the carers national association <e> <s> that body has recently been formed out of a merger between the national council for carers and their elderly dependents and the carers association <e> <s> it is now undoubtedly the largest body dealing with the problems of carers for old people <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not strange that in a period of weeks we shall have five holidays and then a long gap from the end of may until the end of august when the weather is normally somewhat better <e> <s> we raise this matter every year <e> <s> we cannot <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord has agreed that it is a good idea that small businesses should export will he not think again about his reply that high interest rates improve the exchange rate and are therefore beneficial <e> <s> surely a high exchange rate is not beneficial to people who are trying to export <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord must agree that raising the level of interest rates does not lead to a stable exchange rate it increases the value of the pound <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that some of us realise that with the coming of and the single european market we shall see a great deal of investment from this country into other countries and also investment from other countries into this country and that that is how it should be <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down may i ask him for further clarification <e> <s> it may be my fault because i do not know the contents of the bill sufficiently well but does in need include the very many cases where the mother is out

into industry as a result of the falling school-leaver rate <e> <s> it would be a great help particularly with regard to school holidays where again and again there is great difficulty <e> <s> if that is the meaning can the phrase in need be extended to cases where both parents are in employment <e>", "<cs> my lords does this provision really have to be restricted to relatives <e> <s> after all one can think of a great many cases where say a previous schoolteacher or a godparent who is not a relation but has a close and valuable relationship with the child should be allowed contact <e> <s> does this really have to apply just to relations <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount said that some specialties will be excluded <e> <s> however a speciality which covers no less than per cent <e> <s> of students is surely in a rather special position <e> <s> for that number to be excluded is not acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government consider additional aid to countries that are increasing or attempting to increase their family planning programmes in view of the close connection between dramatic increases in population and environmental issues <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps may ask a question since i am ignorant in this matter <e> <s> following the point made by the noble baroness lady faithfull i can see the practical difficulty that one may be stuck in the clinic needing the protection order <e> <s> would it not be possible that in issuing the assessment order the magistrate may also issue a provisional protection order in the event that the assessment proved that the child needed the protection <e> <s> then there would be no need if the assessment went the wrong way for a return to the magistrate <e> <s> but if the assessment did not go the wrong way the protection order would not be used <e> <s> is there a way of combining the two <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a question that probably arises out of my ignorance <e> <s> when is fostering not fostering <e> <s> if parents ask a friend to take a child in for a while do they have to notify that <e> <s> i recall that when i was on the staff of the london school of economics we had a number of african students <e> <s> they had arrangements among themselves whereby people they knew looked after their children <e> <s> does that constitute fostering or is such an arrangement permitted <e> <s> quite a lot of it goes on <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to make it quite clear that although there is no name from these benches against the amendment on the marshalled list we are wholeheartedly in support of it <e> <s> like the noble lord lord rippon we have been increasingly concerned at the extent to which regulation is being <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has told the house that it is the governments policy not to interfere with local authorities <e> <s> therefore are we to understand that they will now be free to spend the money obtained from the sale of council houses which they have not been allowed to spend <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any hope that the survey will lead to the chamber being less abominably stuffy late at night <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that in many parts of south wales at any rate it has been impossible to get a job unless one belonged to the right party and the right party is not the conservative party <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble friend lord winstanley i am astonished that a review of this kind excludes any reference to community care <e> <s> the noble baroness lady cox has also referred to this point <e> <s> i am not only surprised i am genuinely alarmed <e> <s> it seems to indicate that the government as shown also by their long delay in reacting to the griffiths report are simply not aware of the seriousness of the problems involved in community care <e> <s> it seems that once again the government and the department are unaware of what is going on elsewhere <e> <s> the decisions being taken in regard to housing benefit are increasing the difficulties of people trying to cope with the elderly and the infirm <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us how we rank when it comes to full-time employment for women <e> <s> does the minister not agree that the very high figure he quoted is much swollen by the large numbers of women working part time <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that not everybody certainly not everybody on this side of the house agrees with her complacency about the effectiveness of the regulatory systems in gas and in telecommunications <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble and learned lord but i do not believe i am alone in still being somewhat confused as regards what is meant by the economic well-being of the united kingdom <e> <s> for example would it include the economic well-being of substantial companies which were threatened by a raider from overseas which was trying to purchase them <e> <s> what is the criteria by which you know that it is the united kingdom that is threatened <e> <s> it is not clear to many of us and it may be our stupidity <e>", "<cs> my lords the white paper covers a great many extremely important matters <e> <s> it is impossible to deal with all of them adequately in a debate of this kind and i intend to concentrate almost entirely on the training aspect of the white paper <e> <s> i wish to comment on some of the points which have already been raised on other sections of the white paper on the industrial relations approach of the government <e> <s> i suggest to the government that their thinking about industrial relations has been conditioned almost entirely by the state of industrial relations under conditions of unemployment <e> <s> there is nothing to suggest that they have done any thinking to decide how they will handle industrial relations issues when the balance of power changes as it inevitably will if the governments employment policies succeed and we return to full employment or near full employment <e> <s> the power of the trade unions will then be very greatly enhanced <e> <s> whatever one may think about the rights or wrongs of this industrial relations are very much a matter of power bargaining <e> <s> the unions have been in a powerless position because of high unemployment <e> <s> therefore they have not been able to exercise any pressure <e> <s> the government are already concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords one cannot be slightly wrong <e> <s> one must either be right or wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords so it is the date that is wrong <e> <s> anyway it was a conservative government that introduced that measure because they knew that employers by themselves would not deliver the training <e> <s> why do the government believe that employers have changed <e> <s> yet i see that the training and enterprise councils are to be put into the hands of employers <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord appears to be confused <e> <s> said about the governments industrial relations policy that they had not geared themselves up for full employment because industrial relations under full employment present different problems from industrial relations when there is unemployment <e> <s> i did not say that the policy was not related to the training programme <e>", "<cs> my lords the implication from the noble lord was that the london school of economics is definitely opposed to conservatism <e> <s> the london school of economics has in its ranks members of all parties <e> <s> it is very out of date to suggest that it is a centre of revolution <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount tell us what the shortfall is in teachers of technology <e> <s> further will he agree that the concentration of so many of those teachers in these city colleges will make the situation even worse in schools throughout the country where there is a very great need to have such teachers in place as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords how many speech therapists work in adult education and what provision is there for improving the position <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that it is not just a question of numbers it is a question of the level of people who are going <e> <s> if we are losing a few of the most distinguished people from the universities that is serious <e> <s> the balance is not redressed by getting a number of juniors from overseas <e>", "<cs> if we use geographical terms are we not confusing the issue <e> <s> we are concerned with competition within the relevant market whatever the geographical limits of that market

"<cs> the words united kingdom would also be confusing <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies perhaps i may make one brief point <e> <s> the secretary of state has said that this is always done <e> <s> however there is a world of difference between having a right to be heard and knowing that it is very likely that you will be called <e> <s> those are not the same things <e> <s> it is the right to be heard that we wish to be embodied in the act <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister saying that there is no way in which parliament is able to question or challenge the decision of the universities funding council <e> <s> the way in which university education develops is a matter of great concern surely we have a right to ask questions and receive answers <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount tell us what proportion of the per cent <e> <s> who do not stay on at school are given regular day-time release by their employers for further study or training <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount told us that he was confident <e> <s> that is the reply we receive frequently from the front bench <e> <s> the government never tell us why they are confident <e> <s> we are not interested in their state of mind but in the reasons behind it <e>", "<cs> my lords what could be more contrary than for sir leon brittan to say that the time is ripe and for the government to say that it is not ripe <e> <s> i cannot see anything more contrary than that <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble earl agree that even if he cannot stand up to the theologians and cannot face up to the red herring of the may day holiday it leaves us with the late spring holiday which we do not even call the whitsun holiday now <e> <s> can he not do a deal on that <e> <s> i cannot think that there is any political or theological objection to moving away from the last monday in may <e>", "<cs> my lords that being so would the minister also agree that that really gives the lie to his previous answer that it was only a matter of contract <e> <s> surely it is a great deal more than a matter of commercial contract <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that while many of us on these benches disagree with a great deal of what the government do we applaud their enthusiasm for fighting protection and supporting free trade <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to follow the noble lord lord mccarthy although his is not on all occasions an easy act to follow <e> <s> today is one such occasion <e> <s> the debate has two very important facets <e> <s> why do we need a change of attitude towards training <e> <s> and how are we to get it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble earl but why does he think that chief executives are going to be expert in the training field <e> <s> i do not understand the argument <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> i want to amplify one matter implied if not expressly stated in the speech of the noble baroness lady lockwood <e> <s> i am sure that it needs to be made clear to the committee that the noble baroness is not asking for anything that could be regarded as a quota of women on boards <e> <s> that is not the intention <e> <s> we are arguing that there probably are and may always have been a large number of women who either through professional or business training or through the kind of experience that women have had by being prominent members of county or district councils are eminently qualified to fulfil the role of executive directors <e> <s> it is obvious from the very small number of women appointed that it is not thought that women have the kind of experience and background that would be valuable <e> <s> companies are not drawing on the available talent because the idea of appointing a woman is still foreign to a great many of them <e>", "<cs> i cannot let the noble lord get away with that <e> <s> i am in favour of positive policies but i am against quotas <e> <s> do get it right <e>", "<cs> no it does not <e> <s> this is quite a serious point <e> <s> positive discrimination implies quotas <e> <s> we are definitely not in favour of quotas <e> <s> however we are in favour of a deliberate policy to go out and find the women who have the necessary qualifications <e> <s> that is something quite different and is a very important distinction <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may record the fact that i am now above the age <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to intervene but at no point did i say that <e> <s> i do not believe that women have special qualities <e> <s> i said that there are many women who have the personal qualities that are required on boards of directors <e> <s> that is all i am saying <e> <s> i ask the noble lord to get that clear <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister mentioned that a per cent <e> <s> increase in interest rates had less effect than the corresponding figure in unit costs <e> <s> does he agree that by putting up interest rates he also puts up mortgage rates which will greatly increase the pressure on pay claims <e> <s> particularly at a time when there are skill shortages is it not very likely that employers will give way to those pay claims which will greatly increase their costs <e>", "<cs> my lords how many of them were old age pensioners <e> <s> if this measure is for their safety and they do not ever riot they will be just as safe even if they do not have tickets <e>", "<cs> i am sure that i am one of the people for whom the noble lord lord mottistone has less respect <e> <s> he will certainly have less respect after i have finished as i am going greatly to disagree with what he said <e> <s> the noble lords idea of democracy seems to be that it is genuine democracy provided it agrees with the powers that be <e> <s> i can well undertstand that some of these proxies make a considerable nuisance of themselves but that is the price that one pays in democracies <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government prepared to encourage local authorities which still have money from the sale of council houses to use some of that for the repair of properties which could then be used <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness lady blackstone for giving us the opportunity this afternoon to discuss this important subject <e> <s> i am glad also that we shall hear the maiden speech of the right reverend prelate the bishop of bradford <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount saying that the alleged argument between the treasury and the des is being won by the des and that there is no intention of attempting to control intake in relation to manpower planning <e>", "<cs> it was reported in the press my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it is estimated that it would take million to provide the schools necessary to educate these children and that so far the government have budgeted for only million <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree in giving the figure calculated in for the cost of local income tax that technology has advanced considerably since then and that a new estimate should be made to see what local income tax would cost using modern equipment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not explained he is merely asserting <e> <s> the minister has not explained at all how it will cost more <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree i am sure that he does not that in view of the high cost of good workplace nurseries there is no way that they can be provided on the cheap and the desirability of getting more women back into employment it is reasonable that the cost should be shared among the government the employee and the company and that the governments contribution could well be by way of tax relief for women who take advantage of such schemes but who have to pay for them <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government are firmly committed what is the point of submitting our views <e> <s> following that will the noble lord not think again about the proposals from the noble lord lord winstanley <e> <s> surely when making a big change in any sphere there is a great deal to be said for a pilot study unless one is totally convinced that one has got it absolutely right in the first place <e> <s> what evidence is there ever to suggest that one has got anything totally right in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that these unsubstantiated implications of ill faith on the part of the official trade unions do nothing to ease the present difficult industrial relations position <e> <s> does the noble lord recall that in the days before the donovan report nearly all strikes were unofficial and does he agree that the highly legalistic approach of the government towards industrial relations is not likely to work very effectively once labour power becomes stronger with the recovery in employment <e>", "<cs> the only way for it not to be secret is for it to be open <e> <s> it must be one or the other <e> <s> the national rivers authority is a watchdog body <e> <s> it is not primarily an executive body <e> <s> it will have executive duties but its prime function is to ensure that the way in which the water supplies are run and the implications of so doing are watched in the interests of the public <e> <s> surely the public ought to have access to what its watchdog is doing <e> <s> we are not talking about a straightforward executive organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl tell the house how soon the new bail hostels will be available and whether the programme can be speeded up <e> <s> we understand that a number of people in that prison are on remand and could be in bail hostels <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand from what the secretary of state said that the government are discouraging the use of arbitration when there is a dispute and are supporting the idea that employers should resist going to arbitration <e> <s> secondly on reflection will the secretary of state not revise his comment that the only thing which can hold back this country is wage increases <e> <s> surely there are plenty of other things such as inadequate training inadequate investment and inadequate infrastructure <e> <s> does the secretary of state really say that the only thing is pay claims <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say how many disabled young persons who wished for a yts place were unable to gain one <e> <s> it could be that the per cent <e> <s> represents those among disabled people who are easiest to place <e> <s> i am not however denying that per cent <e> <s> is in many ways unexpectedly good <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that in the attempt to get experienced women nurses back into the service the provision of child care is of the very greatest importance <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that it can cost as much as <e>", "<cs> my lords the council for industry and higher education in its valuable report <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support this amendment <e> <s> it is all very well for the noble lord to say that in a free country anyone can have access to the secretary of state <e> <s> however what we want is to ensure that the people on such committees are listened to when they have that access <e> <s> surely it makes a great deal of difference to have written into the legislation the fact that they have such access <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene here for just a moment <e> <s> i find myself at present in a position with two colleagues of this chamber where we have been trying for three weeks to get an answer to a letter from someone in such a position <e> <s> however we have not even had a reply <e>", "<cs> the noble earl said that it would be impossible to accept the amendment because there could be some ghastly catastrophe so that it would not be possible to supply electricity <e> <s> is it not possible to insert a saving clause about acts of god intervening or a matter which could not be foretold <e> <s> that would be a let-out and would provide an excuse if the whole system blew up and it was not possible to provide electricity <e> <s> we are not referring to such eventualities but to these maddening interruptions of supply which are not an act of god but just the result of as was said on another occasion the inactivity of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords while expressing sympathy with and admiration for the noble baroness in her handling of these questions perhaps i may ask the noble lord the leader of the house whether he agrees that with two questions on the order paper dealing with foreign affairs and defence it is a pity that no one from either the ministry of defence or the foreign office is here to answer the questions on which the house can reasonably expect an informed answer <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble lord the leader of the house for that reply may i suggest that in such circumstances it might be more appropriate to defer the asking of such questions <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl tell the house what plans the government have for the provision of additional bail hostels over and above those of which we have already been informed <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the noble lord lord ennals the noble lord said that the government would continue to listen <e> <s> does that mean that genuine consultation will continue after the six days are up <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to prolong this conversation especially as we shall be discussing social security during the next business <e> <s> however i should like to ask the minister one question arising from what he said about changing the statistics <e> <s> if one is studying these matters one wants to know the trend <e> <s> if one has altered the method of taking the statistics what was collected years ago does not tell one much about today <e> <s> but one wants to track <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness agree that since the government cannot define poverty they will not be able to define wealthy either <e>", "<cs> my lords if my memory serves me right the abolition of the earnings rule appeard in my own election address in <e> <s> that was the first of the many unsuccessful attempts that i made to enter another place <e> <s> however we on these benches are familiar with the unintended flattery that comes from imitation <e> <s> i should say that we have become more familiar with it recently <e> <s> so i greatly welcome the inclusion of that provision in the bill <e> <s> i am afraid however that that is where my enthusiasm for the bill ceases <e>", "<cs> my lords it can in fact be put both ways <e> <s> i believe that capable of and available for was the phrase which was always used <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me intervening i do not recall having said at least if i did then i do not know what i was thinking about that i favoured the abolition of the attendance allowance <e> <s> i do not think that i said that and it would be very embarrassing for me to have it on the record <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the remarks of the noble earl lord lauderdale <e> <s> when we speak of eight people being properly qualified the fact of the matter is that there is a very wide range of expertise needed among those people <e> <s> no one person or two persons will have all that expertise <e> <s> a team of eight persons is needed who between them will possess the degree of specialist knowledge which the generalist simply does not have <e>", "<cs> one understands entirely if we are talking about an industrial consumer and if it has to say how much power it will use <e> <s> but the situation is different for the domestic consumer <e> <s> i dare say that the noble baroness is a much better housewife than i for i could not possibly say how much electricity i shall use over the next quarter or half year <e> <s> if you go out into the street and ask the first hundred women what power they shall be using over the next year i doubt very much whether more than per cent <e> <s> will have a shot at the figure <e> <s> of those per cent <e> <s> of them will get it wrong <e> <s> it does not make sense at all <e> <s> i ask the noble baroness to take the question back for further consideration as regards the domestic consumer <e> <s> the requirement is fair enough for the industrial consumer <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness told us that this has been going on since or some such time <e> <s> whatever it is it is long enough <e> <s> perhaps i may ask the noble baroness whether she has ever been asked to make such an estimate <e> <s> in all the years that i have been using electricity no one has ever asked me to make an estimate <e> <s> it may have been the practice since but it has been going on in places which most of us know nothing about <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that at present it comes out in some of the area boards leaflets <e> <s> we should like to ensure that everybody who receives a bill has a clear explanation of how the standing charge has been arrived at <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble baroness but does she agree that the prepayment meter would ultimately obliterate the problem <e> <s> there would be a backlog of people who have not paid but once prepayment meters are installed the problem would not arise <e> <s> it is surely better to see that the need for disconnection does not arise by putting in the prepayment meter than to keep the penalty hanging

reply from the minister <e> <s> i do not think that he has fully appreciated the point that we have made <e> <s> his response came under two heads <e> <s> the first was his resistance to the idea that people should be required to have prepayment meters <e> <s> i think that he said that it was an interference with liberty or privacy if such meters were imposed <e> <s> but it is perfectly reasonable for a supplier to make such a requirement <e> <s> i can see no objection to saying that if people have not paid and do not pay their bills they must have a different system of payment and that system will be the prepayment meter <e> <s> i do not accept the noble lords suggestion that that is an infringement of peoples right to pay or not to pay <e>", "<cs> both the noble baroness and the minister have made our case <e> <s> every time they open their mouths they show that the present system with the threat of disconnection simply is not working <e> <s> it is both an expensive and an inefficient way of getting the money in <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness also said in her previous speech that a very great deal of money was owed for electricity which it had not been possible to recover <e> <s> i am saying that she and the minister out of their own mouths have shown that the existing system is not working and they do not <e>", "<cs> we are constantly referred to the codes of practice and the good sense of the authorities but that is not good enough <e> <s> we want such matters written on to the face of the act <e> <s> we do not want to have to rely on non-enforceable codes of practice and on the assumption that officials in these organisations will behave sensibly <e> <s> no doubt the great majority of them will do so but half the time the law is about having to deal with the small minority of people who do not behave sensibly and decently <e> <s> that is why we want this on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am not surprised but i am none the less disappointed by the noble lords reply <e> <s> he is being extremely doctrinaire in saying that people can go to the social services to get the money that they need <e> <s> he said that if the adjustment was made the cost would fall on the other customers <e> <s> the additional cost for the other customers would be absolutely minuscule <e> <s> it would be a great reassurance to many disabled people to have this on the face of the bill <e> <s> however at this time of night i do not propose to press it further <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask a genuine question to seek information <e> <s> are the figures relating to japan based on the japanese manufacturing industry or do they include the large number of small industry and craft-based workshops in japan <e> <s> in those one would expect productivity rates to be very low <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the important point to make is that the growth rate can be expected to be higher when one starts from a very low base <e> <s> does he also agree that one may give the wrong impression if one takes productivity rates year by year and compares country with country <e> <s> when you start from a low base it is far easier to have a high growth rate than if you start from a high base <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord ross not only for introducing the debate but also for the work that he has carried out over the years in this house and in another place in respect of housing and homelessness <e>", "<cs> my lords does the government not agree that it is unfortunate that the national curriculum lays down that there should be one language taught and that the teaching of it shall not start until the age of whereas most people would believe that the sooner one starts a foreign language the better <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the real objection to the scheme that it is regarded as an interference with our sovereign rights <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that there is all the difference in the world between being asked as an executive to comment on and explain how one will implement a policy which has already been formulated and being in on the formulation of the policy <e> <s> it is perfectly arguable that one should not have people in a representative capacity but one needs the knowledge in policy formation that only a professional nurse can bring <e>", "<cs> i must say that i find the response of the noble baroness extremely disappointing and rather surprising in view of what she has just said in reply to the noble lord lord peyton <e> <s> the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords how does the noble viscount explain his optimistic view of what has been going on when the blackwell journal index shows a per cent <e> <s> cut in periodicals

discrepancy between what the noble viscount is saying and what the blackwell journal index shows <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that highly skilled men such as miners are perfectly capable of being trained for the new high technology jobs if the training is available <e> <s> does he agree that there is no need to keep them in traditional manual jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has told the house that the government accepts the principle of additionality <e> <s> will he put his hand on his heart and say that the government will act upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome what the noble earl has told us about the three new remand centres but can he give us any information about additional provision for after-care since a reduction in recidivism would obviously go a long way to reducing overcrowding in gaols <e>", "<cs> i wish strongly to support the amendment <e> <s> i should like to spend one moment on the argument which is superficially attractive to a great many people <e> <s> it is we want the money to go to those who need it most <e> <s> i am often told by people isnt that sensible <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady faithfull pointed out it applies not just to people going to hospices but to the large number of people who are being looked after in their own homes <e> <s> there is a special reason why it is valuable for such cases that is that the invalid care allowance is dependent upon the attendance allowance <e> <s> if a person has had to give up work because he or she is looking after someone who is terminally ill he or she can get the invalid care allowance only if the attendance allowance has been awarded <e> <s> that means as the law stands that they cannot obtain the allowance until the six-month period is up <e> <s> that is a difficult period of time to span in those circumstances and in some cases it means that by the time such people are eligible for the allowance they are dead and the invalid care allowance is never given <e> <s> i hope that the government will find a way to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i ask the minister to reconsider this matter though not necessarily in the terms of this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord has agreed that it is highly desirable that people should undertake training and that any obstacles that are put in the way should be discouraged not only from the point <e>", "<cs> in the light of that relatively encouraging response i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the minister but he raised an important point when he said that the claimant would have warnings meetings discussions and so on and that the matter would then go to the adjudication officer <e> <s> in view of all those warnings it would be assumed before the adjudication officers decision that the claimant was guilty because the penalty would be inflicted before the trial had been held <e> <s> that is an odd reversal of justice <e> <s> surely the man is not guilty until the adjudication has been settled <e> <s> it would be odd if a court inflicted a penalty before the case had been heard which seems to be what happens here <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that days was far too short and that may well be right <e> <s> however i believe that the noble baroness lady faithfull said that her information was that the appeals often wait two to three months <e> <s> that must surely be too long <e> <s> can the noble lord tell us whether he has any information about what the median period is for an appeal to be heard <e> <s> if so and if it is as long as we have been told surely it is worth while trying to make it a shorter period <e> <s> no one should have to wait from two to three months if that is the period of time involved <e> <s> i have no idea what it is but that was the period of time given to us <e>", "<cs> as i was given that figure i wish to put something on the record <e> <s> i find it quite astonishing that the department of social security <e>", "<cs> if the minister was wrong about that it is the case that the penalty is inflicted before the judgment is it not <e> <s> that seems to me an extraordinary way of conducting justice <e> <s> that would not occur in a magistrates court <e> <s> imagine fining a motorist for a parking offence and then taking him to court <e> <s> actually that is a very bad example because if a parking offence has been committed that does occur <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment not least because of the totally inadequate amount of child care provision available <e> <s> we are not talking about people who will hire a nanny although that would take more than hours <e> <s> we are talking about people who have to try to find a place in a nursery <e> <s> we know that the provision of places is so low it is the lowest in europe that unless one is in the deprived categories one will be extremely lucky if one gets ones baby in a nursery let alone within hours <e> <s> it is totally unrealistic to think that people can find places for children in day nurseries in hours <e>", "<cs> may i suggest another matter that the noble lord may be thinking about while he is <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl withdraws his amendment i just make this additional point <e> <s> the minister said that a good employer may do this that and the other <e> <s> he may well do although a great many would not <e> <s> however no good employer will help a man looking for work <e> <s> that is the point of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that this question would be more appropriately addressed to the local press <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether i have a suspicious nature but does the noble baroness really believe that if people find mice in their stores they will rush off and tell the authorities <e> <s> i should think that that will be the last thing that they will do but instead will pretend that they have not seen the mice <e> <s> is such a provision good enough to ensure that the matter is followed up <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with great ignorance that i should like to ask the minister one question on the subject <e> <s> it is in connection with shared schools and the education of protestant and catholic children together <e> <s> i realise that it is a delicate question to ask the minister but i understand that when it was first attempted some years ago great difficulties arose because of the attitude of the roman catholic hierarchy <e> <s> in some cases they refused to confirm catholic children who had attended shared schools <e> <s> it is probably too simple to put the matter in this way and i do so only because i am ignorant <e> <s> it has always appeared to me that in the long run shared schools can provide at least a useful stepping stone towards peace in the next generation if not in this <e> <s> what is the present position <e> <s> is it easier to have shared schools <e> <s> what is the attitude of the roman catholic hierarchy because obviously that is of great importance if the system is to develop <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord mentioned seven schools <e> <s> what sort of percentage of children does that represent <e> <s> are we referring to per cent <e> <s> per cent <e> <s> or what <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that it was prohibited as well it would be to conspire to commit genocide as well as to commit it <e> <s> can he explain what kind of preparation has been identified which would rank as conspiracy <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not have the least desire to make such a meal of the amendment <e> <s> we do not believe that it would take a long time for the requirements to be brought into force <e> <s> we do not wish the wind-up of the scheme to be delayed <e> <s> we want the transitional period to be as short as it can be <e> <s> i cannot see since these what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for reasons of his own calls privileges conditions are already in being that it will take long for the government to say that they are to continue under the new scheme <e> <s> i should have thought that that could have been done between monday night and tuesday morning if they decided to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords following the question of my noble friend lord bonham-carter does the noble lord agree that people are more likely to stay put in hong kong if they have an assurance that in the event of the worst happening there will be somewhere for them to go <e> <s> there would then be no question of wishing to get out now in order to escape while they can <e>", "<cs> my lords we should like also to thank the noble lord the leader of the house for repeating the statement and to raise one or two issues with him <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> in view of the fact that he is prepared to consider the matter i would not dream of pressing the amendment to a division at this stage <e> <s> however i give him notice that i certainly shall do so if he does not bring forward a satisfactory solution in the meantime <e> <s> i should very much like to have the opportunity to discuss the issue with him if that were possible <e>", "<cs> is there any reason why landlords should not be told that they must give permission for a cooker <e> <s> why should it only be in cases where <e>", "<cs> i wish briefly to support this amendment which is very much in line with the next amendment standing in the name of the noble lord lord henderson and myself <e> <s> i think there can be no doubt that the intention of the amendment is in line with equal opportunities and not contrary to it <e> <s> if the noble lord will take the provision away and have the discussions suggested by the noble lord lord mottistone that would undoubtedly be very helpful in clarifying the legal position <e> <s> if the worst comes to the worst a test case either way could be taken to the european court <e> <s> that no doubt is where the matter will land up unless we come to a sensible solution here <e> <s> it is a pity to have yet another case go to the european court if the matter can be settled here <e> <s> i believe that the acceptance of this amendment would go a considerable way in that direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to ask the noble lord to think again about the two cases which he discussed at the beginning <e> <s> there was the case of the man who was injured which i do not think the noble lord mentioned but he would be in the same category as the man who was sick who left for those reasons but recovered and was re-employed <e> <s> the noble lord said that he thought that was very unlikely to happen <e> <s> i think it is very likely to happen <e> <s> it happens again and again in ordinary industry that people leave if they think they are seriously damaged and the doctors and everybody else think they are seriously damaged <e> <s> it is quite common for an employer to keep them on the books for a while and then to say we cannot leave them on the books indefinitely we shall take them off <e> <s> but the man gets better as happens very frequently he reapplies and comes back <e> <s> all the noble lord said to us was that he thought it would not happen <e> <s> i should have thought that those cases were in a totally different category from the others which the noble lord discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords i enter this debate with the very greatest hesitation recognising how little i know about the theology of the matter and how little experience i have of these questions <e> <s> however i speak very much as a layman a very ordinary member in the pew <e> <s> it is as a layman and from a laymans point of view that i should like to say a few words <e> <s> before doing so i should like to say how very much i agree if it is not presumptuous to say so with the speech made by the noble and learned lord lord hailsham <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i am being extremely stupid but i cannot see that simply adding the words includes intellectual property rights changes the situation in any way <e> <s> that merely slightly expands and explains what is meant <e> <s> how does it make such a fundamental change <e> <s> i am not at all clear on that matter <e> <s> will the noble baroness clarify it a little more <e> <s> perhaps i am at fault but i do not understand what was said <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house our previous amendment proposed that the meter should be installed automatically <e> <s> as i understood it it was to that proposal that the government objected <e> <s> if they were prepared to accept it we should be pleased <e> <s> we modified the amendment to meet that objection <e>", "<cs> my lords i tried to explain to the noble baroness that we originally wished to provide that the board could automatically impose the installation <e> <s> as i understand it it was to that proposal that the government objected <e> <s> we therefore produced this modified amendment which does not enforce that action on the person required to pay <e> <s> that was because the government were not prepared to have an automatic installation of the meter <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with great attention to what the minister said <e> <s> it seems to me that on this occasion as on so many previous occasions we are told that everything is in the code of practice or that it will be incorporated into the licence <e> <s> however there are many occasions when i think this is one of them we want the provision not in the code of practice but on the face of the bill <e> <s> therefore i feel i must test the opinion of the house <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a further comment <e> <s> one is not concerned only with advertising by word of mouth <e> <s> some recruitment especially where there is unemployment is done by people dropping in when from the point of view of the employer there has not been any question of a job being available <e> <s> somebody on the street can come in and ask is there a job <e> <s> it could not be said that the job had been advertised in any sense <e> <s> it is equally important to know what happens to such people <e> <s> word of mouth is not the only way in which people get to know of vacancies <e>", "<cs> those were not my <e>", "<cs> years ago i was employed in this kind of game <e> <s> in conditions of unemployment a great many people come to the door and say any chance of a job <e> <s> the reason behind their coming may be because of word of mouth advertisement or anything else <e> <s> often they are interviewed and employers keep their application in case there is a job <e> <s> there is no question of the employer having taken the initiative to advertise or telling the workforce that there is a job <e> <s> frequently people come in in that way <e> <s> one would be interested to know what happens to the application of a catholic who goes uninvited and that is my point to a protestant firm <e> <s> i guess that in many cases those cards would be torn up <e> <s> that is what we want to know <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the minister two questions on this issue <e> <s> the first is whether in regard to training this bill is on all fours with the sex discrimination act for the uk <e> <s> under that act it is perfectly legitimate to provide training for a member of a sex which is substantially under-represented in a particular job <e> <s> that is not regarded as discrimination <e> <s> people will not automatically get a job as a result of the training but the argument is that the training brings them up to a level starting place to enable them to compete for the job <e> <s> is that the intention in this legislation <e> <s> if it is the intention there is no problem about providing training for the under-represented group <e> <s> that group can quite openly be provided with training and that is not regarded as discriminatory <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord <e> <s> if the point that i made about the sex discrimination act is correct that problem does not arise <e> <s> one is allowed to discriminate quite openly in training matters <e> <s> it is when it comes to giving a job as a result of the training that the issue of discrimination arises <e>", "<cs> it is late at night but there is an important difference <e> <s> removing an existing discrimination is not the same as discriminating in favour of a group of people <e> <s> one is removing a discrimination which operates against a particular group <e> <s> that is not discriminatory under our legislation <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to add to what my noble friend lord bonham-carter has said <e> <s> on a number of occasions i have taken part in women-only management training programmes for companies where there has been a dearth of women in management so that to redress the balance women-only courses have been put on <e> <s> that is totally illegal <e> <s> in an organisation in northern ireland which has no supervisors of a given faith such as no catholic supervisors <e> <s> it would by analogy with the english situation be perfectly proper to put on <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister reconsider his statement that the only way of dealing with inflation is through monetary policy <e> <s> does he not feel that fiscal policy also has a role to play <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not mention credit controls <e> <s> i do not believe in credit controls <e> <s> i asked about fiscal policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i may have got it wrong but i ask the minister whether he can be right as regards the figure of people who are deaf blind and have difficulty in walking <e> <s> that means one in every of the population if i have done the sums correctly <e> <s> we cannot have one in every people in this country who are blind deaf and unable to walk <e> <s> where are they all <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say from these benches how much we also welcome the statement given to us today <e> <s> i can only say better late than never <e> <s> i shall not digress on the very large number of times that we have asked when the statement was coming i shall merely say that i am delighted that it has now arrived <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what i am looking for <e> <s> if i could find it i should be only too delighted to give it to the noble lord <e> <s> i have read the passage three times so i am absolutely certain that it is there <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord ennals can find it <e> <s> it is a rather important point <e> <s> i shall come back to it in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> that is what one calls comradeship <e>", "<cs> my lords the reply from the noble lord is very much what i had expected <e> <s> the whole purpose of these amendments was to try to stop the government from taking advantage of the derogations <e> <s> it provides an opportunity to seize the nettle that will have to be seized sooner or later while we are making changes in this social security legislation which is the appropriate place for doing so and to make a modest advance in relation to occupational pension schemes <e> <s> i should like to test the opinion of the house to see how much support there is for moving in the direction of greater equality of opportunity in relation to pensions <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches strongly support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister really say that the government have so much confidence in the work of the non-statutory boards which after all have been in existence for some time when his own department has published documents which are on sale to the general public showing how little industry has done in the way of training <e> <s> how does he explain that apparent contradiction <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean that the previous publication was therefore wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the clause of the bill which reduces discrimination against women <e> <s> it gives them greater opportunities than they have had previously and makes much needed changes to the act <e> <s> women will now have the ability if they so wish to work in mines <e> <s> i happen to be the daughter of a mining engineer <e> <s> i am not unaware of what conditions in mines would be like <e> <s> it is extremely improbable that many women will wish to work in mines but it is true that there are desirable jobs in the technical and managerial grades which some women will wish to have <e> <s> if they wish to get those jobs they must be able to work underground <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a male principal at lady margaret hall <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a point of very considerable importance <e> <s> will the ministers department issue any regular reports about what is going on <e> <s> asking questions without the data is not very fruitful <e> <s> at present we receive a great deal of information from his department about training <e> <s> what will happen in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has told us that a considerable part of the imports are semi-finished and finished goods <e> <s> which of those goods could be manufactured in this country <e> <s> if they are not why are we failing to supply our own semi-finished and finished goods to industry <e>", "<cs> my lords if the position is as good as the noble lord says why do we have the balance of payments problem <e> <s> it is quite contradictory <e>", "<cs> my lords i strongly support this amendment <e> <s> surely it is not asking too much that adequate time should be allowed to provide child care <e> <s> as my noble friend made clear in his graphic phrase it is not looking for a left luggage office in which to dump your child but finding the most suitable place in which to leave the child and be happy with the arrangement <e> <s> i should add that if you make arrangements which are unsatisfactory you will shortly be losing the job <e> <s> it is therefore not a good idea to encourage women who are going to work to make child care arrangements which they do not regard as entirely satisfactory <e> <s> it will not benefit the woman the child or the employer <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls still talks as if many of these youngsters were people who had left home through natural exuberance and who wished to find their way to london rather like young dick whittingtons <e> <s> however we have figures which show that well over per cent <e> <s> of these young people have either been brought up in institutions and therefore do not have a home to go to or have been chucked out from their homes for reasons which are not of the jolly kind that he is suggesting here <e>", "<cs> my lords is it in order for me to say at report stage before the noble lord sits down <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may say that he really did not reply to what i think was a very important point made by my noble friend lord bonham-carter <e> <s> i know that the noble lord will realise that he speaks as one with very considerable experience of commissions <e> <s> it is a very great help to someone who is responsible for a commission to have direct access to the secretary of state <e> <s> it has nothing to do with criticism of officials <e> <s> it is simply that when running a commission it is a great help to have the right to go direct to the secretary of state <e> <s> my noble friend found that to be the case when he was running the race relations commission <e> <s> it is not a political point it is an administrative point so to speak <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord would comment <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i was the person who raised especially the question of the casual applicant <e> <s> while i see the point that the noble lord is making i know very well that regarding womens equal opportunities and race relations casual applicants have often been turned away because they were what they were <e> <s> a great deal of discrimination has gone on as regards the casual applicant <e> <s> i am not at all sure that one is safe in saying that one does not have to monitor the casual applicant <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully understand the difficulty <e> <s> the noble lord is being a little optimistic if he thinks that that is how recruitment will happen <e> <s> however i see the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that one cannot have religious exclusive training programmes because that would be direct or indirect discrimination <e> <s> the whole point of sections in both the race relations act and the sex discrimination act is that there are provisions relating to the underprivileged and under-represented groups <e> <s> that is the whole purpose of the exercise <e> <s> as i said in committee there are women-only management training courses <e> <s> they are exclusive to women <e> <s> men cannot go on them <e> <s> that is permitted by the legislation <e> <s> it exempts them from the charge of indirect or direct discrimination <e> <s> that is specifically said in the legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may attempt to clarify a point because i am also confused about redundancy in relation to agreed procedures <e> <s> it must <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i do not think the noble lord dealt with my problem about last in first out <e> <s> there has been a recent recruitment programme which has taken in a larger number of catholics than protestants <e> <s> the latter would therefore under a last in first out criterion go <e>", "<cs> i should also like very strongly to oppose the amendment <e> <s> i speak as an ex-lecturer who fought i forget how many elections while still working as a lecturer <e> <s> i was not it is true a principal or vice-principal but i take it that the principle is much the same <e>", "<cs> my lords am i to understand that the privileged objection is based primarily on finance <e> <s> will the noble lord the leader of the house examine again the point which has just been made by the noble lord lord carter <e> <s> we were told by the government front bench that we were talking about people <e> <s> plainly the cost of dealing with people is very different from the cost of dealing with <e> <s> that is surely a matter of fact <e>", "<cs> the committee will correct me if i am wrong but perhaps i may put this point <e> <s> is it not true that if this bill falls because it is thought to be not properly put together and therefore not achieving its object and if the government do not produce their own bill there is nothing in the world to prevent a noble lord from launching a private members bill on precisely the same lines the minute we return after the recess <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that one should raise large questions in response to a statement but one is left absolutely flabbergasted that a change of this magnitude and importance is brought forward now <e> <s> can the noble baroness explain what process of investigation was undertaken before the electricity bill was drafted and which failed to throw up the facts of the issue <e> <s> i realise that this is a big question to ask on a statement but it leaves us speechless <e> <s> who advised the government <e> <s> where did the information come from on which the government based the bill and which overlooked this trivial little matter of nuclear energy <e>", "<cs> we on these benches would like to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> sexist <e>", "<cs> my lords the people in the industry are the people who produced the wrong figures are they not <e>", "<cs> my lords at this time of night i shall endeavour to be brief <e> <s> i am delighted to be able to congratulate the noble earl lord caithness on his new appointment <e> <s> we have all enjoyed sparring with him in his previous incarnations <e> <s> we shall continue no doubt to enjoy sparring with him in his new role <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord henley on his promotion to this present position <e> <s> with the agreeable inconsistency of your lordships house we wish him the very best of luck and we intend to give him a very bad time <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale on the brilliant lucidity with which he explained this report <e> <s> on the face of it it looks a relatively simple matter but it is simple only to those who have not tried to understand it <e> <s> it is full of complex and difficult issues which will have to be thought through and worked out very carefully indeed if we are to achieve the results which we all want to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to have that explanation from the noble lord lord stallard and i apologise if i misunderstood him <e> <s> however i disagree with him in that full retirement pensions for everybody at at what would be an acceptable and adequate pension would be pretty costly <e> <s> i believe that the retirement pensions like retirement age should be graduated <e> <s> personally and this is purely a personal view i would drop the flexibility to a point lower than <e> <s> for quite a lot of people i believe that a small pension at with the opportunity to earn money in other ways might be very acceptable <e> <s> if people go on working for a much longer period their pensions should be correspondingly enhanced <e>", "<cs> my lords i have very little to add to what was said by the noble baroness lady jeger but i want to stress our great dissatisfaction with having these regulations brought before us so late <e> <s> the point of regulations is that they deal with broad principles in a great deal of detail and a great deal of detail needs a great deal of time to be properly absorbed and the implications fully understood <e> <s> it is unreasonable to expect us to have studied absorbed and thought about these regulations and then discuss them in this house at such short notice <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will realise that i have already been kind to him once this morning <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall take advantage of the ministers offer to be disagreeable <e> <s> it seems a little odd that the information has gone out before the regulations have been put through parliament <e> <s> i thought that they had to be approved by parliament <e> <s> if they have not been approved how can they properly give publicity on the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble earl agree that in the past six months the amount of the balance of payments deficit due to investment has fallen dramatically and that it is alleged that no more than per cent <e> <s> of it can be accounted for in that way <e>", "<cs> speaking as a lambeth ratepayer and knowing the difficulty in getting lambeth to reply to any letters at all i can say that one year is much too short a time to complete any dealings with such an authority <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the noble viscount will agree that the fact that standards have improved does not necessarily mean that they are good <e> <s> it depends what they were like before <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like strongly to support what has been said by the noble lord the leader of the official opposition and in particular to stress the way in which training issues are being handled <e> <s> they should not be tagged on to an employment bill <e> <s> because of their importance they require a bill in their own right <e> <s> but to bring about the reconstruction of the industrial training boards to which many of us have attached a great deal of importance as amendments to the bill at this stage is treating the whole issue of training with contempt <e>", "<cs> i strongly support this amendment not only in the interests of women but because it is becoming urgent that we should find ways of recruiting more women into the labour market encouraging them back and making it easy for them to return after child bearing <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a point here to reinforce the argument put forward by my noble friend lord tordoff <e> <s> it concerns the situation where there is a clamour as sometimes occurs among employees about people who are so infected <e> <s> the employers hand would be greatly strengthened should he wish to support a person suffering from hiv if he could say i am not permitted to discriminate against this person <e> <s> pressure of this kind exists <e> <s> for an employer who is under pressure from many quarters for different reasons this is an added pressure <e> <s> it would be most helpful for him if he could say that he cannot agree to what is said because the law does not allow him to do so <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may take up a point made by the minister <e> <s> the point that is so frequently made is that there is the unfair discrimination protection <e> <s> but unfair discrimination decisions at a tribunal rarely involve reinstatement they involve compensation <e> <s> however a person with that condition wants a job <e> <s> he does not want compensation <e> <s> compensation helps a little but it is a job that he wants <e> <s> since reinstatement is so rarely used by a tribunal the defence that he is covered because he can go to a tribunal under the anti-discrimination legislation does not stand up <e>", "<cs> we should also like to welcome the amendment but it is too good an opportunity to miss not to ask the minister to think again about one or two possible additions <e> <s> i take his point that to extend the provision to a wide range of parents would cost a great deal of money but there is one group of women whom i ask him to consider before the next stage <e>", "<cs> i very much hope that the minister will at least consider this amendment <e> <s> i have never understood the logic of putting together regulations which apply to women and to young persons of between and years <e> <s> there is remarkably little in common that i have ever been able to note between a woman of say or a woman of child-bearing age and a hefty young man of <e> <s> why the same regulation should be applied to them has always been a mystery to me <e>", "<cs> what does the minister say in light of the fact that the numbers of health and safety inspectors have been cut <e> <s> if the noble lord has had anything to do with the industry he will know perfectly well that the legislation is only enforced by inspectors coming round and that it is extremely easy to evade inspection because i have done it <e>", "<cs> i interrupt again because the noble lord has not answered my point <e> <s> later on the noble lord will tell us that he believes in training <e> <s> i ask how this permission to work youngsters all the hours god sends can be in line with encouraging proper training for to year-olds <e> <s> does he or does he not believe that young people of that age must be made better use of so that they are properly trained and competent for the labour market of the future <e> <s> he has not answered that in any way <e>", "<cs> thank goodness for that <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord agree that the pit ponies did not have any option but the women will <e>", "<cs> the noble lord mentioned the example of a woman mining engineer <e> <s> will he answer this straight question if a woman says i am perfectly physically fit but i cant stand the idea of going underground so i shant take that job will she or will she not be disallowed benefit <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord yet again <e> <s> i support the relaxation of the provisions which prevent women working underground <e> <s> however i am bound to say that if the noble lord will not agree to this change and it is a big change to allow women to work underground then perhaps he could agree to a provision which states that a woman has the right to refuse such work at least for a period of years if not indefinitely without losing her entitlement to benefit <e>", "<cs> i think that i gave the minister the answer <e> <s> i recognise that in saying what i said that there should be an exemption for women one might say that that breaches strict discrimination because men are unable to refuse <e> <s> the difference is that women have never before been down the pits <e> <s> the government are introducing something new which to some women is a frightening prospect <e> <s> that is why i asked the noble lord whether he could consider this provision at least for a period of years <e> <s> it may be that in a generations time young women will feel differently about the matter <e> <s> there are women today to whom the provision could apply and for whom the prospect would be terrifying <e> <s> for that reason i am prepared to be inconsistent <e> <s> one does not always have to be consistent about everything <e> <s> i simply ask that for a period of time women should have the right to choose <e>", "<cs> surely the minister will agree on the question of transport so that both sexes are able to work night shifts from the age of if this goes through <e> <s> is he really saying that he thinks that it is satisfactory that girls of should leave the factory at am to make their way home as best they can <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says boys too <e> <s> let us not be discriminatory <e> <s> but the minister knows perfectly well the state of the streets <e> <s> i do not know whether he has a daughter <e> <s> he may not even have a wife for all i know <e> <s> but if he has a daughter would he really like her to be coming home night after night at am if there is inadequate transport <e> <s> the tubes may have stopped running <e> <s> how is she to get home <e> <s> can we not at least specify transport in the welfare provision <e> <s> that is a minimum surely if nothing else <e> <s> it is a very serious consideration if young girls are to try to find their way home at am <e>", "<cs> i really cannot let this go <e> <s> does the minister understand that yes there is choice of employment in many parts of the south-east where people do not have to take a particular job but that in many areas of the country there is no choice <e> <s> in small towns with smaller employers there is not much choice of employment <e> <s> the government are punch drunk in their enthusiasm for smaller employers however such employers are often the people who make the worst arrangements for their employees <e> <s> the minister must be in cloud cuckoo land if he thinks that a great employment market operates between a girl of and an employer who controls one of the few opportunities of employment in the area where she lives <e> <s> that situation does not constitute a market <e> <s> all we are asking is that a minimum transport protection should be provided for women and particularly girls if they are going to be employed on the night shift <e> <s> there are areas in the country where the choice of job is extremely limited <e> <s> i know the minister knows this but he does not seem to take my point <e> <s> in those areas if women do not accept the night shift work they will not get any work at all <e> <s> it is not asking a lot to ensure that transport arrangements are provided as a right for women working on night shifts <e> <s> i ask the minister to think again about this matter <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord think that all employers in the midlands and the north-east are like the employers in the house of lords <e> <s> if he does he should

of things which the government have done and i accept that they have made progress in this area <e> <s> has he any evidence about results <e> <s> if they have brought in these new initiatives they

<e>", "<cs> my lords does the house not agree that we seem to hear rather more about the scots than we do about the angles <e>", "<cs> we on these benches have supported a considerable amount of the governments trade union legislation but surely enough is enough <e> <s> if we are to move into a more prosperous time as we all hope then it is absolutely essential that we should have a responsible trades union movement working collaboratively with employers though doing their proper job of representing employee interests <e> <s> why must the government niggle at the trades unions in this way

he will think before he says get your cards and go <e> <s> that is real life <e> <s> i fear that the noble lord has never been near real life <e>", "<cs> the noble lord did not answer my point that this matter is of considerable importance in the internal operations of disciplinary and dismissal systems <e> <s> this is a controlled exercise namely that an employer has to put in writing the reasons for dismissal <e> <s> now there will be no protection until two years have elapsed against arbitrary dismissal <e> <s> as happens again and again a foreman becomes fed up and tells someone that he must go <e> <s> if he has to put that in writing he hesitates before doing so for no good reason <e> <s> the noble lord has not answered that point <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has been brought up in a totally legalistic system of industrial relations <e> <s> however he must understand that a great deal goes on inside industry which has not much to do with legal enforcement <e> <s> however these are valuable controls over the way in which people behave and for ensuring just dealings between people in positions of <e>", "<cs> the point is that now a person has no access to a tribunal

from a trade union background although i have belonged to one to hear what the noble lord has to say <e> <s> i have been frightened by some of the governments trade union legislation although earlier on i backed it <e> <s> the minister appears to me to be saying that strikes are an improper action to be taken by trade unionists even after a ballot <e> <s> if it is never proper to take strike action how can there be an appropriate balance of power between the union and the employer <e> <s> that is what it is all about <e> <s> freedom of association which is a basic freedom is meaningless

labour <e> <s> if they do not have the right to withdraw their labour the whole thing is a farce <e> <s> if trade unions can be sacked wholesale because they have taken part in a properly conducted

presented with a <e>", "<cs> it does not <e> <s> the minister has made an assertion <e> <s> he says that things will be better but has not given a single reason why that should be <e> <s> we need an analysis and information as to why there will be an improvement <e> <s> the government front bench are constantly doing this <e> <s> they stand up and make assertions and hardly ever produce any

done so <e> <s> that being so what evidence is there and we are asking for evidence that it will now do something different <e>", "<cs> before the minister tells us that employers will look after all this in their own enlightened self interest i should like to ask him one or two questions <e> <s> he has said that yts is now the great recognised challenge for people going into employment and that it provides an excellent training <e> <s> i was closely associated with yts until the minister arbitrarily abolished all the boards connected with it <e> <s> not that that matters there are many other jobs to do <e>", "<cs> i did not answer the noble lord when he challenged me over day-time release <e> <s> of course i do not believe that day-time release is the be-all and end-all of training <e>

complementary training of a practical kind with some kind of day-time release in many cases but not in all cases <e>", "<cs> the minister must realise that there is an age-long tradition of trade union involvement in training <e> <s> the trade unions have taken an active part <e> <s> sometimes they have been obstructive i do not agree entirely with the noble baroness lady turner <e> <s> not all unions in all areas have been favourable <e> <s> but many have <e> <s> good training cannot be carried out inside an organisation unless there is active support from employees <e>", "<cs> as a mere englishman i hesitate to raise my voice in this debate <e> <s> but i wonder whether the minister has satisfactorily answered the point made by the noble baroness with regard to avoiding any discrimination as between the two types of schools <e> <s> the minister said that the provision was not included in the bill affecting england and wales <e> <s> perhaps we should have put it in <e> <s> it is possible that a subsequent administration not the present one might decide that they wanted to favour one type of school rather than another <e> <s> many of us feel that that would be extremely undesirable <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i have misunderstood everything but i thought that i had got the position clear <e> <s> perhaps it would help if i said what i thought to be the situation <e> <s> i think that the minister means if i may put words into his mouth that as long as the existing chap stays in the job he keeps his existing conditions of employment <e> <s> when he goes and a new person is appointed to step into his shoes in that position that new person is subject to the new law <e> <s> is that right <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards compensation for financial loss the minister gave an extraordinary answer <e> <s> he said that very few people were concerned which means that it will not cost much <e> <s> that must be very appealing to the government <e> <s> he then said that it would complicate the administration <e> <s> surely providing a small number of people with a financial loss payment cannot be beyond the wit of people who are handling these enormously complicated and difficult local authority finances <e> <s> i find that an extraordinary situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble earl <e> <s> i have not so far taken part in this bill but all of us are obviously extremely concerned about homelessness as i know is the noble earl <e> <s> it seems quite extraordinary that we are passing a housing bill at the end of october if this report is to be published at the end of november <e> <s> presumably this report will produce recommendations which can be put into effect only by some form of legislation <e> <s> can the minister give us an undertaking because it will be too late for it to be included in this bill that parliamentary time will be available to take action on the report which is to be published at the end of november <e> <s> this is a matter which is worrying people and which is quite outside party lines <e> <s> one has only to walk around the streets of london to feel thoroughly ashamed <e>

most of the points but i should like to stress the great importance of retaining women in employment <e> <s> we shall need them desperately <e> <s> if they have an established right to come back then obviously they are more likely to do so than if they have to apply again as anybody else would do who has not previously been in the firm or organisation <e> <s> therefore to limit it to the shortest possible period of time to establish rights is in the interests of the employer as well as of the woman <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord raises a very important point <e> <s> it is true that at one stage there were facilities provided for training women who did not qualify because they had been receiving unemployment benefit <e> <s> but the numbers were very limited <e> <s> have those numbers very greatly increased recently <e> <s> that is part of our objectives <e> <s> those places were valued but initially the numbers were very small <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no point in dividing the house on the amendment <e> <s> i very much hope that the government will bear it in mind <e> <s> i hear in the ministers reply traces of sympathy with the objective <e> <s> if we keep on long enough he may realise that it really is in everybodys interests that it should be made as easy as possible for these women to return to work <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i found some difficulty with the word conscience as regards working underground <e> <s> nonetheless i hope that the government will think again about this matter which we discussed at considerable length on second reading and in committee <e> <s> i believe that the arguments put forward then were more powerful than the arguments put forward today by the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> i understand that he has done this because he is desperately looking for a suitable phrase to put in at this stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think much of what the noble lord says about current medical opinion <e> <s> a good deal of his argument rests on the force of the general provisions and the work of the health and safety executive <e> <s> that is fine if that body is adequately staffed <e> <s> can the minister say how many establishments there are to each inspector <e> <s> in the old days i was in industry for years i never had one full-blown inspection because there were not enough inspectors to go round <e> <s> they would come in occasionally to look for one particular point <e> <s> the minister talks as though the general requirements are adequately enforced because there are inspectors <e> <s> that flies in the face of reality with the limited number of inspectors <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask for another fact not an opinion <e> <s> how many establishments under the factories legislation are to be inspected by the existing inspectors <e> <s> that is the interesting figure <e> <s> we can then do a sum and work out how often they will visit any one establishment <e> <s> i am sure that the advisers in the box have the figure <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords if the requirement existed employers would not be able to discourage them <e> <s> that is another point <e> <s> on a previous occasion at committee stage i asked what percentage of youngsters taken on in that age group who were not on yts were being released for training <e> <s> the answer that i was given from the government front bench was per cent <e> <s> that suggests that it is not just a small number of employers who are not releasing young people for training <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord had given me any response to what i said at the very beginning namely that if he did not like the form of the amendment he would meet the points that i had made in some other way at third reading i should have been prepared to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> but he has not answered any of the points that i raised <e> <s> he has said nothing about how one squares the relaxation on hours of work and the introduction of shift work and night work for to year-olds with proper training programmes <e> <s> he said extremely complacently how good the youth training scheme is but those of us who have been close to it know that some of it has been very good and some of it has been anything but very good <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to prolong this already overlong discussion but did the minister say that the post office would use volunteers <e> <s> who on earth are these volunteers and what will the unions say about their introduction for the delivery of sunday mail <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask for clarification from the lawyers on the interpretation by the noble lord lord houghton of indirect discrimination <e> <s> i believe that it is extremely important in this context <e> <s> as i understand it it is not a question of intent but that if a requirement is laid down which cannot be fulfilled by a substantial proportion of one ethnic minority an employer is guilty of discrimination <e> <s> however he is not guilty of discrimination if he can show that that requirement is justifiable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am on the ministers side on this matter but we must have better arguments than that <e> <s> if the hard hats regulation is introduced to reduce accidents and then certain people are exempted from wearing them as a matter of plain logic the number of accidents as compared with now will be reduced but there will still be more accidents than if everybody had to wear a hard hat <e>", "<cs> my lords it states quite clearly that one can bring in a defence of it being justifiable <e> <s> there is no question about that <e> <s> it can be argued that it is justifiable <e> <s> your lordships will remember cases concerning women and the requirement of height <e> <s> if an employer said that a woman had to be six foot tall and could show that she could not do the job unless she was then the discrimination was justifiable <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships may agree that it is quite a novel idea that a third reading speech should be half as long again as a second reading speech <e> <s> i can assure noble lords that i have no intention of competing in the stakes for the longest speech in the winding up of a bill <e> <s> however i should like to say that i found this bill extremely disappointing <e> <s> it is doctrinaire and rigid it is a bill of lost opportunities <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a great sense of unreality about the debate <e> <s> the truth of the matter is that of course the conservative party wants to <e>", "<cs> my lords i should hike to ask the noble and learned lord to consider once again the point raised by the noble lord lord prys-davies about the upper-age limit <e> <s> the suggestion in the amendment is that it should be raised to the age of <e> <s> i am sorry that it has not been proposed that the age limit should go even higher <e>", "<cs> my lords they become naughtier <e>", "<cs> my lords i must support my noble friend lord meston in his complaint about the amendment <e> <s> it treats your lordships house with not even something approaching contempt but with actual contempt <e> <s> it makes an absolute mockery of the whole proceedings when we are given this amount of material at this stage and no opportunity of going through it <e> <s> we on these beaches take an extremely poor view of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord peston replies i would ask whether we may have some comment on the remarks made by my noble friend lord airedale <e> <s> they concerned noble lords on the government front bench speaking to amendments which are to be moved but which have not been moved from these benches <e> <s> the noble viscount lord ullswater said that he hoped that he understood the noble lord lord peston correctly <e> <s> i suggest that he would have a better chance of understanding the noble lord correctly if he waited to hear what he had to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that explanation <e> <s> i do not wish to prolong the discussion at this time of night <e> <s> however i think the noble lord will be aware that what with the nature of some of the amendments which have come back from the commons in vast numbers and the late placing of government amendments we feel that the position of the opposition is now being made almost impossible by the way the government are conducting their business <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to ask for the support of the house in challenging a preliminary decision of the leader of the house who turned down a request this morning for a statement to be made on the white paper on community care <e> <s> this question has been put down because in todays edition of <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the leader of the house saying that the statement in <e>", "<cs> my lords it is all very well for the noble viscount to say that it is in the interests of industry to have a good education system that is of course true but is he really saying that this is the financial responsibility of industry <e> <s> surely it is the financial responsibility of government and local authorities and not of industry <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have read and reread the gracious speech and have listened through four days of debate not let me say to every single speech but to a considerable number it has come over with increasing force that there is the sharpest contrast between the admirable objectives laid down in the gracious speech and the means to carry out those objectives described in it <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to apologise to the house and to the noble lord lord henley in particular <e> <s> owing to an engagement into which i entered long before i knew that this debate would take place i shall not be in my seat when the noble lord replies <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl is really so worried about the retrospective nature of the payment and throughout this discussion i have been waiting for him to say that what on earth is there to prevent the government producing a single one-clause bill to ensure that these particular widows will be given a pension <e> <s> one need not tack it on to previous legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords can we not enjoy the advantages as well as the disadvantags of that position and get some money from the state <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister suggest to his noble friend that the government should reverse their attitude towards the lingua programme in order to speed up the learning of foreign languages <e>", "<cs> my lords it is interesting to note that when the noble lord needs words to describe something which is really good they are the words that he finds <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a former member of the top salaries review body although i served on it some years ago now <e> <s> the members of that body discussed these matters <e> <s> the decision was made rightly or wrongly to link these salaries to a civil service grade <e> <s> following the speech of the noble lord lord lucas i should like to know whether these other matters such as the london allowance and other payments are being sufficiently considered <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord prys-davies i am amazed to find that a document of this size should be a regulation which we cannot amend or by convention in this house reject <e> <s> i wish to ask the noble lord lord skelmersdale whether there is any precedent for a document of this kind being presented as a regulation <e> <s> it is in fact a bill <e> <s> there is no question about that <e> <s> the fact that a great deal of it though by no means all is similar to the education act passed for england and wales is no excuse for not having a proper parliamentary debate <e> <s> it cannot be described as anything other than a bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much hope that the house will not accept the amendment moved by the noble duke <e> <s> we have been discussing the question of abortion and revision of the abortion legislation for a very long time <e> <s> moreover last year with the alton bill a great deal of parliamentary time was given to the issue and a great deal of discussion took place on the matter throughout the country <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble viscount agree that the boroughs in which the need for such services is greatest are those which will find the greatest problem in paying for them <e> <s> it is not likely that the most hard hit boroughs with serious inner-city problems and with large numbers of unemployed people in ethnic minority groups will be able to finance the services required <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first declare an interest as i am a

agree with the noble lord lord layton that we must set a good example and put our own house in order and each before our own door sweep and all the other good advice which we have given it surely is

they can be tracked down at once <e> <s> i know that i signed something but i cannot now find it <e> <s> if i should be run over i wager that the piece of paper that i signed some time ago will not be

chancellor answer this <e> <s> when he puts in his estimate if he receives all that he has asked for and is satisfied he can then staff the county courts to do the job that <e>", "<cs> will the noble and learned lord comment on the point that the purpose of the amendment might be better served by strengthening the powers of the local ombudsman <e>", "<cs> if the two greatest legal minds in the country at the present time disagree about the meaning of this legislation what hope is there for ordinary mortals such as the rest of us to understand what is going on <e> <s> is that not a strong argument for at least having another look at the wording of the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords since the minister has said that the government are opposed to political bias in such appointments perhaps i may ask this question <e> <s> does it not cause him grave anxiety when he learns that some authorities are apparently exercising political bias because the only appointments they are making come from

servants <e> <s> it recommended that negotiations should take place within the inter-quartile range in comparison with the private sector <e> <s> that would seem to be particularly appropriate to such people as ambulance workers <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the problem of cutting down forests in those countries is linked with their population explosion and poverty and there is an urgent need for policy to be directed towards those issues <e>", "<cs> my lords some while ago it was agreed that not every speaker would congratulate a maiden speaker on his speech <e> <s> however i intend to continue to break the rules for the speech of the noble lord lord sharp of grimsdyke was so exceptionally brilliant and so extraordinarily relevant and valuable in todays debate that one

life which is thought to be near to the heart of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to thank the noble viscount for repeating the statement <e> <s> i must say that a statement which is pages long and which reached us less than half an hour before we had to comment on it makes considerably difficult the proper operation of the task of this house in commenting on

any financial obligations towards the child <e> <s> that is one thing but if there is no such obligation and all the child obtains is the knowledge that a certain person was the donor but that the donor has no obligation whatsoever towards him does that make any difference in the view of the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord agree that the question was correct in saying employees in that there are a few fathers who have to look after children <e> <s> in addition the noble lord says that the government are encouraging employers to provide crches <e> <s>

by whom one is employed that matters not whether a person is employed <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment not as a legal person but as the woman <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the noble and learned lord a direct question <e> <s> in these circumstances is the solicitors primary loyalty to the building society or to the individual purchaser <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not speak when the noble lord lord simon of glaisdale made his proposal that the house do adjourn <e> <s> i make the point completely out of order but it seems to me that the amendment raises a matter of very considerable importance which ought to be discussed in a fuller house with people more wide awake than they are at this time <e> <s> i do not know whether there is a way out of this difficulty but i think it most unfortunate that we proceed on this matter at such a late hour in an empty house <e>", "<cs> my lords does <e>", "<cs> my lords this afternoon we discussed two themes the minor theme in a sense of the amendment moved by my noble friend lord russell and the major theme of the bill this skimpy little bill which is all that the government have given us to discuss on this very important matter of student loans <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that it is just as much a doctrine to believe in the free market a doctrine which i happen to share with him as it is to believe in public ownership <e> <s> it is not a matter of being doctrinaire <e> <s> one is not only doctrinaire because one believes in socialist doctrines <e> <s> there are other better doctrines in which we all believe <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister any information on how many mentally ill people are being held in prison simply because there is no other accommodation for them <e> <s> is it planned that when secure units are available within the health service the health service will be required to accept such people <e> <s> at present if there is no place for offenders to go the prisons cannot refuse them even though it is known that prison is a totally unsuitable place for them <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to say first that i know that my noble friend lord jenkins of hillhead deeply regrets that he is unable to be here at the start of the committee stage <e> <s> he would like to have spoken in appreciation of his former very much respected colleague <e> <s> i should also like to say that we shall miss him very much and that this afternoon particularly we shall miss his wise contribution to education <e> <s> he was a true professional in the field of education and understood the enormous importance of this question <e> <s> we greatly regret that he will not be here for our debates <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that we went through this matter on second reading and voted against it <e> <s> most of the people who voted against it were not here when we discussed it <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment strongly particularly in the interests of older women who have not had great educational advantages or have not taken advantage of them in the past <e> <s> many women while they are at home with small children can embark on periods of part-time study and get themselves to the point at which when they are free to come back into the labour market they are well on the road to if not completely arrived at the level of qualification which will enable them to take a job at a higher level <e> <s> they are the people whom we badly need in the labour market capable of doing the more demanding and skilled jobs <e>", "<cs> the minister did not answer the points i made about women at home who are not being paid for by anyone <e> <s> he said that many part-time students are paid for by their employers <e> <s> women at home are not paid for by anyone <e> <s> they or their husbands have to meet all the expenses that they inevitably incur <e> <s> they are the very people who could for example be trained to be teachers <e> <s> that is the job that they are likely to take up <e> <s> we have the greatest difficulty in getting teachers <e> <s> even with what they are paid when they start teaching teachers will start repaying quickly what they have been given as part-time students <e> <s> do we or do we not want more teachers <e> <s> where shall we get them unless we tap the big reserves of women who wish to get back into the labour market <e> <s> to ignore them could not be more economically short-sighted or educationally foolish <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to prolong the debate but surely the position is quite straightforward that these students came in under the expectation of certain conditions a grant plus social security benefits <e> <s> to put it bluntly the noble earl has not answered the accusation of bad faith <e> <s> if he wants to keep faith with the contract which formally or informally was entered into he needs to say to the students who are already at university that next year or until they finish their course they will have in real terms the grant that the government offered them it will not be increased by per cent <e> <s> it will be at least per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> by the time we reach next year <e> <s> they thought they were being offered per cent <e> <s> plus the maintenance of their social security benefits when they went to university <e> <s> the noble earl shakes his head but that is what they understood they would receive <e>", "<cs> the point overlooked by the noble baroness lady carnegy is not what may happen when a person applies for a job having undertaken a degree course perhaps some years earlier and then having started a family <e> <s> the debts will have built up <e> <s> i do not much fancy the idea of a labour market in which one relies on going to the employer and saying by the way you will pay off my debt wont you <e> <s> i do not think that that is good practice <e> <s> however that is another matter <e> <s> what is being overlooked in this discussion is whether people will take the courses in the first place <e> <s> i find the vague prospect that in the future when one has passed all ones exams the employer will like one so much that he will pay off all the debts an unconvincing argument <e> <s> will a young woman who is deciding whether or not to go to university or an older woman coming back to take a course we have now been told that they will receive no encouragement to do <e>", "<cs> yes but <e>", "<cs> i cannot let the noble baroness get away with that about the overseas students <e> <s> it is of course true that the numbers have increased but she is well aware that the universities and colleges have gone hawking their courses around the world attracting the wealthy student as against a time when i was teaching them at the london school of economics when we had large numbers of students from developing countries who were hard up and paid for in all sorts of ways fifth cousins sending contributions and not sending them which was even worse <e> <s> that is how they reached the colleges <e> <s> we have the students but we have kept out many good students whom we previously had <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down perhaps she can answer the question which i raised on a number of occasions and to which i have not yet had a reply <e> <s> we are constantly told that loans will not be a deterrent to people in this country because they have not been a deterrent in other countries <e> <s> that seems to me to be a very odd argument <e> <s> up till now these courses have been free students have not had to pay <e> <s> while they were free they have not attracted sufficient women and people from lower income groups <e> <s> on the governments own labour market argument if the idea of education cannot be sold when it is free do they think it can be sold when it is not free <e>", "<cs> i ask the minister to recognise that to skimp on books is to spoil the ship for a haporth of tar <e> <s> in any decent university one can manage without staff better than one can manage without books <e> <s> we shall be down to this ghastly business which one sees in a few places where students rely on taking down lecture notes <e> <s> that is the absolute opposite of anything that can be described as a decent university education <e> <s> one has to have books or one might as well shut up the whole place <e>", "<cs> i was hoping that instead of a loan the government would stump up and pay for child care <e>", "<cs> i should like to digest at leisure what the noble baroness said when i am rather more awake <e> <s> however i hope that the whole question of child care and the cost of it will be very carefully considered if it is desired to persuade these women to return <e>", "<cs> i should like to reinforce what the noble baroness has just said <e> <s> those who have worked with students know that a small percentage drop out as a result of breakdown <e> <s> i assure the noble earl that any idea that those people will get good jobs because they have had one and a half years at university a breakdown and psychiatric treatment is absolute pie in the sky <e> <s> they are the most difficult people to help <e> <s> to say that they will not have to pay it back because they are not receiving per cent <e> <s> of average national income is only deferring repayment <e> <s> they still have that debt <e>", "<cs> i wish to support this amendment very strongly <e> <s> i was interested to hear what the noble lord lord peston said <e> <s> a long time ago i like the noble lord arrived at the conclusion that there was a strong case for loans for taught masters courses <e> <s> it is extremely important that the government should recognise that finance for these courses is highly desirable <e> <s> by definition the people coming on the taught masters courses are by and large but not exclusively the cream of the undergraduate population <e> <s> we talk about quality <e> <s> if we want quality we must develop the ablest people among the students to the highest degree possible <e> <s> that means the taught courses with expansion in undergraduate courses <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord lord peston will agree with me but i have observed a tendency to put it bluntly to do a slightly more mass produced job on the undergraduate courses than some of us would think desirable <e> <s> this has partly been because there has been an increasing reliance on the fourth year of the taught masters in order to give the quality of teaching to the people with the greatest level of ability <e> <s> what i can see happening if we do not provide loan provision for taught masters courses is that the mass produced approach to the undergraduate courses undergraduate students are apparently to be taught without books according to what we have been discussing recently will go ahead and we shall lose the quality in the undergraduate courses without picking it up again by providing good masters courses for the people who are capable of taking them <e>", "<cs> is there not some doubt about that <e> <s> i thought that the noble lords party was going to abolish us so he will not be in a position to do that will he <e>", "<cs> if i understood what the noble earl said there will be a restricted number of places and resources for people doing research supervised research students and they will be selected according to somebodys criteria of what are important subjects to study <e> <s> i should dearly like to <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the attack made by the noble lord lord carter on the degree and depth of poverty experienced by certain sections of the population in this country today <e> <s> before he nods his head in too much approval of what i have just said however i do not accept either his analysis or his prescription <e> <s> before the labour party makes so much of what has happened to the change in income tax level it should remember that the level was changed from the quite absurd and the party admits by its present schemes that is was quite absurd top level of tax of per cent <e> <s> for income and per cent <e> <s> for investment income <e>", "<cs> my lords following the question of the noble baroness lady faithfull will the minister assure us that in the inquiry that is being undertaken we shall have full information as to whether these young persons have come out of care <e> <s> if the answer is that a high percentage has i am sure that the noble earl will agree that it has important implications for our care policies <e> <s> is that information being sought in the process of the inquiry <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down in view of what he has just said and his admission that manual records are not covered by the data protection act perhaps i may ask him whether that means that manually held records of students loans could for example be sold for mail order purposes <e> <s> is tha what it means <e> <s> could we have an answer yes or no to that question <e>", "<cs> the minister refers to reading the small print <e> <s> would it not have been a good idea to put more of that into the bill <e>", "<cs> the point about manual records is very important <e> <s> the noble earl said that the same rules will apply to written records as to computerised records <e> <s> however as i understand it that is not in the data protection act and is not written on the face of the bill <e> <s> therefore the only guarantee which we have is what the noble earl has said but that is no guarantee at all when one comes to a court of law <e> <s> the noble earl believes that and wants that to happen but if it is not in the data protection act or written into this bill then there is no protection <e>", "<cs> surely the point as has been pointed out over and over again is that the act was one that was accepted throughout the house and therefore there was much less controversy about it <e> <s> so it is not a very good argument to say that because it was done in the act it is perfectly all right to do it in the act <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl replies perhaps i may anticipate what may be in many peoples minds <e> <s> i know that a number of people believe that during vacations it is appropriate for students to earn money to pay for the costs and to replace the grants and allowances which have been removed <e> <s> i wish to put the the strongest possible opposition to the idea <e> <s> i accept that the odd job from <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down perhaps i may ask him what reaction he has received from the universities and polytechnics to the suggestion that they should administer the access funds <e> <s> it is not only a major administrative task it is one that many academics would be extremely unwilling to undertake <e> <s> it means making judgments about the amount of money to be given to student a as distinct from student b i should not have liked to do that job <e> <s> it could be an extremely invidious task <e> <s> can the noble earl tell the committee whether the academic institutions have expressed any opinion about being asked to make such a discrimination between individual students <e>", "<cs> once again the noble earl has not answered the point <e> <s> he says that this matter will be dealt with by regulations <e> <s> however even under the affirmative regulation procedure there is no way in which we can argue about the amount of money <e> <s> that is why my noble friend wants this written into the bill <e> <s> i have already said that once this afternoon but the noble earl repeated the totally unsatisfactory answer which he gave before <e> <s> that does not meet our problem which is that the affirmative resolution procedure gives us no opportunity to vary the amount of money <e>", "<cs> despite all his great experience the noble lord lord callaghan overlooked the fact that it is not the people who heard the argument who will decide the vote but the people who have not heard it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for those remarks and of course i will do as he requests <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the noble lord lord peston particularly as my name is down to amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> i shall be brief as i do not have a great deal to add to what the noble lord has said except to underline that this is an opportunity for the government to help us out of what will be an extraordinarily difficult position as the government have often stressed in finding people for certain professions <e> <s> the amendment provides an instrument which could be used quickly at times of acute undermanning of these central occupations <e> <s> it will be extremely difficult to fill such vacancies unless some financial incentive can be provided quickly outside improvements in the pay structure by letting people off loan payments <e> <s> in the interests not sc much of the major purposes of this bill but rather of providing the government with an instrument to help us out of our future difficult labour market problems i urge the government strongly to accept these amendments <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has not taken the point that i was trying to make in amendment no <e> <s> b which was not primarily about protection for students <e> <s> the amendment is an instrument for dealing with a serious position in the labour market as regards recruitment <e> <s> the noble baroness says that students will not be worried about paying back the loan because the pay level is so low that they have to reach <e> <s> i am afraid that the argument is very much on the other side <e> <s> presumably the people whom we want to enter nursing and teaching will be people who will stay and move up the career ladder <e> <s> if the loan still has to be repaid the noble baroness said that it will be deferred as the bill indicates as these people progress do better and take on more responsibility they will move into a position at which they will have to start repaying the loan which is scarcely an encouragement <e>", "<cs> but the professions are not named <e> <s> this simply gives the secretary of state the right to do that where he sees fit <e> <s> they are not named professions <e> <s> when he is suddenly aware that he will not obtain his nurses and the teachers he can say that over the next five-year period people coming into those professions will not have to repay the loans <e> <s> we have not listed them <e> <s> it is for him to choose <e>", "<cs> i should like to emphasise the word male in these amendments <e> <s> the government refer to the average wage but the average male wage and the average female wage are quite different <e> <s> combining the two gives a much lower figure at which students will have to start paying back loans than if average male earnings are taken <e> <s> that is why i put the word male in my amendment <e> <s> what is the actual figure we are talking about <e>", "<cs> we have heard no good arguments to say that it is right <e> <s> the noble earl has not answered my question as to whether average earnings refer to male or male and female taken together <e> <s> it can be one or the other but we should be clear as to which it is <e> <s> the noble earl knows perfectly well that the two figures are different <e> <s> which figures is he talking about <e>", "<cs> i do not want to delay the committee but i should like to ask the minister to <e>", "<cs> the noble earl will admit will he not that the first money was spent and the second amount of money was lent <e> <s> there is a difference <e>", "<cs> in view of what the noble lord said if the academic concerned the headmistress for example decided that she would not be prepared to act as a referee what would be the <e>", "<cs> from these benches we have repeatedly said that we accept that there must be a system of repayment <e> <s> we must not let it be said that everybody is opposing a system of repayment <e>", "<cs> before the minister gets away with that cheap jibe perhaps i may point out that we do not have to accept every mortal thing that goes on in europe because we are good europeans <e> <s> we believe in getting into europe putting our point of view and arguing when we do not agree <e> <s> if the government did that we would be a great deal further on the way <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the anxiety about psychiatric treatment and training at the maudsley can the noble baroness confirm that there is no truth in the rumours that the cassel hospital is also under threat of some closures because that in its turn is an extremely famous hospital providing care and training in the same important field <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of boring your lordships i intend to focus on the subject which has already been discussed by the noble baroness lady lockwood and the noble viscount lord craigavon and that is population <e> <s> that being so i must declare an interest <e> <s> as a director of marie stopes international i went to india last year to do some work in connection with the clinics that we run there <e> <s> i shall be spending the easter recess in kenya and zimbabwe studying the development of our clinics and the work that is being carried out there by the organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord gave us figures about overseas students now coming to this country <e> <s> are they broken down by sex <e> <s> as regards those figures can the noble lord tell the house roughly the percentage of men and women <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also thank the noble lord for explaining the order and accept it as it stands <e>", "<cs> my lords we too very much regret that the amendment should have been produced at such very short notice <e> <s> it is not a trivial amendment <e> <s> it affects a large number of young persons and represents a change to the consumer credit act <e> <s> we do not consider that it should have been introduced at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords in the wording of schedule b it says <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble baroness says in no way deals with the problem of the postgraduate student referred to in amendment no <e> <s> who will not receive a loan <e> <s> i want to speak strongly in favour of the retention of housing benefit for those postgraduate students who are without loans <e> <s> they are the cream of the graduate population <e> <s> they are the people by whom the creative and academic roles and a variety of leadership roles will be filled <e> <s> if they are to be starved out of doing graduate work because they have neither loan nor housing benefit then the nation quite apart from the individual graduate will be very much the poorer <e> <s> i strongly hope that the government will reconsider the case for the graduate student as put forward in amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl saying that this is not in fact a different amendment from the one we had last week <e>", "<cs> my lords no one wishes to extend the debate too long but the noble baroness lady david has raised a very practical point <e>

august <e> <s> even then the students do not receive their money until six weeks into term <e> <s> that can be jolly awkward for a student studying for the first year at a university away from home

admission that the government have overlooked it otherwise why is this amendment here except to put right that the government have overlooked it <e> <s> the noble earl may have some reason for complaint about this debate but it certainly cannot be that <e>", "<cs> my lords on these benches we too give a general welcome to the statement realising that it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to take up time but the noble lord referred to my question to which he did not give an answer <e> <s> my point is not what the tecs are thinking about in terms of local need but where a youngster who

therefore also not agree that one of the things we must do urgently is to give very much higher priority to the establishment of effective and relevant training programmes and to see that such programmes are used <e> <s> in many cases there have been good training programmes but their takeup for a whole variety of reasons has been woefully inadequate <e> <s> if the noble earl and his department believe this are they prepared to back a high priority for training not only with words but also with sufficient and additional financial resources <e> <s> i should declare an interest in asking this question because i am chairman of the apex trust which is at the moment with the knowledge of and with some degree of support from the prison department launching new initiatives in training within prisons <e>", "<cs> i sympathise with the object of the amendment but i have the gravest doubts about how it will work <e> <s> i believe that most gps could find a form of words which would be perfectly acceptable as a reason without reflecting the real situation one iota <e> <s> i believe that to talk in legislative terms of a patient being obliged to say why he is leaving a doctor is taking the matter to absurd lengths <e> <s> the most probable reason is that the patient does not like the doctors face or some other totally frivolous reason perhaps the doctor just rubs the patient up in the wrong way <e> <s> this is becoming absolutely ridiculous <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may speak as president of the carers national association <e> <s> i do not have the figures as i was not aware that this subject was coming up but the minister may underrate the extent to which unrelated people do the caring <e> <s> it is not at all uncommon for two women who are friends to live together and do the caring one for the other but there is another important group <e> <s> so many women for one reason or another outlive their husbands <e> <s> you have only to look at the figures to see how many widows there are in the older age groups <e> <s> we tend to go on and on in my sex <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness denigrates the survey carried out by the liberal-democrats does she not agree that it represented a far higher proportion of opticians than is commonly the proportion questioned in opinion polls to which until recently the government have paid a great deal of attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble baroness so soon but we have not heard varying views <e> <s> we have heard uniform views throughout the evening <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter of detail but these additional things which are being added in this area would not have been necessary if the hospital had not been moved <e> <s> they are costs incurred as a result of the move are they not <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness always tells us that she believes this and is confident about that but she never tells us why she believes it or what her confidence is based on <e> <s> we are interested not in her faith but in the facts behind it <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to express my wholehearted support for the amendment <e> <s> however i agree with the noble lord lord carr that it is possible there may be a better way of achieving the same highly desirable result <e> <s> i hope that the government will not tell us that we do not need anything of the kind because market forces inside <e>", "<cs> is it more important that you should not die than that you should not be badly taught <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may support what my noble friend lady robson said and ask the government to view the matter as one of great urgency <e> <s> undoubtedly one of the best ways to reduce the population is to increase the education of women <e> <s> support earmarked for that purpose through government aid and the voluntary organisations which can give it is in the long run probably one of the best ways of doing so <e> <s> cannot the government attach a much greater priority to giving of that kind <e>", "<cs> i too wish to support the amendment to which i have added my name <e> <s> the noble lord lord carter referred to the situation where for financial or other reasons patients are forced out of institutions where they receive proper care or at least something approaching proper care <e> <s> in some cases there is nowhere for them to go but in many cases families will attempt to do something for thern out of a sense of family responsibility <e> <s> however in many cases those families are inadequately equipped to provide the kind of care that is required <e> <s> as a result the patient suffers and the burden that falls on people trying to provide care becomes intolerable <e> <s> i wish to underline that point in particular <e> <s> we cannot overburden carers <e> <s> we shall kill off carers in the attempt to maintain cheaply people who should be in institutions <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may press the noble lord on that point <e> <s> we are not trying to be difficult about it <e> <s> as i see it the crux of the matter is that it is a short-term problem <e> <s> what will happen in the interim to those people who may be forced out <e> <s> unlike so many other problems this problem will come to an end because after the position will <e>", "<cs> although the noble baronesss answer shows that the government have some awareness of the quality problem there is little in the bill itself to reassure us that it will be taken into account <e> <s> we attach such great importance to quality that its failure to figure adequately in the bill means that i must take the opinion of the committee <e>", "<cs> in the light of that near promise and on the strict understanding that if the provision is not to our liking we shall move our amendment at the next stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> although on these benches we have not put our names to these amendments i should like to confirm that we entirely support the idea behind them <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble baroness for giving way <e> <s> she said that the provision mentioned in subsection d would be better dealt with by regulation or by advice and not by provision in the bill <e> <s> it has been said although it is not mentioned in the bill that no one will be discharged from an institution until satisfactory arrangements have been made <e> <s> it is extremely important that that provision should be covered by legislation so that if proper arrangements are not made the matter can be challenged in terms of the legislation <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness can comment on that point <e> <s> what is proposed would give people the right to challenge if it is thought that adequate arrangements have not been made <e> <s> the fact that people may be discharged from hospitals without such arrangements being made is a source of great anxiety <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down i hope that i shall be able to get satisfaction on my point <e> <s> the issue i raise is this <e> <s> suppose someone is discharged and their next of kin or a close friend who will be concerned believes that the plan is inadequate <e> <s> what right have they to challenge it <e> <s> that is what i am getting at <e> <s> if it is in the legislation they have a right of challenge <e> <s> i believe that there should be a right of challenge <e> <s> if the noble baroness can assure me that somewhere in the bill there is the right of the next of kin to challenge a plan as being inadequate then i am happy <e> <s> if that is not so then i am not <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i must apologise for being a bore on the subject will he clarify what he meant when he said that one can appeal against an assessment <e> <s> i hope to get this on the record <e> <s> did he mean by that that if an assessment is made of someone who was coming out of an institution and it is appealed against that person will not leave the institution until the appeal has been settled <e> <s> the important point here concerns whether such a person will be held in an institution until there is a satisfactory plan <e> <s> is that what the noble lord meant <e>", "<cs> i find the response of the noble baroness totally unsatisfactory <e> <s> apparently she has not grasped the point of what we were trying to say <e> <s> it is essential that the carers position and the carers should be on the face of the bill <e> <s> i wish to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am a strong supporter of the social services taking primary responsibility <e> <s> i wish also strongly to support the amendment <e> <s> i fully recognise the point that the noble baroness lady cox has made that at this stage it is vital that those with health and medical expertise should be involved in the assessment <e>", "<cs> is the noble baroness right in saying that the guidance will be issued and if it is not followed the secretary of state will have powers to enforce it <e> <s> that means that the guidance ultimately will have the force of law <e> <s> that being so will we have the opportunity of seeing the guidance regulations when they are produced <e> <s> will they be in the form of an affirmative or negative resolution or not at all <e> <s> will they be sent through the post <e>", "<cs> i support the principle behind the amendment although i am not certain whether the wording is correct <e> <s> surely the noble lord lord seebohm gave a clue about the need for an inspectorate <e> <s> he said that of course the social services departments and the local authorities want their own inspectorate to ensure that they are up to standard but that the person appointed was the deputy director to the director of social services <e> <s> if a subordinate employee is inspecting your work surely there will not be the objectivity to put it mildly that there would be from a regional inspector who is completely independent of the body being inspected <e> <s> that is what we want <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter says that inspectorates tend to proliferate <e> <s> if one looks at the figures as regards the factory inspectorate which is a group with which i am familiar one sees that that inspectorate has proliferated not at all <e> <s> i am not sure about the inspectorate of schools <e> <s> however i challenge whether it is correct to say based on experience that such inspectorates grow and grow <e>", "<cs> i said factory not tax <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness made an interesting comment on the social services inspectorate but can she give the committee any idea of the scale involved <e> <s> there is a great deal of work to be done <e> <s> how many inspectors will there be and what background will they have <e> <s> it may be that they are needed but we should have more information about them <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble baroness for giving way <e> <s> in my opinion her assertions are totally unrealistic <e> <s> perhaps i may give members of the committee an example <e> <s> i once knew an old lady who was dying and who eventually died <e> <s> she was years old and uneducated <e> <s> she had a home help who was a lifeline to her because no one else came to see her except the occasional visitor <e> <s> the home help would say to her oh i do like that vase <e> <s> a long pause would follow and the old lady would say would you like to have it <e> <s> on her next visit she would say i do like that rug <e> <s> that is the kind of situation which will arise <e>", "<cs> does the clause mean the physical premises or the care that goes on within those premises <e> <s> the clause is not clear <e> <s> it could mean either <e>", "<cs> this matter is not clear <e> <s> premises to me suggest a physical building seeing whether the loos are all right and that type of thing not checking on the quality of care given to the inmates <e> <s> the clause may mean that but the wording is not clear <e> <s> we should know which it means <e> <s> i agree that it could mean either <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for the consideration that she has given to this <e> <s> as i said at the beginning i have no intention of pressing the amendment at this stage <e> <s> we shall wait to hear what further clarification the noble baroness can give at a later stage <e> <s> we shall certainly come back to the issue and not leave it at the next stage <e> <s> however i now beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble baroness for giving way <e> <s> in my view we are discussing two different points <e> <s> there is the point where a director of social services is given a quite different job to do <e> <s> as i understand it that is against the provisions of the initial act <e> <s> i think that all of us would agree that that is an unsatisfactory situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am both glad and grateful that it falls to me to add my congratulations to the two maiden speakers whom we have had the opportunity to hear this afternoon namely the noble marquess lord exeter and the right reverend prelate the bishop of lichfield <e>", "<cs> on these benches we support this amendment <e> <s> i know that the minister will tell us that the government want the money to be targeted on those who are worst off <e> <s> we have heard that so of ten and it will be very disappointing if we do not hear him say it again today <e> <s> i want to make the point that although i agree that there are times when that argument applies there are times when it does not <e> <s> there is no need to be dogmatic in supporting the principle of targeting or the principle of universality <e> <s> it is horses for courses <e> <s> some benefits are appropriate <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord agree that income tax relief for those in the per cent <e> <s> tax band also benefits those who are particularly well off and that a reduction of that benefit to per cent <e> <s> would more than meet the uprating of the child benefit <e>", "<cs> the noble lord referred to my reference to the relief for per cent <e> <s> income taxpayers <e> <s> he must agree that that relief gives additional spending power to people in the better off sections of the community otherwise they would not be paying per cent <e> <s> and the exchequer is the poorer because those people receive it <e> <s> that means that it is not irrelevant to the argument <e>", "<cs> i cannot accept that patronising reply from the noble lord <e> <s> i fully understand the effect of high taxation on the development of the economy <e> <s> what we are discussing here is not giving a specific benefit a generous benefit to the better off that is an entirely different matter from increasing taxation <e> <s> i have no desire to see taxation increased <e> <s> i have every desire not to see benefits of that order given to people who most emphatically do not need them <e>", "<cs> i mentioned the point <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to express my support for the amendment <e> <s> i am sure we all realise that this is a very sensitive matter <e> <s> in many cases the person concerned is dead before he or she has reached the stage of qualifying under the provisions of the act <e> <s> what is proposed would ease that most difficult position <e> <s> it would not cost a great deal of money <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend said surely we must consider the implications of what the government are doing <e> <s> if the courts have shown that the statute does not mean what the government intended it to mean the right process would be to amend the statute <e> <s> that is not to say that because the courts have given a decision that the government do not like they will disregard it <e> <s> the precedent for that is extremely dangerous <e>", "<cs> because the government get it wrong they legislate badly they lose in the courts and say we shall take no notice of the courts <e> <s> can the noble lord not see how dangerous that could be <e> <s> one day we might have a benevolent government and a benevolent government is perfectly possible who because the government have done it on this occasion would be delighted to apply the rule every time the court said something that they did not like <e> <s> it is extremely dangerous to adopt that course <e> <s> surely the government must change the legislation <e> <s> if they get it so badly wrong that they get it wrong twice then for goodness sake they had better find somebody else to draft the bill <e>", "<cs> the moral of this whole sad story is that the government should get their legislation right in the first place <e> <s> they should not cheat when they get it wrong which is what they propose <e> <s> because they have lost on this they must ensure that the legislation is properly drafted bring it back to the house and alter the law <e> <s> they should not say they will not do what the court says <e> <s> anybody can say that they do not wish to do what the court says <e> <s> what a precedent to set <e>", "<cs> it is no argument to the committee that it is only a small amount <e> <s> that really will not do <e>", "<cs> while i understand some of the objections that the noble lord lord mottistone raises it is of overriding importance to get the money to the woman <e> <s> there are two reasons <e> <s> in the first place she needs it and we know that in many cases she does not receive it <e> <s> secondly if she does not receive it the burden falls on the taxpayer <e>", "<cs> i am extremely disappointed by the governments reply <e> <s> i said that i had no intention of pressing the amendment at this hour <e> <s> i beg the government to think again <e> <s> it is a basic <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support the amendment and emphasise a point alluded to by other speakers <e> <s> one of the governments reasons for refusing to give support to to year-olds is an assertion that there is a yts place for all youngsters who want one <e> <s> therefore they are deliberately not weighting <e> <s> i believe that the government should look again at this matter <e> <s> it may be that numerically that is true although i believe that in many areas that is not so <e> <s> however even if it were true yts is meant to be a training scheme <e> <s> if it is not the right training for a youngster it is absurd to push him or her arbitrarily into training just because there happens to be a training place in a particular occupation <e> <s> it is a waste of training provision and will not lead to any satisfactory result <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness says that the training agency has resources <e> <s> those of us dealing with the training agency in one way or another at present are only too acutely aware that the funds are growing less and less and many special schemes are being cut back quite drastically as a result <e> <s> i hope that she will look at that matter before she says that it is properly financed <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i should like to raise one point with him <e> <s> i fully understand that there has to be an upper limit beyond which people cannot apply to the social fund for community care payments <e> <s> but cannot a special category be made of the people who are coming out of institutions under the programme that we have been discussing in the national health service and community care bill <e> <s> they are a quite clearly defined and easily recognised case <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make a point before the noble baroness sits down <e> <s> surely we all agree that there must be some sanctions and some penalties because certain people abuse the position <e> <s> without necessarily supporting the amendment i should point out that weeks is a long time it is six months to be without benefit <e> <s> there is a big jump between six weeks and weeks <e> <s> the penalty of having no money coming in for half a year is very heavy <e> <s> will the noble baroness consider whether there might at least be a half-way house between six weeks and weeks <e> <s> we do not deny that there must be a penalty <e> <s> it is simply that the penalty seems to be rather draconian <e>", "<cs> that is the sensible course to take in the circumstances <e> <s> i hope that before the report stage and there is a brief recess the government can give rapid and deep thought to the implications of the judgment <e> <s> in innocence the implications seem to be clear but i agree that they are both extensive and expensive <e> <s> however if there is a reasonable expectation that we shall have a statement from the government before report stage then i am happy at this juncture to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i was much impressed by the arguments put forward by the noble lord lord coleraine <e> <s> he said that he would not press the amendment so i do not suppose that this is of great interest to him but the case he made seems to me to be unanswerable <e> <s> we are moving all the time towards executive interference in matters which ought to be in the hands of some form of judiciary <e> <s> this is much to be deplored <e>", "<cs> i on the other hand very much hope that the option will be made available <e> <s> if the occupational pension schemes have to compete with personal private schemes they will be more attractive <e> <s> that is a very good thing <e> <s> occupational schemes have become more flexible <e> <s> but there is no doubt that in the past they tied people to employers <e> <s> they increased immobility and operated heavily against people who had the enterprise to get out and do something else <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the percentage of workers trained under the labour government was even worse than the percentage trained under the conservative government <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that if those institutions are so concerned it is a bit odd that we receive through the post so many unasked for letters offering to lend us money <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he reconsider the wording <e> <s> if your lordships house is confused by the title family health services authorities and is expected to understand that that means that it is not an authority then i suggest that the public are likely to be equally if not more confused <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the noble lord was in the process of answering my question when he was abruptly interrupted by the noble lord lord peston <e> <s> i should like an answer as to whether it is possible at the third stage for the noble lord to consider clearing up what undoubtedly is a confusion in the use of this term <e> <s> there are many other words that he could introduce to convey the idea that he wants to convey <e> <s> why pick on the one word authority which is calculated to confuse <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very confused by these most interesting statements about universities and polytechnics in relation to these amendments <e> <s> i should like to ask one question merely for clarification <e> <s> it seems to me that the distinction which is being made is not really a distinction between universities and polytechnics if it were i would be entirely on the side of the noble lord lord peston in saying that no such distinction should be made <e> <s> surely it is a distinction between institutions of higher education with a medical or dental school and institutions of higher education without a medical or dental school <e> <s> that is the distinction which is being made <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not intervened in the debate so far <e> <s> as i understood it the noble baroness said that the circular would advise the districts to consider that something should be done <e> <s> that is not a very strong indication that the government want something to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lady robson whose name is down to amendments nos <e> <s> to which i gather from the groupings are to be taken in conjunction with the amendment which the noble baroness has just moved i should like to say that the amendment is an improvement <e> <s> however it would have been so much better in our view if at any rate some of the prescribed groups which appear in amendment no <e> <s> had been incorporated <e>", "<cs> my lords due to the lateness of the hour i shall be extremely brief in what i have to say <e> <s> i very much support the remarks made by the noble lord lord butterfield <e> <s> however i have one caveat <e> <s> i was amazed to hear him say that while he wanted to keep the basic pay the same he was quite happy if these hospitals could offer rolls-royces to the people who went to work for them <e> <s> on the basis of years on the top salaries review body i must say that if there is one really dangerous thing to do it is to introduce benefits of that kind <e> <s> it distorts the situation in a far worse way than salary differentials <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to follow the recommendation of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that we should not rehearse all the arguments which were put forward previously even if i do not follow his practice because he seems to have rehearsed a great many of them <e> <s> i should merely like to say that i strongly support the new amendment for the old reasons <e> <s> child benefit is an extremely valuable benefit <e> <s> it was put in when the tax concession to people with children was removed and therefore to fail to implement this measure is to go back on what was then decided that people with higher incomes but with family responsibilities should get some relief <e> <s> it is support for the idea of a horizontal distribution in favour of those who have the responsibility of bringing up children compared with those who do not <e> <s> that is a principle which it is extremely important to maintain <e>", "<cs> my lords it reduces the cost through taxation <e> <s> the noble lord made what was to me an extraordinary argument <e> <s> i understand his devotion to a scheme for which he was responsible for a long time <e> <s> but he cannot maintain that the national insurance scheme has been in any actuarial sense an insurance scheme <e> <s> almost from the time when it was introduced as lord beveridge pointed out years ago it was broken down by the introduction of pensions at the level at which they <e>", "<cs> my lords that was years ago <e> <s> i cannot be held responsible for what lord crewe said before even i was born <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that there are not many men in the street earning over per week <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to express my support for the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord kilmarnock has made all the relevant points most admirably <e> <s> however i have a small but very important point to make <e> <s> the bill as it stands refers to where death <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he tell us how the process will work <e> <s> he says the doctor who knows and has examined the patient will not be the one to say that the limit is six months <e> <s> he then went on to talk about some committee which does not see the patient but sees what the doctor says <e> <s> it in its infinite wisdom says that there is a six-month limit <e> <s> how will that be done <e> <s> it seems an odd way to determine upon what date a person will die <e>", "<cs> my lords i reinforce my noble friends comments regarding the effects of cuts in government spending for schemes of this kind schemes for special needs groups with which i am associated <e> <s> i specifically refer to young offenders who are difficult to train and place <e> <s> the cuts in government funding have led to drastic reductions in the training offered and because of that the people concerned will find it extraordinarily difficult to earn any money <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may point out that he has not referred to the fact and there is no argument about this that the government have cut the amount of money available for all these schemes including the money going to the tecs <e> <s> large numbers of people concerned with these schemes have been making representations to the government in that respect <e> <s> the noble lord may say that it has been found that previously the schemes have been grossly over-funded <e> <s> i do not think many people would agree with that <e> <s> if that is not the case the government must at least admit that such cuts are making it more difficult to fulfil the undertaking <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will agree to review the position now that these cuts are taking place to see whether the government can say as they have said previously that there are places available <e> <s> what was true in the past is not going to be true in the future with less money coming forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not find that to be a satisfactory answer <e> <s> the noble lord has repeated the points that he made in the previous debate <e> <s> he has again produced the argument that because expectations of earnings are lower the benefits rates should be lower <e> <s> he did not answer the point made by my noble friend that one does not apply that argument because womens expectations of earnings are lower than those of men and the logic of that situation would require them to do so <e> <s> however the noble lord is obviously quite implacable in regard to that matter and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord did nothing to reply to the very important point made by my noble friend as to who should bear the cost of these pensions whether it is an appropriate burden to place on industry or whether it is something which is better carried by the taxpayer <e>", "<cs> my lords it may well be that the amendment could have this effect which is not totally acceptable and no doubt the proposals are complicated <e> <s> but the problem is not complicated at all <e> <s> it is the gap between peoples income in these institutions and the charges <e> <s> if the government do not like the amendments put forward and no doubt they can put many arguments against them the burden is on them to explain how in a simpler way they will bridge the gap <e> <s> that gap is a matter of great urgency at present both to the persons concerned and the institutions <e> <s> if the institutions close down we shall be in a difficult position <e> <s> if the government do not like the amendments what are they going to do <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked me the question before i sat down so i take it that i am in order if i reply although it is report stage <e> <s> it is simple <e> <s> i have already said that i understand that the government regard these proposed amendments as too complicated or inadequate in some way or another <e> <s> however the burden is on them to do something about the extremely urgent problem <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i must reply to that <e> <s> i did not of course say that it is because the amendment may not be acceptable that there is an obligation on the government <e> <s> i said there was an obligation on the government because the problem is real and urgent and the amendment is trying to deal with it <e> <s> if the matter is not dealt with properly that urgent problem will not go away <e> <s> it is i suggest a problem for the government to deal with <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly we should like to give support to this amendment <e> <s> it is permissive it is not compulsory and it opens up new opportunities <e> <s> we very much hope that the government will support it <e>", "<cs> my lords why did the government use the word budget in the first place <e> <s> it has a clearly understood meaning <e> <s> do the government not understand what it means <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt <e> <s> the minister has made a very important statement <e> <s> she said that they will decide together <e> <s> the whole point of our amendment is the independence of this body <e> <s> the minister said that they will decide together <e> <s> but amendment no <e> <s> states that the group shall have functions <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish strongly to support the amendment <e> <s> everyone nowadays is an equal opportunities employer except when one examines the results only to find that they are very difficult to discover <e>", "<cs> my lords in listening to the opening speech of the noble lord lord williams i recognised a classic example of satan refuting sin <e> <s> i recalled the experiences of the time when the labour government were in power <e> <s> i recalled the overmanning in industry <e>", "<cs> my lords my party supported the labour government for a very short period of time <e> <s> during the time we supported it we did our best to modify some of the nonsenses that were produced <e> <s> however i only have minutes in which to speak and i should be grateful if noble lords would not interrupt me <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an extremely cheap remark <e> <s> if that is the best that the noble lord can say in defence of the actions of the previous labour government it is a pretty poor do <e> <s> the noble lord knows perfectly well what the answer to his question is <e> <s> however i shall not take up my minutes replying to frivolous questions which are posed simply because the noble lord has nothing better to say in defence of his own party <e>", "<cs> my lords it would help me if the noble baroness could explain one point <e> <s> as i understand it she said that provision of care would be available for people who for any other reason were in need of care <e> <s> whose right is it to decide whether care is needed <e> <s> for example i can envisage a household in which there is a person who is deeply into alcohol or drugs <e> <s> he or she is living in the household but it is becoming intolerable for the family to cope <e> <s> i believe that if the words of the amendment were written on the face of the bill the family could go along to the local authority and say this is someone who is really in need of care which we can no longer give <e> <s> i see the noble baronesss point in not wishing the wording to be too specific <e> <s> however that family could then be refused care could it not <e> <s> because there is no specified right to care <e> <s> am i wrong about that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down i am sure that in the preparation for her reply to the amendment she herself or her officials must have asked what the numbers were likely to be <e> <s> if the police are already carrying out inquiries into i believe she said over cases i cannot envisage that the percentage increase of cases required for homes will be so great <e> <s> we shall not have homes sprouting like mushrooms all over the country <e> <s> once the system is established the <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot follow my noble friends argument <e> <s> if it were improper for us to have tabled the amendment the clerks would have said that it could not be accepted <e> <s> we must rely on the clerks judgment on such matters <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to save time because my question is supplementary <e>", "<cs> i wish to clarify a point made by the minister and the answer will make all the difference when i decide whether to call for the opinion of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that a local authority could move someone from a private home for which they could not pay into a local authority home <e> <s> did he say that the local authority would be under an obligation to do so which will meet our point or that it would have the power to do so <e> <s> if he said that it would be under an obligation to do so i am satisfied <e> <s> surely if i may say so to the leader of the house it is entirely reasonable to ask for clarification <e>", "<cs> my lords venturing to displease the minister again if he had said that the local authority had a duty i should have been entirely satisfied <e> <s> however he has said only that it has the power <e> <s> will he take the amendment away and say whether at third reading he will consider making it a duty <e> <s> if he will do so i shall not divide the house <e> <s> if he will not i shall divide the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask for the opinion of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene in this debate simply to say that this amendment has our very strongest support <e>", "<cs> my lords does the guidance deal with this position <e> <s> someone comes out of care and it is decided that he or she must go to the family or their nearest relation the family may feel unable to look after that person <e> <s> if there were rights established on the face of the bill regarding prior consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble baroness because i was not in my place when she moved the amendment and she referred to the amendment to which my name appears <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister wishes to omit the word carer <e> <s> is that only in connection with complaints made about the person being cared for <e> <s> i am extremely anxious to make sure that the rights of carers as carers as distinct from carers as people who are acting on behalf of the cared for person are adequately safeguarded and to ensure <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i thank the minister for that response <e> <s> it is an important point although it may be covered elsewhere <e> <s> i wanted to make sure that it was not going to default in the course of the changes that were proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly do not press it at this time of night <e> <s> i am very disappointed with the answer <e> <s> i hope that i have made the point as plainly as i can <e> <s> respite care is in a category by itself <e> <s> other noble lords have reinforced what i have been trying to say <e> <s> it would not be difficult for the government to introduce an amendment of their own on these lines <e> <s> however as with almost everything else that we have suggested making us feel that to a considerable extent we are wasting our time they are obviously adamant <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have tabled amendment no <e> <s> i support this amendment but i hope that if it is passed my amendment will not be overlooked because of the greater emphasis that it places on carers <e> <s> it is of the greatest importance that the needs of carers should be taken into account in exactly the same way as the needs of the person being cared for <e> <s> that is in the interests not only of the carers themselves but of the person being cared for and the community as a whole <e> <s> if the carers break down and unless sufficient assistance is given they will break down the burden will be thrown back on the community and the cost to the community as a whole will be greater than anything that would have been necessary to support the carer <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to express my support for these two amendments to which i have attached my name <e> <s> i think that the relevant points have been made and i do not wish to take up too much of the time of the house <e> <s> however underlying both amendments is the case for carers to be considered as people who are doing a job of work rather than people who are just having a contribution made to their income <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the government will find it possible to accept this <e> <s> in the previous amendment we asked for sums of money which the government rightly or wrongly regarded as considerable <e> <s> the amount of money involved in this amendment is negligible <e> <s> i hear the microphone whistling i might wish to make a noise like that at the minister but i do not know how to produce it deliberately <e> <s> the amount of money that this amendment would cost in comparison with the amount involved in the previous amendment is negligible but in a number of cases it would make a tremendous difference to the people concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he possibly go one step further <e> <s> if i may say so he has expressed an unusual degree of sympathy for the amendment <e> <s> will he take it away and see whether he can come back at third reading with a more restricted amendment that would be <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly try with or without the ministers permission to bring an amendment back at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords may i formally support this amendment <e> <s> we have spoken to it on a number of occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i respond briefly to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> if my memory serves me correctly and i should not like to be put on oath on this matter i recall lord beveridge saying that he chose the age of for women because when the new scheme was introduced men who retired at could draw a dependence allowance for their wives if and only if the wives had reached the age of <e> <s> the phrase which lingers in my mind it comes from a meeting at that time and therefore cannot be regarded as reliable is that lord beveridge said that women had to be treated the same as wives <e> <s> nobody ever has but that is another point <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord said my honourable friend the liberal democrat member for southport moved an amendment which was rather more extensive in its application than this amendment <e> <s> i should like to support the amendment as it has now reached your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of my noble friend lord winstanley i too should like to say briefly that we on these benches give the amendment our strongest support <e>", "<cs> my lords in the interests of brevity i wish merely to say that we on these benches totally support the amendment and particularly the point just made by the noble lord lord carr of hadley <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness lady young is right why has such an anxiety grown up in over institutions <e> <s> there must be some way of bridging the two statements <e> <s> i ask for information <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for accepting the amendment and for keeping the proceedings so short <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down perhaps she will clarify a point for me <e> <s> she states that under the legislation an assessment has to be made if the authority is told about a person <e> <s> let us suppose that the person who needs to be assessed says ill not let you in and slams the door in the visitors faces <e> <s> what will happen <e> <s> do they force their way in <e> <s> that is the reality <e> <s> the kind of person about whom we are talking will not let them across the doorstep <e> <s> what will the position be then <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may raise one further point of clarification <e> <s> as i understood him and i was listening as carefully as i could he spoke on the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much reassured by that last statement of the noble lord <e> <s> i should be happier if it were on the face of the bill in some shape or form <e> <s> i am not fully aware that it is <e> <s> however i shall read very carefully what the noble lord said <e> <s> i am sure that it is his intention that the wishes of the movers of the amendment are stated in the bill <e> <s> i shall have to examine it carefully before i am absolutely certain that what the noble lord said and what the bill says are precisely the same <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i support the amendment <e> <s> unless such powers are <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that we are at report stage but perhaps i may ask for further clarification <e> <s> will claimants who followed the lead of the claimant who won the case be treated on all fours and in exactly the same way as that claimant <e> <s> that is the heart of the matter <e> <s> that is what we are talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords they will not be on all fours except in the test cases <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly the point with which we are trying to deal <e> <s> they should be on all fours <e> <s> i am afraid that i shall have to test the feeling of the house <e> <s> it is such an empty house that it is difficult to test the feeling <e> <s> but the principle is simply not established <e> <s> we need to establish it <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords we support the amendment <e> <s> the government have recently shown increasing anxiety which we all share about homelessness <e> <s> if such units are shut before there is adequate provision to deal with people removed from them that can only mean that homelessness will increase <e> <s> in the interests of the cause with which i believe all in the house agree of cutting down the number of people living in cardboard boxes i beg the government to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has the advantage of me in that <e> <s> it is surely not easy if one is an unemployed single parent or even just a parent and one wishes to find a suitable person not just anyone to take on the job of looking after the children <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to be reminded of the position of lone parents <e> <s> however the noble lords answer is totally unrealistic <e> <s> in the vast majority of cases it will be a woman who takes up the employment <e> <s> i understand that the government wish to encourage that <e> <s> she may have a husband and if we follow the noble lords argument does he suggest that the husband should stay at home in order to look after the children so that the wife is available <e> <s> if not i cannot honestly see that the wife with a husband working will find it any easier to get someone to look after her children than will the lone parent <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i want to say how greatly we disapprove of the way in which your lordships house has been treated in this matter <e> <s> either there is a second chamber which can do a proper revising job or there is not <e> <s> for my part i would rather not have a second chamber than one which is treated with the contempt that we have been treated with throughout this debate and in the way that we are now treated by the commons <e>", "<cs> my lords since the amendment said only that the bill shall not come into force until there are sufficient resources are we to assume that the government will bring it in when there are not sufficient resources otherwise i do not see why they have not accepted the amendment <e> <s> it must mean that the government will bring it in without sufficient resources <e> <s> it seems odd <e>", "<cs> my lords as this amendment parallels one which i moved i suppose that i must rather grudgingly say that it is some little gain <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness follow up the point made by her noble friend lady faithfull about the training together of people the police lawyers and social workers who need to handle together these issues <e> <s> i understand that the noble baroness lady faithfull said the other day that social workers are not taking part in these <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down he made an extremely interesting statement at the end about research being undertaken into the operation of both the social security provisions and the yts <e> <s> will he comment on a point which my noble friend quoted me as having made before about getting the right fit in the yts <e> <s> if the training is to be taken seriously it has to be training appropriate to the person who is being trained <e> <s> that is a very important point from the employers point of view as well as that of the youngsters <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord totally misses the point <e> <s> a little longer to find the right course at a small cost is better than taking the wrong course failing on it and being a nuisance for the rest of your life <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not draft it someone else did <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for very small mercies and i thank the minister for his more sympathetic approach <e> <s> however before the bill goes back to another place perhaps he will consider one other possible option <e> <s> he referred to the difficulty of administering the amendment <e> <s> will he consider people who are already drawing invalid care allowance <e> <s> that will restrict the proposal to a small number of people but at least it would be a clearly identifiable number <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall endeavour to obtain some evidence for the noble lord <e> <s> i hope that if i produce it he will continue thinking and not wait for the results of a monitoring process which can go on for a long time <e> <s> if my evidence prompts his thoughts into action it will be extremely well received in many quarters <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that the labour party has different views which is certainly true <e> <s> will the noble lord tell the house how many views there are on the other side of the house and indeed within the cabinet <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the leader of the house said that three members from the labour party should speak <e> <s> my noble friend lord hanworth has risen on a number of occasions but has not been invited to speak <e> <s> will the noble lord please comment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that there are two possible and directly opposed interpretations of the policies put forward one by no <e> <s> and the other by no <e> <s> <e> <s> is it not extremely damaging to our reputation in the community that we put forward two policies which cannot be reconciled as the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> just to confirm that aspect i have in my handbag some figures recently quoted of the percentage of the industrial workforce which has had skilled vocational training <e> <s> the figures are for france per cent <e> <s> for italy per cent <e> <s> for west germany per cent <e> <s> for spain per cent <e> <s> and for the uk per cent <e> <s> need anything more be said <e>", "<cs> i do not want to prolong this discussion but in supporting my noble friend lord rochester i pick up the point made by the noble lord lord jenkins <e> <s> it would be a pity to accept the argument from the guilds <e> <s> the guilds as i think most people remember them were organisations of employers and as employers they had an interest in standards and so were totally different from trade unions <e>", "<cs> i accept that amendment no <e> <s> is a rather watered down version of schedule <e> <s> i know that that will be denied but in substance that is what it is <e> <s> however i believe that the wording of amendment no <e> <s> is rather vague and open to a lot of argument <e> <s> for example i can see that there could be many arguments about the words <e>", "<cs> i hope that the government will think again about the proposed new clause <e> <s> over recent years the whole sphere of industrial relations has become more and more legalistic and restrictive by law <e> <s> we on these benches agreed that some changes in the law were necessary <e> <s> however we believe that the government have gone much too far in their legalistic approach <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me to intervene many of our best industrial companies share the view that we have become overly legalistic <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may suggest to the noble lord that the instructions for the ballot may have been sent by post <e> <s> in the present state of the post office it is possible that the paper was not received <e>", "<cs> the minister has implied that he agrees with the amendment <e> <s> he said that it is unnecessary because the point is already covered <e> <s> he will have heard of a belt and braces <e> <s> what is the trouble with accepting the amendment and making the position clear <e> <s> why cannot he accept the amendment <e> <s> as he says that the matter is covered it would not do any harm <e> <s> if there is any doubt it would make the position clear <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the confusion which has arisen because of the rumours about community care being put on ice and following the remarks made yesterday in another place can the noble baroness tell us whether or not it is true that community care provision is to be put on ice <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish very much to support what the noble lord lord beloff has said <e> <s> like him at this stage i do not think any good can be done at all <e> <s> i wish to add one point <e> <s> there is no doubt at all that the graduate students are the people on whom the future development of higher education in this country is bound to depend <e> <s> if we skimp and cut down on the number of postgraduate students we shall have to rely even more on the quality of the first degree <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i quoted a figure of weeks <e> <s> i should have said months <e>", "<cs> i should like to add one brief point <e> <s> it is high time that we moved towards a declaration of the right to strike <e> <s> that is what this issue is about <e> <s> our system relates to trade union immunities and breach of contract <e> <s> the breach of contract argument is to a large extent an unreality because it is very rarely used in practical circumstances <e> <s> our system is a somewhat muddled and confused way of giving the right to strike <e>", "<cs> members of the committee who have opposed the amendment say that it will increase the propensity to strike <e> <s> how do they explain the fact that many countries with the law is in this form have a better strike record than this country <e>", "<cs> the number of strikes fell particularly when unemployment was very high <e> <s> the noble lord knows perfectly well that that is so <e>", "<cs> i ask the government to think very hard and to accept this amendment <e> <s> let us picture a situation most supervisors and foremen are no doubt fair just and good tempered <e> <s> we all know that in every organisation and occupation there are some such persons who are not <e> <s> there can be a build-up of bad feeling in a department <e> <s> that can be because of action taken by a bullying and unreasonable supervisor <e> <s> not unreasonably in many cases an unofficial strike takes place <e> <s> unless this amendment is accepted the unofficial strikers can be dismissed without any claim whatever <e> <s> it is an unofficial strike and they would have no right to appeal <e> <s> they would have no opportunity to say that the reason for the strike was bullying tactics or whatever it may be <e> <s> it may be the culmination of a variety of matters which have taken place before and which have blown up into a big row <e> <s> the result is that the workers go out on <e>", "<cs> absolutely and that is why i am supporting the amendment <e> <s> if the workers go out on strike in that kind of way it provides a breathing space <e> <s> without this amendment it may mean that workers who have gone out on strike in a burst of temper and without having considered their position will be dismissed <e> <s> that is a circumstance which does and will happen where human beings are gathered together and get in each others hair <e> <s> they will have no right to go to a tribunal and explain about the bullying that had taken place beforehand and that built up to and led to the strike <e> <s> they should be given a warning that if they do not go back to work and take advantage of the time and opportunity for matters to settle down they will be dismissed <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord murray of epping forest made an important point <e> <s> the noble lord lord strathclyde is really saying that the only action that the government will accept as proper action is union approved action <e> <s> however the noble lord lord murray made the point that it is perfectly possible for a group of workers to run a ballot and therefore to have a legally endorsed right to strike although they may be at odds with their union as to whether the union is prepared to make that action official <e>", "<cs> i may be rather stupid about this but i still do not understand the position <e> <s> can the noble lord explain once again <e> <s> if an individual worker really believes that the job he is being asked to do is unsafe and he simply refuses to work and just sits there not doing anything that is not industrial action <e>", "<cs> if a dozen workers just sit there is that still not industrial action <e> <s> it becomes industrial action if pressure is put on the employer either singly or as a group <e> <s> is not the mere fact that there has been a stoppage of work a form of pressure <e> <s> that is what i do not understand <e> <s> when does it become pressure <e> <s> if the employer wants to get the work done and that is what strikes are all about and the employee sits there refusing to use the machine and the machine is rented at per week surely the employee is putting pressure upon the employer <e> <s> the noble lord seems to be indicating that that is not pressure <e> <s> in that case when can a refusal to work be seen as pressure <e> <s> i do not understand the distinction which the noble lord is making <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that it is the pressure which determines whether it is industrial action <e> <s> are we agreed about that <e> <s> it is the putting on of pressure which makes it industrial action is that right <e>", "<cs> i cannot see that there is any greater pressure than refusing to work <e> <s> that is what a strike is all about <e> <s> let us suppose that there is a valuable piece of machinery which is eating its head off in the stables to change the metaphor the employer <e>", "<cs> the minister cannot get away with that <e> <s> i do not speak for the labour benches but i am <e>", "<cs> as i understand the groupings list we were also talking to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> we were speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> on the groupings list i have amendment no <e> <s> is grouped with amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> it was because the noble lord made a point about amendment no <e> <s> that i wanted to say something <e> <s> i do not accept his point that one day is enough <e> <s> if unofficial action is taking place it is extremely likely that most of the people taking the unofficial action will not be in the plant <e> <s> they will be at home or in the pub <e> <s> that being so i cannot see that the noble lords argument about how the union is to contact them stands <e>", "<cs> they might be in different pubs <e> <s> is the noble lord seriously suggesting that the local union official has to go to different pubs <e>", "<cs> what are the government encouraging people to do <e>", "<cs> i should like with some qualification to support the amendment in the sense that i believe that there should be room somewhere for a general conscience clause <e> <s> i say that because it may not only be the exclusive brethren who have such problems <e> <s> in this country at present we have many people with very differing beliefs which are strongly held <e> <s> providing it can be tested that people are genuine and that they are not hiding behind the conscience clause so as to defeat the purposes of the bill i think that we should try to find a way to meet this need <e> <s> the total numbers involved will be very small <e> <s> the people <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also express our regret at the fact that the government have decided to suspend the standing order <e> <s> it is not merely a matter of overloading members of the house with work as the noble lord lord cledwyn has said it also means that it is impossible for the house to do its job properly <e>", "<cs> my lords courtesy and convention require that i should thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> if courtesy and convention did not require that it would be impossible so to do <e> <s> like the noble lord lord ennals i find the statement totally deplorable <e> <s> the carers national association represents people who are deeply affected by the changes <e> <s> it has been overwhelmed with telephone calls from anxious and angry people who no longer know what will happen <e> <s> they feel totally betrayed because they were led to believe that at last after the delays following the publication of the griffiths report and the endless lobbying there would be an effective community care programme <e>", "<cs> if the itc required quite specific information to be stated in annual reports and laid down what that specific information should refer to that would constitute proper monitoring <e> <s> however anything less than that does not constitute monitoring <e>", "<cs> my lords i am privileged to be the member of this house who is able to express and has the pleasure of expressing to the noble lord lord varley real appreciation of that quite remarkable maiden speech <e> <s> people always say that maiden speeches are remarkable but this is a remarkably remarkable maiden speech in that the noble lord managed to bring in many matters of great substance which were potentially and not even potentially in actuality controversial but he did it in a way to which no one could possibly take the slightest exception <e> <s> it was a real contribution to the subject that we are discussing today and not just an entry ticket to our debate as maiden speeches inevitably sometimes tend to be <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add to that and ask the minister to justify denying people in this category the right of appeal to an industrial tribunal <e> <s> is there any other offence given that the time considerations have been met where that right is denied <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not ask that <e> <s> i asked for any case in which having been sacked one had no right to go before a tribunal and claim unfair dismissal <e> <s> that was my question <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down i ask him to reflect again on the answer that he gave me <e> <s> he said that the law already allows for dismissal without appeal to an industrial tribunal in a case which involves non-selective dismissal of strikers and in which the whole labour force is dismissed <e> <s> that does not answer my point <e> <s> the point i made is that there is a world of difference between dismissing the <e>", "<cs> my lords we strongly support the amendment <e> <s> i am sure that the minister does not wish to give the impression that in the face of a threat of danger this is industrial action <e> <s> it does not have to be dangerous machinery <e> <s> there are other extremely unhealthy conditions such as gas leaks <e> <s> the minister would not argue with us that that should in any way be seen as industrial action <e> <s> if that is so can he not accept that sometimes the belt and braces argument is right <e>", "<cs> it may be the heat or i may be stupid but the minister has explained that in his view there is a difference between television and radio <e> <s> that i can understand <e> <s> he has not explained why if defining quality is difficult or almost impossible it is possible to do it for television but impossible to do it for radio <e> <s> it was that narrower question that my noble friend lord bonham-carter put forward not what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander <e> <s> that is another argument <e> <s> we are discussing whether quality can be defined <e> <s> the minister says that we cannot define quality although we are doing so for television <e> <s> i am confused <e> <s> will the minister clarify the point <e>", "<cs> are we not straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel if i have it the right way round <e> <s> we have said that it is too difficult to define quality but we cherish good taste <e> <s> it is extremely odd <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter will agree that although a step-by-step approach may have been quite useful up to a certain point one does not necessarily have to go on walking indefinitely in the same direction which is what the government seem determined to do <e> <s> as my noble friend lord rochester said we on these benches supported a good many of the governments first steps <e> <s> there was no doubt that trade union power had gone far too far and that the labour government had completely failed to put the kind of curbs on trade union power that were needed <e> <s> therefore in the initial stages we supported the governments approach <e> <s> but the government would be very well advised to call a halt to these steps <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister inform the house what was the attitude of the labour party when in power and had the opportunity to join the erm <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down perhaps i may be permitted to say that the uncharacteristic silence from these benches does not mean that we are not deeply involved in the argument <e> <s> we strongly support the position taken by the right reverend prelate the bishop of liverpool <e> <s> when looking around the world at the present time one sees that one of the most explosive forces for evil as well as for good is religion in all its forms <e> <s> surely there could not be a moment when it would be more important that we should learn about and not merely tolerate other religions <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the well known inaccuracy of the official statistics is not the whole of this argument somewhat unreal <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may follow up the point made by the noble lord lord jenkin which is of the utmost importance and ask the minister whether he will consider taking some special steps perhaps with ngos to see in what way moneys could be made available for womens education in developing countries <e> <s> the level of illiteracy within those countries is a very serious handicap and earmarked money for that purpose would be of the greatest help <e> <s> i have no doubt that a number of organisations would be willing to collaborate with the government in a campaign to raise the level of literacy of women within developing countries <e> <s> that would probably help more than anything else <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to be frivolous about the matter but could not the wording of amendment no <e> <s> be used to describe cigarette smoking <e> <s> the amendment refers to <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down perhaps i could ask a question <e> <s> i may have been stupid in listening to him and should like to understand his position <e> <s> is it a right to have the pension indexed to per cent <e> <s> or is that at the discretion of the company <e> <s> the noble earl said that the company had always done that <e> <s> it is a very important point <e> <s> i take it that it is per cent <e> <s> or the level of the rpi whichever is the less <e> <s> that is usually the case <e> <s> what is the right of which they are assured as distinct to what they may be lucky to get if the company is in a good mood <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the minister but what is the scientific evidence which shows that there is a great volume of concern <e> <s> that is what we should like to know <e> <s> we have been told about it in general terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the noble earl this question who will appoint this great body that is to look after our morals on television <e> <s> how are the members of that body appointed <e> <s> how can the public complain against its judgment if they so wish <e> <s> perhaps i may also make the blindingly obvious point that if people do not like what is on the screen they can always turn off the television <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister advise me what should be done about lambeth council to which i have applied at least five times to be sent the poll tax bill and which will not send it <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister appreciate the extraordinary difficulty into which she places voluntary organisations and others which have been encouraged to expect reliable statutory funding only to find that they do not know when it is coming nor how much it will be <e> <s> does she appreciate that when one is trying to run an organisation uncertainty about ones cash flow is jolly nearly death <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to join with others who have congratulated the noble baroness lady castle elusive though she may be on her very powerful maiden speech <e> <s> it was a remarkable speech <e> <s> to have achieved triple maidenhood must be a near miracle <e> <s> in addition i should like to say how grateful i am as another woman to the noble baroness for all that she has achieved in her career on behalf of women <e> <s> it will not surprise noble lords that i frankly do not agree with a great deal of what the noble baroness says or does <e> <s> however i very much agree with the work that she has undertaken in that area <e> <s> she and margaret thatcher and i recognise that they are not always coupled together must forever have killed the myth that women do not have the stamina the toughness the determination or even the sheer downright beastliness when required to play the game of politics and to play it very successfully <e>", "<cs> my lords until one hour ago i intended to begin by saying that there had been remarkable uniformity in the support and praise for this report <e> <s> however recent speeches have led me to believe that there is more diversity of views in your lordships house than the earlier speeches had suggested <e> <s> it will not surprise your lordships that we on these benches who claim to be the stone age europeans and totally undivided supporters of the ec from its inception welcome this report wholeheartedly <e> <s> i shall not take up too much time congratulating the noble lord lord aldington and his team because everybody else has done so <e> <s> i am sure he will accept that our enthusiasm and gratitude are great <e> <s> they have been much enhanced by the speeches made in the last hour which have shown how great is the need for clarification of the kind that this report has given us <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl say how many of the new recruits to the metropolitan police have been women and how many members of the ethnic minorities <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that this is a matter of very great importance to a great many people <e> <s> it is not a party matter <e> <s> we fully understand the governments difficulties on the other hand the whole position is extremely confused <e> <s> the outcome will affect a great many people and it is very difficult for people planning occupational pension schemes to make sensible decisions <e> <s> when will the government be able to say that the position is clear enough for us to have a full debate on this extremely important matter <e> <s> will they please expedite the matter on a non-party basis <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i hope he will clarify one point <e> <s> he said that <e>", "<cs> my lords if a servant has lost his existing employment and cannot take other employment how is he to live <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also wish to pay tribute to the work that the noble lord lord belstead has done as leader of the house <e> <s> it must have been extraordinarily difficult to take over from the noble viscount lord whitehead the previous leader of the house <e> <s> i apologise to the house <e> <s> i meant to say the noble viscount lord whitelaw <e> <s> however the noble lord certainly followed the example of the noble viscount in one most important respect we all greatly welcomed that in that he has been not only the leader of the conservative party in this house but also and pre-eminently the leader of your lordships house <e> <s> that is a tradition which noble lords in all parts of the house are grateful for <e> <s> we welcomed it and we are confident that it will be continued <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to reinforce what was said by the noble baroness lady blackstone about virement <e> <s> it is maddening that the allocation of money which is decided in advance of the grants is rigid <e> <s> anyone who has had the job of administering moneys from central government knows that over time the best use of that money changes <e> <s> to be stuck with the exact allocation of money that has been incorporated in the budget is extremely uneconomic <e> <s> it produces very bad results and wastes money <e>", "<cs> my lords i only want virement for the concerns in which i am particularly interested <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble baroness but i must register a protest <e> <s> the change is made for administrative convenience and not in order to achieve the best possible educational results <e> <s> we should not organise matters for the convenience of civil servants who administer them <e> <s> we must run them to get the best schools and colleges that we can <e> <s> if there are difficulties for the auditors that is just too bad <e>"]
