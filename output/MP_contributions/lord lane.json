["<cs> my lords i rise with some diffidence and trepidation to address your lordships in this arena which for me is unfamiliar <e> <s> please forgive me if i unwittingly break any of your lordships rules <e> <s> your lordships attention has been directed properly to the courts to the police and to statistics <e> <s> so far as statistics are concerned i propose to say nothing except that they are mostly misleading and very largely unintelligible <e> <s> so far as the police are concerned i just wish to say that they can operate only with the consent and with the active help of law-abiding citizens <e> <s> what can destroy the efficacy of the police more quickly than anything else is the undermining of their authority by people who ought to know better <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a vast subject and six and a half minutes is not enough time in which to deal with it properly <e> <s> may i confine myself therefore to the two criticisms which are made of the judges <e> <s> one is a general criticism namely as i understand it by the noble earl lord longford that judges are passing sentences which are too long and the other is a more specific criticism namely that the judges vetoed a liberal proposal by the home secretary for penal reform or else threatened to retaliate if it became law <e> <s> they are both completely unfounded <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with some diffidence for this reason i appreciate that a judges view may very well be distorted by the fact that he deals largely with the pathology of society <e> <s> speaking for myself and i am neither a sociologist nor a criminologist and nor can i drive a horse whether it belongs to my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones or not or whether it is kicking or not i too was misled by the terms of this motion <e> <s> it seems to imply as the noble lord lord hooson has indicated that there is some connection between the rise in violent crime and the failure to reintroduce the death penalty the suggestion being as i understood it initially that were hanging to be reintroduced there would be a sudden improvement in the violent crime figures <e> <s> i was very glad to hear from the most reverend primate that that despite the appearance of the motion was not what it meant <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two aspects to this problem are there not <e> <s> first there is the aspect of the death and degradation which are the sequel to the trafficker in this type of drug and as to those one needs no emphasis <e> <s> no doubt your lordships have received letters such as i have received frequently from distraught parents asking whether anything is being done to prevent other children from dying in the same way as their own children have died <e> <s> that is bad enough <e>", "<cs> my lords it was good to hear the wisdom of caithness matched by that of sutherland <e> <s> i too should like to pay a tribute to the quality of the speech of the noble lord lord irvine and the eloquence with which it was expressed <e> <s> it augurs well for the future of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> first of all i should like to deal or attempt to deal with the question of over-lenient sentences <e> <s> it is a truism that justice is two-edged <e> <s> if it is open to a person who thinks that he has been sentenced too severely to appeal against that sentence it seems to me that it should likewise be open to the crown to appeal in a case in which a man has manifestly been sentenced too lightly <e> <s> other jurisdictions which operate the common law use such a system without trouble and i was sorry to hear them referred to as inferior <e> <s> i do not think that either canada or australia would welcome that remark <e>", "<cs> i am incapable of the sort of histrionics we have just heard <e> <s> anything i say will be by comparison at any rate extremely dull <e> <s> i support this amendment <e> <s> it is purely a matter of practical and very dull politics <e> <s> i am unmoved by lord campbells bank managers wife <e> <s> she deserves to be treated in exactly the same way as anybody else <e> <s> nor is anyone altering any fundamental legal principles <e> <s> the fundamental legal principle is that no one is convicted unless the prosecution proves the case so that the jury or the magistrates feel sure <e> <s> that is the fundamental principle and that is not in issue here <e> <s> without going into any statistics there is no doubt that a very significant proportion of valuable crown court time is taken up by dealing with this sort of case <e> <s> it was said that per cent <e> <s> is the figure <e> <s> i do not know and i would not quarrel with that <e> <s> we are also told that the cost of one day in the crown court runs into thousands of pounds something like or <e> <s> we all know particularly in the south-east that the delay in criminal trials is unacceptable <e> <s> try as one will it is almost impossible to keep pace with the increase in the number of offences sent for trial which i think has risen by per cent <e> <s> in the past six or seven years <e> <s> in addition we now find the crown prosecution service desperately short of money <e>", "<cs> i do not <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may congratulate the noble baroness lady oppenheim-barnes on her powerful maiden speech <e> <s> it is clear that her presence here will greatly enhance the proceedings in your lordships house <e> <s> she indeed brings a breath of fresh air wherever she goes especially here <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add my congratulations to those that have already been expressed to the committee and to my noble friend lord nathan on producing such a clear and readable report <e> <s> i also apologise to my noble friend for not being here for his opening remarks <e> <s> i was gainfully employed in the royal courts of justice not on a murder appeal but on a conspiracy to rob when armed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make one or two general observations <e> <s> i shall speak first on part ii of the bill which your lordships are considering <e> <s> the judges are concerned about the long-term effects of the bill much of which one is bound to say is drafted in such a way as to make its outcome difficult to predict <e> <s> for example it seems as the noble lord lord hutchinson said that the legislation will omit what is perhaps the most important objective contained in paragraph of the white paper <e> <s> the wording of that document is not repeated in clause of the bill <e> <s> there is no repetition of the third paragraph which expressly introduces the limiting concept of the interests of justice <e> <s> i am sorry that the interests of justice have gone <e> <s> i hope that i shall not be accused of sabotaging the bill if i ask what the purpose of that omission may be <e> <s> i appreciate that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor said correctly of course that the language of the statute is necessarily different from the language of the documents which may have gone before <e> <s> but what is the necessity for that alteration <e>", "<cs> i wish to support what the noble lord lord meston said <e> <s> this is a sensitive area and at this time it is particularly sensitive because there is to be devolved to the county court this is now happening a large volume of work <e> <s> with the best will in the world the county court does not operate with the same facilities as the high court <e> <s> the transcripts of judgments and the notes of the judges are probably not as well or efficiently done as they are in the high court <e> <s> that will inevitably result in a greater volume of appeals <e>", "<cs> i confess that i do not understand the objective of the proposal <e> <s> no one doubts that the official referees do a wonderful job of work <e> <s> they relieve the judges of the high court of a number of cases which are extremely time consuming <e> <s> that leaves the judges of the high court free to do work that is possibly more intricate and more difficult <e> <s> no one queries that the official referees have all the qualities that the noble lord lord hackling has enumerated <e>"]
