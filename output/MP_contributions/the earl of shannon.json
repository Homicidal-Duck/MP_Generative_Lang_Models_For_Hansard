["<cs> my lords as previous speakers have mentioned i know that the whole house agrees with the valuable work of our european communities committee and its sub-committees <e> <s> sub-committee g has rightly drawn the attention of your lordships to the proposal we are now considering for a variety of reasons some of which appear to be of great constitutional importance but for my part i wish to make only a very brief intervention on one particular aspect of the proposal which i see was quite rightly noticed and questioned during the proceedings of the sub-committee by the noble lord lord ironside <e> <s> i refer of course to the proposed criteria in annex vi covering requirements for bodies who carry out independent testing in the absence of the self-certification procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords who have spoken i too should like to express my gratitude to the noble lord lord allen of abbey-dale for raising this subject in this house this afternoon <e> <s> as we can see merely by the size of the report this is a very wide subject and like the noble lord lord hayter i find myself struggling in very difficult waters not being one of those learned in the law <e> <s> i believe we all think that revision of the law is not something that we can say is not overdue but need we or should we really go overboard on consumerism <e> <s> consumerism laudable though it is in itself is not sensible when it is in direct contradiction to the manufacturing facts of life <e> <s> that was very well brought out by the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson and the noble lord lord hayter when they cited examples of whether industry knows what it is in for and what all this is going to cost <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble viscount for explaining in such detail this order which is now in the correct amended form as was agreed with the hosiery and allied trades research association and the industry concerned <e> <s> at this point i must declare my usual interest in matters of industrial research <e> <s> i fully appreciate that the attitude of her majestys government is that they do not wish to continue indefinitely with compulsory payments by industry <e> <s> nobody likes paying statutory levies even if they are for ones own benefit <e> <s> however i must ask her majestys government to bear in mind the vital necessity and it really is a vital necessity for british industry to keep very fully abreast of the modern technology available <e> <s> it will be our only means of maintaining our industrial economy in the face of competition from developing nations especially in the low labour-cost areas <e> <s> the textile industry has produced some classic examples of where we have not kept abreast of the latest technology and of where as a result we have lost out <e>", "<cs> my lords i regard myself as most particularly fortunate in that it has fallen to my lot to be the first speaker to have a chance to congratulate the noble lord lord sieff of brimpton on his excellent maiden speech <e> <s> he brings to your lordships house his great wealth of commercial and industrial experience which is typified in the internationally famous company which he chairs with i understand great personal involvement in that he arrives in his office before oclock in the morning every day <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> does it not sound rather unreasonable that money should be made available for workers only while they are staying at home <e> <s> if they are being trained for the future benefit of our industry should not the same money be made available <e>", "<cs> my lords we come to the end of what i think we all agree has been a most interesting and constructive debate <e> <s> as i forecast many noble lords have given us the benefit of their highly specialised and expert knowledge <e> <s> our three maiden speakers acquitted themselves with great distinction <e> <s> the noble lord lord benson referred to our self-inflicted restrictions on industry and stressed the importance of working with a common purpose <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcalpine of moffat emphasised the need for good management and sound and progressive leadership <e> <s> the noble lord lord matthews forecast the <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am among those who welcome the bill <e> <s> it is long overdue that we should have a rational well-deliberated definition of our citizenship law <e> <s> i cannot claim to speak on behalf of any ethnic minority or perhaps if i did the ethnic minority that i should be speaking on behalf of is one that should be trying to make life utterly <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to your lordships that my name is not on the official list of runners in this race <e> <s> i did intend to speak in this debate but i knew i would have to miss the earlier part of it although i have listened with great pleasure to many of the impassioned pleas from your lordships on all sides of the house on both aspects of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to make a very short intervention in this second reading debate to cover only two points <e> <s> my first point follows the comments of many previous speakers and in this respect i should declare an interest as a vice-president of the inland waterways association <e> <s> like many others of your lordships who have spoken this afternoon i am concerned with the proposal to dispense with the water space amenity commission which was set up under the water act to cover amenity users of water including navigation <e> <s> some two years ago the government proposed to dissolve the inland waterways amenity advisory council which covered the waterways administered by the british waterways board but they were fortunately dissuaded from this course of action by the very strong opposition which they incurred <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government fully satisfied that these exemptions are absolutely and critically necessary for these international organisations to perform their function <e>", "<cs> although i am not a member of your lordships select committee i too should like strongly to support the concept of this amendment as i indicated during the second reading debate when the noble lord lord sherfield was kind enough to tell us that he would be moving this amendment and the subsequent one during the committee stage <e> <s> if however i do have a criticism against this amendment it is that it could be even more specific <e>", "<cs> i regret that unlike the previous amendment i cannot support this one as i gave notice on second reading when the noble lord lord sherfield gave notice of his intention to move it <e> <s> i outlined my reasons at the time but i had better repeat them <e> <s> first such an amendment would achieve very little <e> <s> as the noble lord said the authorities are already all in voluntary membership of the water research centre <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord stanley of alderley i too seek the leave of your lordships committee to speak to my own amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it would probably be for the convenience of the committee if i make a few comments on my amendment and then all the contributions can be answered together since they are very much on the same subject <e> <s> my amendment is essentially a probing amendment in order to find answers to two particular questions <e> <s> first the bill still contains references to the consumer committees and i was wondering whether the noble lord lord skelmersdale would now be prepared to enlarge on what he said during the second reading debate <e> <s> i should like to quote part of what he said as reported at column of the <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is very grateful to the noble lord lord ardwick for his description of the bill in moving that it be read a second time <e> <s> he did so with a certain amount of diffidence and raised many of the points which i feel i should bring to your lordships attention as to why your lordships should not grant this bill your approbation <e> <s> i oppose it firstly because it is inappropriate secondly because it is unnecessary and thirdly because it is undesirable <e> <s> in moving that the bill be read a second time the noble lord referred to the fact that it had had very small consideration in the other place <e> <s> i agree because in searching through the <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the minister for explaining the order in detail and i was most pleased to hear him at the beginning of his speech extolling the virtues of the activities of the research association <e> <s> there is however one question that i should like to ask him <e> <s> i wonder whether he and his department are aware that bcira the old british cast iron research association has been in discussion with the steel castings research and trade association regarding ways of rationalising the research and development activities of the two organisations with a view ultimately to creating a single organisation to serve the technical requirements of the entire united kingdom cast metals industry <e> <s> as i understand it these discussions have recently been actively encouraged by the department of trade and industry <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down i wonder whether i may apologise to him for obviously having been an extremely bad instructor <e> <s> cast iron contains slightly more carbon than steel not the other way round <e>", "<cs> my lords it is particularly timely that the noble earl lord bess borough should draw our attention to the subject of the report of the alvey committee and to inquire of the government how they are getting on with implementing the recommendations <e> <s> although i speak from an entirely industrial rather than scientific point of view i echo the remarks of the noble lord lord flowers in welcoming this short debate first because of the supreme importance of the subject <e> <s> it far transcends almost all the other topics currently occupying so much government and public attention <e> <s> secondly and arising from the first please what is being done <e> <s> how is it progressing <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships will take the greatest interest in the response from the noble lord lord lyell <e>", "<cs> my lords i apreciate that at this late hour and with further business to follow any contribution which i may make to this second reading debate must be made extremely brief and this i shall proceed to do <e> <s> the noble lord the minister will no doubt be relieved to hear that i have no intention of entering the lists of the various protagonists of the relative merits and disadvantages of the proposals in respect of rights to buy and their consequences <e> <s> but like our excellent maiden speaker this afternoon the noble lord lord broxbourne although without his great wealth of experience and personal knowledge i shall confine my observations to parts ii and iii of the bill and in particular clauses and <e>", "<cs> i fully appreciate that the whole matter of this bill is a most emotive subject <e> <s> we all have our store of horror stories based on varying degrees of factuality and it always tends to lead us to believe that someone else is scurrilously opposed to our own particular hobby-horse <e> <s> therefore it is with particular regret that i rise to oppose this amendment as a paving amendment for the inclusion of the new schedule to the bill <e> <s> i do not have anything at all against the schedule itself i think that its conditions are admirable <e> <s> i just oppose the fact that they come as an amendment in primary legislation because as such it becomes more or less inscribed in tablets of stone for ever immutable or only alterable with immense administrative effort <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak most strongly in support of the points which have already been made most admirably by the noble lord lord nathan <e> <s> in considering the draft directives the sub-committee of which i had the privilege of being a member was faced with deliberating on a three-fold problem <e> <s> i apologise for repeating some of these points but they are essential to the argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i can hardly claim to be disappointed because it is a great pleasure being able to initiate a debate which has received so much support <e> <s> i should like to thank all those noble lords who have participated and also the minister for his kind and thoughtful response <e> <s> if we can impart our enthusiasm throughout the country industry year will undoubtedly succeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> may i ask further for an assurance that the ministers department fully appreciates the fact that it is now known that only one infected pig can generate to the power of eight infected viruses in only hours <e> <s> if there are as i know there to be at least three if not more intensive pig units of over pigs in each unit in the south of england should one or more of those units become infected it would with our prevailing south-westerly winds spread a wind-borne plume of infection over most of the country and put pretty-well the whole of the hoofed population of this country at risk <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to speak in support of the prayer moved by the noble lord lord swansea <e> <s> it would appear that there are two reasons which one can suspect for making this order <e> <s> one must surmise that the first is in order to achieve a policy of restrictions by financially penalising the innocent <e> <s> i suppose that this has been done by authorities throughout recorded history and no doubt it will be difficult to dissuade the government from treading this well-worn if very reprehensible path <e>", "<cs> my lords we must be most grateful to the noble lord lord stoddart for raising in your lordships house this evening the matter of the m ribbon development scheme which is sponsored and encouraged by the department of the environment <e> <s> about the only difference between that and the highly despised and discredited schemes of the early s is that this is more in-depth <e> <s> that just means a wider ribbon <e>", "<cs> thirdly pressure comes from greedy farmers who after nearly half a century of feather-bedding are most dismayed to find that their particular gravy train has finally hit the buffers <e> <s> no doubt under a new policy of set-aside for their land from producing grain beef butter and milk mountains and lakes they are clamouring to reap the most profitable crop of all from their land namely houses <e> <s> they do not want to be left out of the killing either <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord longford is quite right to raise the issue of the mentally disordered this evening <e> <s> however my concern and the theme of my contribution as very much seems to have been the theme of the noble lord who has just sat down is how society regards this group of people when they are discharged from their institutions <e>", "<cs> my lords you will be pleased to hear that i do no intend to detain you long this evening in view of the many speakers in this debate and the late hour <e> <s> i shall therefore not debate the relative merits of the privatisation of the water industry or its non-privatisation <e> <s> that topic has already been covered by many speakers and from every conceivable aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord cledwyn is quite right to raise the issues related to the implications of the social industrial and trade policies of the single market <e> <s> i like other members of this house try to make my contribution partly because i have the honour to be a member of your lordships european committee and privately in my capacity as chairman of strategy europe limited which is an organisation advising companies and institutions both in the united kingdom and elsewhere in terms of the single european market <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> i shall have to look at what he said <e> <s> i take it that there is an obligation to keep a margin in hand <e> <s> or is it just to meet future needs <e> <s> can the minister tell us whether there is any provision that calls for a margin in hand <e>", "<cs> i have not been able to find my way i am still at page <e> <s> i shall look at it <e> <s> i thank the noble earl very much and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for what he said <e> <s> i shall have to read again in the <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his response but i am afraid that i cannot agree <e> <s> one example he gave was that a shopkeeper may prosecute a thief <e> <s> here we are talking about industrial companies prosecuting each other <e> <s> it just does not make sense <e> <s> the noble lord said that the pollution inspectorate could prosecute <e> <s> that is perfectly correct <e> <s> it is an authority <e> <s> the national rivers authority could prosecute <e> <s> that is perfectly correct <e> <s> but if one company is in the position of being prosecuted by another company criminally this has very undesirable effects <e> <s> i gave three examples <e> <s> it cannot possibly be allowed <e> <s> authorities prosecute <e> <s> private companies have contractual arrangements between themselves and breach of contract leads to action for damages <e> <s> but private companies do not undertake criminal prosecutions against another <e> <s> i am sure that when the minister considers the matter again he will concede that there is a serious point here <e>", "<cs> do they prosecute their customers <e> <s> do they gain commercial advantage with their customers because they are in a position to prosecute <e>", "<cs> you already have a director general a national rivers authority and the pollution inspectorate three very good authorities which could prosecute <e> <s> why then give this ability to indulge in criminal prosecution of a commercial company <e> <s> it clearly does not make sense <e> <s> i am sure that the minister wishes to think it <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> i hope that the director general will realise that he should have technical advice <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry that british industry should be placed in this disadvantageous position <e> <s> i hope that the government realise that <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for his response <e> <s> it appears that the provisions that i was hoping to achieve are in fact deeply covered beneath a bushel elsewhere in the bill very deeply covered <e> <s> but i thank him for the assurance that they are there and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for his response <e> <s> i take it from him that the charges will be reasonable and directly related to the costs incurred by the national rivers authority <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> in view of that explanation i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his kind commendation of my <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that long and helpful reply <e> <s> although this is the second time on which i have raised the issue it is the first time i have been told that i am totally removing the right of prosecution <e> <s> in committee i said that prosecution should be in the hands of authorities and not public companies <e> <s> therefore i did not believe that i was removing prosecution entirely <e> <s> much of the ministers response was related to the fact that i was suggesting that there should be no prosecution <e> <s> that is not so <e> <s> i was merely suggesting that prosecution should be in the hands of authorities and not commercial companies <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord renton for searching that out <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make only a short intervention in this debate <e> <s> unlike most other speakers i was not a member of sub-committee b nevertheless i am most grateful to the noble lord lord shepherd and his sub-committee for this well considered report and for the way in which he presented it to the house this afternoon <e> <s> he highlighted many of its important conclusions <e> <s> it is difficult to make any observations about the report without referring to those conclusions although they may have already been mentioned by other speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords in answering the noble lord i must now declare an interest as i am a vice-president of the inland waterways association <e> <s> as he probably well knows we built our canals rather a long time ago <e> <s> therefore the lock chambers are very narrow <e> <s> we produced a type of boat known as the narrow boat to cope with those lock chambers <e>", "<cs> my lords in my short contribution to the debate i like the noble lord lord coleraine wish to draw the attention of the house to a section of the bill headed <e>", "<cs> my proposed amendment does not seem to have attracted much support <e> <s> it was not my intention to be mischievous or to try to wreck anything <e> <s> i appreciate that my amendment may be incorrect in suggesting that there may be some form of nomination included by those two bodies <e> <s> however it seems a little odd that members of one faction should be allowed to monitor and write the rules for the operations of their competitors <e> <s> it does not seem to me to be exactly fair nor will it be seen to be fair by anyone else <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> they were just the assurances that i was hoping for <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has rather beaten me to the post <e> <s> although his amendment amendment no <e> <s> c comes after my amendment amendment no <e> <s> obviously it covers very much the same ground <e> <s> should my amendments amendments nos <e> <s> and fail i shall very strongly support amendment no <e> <s> c to which the noble lord has spoken but not yet moved <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord for his reply <e> <s> i am sure that the member who tabled the amendment will be pleased to read that in <e>", "<cs> i realised when i put down the amendment that i might be treading on some toes but my i did not realise quite how tender those toes were <e> <s> the object of my amendment was to draw attention to the fact that we had two incongruous clauses alongside each other one saying that you may have this extra freedom and the other saying that you will not be allowed to use it <e> <s> that fortunately was when the noble lord lord renton brought us back to the subject of my amendment <e> <s> previous to that we heard some pretty good speeches but i would suggest that they were not on my amendment <e> <s> they were made to an amendment that was not down on the marshalled list <e> <s> they were speeches to an amendment to leave out subsections and <e>", "<cs> as i have already spoken on this matter at length i shall not seek to move this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all noble lords who have taken part in this short short debate <e> <s> we may have been short on numbers but i believe that your lordships will agree that the quality of the contributions was that generally associated with your lordships house <e> <s> all contributors spoke with great knowledge on the various aspects of the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill demonstrates three sentiments the chiding of the offender the brutalising of the vulnerable and the politic of slamming the door after the horse has bolted <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to all those who have spoken with reference to my amendment and especially to the noble lord lord mcintosh even though he said that my speech was somewhat recycled <e> <s> i thought that there might possibly be noble lords who were not present on the previous occasion <e> <s> i should draw the committees attention to the fact that we had exactly the same recycled reply from the minister <e> <s> his brief was exactly the same as the one that he read out on two previous occasions <e>"]
