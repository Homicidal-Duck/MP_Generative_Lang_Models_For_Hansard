["<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls on what is certainly a modest but also an excellent bill <e> <s> he has been very careful to say that his bill does not alter in any way the legislation which prevails at the moment to do with the sale of intoxicating liquors <e> <s> he has emphasised that several times <e> <s> it is a very curious area of legislation the licensing laws of this country <e> <s> indeed any visitor to these shores not familiar with our strange ways might well be excused for thinking that wherever we have something which has to do with objective morality whether it be attitudes towards drink prostitution or gambling we get ourselves into a bit of a mess <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first of all like to express my appreciation to the noble lord lord terrington for giving me a chance to speak on this question as a fairly recent member of the wider share ownership council <e> <s> there is nothing like having to speak on a subject to concentrate the mind <e> <s> in preparing my speech i have been aware of my comparative lack of detailed knowledge of wider share owning schemes and so on <e> <s> therefore if your lordships will permit me i shall get on to a rather more general basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord graham of edmonton for coming up with the word i have been seeking that word is perception <e> <s> ever since our debate last december i have tried to find a word that is charitable and understanding in describing how it was that the governments line on the british film industry came about <e> <s> i believe the noble lord was absolutely right when he said that it was due to a lack of perception <e> <s> even taking into account the white paper and the distinguished persons who were consulted and who were acknowledged in that white paper the lack of perception there is very clear <e> <s> that lack of perception is not something that has suddenly come forth from this government it has perhaps endured for a great length of time <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a debate of very high quality <e> <s> there has been a number of speakers who have been fairly dazzling in their performance among whom not least i think was the noble earl the minister <e> <s> if i may i should like to draw upon one or two of the points that he raised before getting into the more general areas of arts as understood by the man in the street in this country which are somewhat different from the arts as seen and understood by people who are involved with them by politicians and indeed by civil servants <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl for that <e> <s> i understand exactly what he is saying <e> <s> i think it is an unfortunate misconception in the eyes of the man in the street and not i must say discouraged by the very unseemly confrontations between the arts council and sir peter hall in the sunday press and i give all credit to the head of the arts council and also sir peter hall as being men of enormous ability who are dedicated in their own ways to solving the problem which faces them <e>", "<cs> first of all i should like to thank the noble viscount lord mersey <e> <s> i am encouraged by having an ally on the other side of the house an ally in our fairly new approach to a very difficult task which is to introduce amendments of this kind <e>", "<cs> i too support this amendment but somewhat more enthusiastically than i supported the last amendment because although i hate to use emotive words such as parasitic one could justifiably if in a rather liverish mood say that the use of video tape in the way that it potentially can be used is parasitic <e> <s> i have just acquired a video recorder <e> <s> i have not yet used it because i am long-sighted and have not yet found a way to operate the controls <e> <s> if there are any entrepreneurial noble lords there is obviously an opportunity to market a light or something else perhaps that magnifies the controls so that one can learn to use the machine quicker <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i am addressing myself to these amendments together and i think that my remarks will terminate in such a way that we shall see that they are all dealt with <e>", "<cs> i shall be very brief <e> <s> i must thank the noble lord lloyd of hampstead for his complimentary reception of my speech <e> <s> i did not mean to deliver a devastating attack i do not like to be devastating and i do not like to attack <e> <s> that is why i sit on these benches <e> <s> nor am i a man for all seasons if i may interject that to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend lord mcintosh of haringey has <e>", "<cs> my lords there is very little that i can say to follow the noble lords in their remarks about the national film and television school <e> <s> it is the cradle of talent in this country not only the cradle of talent to supply the british film industry indeed it supplies all the creative and technical people in television and films who are at present used by the american film industry over here <e> <s> they are people who are very keenly sought and at the moment it is very much to the financial advantage of american companies to use them <e> <s> but that resource which we hope will continue to serve not only our industry but also other industries will not go on automatically and for ever unless this kind of unique institution is maintained at the very high level which is at present recognised the world over <e> <s> it deserves to have its status enshrined in statute <e> <s> the status gives it a better bargaining power and hopefully if we move forward into a more prosperous era of film making it will not only serve television but the film industry equally and can do nothing but enhance our reputation abroad <e> <s> i can add nothing further to the eloquent way in which the noble lord has spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords i briefly support the amendment which i think is a reasonable one <e> <s> in the committee stage some noble lords expressed misgivings particularly about the negotiations with television <e> <s> however in my case i was more strongly in favour of getting some return from the video industry <e> <s> this is a likeable amendment and i hope that the minister will find it likeable <e> <s> it gives some flexibility in the event of the new consortium needing to draw from these areas which benefit enormously from the production of films <e> <s> i hope that the minister will give careful consideration to a well thought out and reasoned amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it a great privilege to be addressing your lordships in this debate <e> <s> we have to thank the noble lord lord hatch for introducing this topic <e> <s> i do not think that in the short time i have been speaking in this house just under a year i have heard from both sides of the house so many speeches which have had such quality <e> <s> i think that whatever television brings one way or the other to the reputation of your lordships house speeches of this kind deserve to be read by everybody <e> <s> one of the first things i shall do is to show the copy of <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a disadvantage to speak at this stage in a debate in that one is so fascinated by the points which have been raised by other noble lords that one is distracted from the theme which one had prepared <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord lord thomas of swynnerton for giving us the opportunity to talk about this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to rise briefly to support the amendment of the noble viscount lord mersey but with a slight reservation which is based on lord williss remarks on the contribution which television could make to the cinema <e> <s> i seldom agree with the governments views on a free market but i think it is healthy that the television companies should be able to negotiate with film companies across the table and come to an agreement based really on the market as it stands at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support this reframed amendment in no wish to conflict with the other place <e> <s> british film year has now begun and since we last discussed the matters largely contained in this amendment it has been shown by recent broadcasts mostly sound broadcasts and a general debate in the country that there is a wide interest and a wide concern about the british film industry <e> <s> i stress the word british <e> <s> the british aspect of this is something which has given many noble lords a good deal of anxiety on this bill for it seems that the government have not fully appreciated the concern about the british film industry <e> <s> they see the film industry as an international film industry in which we have a role to play <e> <s> we have been over these arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords when i put my name down to speak to this bill i thought that it would be a simple matter <e> <s> it seemed a short bill and a fairly clear issue <e> <s> over the last two days i have spoken to a number of noble lords and i now realise that i am in an area of great expertise <e> <s> i did not realise that the matter had been so widely debated <e> <s> the animation and enthusiasm with which this subject is discussed is rather like joining a meeting of the porsche owners club <e> <s> not to be flippant about this a number of matters have drawn me to the bill but my travels in africa over a number of years have made me recoil at the dreadful practices which take place in certain countries in east africa <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the <e> <s> minister and i was not doing that <e> <s> i rather clumsily bracketed a number of monstrosities together <e> <s> i was not suggesting that this committee was in any way involved <e> <s> i was trying to illustrate to the house that over a period of years there have been a number of projects with which this committee was involved <e> <s> the palumbo one was not but i think it groups itself quite naturally in ones mind with those monstrosities <e> <s> it is the purpose of the movers of this amendment to ensure that all steps are taken to prevent projects of this kind going forward without every possible precaution being taken through the electoral system <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for his courteous and lucid remarks <e> <s> i should also like to express my appreciation to the noble lord lord montagu for throwing some light on the body and the kind of considerations that it has in mind <e> <s> i do not like using the phrase those on this side of the house because it is a pity that this is something that develops along party lines <e> <s> i believe that conservation of this kind should go above these considerations <e> <s> nevertheless what concerns us a great deal is the strategic long-term planning of conservation and the preservation of buildings <e> <s> all of us i believe have the same ends in view <e> <s> it may be upon the manner in which we reach those ends that we disagree <e> <s> it is perhaps that we have rather vaguer ideas of the monitoring of taste over a long period <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the ministers point <e> <s> there is an area of confusion here and it is an area of confusion which is in many peoples minds outside your lordships chamber <e> <s> i think that the whole view of conservation in this area is extremely woolly <e> <s> in a way i may have projected this woolliness in your lordships house but i think it is useful in that it shows that in public attitudes there are areas which give rise to concern <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that this week there were the british film institute awards <e> <s> following on what the noble lord lord graham of edmonton was saying and i should like to add that both he and i were present at these awards sir richard attenborough drew attention to the fact that since the start of british film year there has been an increase of per cent <e> <s> in film attendances and that the british film industry is making enormous efforts and showing great enthusiasm <e> <s> will the government bear in mind on their side in any future talks as regards importations of film and video cassettes and so on that it is necessary to protect this very encouraging momentum in the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount the leader of the house consider that this matter involves a sense of urgency <e> <s> i ask that in the light of the fact that the industry is now being viewed in popular jargon as a sunset industry which it certainly is not since man has not devised a better means of carrying large amounts of goods other than by sea <e> <s> our lack of activity and the run-down is due to our deficiency in competitiveness <e> <s> is it not a matter of urgency to consider whether a more long-term view ought to be taken of the whole issue by means of a committee in terms of redeveloping reinvesting and creating more innovation in this industry rather than indulging in the short-term view of flagging out or worse still selling out <e> <s> which will leave us with a maritime industry confined to a few telex rooms in the city of london <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble viscount lord montgomery for giving me an opportunity to speak yet again on the subject of changing the licensing laws of this country <e> <s> i spoke to the bill introduced by the noble lord <e> <s> lord harmar-nicholls to which the noble viscount has just referred <e> <s> since that time in fact only this afternoon i learnt of a very interesting piece of information which i believe is relevant <e> <s> it comes from a booklet published by the brewers society which some noble lords may have read <e> <s> it reveals a very surprising fact and that is that the united kingdom is an example of moderation in drinking habits <e> <s> in the light of recent events in football grounds and so on many of your lordships may find that surprising <e> <s> however among countries having similar standards of living and so on this country ranks twenty-first in terms of <e>", "<cs> my lords we too on these benches should like to thank the noble baroness for repeating this most important statement which has been made in another place <e> <s> nobody would dispute that the government and indeed the country have responded most generously and most efficiently to this emergency <e> <s> we stress the word emergency we always act in this way to an emergency <e> <s> i am very glad to hear that the government are considering extending their use of these aircraft for the very important aspect of the transport of grain in ethiopia <e>", "<cs> my lords it may not surprise your lordships to hear that that part of the gracious speech which caught my attention was the mention of wider share ownership <e> <s> i think it is well known in your lordships house that we on these benches attach a great deal of importance to wider share ownership as a means of broadening the owning of assets in this country <e> <s> it was a fleeting mention nothing much was said about it in the papers the next day but i was encouraged this morning when the chancellor was being interviewed about his speech yesterday to hear that again he mentioned wider share ownership <e> <s> i will not criticise the fairly superficial way in which this complicated subject has been tackled so far <e> <s> it is encouraging at least that this is seen as an <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many noble lords on this side of the house particularly who may feel that it is a great pity that we are having this debate at all <e> <s> it is a great pity that an <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first in this fascinating debate pay tribute to the maiden speaker the noble lord lord clitheroe who made what was for me a model maiden speech <e> <s> it was brief it was to the point it was courteous it had humour and best of all it was admirably suited to the topic that we are debating <e> <s> here is a noble lord who has been educated through the traditional systems of our country and who has taken the path so rarely taken today or indeed so rarely ever taken of going into industry <e> <s> he has been at the sharp end of industry if i may use that expression <e> <s> his remarks tonight have been bolstered by other noble lords who also come from the sharp end the cutting edge of industry <e> <s> i hope very much that when we have further discussions on this sort of topic we shall hear more from the noble lord lord clitheroe <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble viscount lord buckmaster for giving us the opportunity of putting on record tonight some of our thoughts about uganda <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships will have been impressed by the moving way in which the noble viscount lord buckmaster has painted the picture the sad picture of uganda over the past or so years <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also thank the noble baroness for repeating the statement which has been made in another place today <e> <s> i hope that i may be excused for waxing rather patriotic on this statement because i think it is a great pleasure to welcome an episode which reflects so well on the british in every respect <e> <s> it is seldom that we have an opportunity to do so these days with so many gloomy and distressing events given prominence in the press and on television <e> <s> the exercise as anyone who listened to the radio this morning will have heard from the account of rear-admiral garnier was carried through with the utmost good humour efficiency and courage by all concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble viscount lord montgomery for giving us a chance again to discuss this most interesting topic <e> <s> it is always one which produces colourful speeches <e> <s> i already feel a bit of a wet blanket following the noble lord lord molloy with whose sentiments i agree but i am afraid that i shall probably introduce one or two caveats <e> <s> this does not mean to say that i am not entirely for the idea of the liberalisation of our licensing laws but one may forget that it has been years since the scots tried this departure from the british method of the control of <e>", "<cs> my lords in the sad and disturbing hours since the american strike one of the <e>",

the end of the obote regime was training pilots to fly low level helicopters that were ultimately used against the museveni forces <e> <s> will she kindly say what control or influence the government have over such private organisations which may be giving service to repressive regimes <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble viscount lord blakenham for allowing us the opportunity to air our views on this subject <e> <s> i also very much agreed with the noble lord lord jenkins in his summary of the history leading up to the position that we have today where copying has become such an enormous growth industry <e> <s> as the noble earl lord arran said it has become so easy to make cheap money <e> <s> it has grown to such proportions in the record industry and the video industry that i should like to confine my remarks and i am happy to say that i shall be brief to those two areas and to ask the noble lord the minister whether in his reply he can give answers to two specific points as regards each area <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a truly remarkable debate and i thank the noble viscount the leader of the house for giving me at any rate a chance to contribute to it <e> <s> i think it is a pity that with competition from summer events in this country tennis and so on a wider public is not going to have access to some of the remarkable speeches made today <e>

who gave an astonishing historical account of south africa and what has led up to the situation today <e>", "<cs> we on these benches are grateful to the noble lord lord hatch for giving us this opportunity of speaking yet again on the subject of south africa and apartheid and the attitude that we on these benches have against that horrible repressive regime which exists in south africa today <e> <s> it is a pity that on the occasion of the excellent debate which we had in this house on south africa we had to compete with supporting events which gave us the minimum publicity and we have now to give voice to our feelings at a late hour when most of our internal clocks are not geared to bringing out the best <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness enlighten me to what extent our policy on aid to africa is influenced by the growing cancer of corruption in certain african countries with which we deal <e> <s> what influence can the government bring to bear on fellow members of the commonwealth to put their houses in order in this respect <e> <s> would this not be an opportune time to bring that point up and to deal with this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to talk on a subject which i think is ignored in this country and therefore i am not surprised that it did not form part of the gracious speech <e> <s> i think that it is not going to be ignored for much longer <e> <s> i refer to the alarming increase in alcohol consumption among the young and the attendant social problems connected with it <e> <s> indeed in my remarks i will cover increased consumption generally and the harm that that does and shall produce some statistics in the hope that i shall not bore your lordships too much <e> <s> really it is the young which concern me because i think that this is a growing trend <e> <s> we have seen it in other countries it goes hand in hand with youth culture <e> <s> the increased consumption of alcohol with the health problems and the crime problems that that has brought is something that has had to be dealt with in other western european countries where youth culture has developed over the past years <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support the bill of the noble viscount lord montgomery <e> <s> there is no inconsistency with the recent speech that i made in your lordships house where i promoted the idea that we had a very severe problem as regards alcohol in this country <e> <s> i support this bill for the very good reason as the noble lord has just said if i may take the meaning of what he has said that it improves the quality of our life here to enable people to pursue the civilised pursuit of eating and drinking and all that that entails <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very grateful to my noble friend lord taylor of gryfe <e> <s> i am particularly pleased to have a lucky colleague on these benches <e> <s> this is the second time that he has been lucky in one of the ballots for the wednesday debate and it is the second very topical and important subject he has brought before us <e>", "<cs> i also congratulate the noble viscount lord montgomery of alamein on what i think is an excellent compromise <e> <s> although i <e>", "<cs> my lords as i was coming down one of the corridors in your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords when i first began to give thought to what i would say in your lordships debate today my mind went back to a chill morning at the end of last year when i made my way up to muswell hill to take part in the memorial service to police constable blakelock <e> <s> it was a surprise engagement <e> <s> i was replacing somebody much more important than i i was to represent my party on the platform on that sombre occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i recall that in the early s i was associated with a company that was selling hand-powered tools to a certain african country <e> <s> we had arranged for a young african salesman to come here to learn the art of selling these tools in his own country which happened to be kenya <e> <s> after his first weekend here and the factory where he was learning was in the suburbs of london i met him and asked him how he had spent his weekend <e> <s> he had been to that most famous of places of public entertainment hyde park corner <e> <s> he looked at me and said i have seen the most astonishing thing <e> <s> i have seen a place where people are allowed to say the

corner <e> <s> the noble lord lord soper has been a distinguished speaker there for many years <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his intervention <e> <s> i would agree broadly with what he says though i should keep off that particular area of the world because i do not have any personal knowledge of it <e> <s> but i would certainly say that the united states government and indeed the british government have appeared to be unsatisfactory in their support of regimes in many <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not curious and rather sad that set against the financial embarrassment of cannon and their selling of cinemas and of per cent <e> <s> of our feature film heritage in this country over the past two years we have seen cinema audiences double from february to february <e> <s> that shows that what is commonly known as the culture of the moving image is centre stage in our cultural life <e> <s> may it not be appropriate for the government to take firm steps to protect our audio-visual heritage in the form of films so that the young who are a major part of the audiences in our cinemas can have safe access in the future to films without having to apply to either mr weintraub who has bought or is going to buy the cannon films or anyone else abroad who may buy the rest <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the widely accepted connection between under-age drinking and football hooliganism is the minister generally satisfied with the enforcement of the laws against under-age drinking which leads to these abuses <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain your lordships long as i am following in this unstarred question some masterly and robust speeches particularly the speeches of the noble lord lord aldington and of my noble friend lord ezra <e> <s> i do not believe

"<cs> my lords is not the truth of the matter that the link is between alcohol and bad and often deplorable behaviour in the somewhat tribal and exuberant atmosphere of football grounds and journeys to and from them <e> <s> is there not a responsibility on purveyors of alcohol in particular at airports and in the vicinity of cross-channel ferries to ensure that its availability is carefully controlled <e> <s> the reputation of british fans abroad is becoming worse and is leading to greater violence <e>", "<cs> we on these benches view this clause with alarm and we wholeheartedly support

ability to express their moral concerns and to take from local government the ability to reflect the moral concerns of ordinary people and take them to the centre <e>", "<cs> since the minister mentioned me personally could i say that it is not purely a moral issue whether i buy a golden delicious apple or a coxs orange pippin <e> <s> however it may be a moral matter if producers of apples

friendless at the beginning of this debate but help came like the united states cavalry <e> <s> i can confirm the prognostication of my noble friend lord harris that i do not propose to push this to a

policy in south africa have been laudable although they may have been criticised by those nations who wish for a greater commitment <e> <s> the first feature of the policy is the wish to bring people around the table to move towards a negotiated settlement <e> <s> my question on that is is it now possible to reach a negotiated settlement when we can no longer have access to the people who previously could have sat around the table because of the banning of the united democratic front and the organisations which have declared peaceable means as the way to bring about a settlement in south africa <e> <s> it seems to me and my colleagues on these benches that that feature of british policy is no longer effective <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister comment on the restrictive practices which exist between exhibitors and distributors in this country <e> <s> that matter has been adversely reported upon by the monopolies and mergers commission and has also been taken up by the government who have expressed an intention to bring forward legislation on the subject <e> <s> what is likely to be the timetable <e> <s> will the minister further agree that any more delay will prevent independent cinema owners from investing in new comfortable cinemas in which people can watch the new and exciting films which we are led to understand will be coming from the british film industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the amendment because attitudes in the country are now happily changing <e> <s> it is a proposal which at some stage of the bill most noble

probably share my view because although the government have fought against some of the amendments with customary vigour i sense a very encouraging wish on the part of the government seriously to tackle the social problem of drinking in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be churlish not to appreciate the governments acceptance of the motivation behind the amendment which i moved

will be granted so the few which remain will make the properties desirable and these may well be purchased by people who have more efficient and commercially successful marketing experience <e> <s> the likelihood is that more alcohol will be sold <e> <s> that was the point i was making <e> <s> bearing that in mind i am slightly concerned about the criteria which justices will have in mind when they either renew licences or consider the transfer of licences <e> <s> i believe that because those premises will be rare and because unhappily there is a desire in people to drink in areas which seem to be dangerous there will be some demand for these premises <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow the historic perspective of the right reverend prelate the bishop of manchester <e> <s> i congratulate him on what i thought was an excellent speech and for covering so many points in the time allotted <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches welcome this albeit modest bill which the noble lord lord graham of edmonton has put before the house <e> <s> modest though it is it is a most important bill because it closes yet another loophole in the law as regards the definition of what is a wholesale sale and what is a retail sale of alcohol <e> <s> one has to view this bill against a sad background in this country <e> <s> it is a sad commentary on british life that a section of british youth seems determined to use a large proportion of its disposable income in buying alcohol not simply for eventual consumption but for immediate consumption <e> <s> more often than not that leads to intoxication with alarming results <e> <s> those results are very evident on a bank holiday for example <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support in particular the amendment put down by the noble baroness lady masham on health education to which i also have put my name <e> <s> it is admirably grouped with another set of amendments under the heading of road safety <e> <s> these would have been spoken to by the noble lord lord tordoff who is unfortunately not able to be with us today <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that encouraging answer <e> <s> does he agree that one of the most depressing aspects of many of the reported cases of attacks on police in rural areas by groups of youths some under the influence of drink has been the attitude of the public standing in the vicinity of the attack <e> <s> the noble earl will correct me if i am wrong but is there not a common-law duty on every citizen to assist the police wherever possible <e> <s> is it not a sombre comment on todays society that often people in the vicinity of a callous attack such as the recent attack on a woman police officer at maidstone offer no assistance but actual opposition to the police

not be embodied in the statute <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to my noble friend lord harris o r greenwich for asking the question for giving us the opportunity to discuss this very grave problem and for putting so eloquently this depressing picture of rising crime figures on our underground and the seeming inability of the current police force the british transport police to cope with the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that from the film makers point of view london is now one of the most difficult places in which to get the necessary permission for location work <e> <s> this deters film makers for whom locations are as important as studio facilities <e> <s> is there any way the government can provide some guidance to local authorities so as to achieve

sensible to have a distinguishing plate on the motorway where they will be encountering very heavy traffic <e> <s> in some places particularly on the m traffic is far in excess of that expected and people become impatient <e> <s> it will be extremely useful both for other drivers and for the driver with the plate in ensuring that a proper berth is given to him <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships will be aware from these benches your lordships would normally be listening to my noble friend lord donaldson of kingsbridge who with his long experience is able to speak with much more

increasing source of complaint or is it decreasing <e>", "<cs> i should just like to endorse what the noble viscount lord brookeborough and the noble lord lord fitt have said <e> <s> the point was raised on second reading by several noble lords <e> <s> it seems quite unreasonable of the government not to give this potential legislation the kind of teeth which will make it work rather than

that on board <e> <s> i am also concerned about those who have not heard the arguments in the debate voting if this amendment is pressed to a division and am worried about the effect that that will have on opinion in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i read the draft codes with great pleasure first for the content which i find very interesting particularly as i have been a town dweller for some years now and second i hope that this is an encouraging trend because they are written in very good english <e> <s> paragraph of the revised sheep code substitutes sheep with poor teeth for sheep with inadequate dentification in the existing code <e> <s> that is an improvement by anyones standards <e> <s> i suppose that for sheep farmers the code is much the same as those old driving manuals

sight and my long period as a town dweller that in the section giving guidance to stockmen to ensure that sheep are in good condition i read absence of cudding as absence of cuddling <e> <s> i came

his interjection <e> <s> however i wonder whether the meat is widely eaten in this country <e> <s> can understand that it is in third world countries and that demand is growing in this country <e> <s> if it is an increasing business one can expect more people to engage in the farming of those animals <e> <s> they will probably be novices in the main so the codes will be extremely valuable <e> <s> however i understand that the code has much the same effect as does the highway code on road users <e> <s> it lays down the framework and is helpful in the event of court cases being brought against people who treat animals cruelly <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that interesting interjection <e> <s> i am sure that if deer farming becomes profitable inexperienced people will enter the trade <e> <s> again the code will be extremely useful <e> <s> i hope it will be widely read so that those who do not understand the animals but intend to farm and slaughter them will

which i think includes animals which cause traffic accidents and damage livestock as well as the cost of finding and taking away stray animals <e> <s> further if he does agree with that figure is that not sufficient justification for some sensible legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches welcome the bill wholeheartedly <e> <s> the only question that one asks is why such a bill was not introduced earlier <e> <s> section of the act which is now replaced seems very confusing if one puts oneself in the position of a police officer <e> <s> that is an important aspect <e> <s> police

brougham and vaux on his good fortune in having been successful in the ballot and thank him for giving us the chance to talk about both the north report and the governments white paper both of which

been discussed previously in your lordships house <e> <s> there was recently a starred question on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the innovation of an electronic braking

this subject <e> <s> can the minister further tell me what her majestys government have done or are intending to do to implement the european parliaments resolution passed on th march which urged all

can direct these unfortunate offenders many of whom are habitual offenders to detoxification centres for drying out and further counselling and treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords with reference to the ministers answer to a previous question is it not a fact that although it may be true that police officers do not normally take a drunken person into custody unless he has committed an offence there are often occasions when drunks on the street are themselves at risk if not endangering other peoples lives <e> <s> is it not true that they are taken into custody because there is no other place to which they can be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that recent opinion polls and the television programme thats life last week show that a large majority of people in this country would now welcome random breath testing if i may follow on the question of the noble lord who preceded me <e> <s> are the government prepared to introduce random breath testing <e> <s> can the minister give us some details about the governments thinking <e>", "<cs> my lords apart from the interest displayed by all noble lords i have a family interest in the theatre since my direct ancestors

<e> <s> he used to go over to somerset house to receive payment for himself and his company <e> <s> therefore i think that in some degree a member of my family has been responsible for william

have films at cannes but they are not in competition <e> <s> that is the point as i hope the minister has grasped from my question <e> <s> is he also aware that in and there is no reason to believe

that is not a new development <e> <s> i understand that it has always been the case <e> <s> when homelessness in london became a noticeable problem it was discovered that most people who slept rough did so because they had an alcohol problem <e> <s> that has changed recently and in particular during the past five years with the unhappy growth of the number of young people who have become homeless <e> <s> the situation is reversing itself <e> <s> a large proportion of the homeless who live rough are likely to become chronically alcoholic through exposure to the lifestyle of those who live rough rather than living rough because they have those problems in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that the enormous reductions of the great elephant herds in kenya over the past years is a matter of world concern <e> <s> since we have strong relations with kenya would it not be possible for her majestys government to put pressure upon the kenyan government <e> <s> there is no doubt that many people in high places in that country have enriched themselves through that shocking trade which is the source of supply for much of the ivory sold in hong kong and other places <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that the monthly wage of what is in fact a game warden if i can help the noble viscount is around or kenyan shillings per month and that that kind of wage hardly induces him to resist the approaches of people involved in this terrible trade <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord kimball for giving us this opportunity to talk

alcohol abuse <e> <s> although i may have on occasions criticised the industry for not contributing more in certain areas one has to commend their initiatives to enhance social responsibility with

mention the commitment of the industry to publicise the new strength requirements to improve awareness of drinkers of the alcoholic strength of different drinks <e> <s> it has been an area of confusion <e> <s> more people are becoming aware of which drinks are strong or weak <e> <s> that is helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree with me that one of the most bewildering and

treatment than there is in england particularly for young people <e> <s> in this country i am a trustee of a foundation which runs two treatment centres for alcohol and drug addicts <e> <s> it is one of the most alarming and saddening things to see the ever lower age of those who are admitted for treatment <e> <s> as other noble lords have said i am absolutely behind the motivation for this bill

baroness lady trumpington on the clear and concise way in which she presented the main contents of the bill <e> <s> i hope that i can be equally concise and clear in bringing your lordships attention to some of the weaknesses that we have identified <e> <s> we do so in a spirit of co-operation rather than in one of carping criticism <e> <s> the debate has shown that noble lords on all sides of the house wish to achieve the same result although we have slightly different ways of approaching it and perhaps <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of my noble friend lord tordoff i echo the sentiments

for consumers <e> <s> i do not intend to press the amendment but reserve the right to consult my advisers and perhaps come back at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> i do not wish to contradict her but in my understanding and i suggest in the understanding of the average purchaser describes means the use of words <e> <s> however i take what she says and am reassured by that <e> <s> i hope that other noble lords including the noble earl are equally reassured <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may be permitted to respond to the noble lord <e> <s> i intended to make some remarks on that very subject in relation to the last amendment i shall move in this group <e> <s> that amendment refers to the type of legislation being used and although i have no particular objection to discussing this on the present amendment what i have to say on the subject of irradiation will be dealt with in connection with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i shall wish at that stage to take up the points which the noble lord has raised <e>", "<cs> we have had a most useful debate on this subject and one which was refreshingly non-party political in content <e> <s> i have listened with enormous interest to all the views expressed from the other side of the chamber <e> <s> moreover i take on board many of the points raised especially those in connection with the difficulties <e> <s> of course i realise the difficulties in taking this process to its ultimate conclusion and i appreciate the vision of rows of ladies with hoes progressing down the field as given by the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour <e> <s> i quite take her point <e>", "<cs> it has again been an interesting debate <e> <s> i sense a pleasing invitation from the noble viscount opposite which i shall gladly take up <e> <s> he will introduce me to expensive wines which have no after-effects <e>

leave all the things about which we are complaining would not be satisfactory <e> <s> i take on board what the minister has said <e> <s> i shall take back this matter and look at it but at this stage i should like to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can enlighten the noble lord <e> <s> i have taken the trouble to ask experts to explain to me what happens <e> <s> to the amateur and the layman it is a fairly stomach-turning description of what happens to meat of this kind <e> <s> probably the noble lord lord colwyn was on the verge of telling us about it but withdrew <e>", "<cs> i have learnt something from this exchange as i hope other members of the committee have <e> <s> i do not intend to press the amendment <e> <s> this is a new situation which needs to be examined both by the government and those who seek to tighten up safeguards <e> <s> for the time being and under those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble

minister outside the chamber or if the committee will bear with me i could do so now <e> <s> i have several examples of such cases <e> <s> for the convenience of the committee i suggest to the noble baroness that when i respond at the end of the debate i produce that information for her <e>", "<cs> i have the sources here and if i may i shall produce them when i rise to speak later <e>", "<cs> i listened with interest to the noble baroness <e> <s> obviously i take exception to some of the words she used such as scaremongering <e> <s> i do not believe that scaremongering is a factor there is a

the same aims <e>", "<cs> there is considerable concern among members of the industry who deal with fresh products of this kind <e> <s> for that reason i support the noble lord <e> <s> mushrooms

nutritional value in food except perhaps in one or two examples in regard to infant food <e> <s> there might be a temptation to present the food in an attractive way using colour and so on to the detriment of its nutritional value <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for that explanation <e> <s> i fully understand and accept the argument that she put forward which seems to be most appropriate <e> <s> under those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am encouraged by the ministers remarks <e> <s> the committees to which i referred are too expert for one to expect the consumer to take a leading role <e> <s> i was suggesting that there might be an increase in consumer participation even if it is on the edges of those committees <e> <s> i take on board what the minister says and i am generally encouraged by her recognition of what prompted the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness <e>

cases authorised officers will act within their own areas under what is termed the home authority principle sampling foodstuffs and ingredients and submitting them to their own public analyst <e> <s> however on occasions retail samples of products actually produced outside the authority on analysis are reported as either incorrect or suspect and further inquiries have to be undertaken at the point of manufacture <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness <e> <s> i am encouraged by that remark i shall pass it on to my noble friend <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness very much for her help and guidance <e> <s> i shall discuss the matter with my noble friend lord ezra <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i again thank the noble baroness for that guidance <e> <s> we shall examine what she has said <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> at this late hour i have tried to follow closely what

middleton in that the excellent report from the select committee of your lordships house should be squeezed into such a short time between other business <e> <s> i came to this chamber principally to learn <e> <s> as noble lords know we discussed this matter to a certain extent in the preliminary stages of the governments food and safety bill <e> <s> noble lords held themselves back if i may use that expression in order to learn more from the members of the committee <e> <s> i am disappointed that there should be so few of that committee here tonight <e> <s> nevertheless <e>", "<cs> my lords

minister give the precise amount of ivory in hong kong and say what proportion of it is deemed to come from legal sources <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to express my support for the amendment moved by the noble lord lord gallacher <e> <s> it is a fact sad though it may be that public confidence has suffered enormously especially since december <e> <s> however that was not as was implied by the noble lord lord peyton due to unease as regards the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food it is because there is a general lack of confidence in <e>", "<cs> much longer than minutes as the noble baroness says in order to destroy the natural toxins which are contained in the beans <e> <s> i bow to her experience in cooking <e> <s> i believe that commendably the government have written to the bean trade if one may describe it as such asking those involved to label their products with the requisite cooking instructions <e> <s> however there is no legal requirement no legislative inducement for those who sell red kidney beans to conform to the governments request <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble baroness and i understand each other much better perhaps because it is earlier in the evening than on the previous occasion <e> <s> i understand what she has said and it is true that the bill goes a good way towards allaying many peoples fears about the relationship between government and food safety in times of changing needs <e> <s> the rejection of the amendment is still puzzling to many of us who criticise the absence of an absolute safety requirement <e> <s> this would put an obligation on those who supply food to the public to undertake to provide food which is safe in the way indicated in my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords although i cannot support the noble earls amendment in the way that it is framed i agree with a great deal of what he says to support the amendment <e> <s> we have had many opportunities in this house to discuss the process of irradiation <e> <s> unusually a select committee of the house was set up to study irradiation between the committee and report stages of the bill <e> <s> much information has been given to us from

read it tomorrow and i dare say that everything will become clear <e> <s> obviously we are disappointed that we cannot take the measure that i proposed in the amendment and i dare say that the matter will be taken further in another place <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all noble lords who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> the noble baroness said that the difficulties in europe are political <e> <s> i imagine that most difficulties in europe are political <e> <s> i am not absoluely sure what she meant <e> <s> all i am saying concerning this amendment is that we should wait until europe resolves whatever its difficulties are even if they are political <e> <s> however i fancy that they are more than that <e>", "<cs> my lords it will come as no surprise to the house or the minister that we on these benches do not feel as vehemently about the bills basic proposals as the noble lord lord graham of edmonton nevertheless we have some misgivings about parts of the bill <e> <s> i shall be interested to hear the ministers reactions to those misgivings <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill before us appears to be simple but it is deceptively complex <e> <s> i compliment the minister for outlining some of its aspects and difficulties <e> <s> i wish to address some of the concerns felt by members on these benches <e> <s> in many respects they reflect those outlined by the noble lord lord williams of elvel but i do not wish to articulate any suspicion about the relationship between the government and the brewers <e> <s> that would be somewhat over-egging the pudding <e> <s> i look forward to hearing the remarks of the noble lord lord kimball <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble lord lord st john of bletso for giving us the opportunity to discuss not just the question on the order paper but some of the implications of that question <e> <s> he put most eloquently and clearly the situation as he has seen it over the past three months in south africa <e> <s> how lucky we are to have someone who was in the country on nd february who heard the speech of president de klerk and witnessed the release of mr mandela <e> <s> many of the figures he gave and much of the picture of south africa that he painted is helpful and interesting to anyone who takes an interest in developments in south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully agree with the noble lord lord monson but i did not wish to bring the french into the argument at this stage <e> <s> that would complicate matters enormously <e>", "<cs> i wish to support absolutely what has been said by the noble lord lord lucas who moved the amendment and by his noble friend lord jenkin of roding <e> <s> i also wish to thank the noble and learned lord and his honourable friend in another place for receiving us in the scottish office <e> <s> on that occasion i put forward views on behalf of voluntary agencies throughout the united kingdom <e> <s> i stress that fact because the experience of those who are involved with the problem of under-age drinking is that there is no great difference as regards the sources of drink for under-age purchasers <e> <s> the noble lord lord jenkin is absolutely right <e> <s> among the more affluent classes if i may put it that way the home is the most common source of drink for young people <e>", "<cs> my lords we thank the noble lord lord mcintosh for introducing the debate <e> <s> however i believe that he does noble lords on benches other than the labour benches something of an injustice <e> <s> we on these benches are deeply involved with the state of the inner cities and their future <e> <s> it is a pity that i am the only person to speak on behalf of these benches and

field and a great concern for the area on which he will speak <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not wish to follow with further chastisement to the noble lord along the lines given by the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e>", "<cs> we have considerable sympathy with the reasons for the amendments as put forward by the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e> <s> no doubt there is a danger of the scenario that he described and a number of tenants may be put under notice in the interim period <e> <s> nevertheless the new tenants will immediately fall within the act <e> <s> we are faced with choosing the lesser of two evils that of retrospective legislation and the threat of notice hanging over a number of tenants before the end of the three-year tenancy <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i speak to amendment no <e> <s> g which is specifically concerned with <e>", "<cs> i am perfectly happy to be entirely separated from everyone <e> <s> in those circumstances perhaps i may proceed with my amendment <e> <s> it concerns designated funding or specific grants for those dependent on drugs and alcohol <e> <s> the aim of the amendment is to amplify and add to what is already in the bill <e> <s> when we debated the white paper and on second reading the minister was at pains i agree with her to point out that the problems of drug addicts and alcoholics are mentioned in the bill <e> <s> that is a welcome step <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness lady masham <e> <s> i do not share the faith expressed by the minister either <e> <s> i only hope that in a rather typically british way we are not just waiting for a disaster to occur in much the same way as happened in the prisons <e> <s> i hope that we do not find that there is an enormous explosion of crack or some other substance and that we have to take very fast action at extraordinary cost in order to deal with it <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord rea for giving us the opportunity this evening to discuss the problems of work population growth illiteracy and poverty <e> <s> i had not intended to speak in this debate as i thought that my noble friend lady robson was going to speak from her long and deep knowledge of world population problems <e> <s> my noble friend kindly gave me notes to help me in my speech tonight <e> <s> i hope she will not be of fended if i refer only briefly to the content of those notes <e> <s> i suppose it is a guage of what happens to one after six years in your lordships house it is six years to the day that i made my maiden speech on the closely related subject of aid to the third world that i come back to where i began and speak with some enthusiasm about this topic but also with sadness that so little has happened during those six years to encourage us <e> <s> i refer particularly to those countries in east and central africa of which i have some experience <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the governments view about the danger of rabies in this country <e> <s> should rabies unfortunately arrive on these shores what effect would that have on their views of dog registration <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to address a subject which is hardly touched on by the bill and which having heard a great many of the speeches in your lordships house i do not believe has been the subject of any speech today <e> <s> that is the amount of feature film which is shown on television and the growth of the demand for feature film <e> <s> by feature film i mean expressly films which are stories told in visual terms made initially for exhibition in cinemas and which ultimately find their way on to our television screens <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> however does he agree with me that this has been a conspicuously successful example of public funding of a body which has made itself self-sufficient over the years <e> <s> does it not seem rather strange that that body should have been singled out for the treatment that it received from the department particularly in view of the strong social role that it plays in counselling and giving advice to an increasingly threatened minority group <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister to give me a straight answer no pun is intended <e> <s> in the exchanges between the department the local authority and the gay centre the department mentioned the word unacceptable with regard to the level of subsidy as it was described <e> <s> what was unacceptable the level of subsidy or the use of the building <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the directions and guidance which are sent to local authorities will be excellent and complete <e> <s> my anxiety and that of those who are involved in such treatment is about the speed with which the local authorities will react <e> <s> local authorities may be aware of the problems but generally their record is not encouraging <e> <s> we believe that unless a similar amendment is included in the bill sufferers will find themselves without treatment <e> <s> during previous stages of the bill it was said that certain local authorities had not yet fully grasped its implications or the governments intentions <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount confirm that at the moment those who re-offend during a -year period after being convicted of driving while two and a half times over the limit have to present themselves to a doctor before they can reapply for a licence <e> <s> if that is the <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches accept the contents of the bill <e> <s> it is a commendable bill and as the noble lord lord lucas said it rounds off a discussion which we had during the passage of the licensing bill <e> <s> i endorse everything that has been said and i congratulate the noble viscount lord montgomery of alamein on explaining the contents of the bill to us so clearly <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness was kind enough to mention me by name together with other noble lords who spoke during the course of the bill on amendments relating to alcohol and drugs <e> <s> without wishing to detract in any way from the sentiments that have been expressed by my noble friend lady seear and other noble lords i wish to confine my remarks to the concession that the government have made <e> <s> it is extremely welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords we
