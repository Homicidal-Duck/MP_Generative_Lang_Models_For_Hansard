["<cs> my lords i wish to declare an interest in the forestry industry since i am an owner of lowland forestry land in england and of a sawmill that goes with it <e> <s> i beg to congratulate my noble friend lord dulverton and the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe upon instituting the debate and above all upon its timing <e> <s> i suppose that we should also congratulate the authorities or the usual channels in your lordships house for selecting this day <e> <s> with the cas reading report issued only recently though with sufficient a time margin to have created <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to your lordships for not being present when the noble earl made his opening speech on this forestry debate <e> <s> but i have a point which may not have been brought up before <e> <s> your lordships will remember that a chandelier fell from the ceiling of our house very narrowly missing the noble lord lord shinwell <e> <s> the authorities of your lordships house and the palace of westminster put up and it was done in very quick time a timber false ceiling <e> <s> i wonder whether that timber is home produced or foreign <e> <s> i also wonder whether the noble earl could make some investigations and perhaps tell your lordships at a later stage <e> <s> i would guess that in this bill the wood would be called either high-quality shuttering or <e>", "<cs> as a member of your lordships house and one coming from gloucestershire albeit on the other side of the severn may i emphasise what my noble friend lord dulverton has said about the enormous amount of interest that has been taken in this amendment <e> <s> local councils which have never to my knowledge had any interest at all in forestry let alone in the forest of dean except those which are actually in it or which consist of the forest of dean have all asked us please to see that the forest of dean is excluded <e> <s> i cannot understand why as the noble lord lord mcnair has said it cannot be excluded from the bill <e> <s> it will not affect the bill it will not affect forestry in the slightest degree <e> <s> i should be very much in favour as my noble friend lord dormer and my noble friend lord dulverton have said of some provision for all these very special forestry areas which the forestry commission are administering <e>", "<cs> i would ask the noble earl to bear in mind what the noble baroness lady jeger has said in particular in conjunction with the forest of dean <e> <s> the most interesting debate that we had earlier on the forest of dean arose entirely from land integration carried out by the forestry commission <e> <s> i rather suspect that there was absolutely no co-operation in the forest of dean i think that the noble baroness and her many friends there will bear me out and therefore the forestry commission had to take very special measures in order to get the co-operation of the people <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe say whether the proposed trade union member would have to be a member of the forestry commissions staff or could he be a member of any department of the forestry industry <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend lord trefgarne whether he would be satisfied with these penalties under clause <e> <s> i see there is no mention other than two years imprisonment <e> <s> under clause for improper use the penalty is or imprisonment or both <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend is satisfied and if noble lords lord young and lord orr-ewing in particular are satisfied with the cash penalties which are not specified <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend would give further thought to that at another stage <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not also be true to say from the point of view of the national trust for england and wales that if they did not like the would-be purchaser of the forestry commission lease they could refuse it to him <e> <s> how it would work in scotland is very different <e> <s> the feu question is probably outside the terms of the bill <e> <s> however in england and in wales so far as the national trust and any private person are concerned they would be secure provided that forestry was going to be carried on by the purchaser <e> <s> would that be true <e>", "<cs> my lords i too join in congratulating my noble friend lord hylton on initiating this debate <e> <s> i congratulate him and his colleagues for producing the report more copies of which i hope are available in the library <e> <s> i must declare a small interest being the chairman of a small housing association a charitable organisation of the sort my noble friend mentions in the report <e> <s> through the good offices of the housing corporation this tiny association now houses eight <e>", "<cs> my lords i too want to congratulate the noble lord lord st john of bletsoe on his excellent maiden speech and to join with all the others who have congratulated him in hoping that we shall hear from him again many times when he is able to address us <e> <s> your lordships will well remember or some of your lordships will well remember others perhaps not quite so well the nerves that take hold of one on making a maiden speech in your lordships house and that is the first trouble to get <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt my noble friend here because so many of your lordships think that the expenditure is a vital point <e> <s> is it not right that the per cent <e> <s> specific grant if it is spent is also considered as a part of over-expenditure <e> <s> i do not believe that it is separate from county councils budgets that are allowable for grants and expenditure <e> <s> am i not right that it is not over and above what they must budget for <e>", "<cs> my lords i must declare an interest or perhaps it should be a non-interest in that i am the master of a very small almshouse charitable association which is of course exempt from the provisions of the bill <e> <s> however i can perfectly well see the enormous damage that would have been done to this tiny charitable association which happens to be the most ancient of the housing associations in this country since it goes right back to the days before <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord who is to reply what would be the effect of the amendment which the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley wanted to put forward on the severn-trent bill <e> <s> we were told by him it is not everybody who reads <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the noble lord opposite would he not think that it is the ordinary steel worker in bethlehem <e> <s> in the united states who rightly or wrongly i do not know considers that subsidised common market special steel is imported into his country <e> <s> i assure the noble lord opposite and i should like to make it clear to the noble baroness that very many people in the agricultural industry here would consider that own resource subsidies from common market countries would be most unfair to our agricultural industry which is reasonably efficient i hope i think if no own resources are put in by the taxpayer of this country <e> <s> i think that the situation would be exactly the same for the steel worker in the united states and the agricultural worker or the farmer in this country if own resource subsidies apply in the common market without some kind of shall i say protection not a very good word or some kind of arrangement to see that subsidised products do not come in unfairly <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding the amendment which the noble lord has moved would it not be correct that he wants people trained to a certain standard to make glasses which contain specific lenses whereas these magnifying glasses that we are hearing about will do no damage <e> <s> i understand with respect to the noble lord opposite that wrongly fitted eye glasses can do considerable damage if it is the wrong type of lens for the eye <e> <s> is that the point of the noble lords <e>", "<cs> mr lords may i <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether this measure which i imagine every law-abiding citizen in this country would welcome will allow the banning of gatherings which it may be guessed will damage either public or private property <e> <s> from what the noble lord lord wigoder said numbers can be reduced <e> <s> if the noble lord cannot answer on that matter i wonder whether it could be considered at another stage or at another time so that this measure can be made to cover gatherings which are likely to damage either public or private property <e> <s> trafalgar square was mentioned by the noble lord opposite <e> <s> i can think of many other places in connection with the public point of view but i am thinking in particular of private property <e> <s> i do not expect an answer now <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join noble lords on all sides of the house in congratulating the noble duke the duke of somerset on his splendid maiden speech <e> <s> all branches of the forestry industry and your lordships house on many subjects other than forestry will welcome what he has said today and look forward to what he has to say in the future <e>", "<cs> i did not quite understand that from my noble friend <e> <s> however minesweepers were required to be made from this oak coppice <e> <s> in the second world war mosquito aeroplanes and gliders were made from beech <e> <s> i have no doubt that there will be still more uses for timber mixed with chemicals of one sort or another which will have a strategic requirement in the end <e> <s> timber is a marketable product <e> <s> according to all the reports from europe and the united states it will be a softwood that is needed for construction for paper and for chemicals <e>", "<cs> does not the amendment of the noble earl deal only with shotguns and not with having this relevant certificate thereof <e> <s> that is a serious offence but it is not quite as serious as the kind of offence which the noble lord lord mishcon has described with regard to firearms <e> <s> firearms are not connected with this amendment <e> <s> would that be correct <e>", "<cs> my lords we have a thinnish house and it is a fairly late hour <e> <s> as one totally on the other side to the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby i wish to congratulate him on bringing up this very difficult interesting and delicate subject tonight <e> <s> the only reason that i am speaking is that along with the noble earl who will be replying i have had some small experience of this difficult problem in the home office <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl and the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby allow me to speak again <e> <s> the noble lord who is sitting on <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept what the noble lord has been so kind as to say <e>", "<cs> correct <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor and also the noble lord lord adrian whether the principles of this amendment will apply also to other colleges such as technical colleges and other higher educational establishments as well as to universities <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask my noble friend lord selkirk and my noble friend behind me what they mean by a secure house <e> <s> does it mean a house that has a good front door with a lock <e> <s> does it mean a house in which the chimney will not fall in or is it what some of us down here would understand as a secure house <e> <s> if we are to have clarification in the scottish bill and the english bill perhaps my noble friend ought to say exactly what he means by a secure house <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the remarks made by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> many of us in this chamber have seen the tragic circumstances of the so-called carers <e> <s> it may be that such people have been in the same place for many years <e> <s> the house may have to be sold and they may well have nowhere to go <e> <s> i do not know whether the wording of the proposed new clause is exactly correct but if the noble lord could achieve something through his right honourable friend i believe that it would encourage many other people to take on the very onerous job of caring for elderly relatives great friends or even previous employers <e> <s> i hope that he can find some reason for supporting this new clause <e>", "<cs> i must declare an interest as one undergoing a course on chiropractic <e> <s> i hope that nothing in the bill will prevent future practitioners of this branch of medicine being attracted to it <e> <s> the same applies to osteopathy which is another valuable branch of medicine <e> <s> i hope that the minister will consider the amendment most carefully to ensure that the bill does not disadvantage future chiropractors i think that is the right way to describe them or osteopaths <e> <s> i support the noble earl <e>", "<cs> i declare an interest as a trustee of a small charity which is able to give grants for exactly the purposes described by the noble lord who has just spoken <e> <s> i am surprised by the amount of equipment and the cost of equipment which boys and girls require <e> <s> it is regrettable that the charity has little money but it is able to help <e>", "<cs> will the noble earl extend his amendment and if not what will my noble friend who is to reply say about the position of a student who is injured in a genuine sport or game at university and who may be out of action for five or six months or even a year <e> <s> would that situation apply to the noble earls amendment <e> <s> if so i shall be very interested to hear what the noble earl has to say in reply because such incidents happen <e>"]
