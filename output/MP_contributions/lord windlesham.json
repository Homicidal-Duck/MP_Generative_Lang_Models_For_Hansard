["<cs> my lords as the mover of the bill has indicated i intervene in the debate in my capacity as a trustee of the british museum <e> <s> i do so with some hesitation because sitting next to me on this bench is the former chairman of the trustees lord eccles who had a far longer association with the british museum than i have had the good fortune to have <e> <s> the trustees have considered this bill and i have been asked to speak today on their behalf <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady birk has just remarked the british museum declined to support a previous private members bill also sponsored by the noble lord lord abinger largely because it abolished the concept of treasure trove and made no reference to the system of rewards which in our view is essential to prevent the concealment of finds <e> <s> it also seemed unlikely that the role of the coroner in establishing the facts of a find would survive had that bill become law <e>", "<cs> i put my name to this amendment and to the sequence of amendments from no <e> <s> to no <e> <s> on the marshalled list with the exception of amendment no <e> <s> as they represent the result of discussion between the mover of the bill and his advisers and the appropriate authorities at the british museum <e> <s> as i said in the debate on second reading i am a trustee of the british museum and have expressed the views of the trustees and senior staff on this measure <e> <s> i am able to inform the committee that this series of amendments with the exception of no <e> <s> which emanates from the noble lord lord digby has the support of the museum <e>", "<cs> this bill has already received considerable legal scrutiny <e> <s> the noble lord who has introduced the bill has been advised by draftsmen with legal experience and the british museums legal adviser has also considered both the drafting of the bill and the amendments <e> <s> i agree with the noble baroness lady white that it would be helpful and desirable if the government draftsman could run his eye over it <e> <s> it is not for me as a layman to say whether or not it is practicable for the words treasure trove to be defined in this bill <e> <s> perhaps the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones would be prepared to comment <e> <s> i myself would need some persuading <e> <s> i know that in the field of charity law of which i have had some experience many people start by thinking it would be a good idea to define what is meant by charity but end up by concluding that it is impossible to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords as the sponsor of the bill may i say that i fully endorse the recommendation that has been made by the leader of the house as to how peers who are members of lloyds should conduct themselves on this bill <e> <s> when the bill is debated on second reading next week i shall be advising those peers who support the bill to accept the guidance which has been given today by the leader of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> i should explain at the outset that this is a private bill not to be confused with the more usual private members bills <e> <s> unlike private members bills which are public bills although introduced by private members and not by the government private bills are promoted by individuals outside parliament by statutory or private corporate bodies or local authorities with the purpose of obtaining particular powers or benefits beyond those provided by the general law of the land <e> <s> thus a private bill affects only a particular category of people in this case the members of what is described as the community of lloyds or sometimes they may affect a particular place but never the public as a whole <e> <s> it is an important distinction and i make it at the start of our proceedings so we may have it in mind throughout what promises to be a lengthy debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has made himself clear and his question may help to clarify any doubts that may be in the minds of other noble lords <e> <s> my advice to those who support the measure is not to divide the house <e> <s> i do not believe it would be in the interest of the house to have a division on either of the two instructions <e> <s> i have had some exchanges with the noble lord lord wigoder and he knows my view <e> <s> nevertheless i counsel against calling a division against either of the instructions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure it would be the wish of the whole house that i should thank the noble earl who is acting as chairman of committees for the advice he has given on the procedure to be followed should the bill receive a second reading <e> <s> i made rather a long speech in introducing the bill and i ought to make up for it by being extremely brief now <e> <s> but i do not want to deprive myself of the opportunity to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord strathalmond on his eloquent and well-informed maiden speech <e>", "<cs> finally my lords i should record my thanks to both front benches for their support for the bill robust support that is not too strong a word <e> <s> the department of trade for which the lord advocate has been speaking has kept in close touch with the proceedings on the bill <e> <s> the minister has stressed the importance that both the government and the department of trade officials attach to effective self-regulation by lloyds <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord lord mackay of clashfern said in the view of the government which is shared by many noble lords on this side of the house it is preferable that this form of control should continue rather than to proceed by way of general legislation which would be the only alternative <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who worked closely with the noble lord lord carrington both in government and in opposition i should like from this bench to endorse everything that has been said in tribute <e> <s> his resignation is highly regrettable on personal grounds <e> <s> the noble lord has been i think many people would agree one of the best foreign secretaries of recent years irrespective of party nevertheless his resignation is worthy and indeed characteristic of the man we know and respect <e> <s> i should like to leave this thought with your lordships today as we react to the sudden news of lord carringtons resignation that it is by acts of selflessness of this sort that the british parliamentary system confused though it often is maintains its honour <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e> <s> it is more than three months since the second reading of the lloyds bill which took place on st april <e> <s> after a full debate the house gave the bill a second reading and committed it to a select committee as is the normal practice with an opposed private bill <e> <s> two instructions were agreed the first relating to the effect on the lloyds community and on the insuring public of the compulsory divestment by lloyds brokers of their interests in managing agencies and <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a lengthy debate on third reading this afternoon but it has been worth every minute to have heard a notable series of such well-informed speeches <e> <s> i do not think there is any new matter that has been raised which calls for a reply from me <e> <s> the degree of like-mindedness which has been demonstrated has been remarkable <e> <s> it is worth commenting that that is as it should be at the end of the long-drawn-out passage of a bill through parliament <e> <s> after all it is the purpose of parliament is it not <e> <s> to mediate between and to reconcile conflicting interests which may be affected by legislation <e> <s> as we have seen the two houses have both acted according to their distinctive procedures <e> <s> they have also reacted to each other particularly on the issue of divestment and now near the end of the road we are close to a consensus of view <e>", "<cs> my lords my lack of enthusiasm for this bill has been mitigated only by the fact that it has given us the opportunity to hear the maiden speech of the noble lord lord trend <e> <s> in his speech he displayed those qualities of wisdom and experience which have been so conspicuous to those who have worked with him at various times in his distinguished public career <e> <s> i like the noble lord lord adrian share the privilege of serving under lord trends chairmanship as a trustee of the british museum <e> <s> it is for that reason that i intervene quite briefly in the debate this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to follow the noble lord lord soper <e> <s> he speaks with a length of experience of offenders which very few people in this house can rival <e> <s> i should like to echo what he said in tribute to my noble friend lord kitchener on his maiden speech <e> <s> the noble earl is the bearer of a famous name <e> <s> he spoke today with a kind of special knowledge different from that of his illustrious predecessor and he spoke with eloquence <e> <s> we look forward to hearing him again in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i start with a declaration of non-interest in that i am no longer active in television although i was for many years including at the time that the original motion which has been brought before us again by my noble friend lord soames today was debated in june <e> <s> i voted for that motion years ago and i shall vote for this motion tonight if the house divides <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the noble earls initiative in putting down his unstarred question for debate this evening <e> <s> there may not be at this hour many people in the chamber but there is no doubt that a debate of this kind in your lordships house does have the effect he is seeking in supporting and encouraging the very important work that is taking place in the penal system or in the hospitals <e> <s> i should also like to thank him for his generous reference to me at the start of his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a particular pleasure for me to follow the noble lord lord bancroft since i like other noble lords who have spoken in this debate for a time had ministerial responsibility for the day-to-day work of the civil service department <e> <s> when i was there the noble lord lord bancroft was second permanent secretary <e> <s> he was my mentor and closest official colleague and i learnt much from him <e>", "<cs> my point if the noble lord had followed me closely was the opposite <e> <s> the numbers applying are extremely large <e> <s> it is the number of applicants who are being selected which falls short of the total number of vacancies in certain grades <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a remarkable debate encompassing both the morality <e>", "<cs> my lords we have just listened to a notable maiden speech no less i may say than we had anticipated in view of the high reputation which preceded the noble lord lord irvine of lairg before he came to this house <e> <s> as a leading counsel he speaks with knowledge of the law and of the courts too in which he sits as a recorder <e> <s> some noble and learned lords who have already spoken have known the noble lord as an advocate <e> <s> now in this wider assembly we share that experience <e> <s> we admire his eloquence and on this side of the house we have had a foretaste of his quality as an adversary <e> <s> we all greatly look forward to hearing him again in the future <e>", "<cs> north peckham <e> <s> i hope noble lords will not think i have given too rosy a picture of what is still a colossal social and economic problem which diminishes the standard of life and the opportunities for very many of our fellow citizens <e> <s> i do not underestimate the magnitude of the task or the scale of what remains to be done in the inner cities <e> <s> but in opening this debate i wanted to strike a positive note describing something of what has already been accomplished and how much there is still to do <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a long thoughtful well-informed and largely constructive debate on a matter that we all accept is of profound public significance <e> <s> i should like to thank all noble lords who have taken part especially those who have stayed until the final stages <e>", "<cs> i feel the sense of the committee is that we are reaching the end of this long and fine debate on a matter of fundamental principle <e> <s> i support the new clause <e> <s> it is the third version that has been put before us by the government <e> <s> i think it is the strongest and i believe that it will lead to more consistency in sentencing which is in the interests of justice <e>", "<cs> although i wish to speak principally on amendment no <e> <s> i make one preliminary observation on the subject matter of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this is to bring to the committees attention a recent change in practice as a result of the <e>", "<cs> i support the proposal that this group of young offenders who have been convicted of serious offences and sentenced under section of the children and young persons act should be considered by the parole system review which is now taking place <e> <s> the position in which these young people are placed is markedly less favourable than other convicted offenders this was not brought out in the speech of the noble lord moving these <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington has said i spoke at committee stage in support of the proposal that life imprisonment should become the maximum rather than the mandatory sentence for murder <e> <s> i therefore support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to echo what the noble and learned lord lord denning has just said as to how we should address ourselves to this subject <e> <s> we need to accept the public must be reassured that persons who are convicted of murder the gravest crime in the criminal calendar are properly punished and are not returned to society too soon <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to come to that when i describe the current procedures including the private advice given by the sentencing judge to the home secretary <e> <s> there has been a long-standing facility as noble and learned lords on the cross-benches who have tried murder cases will be aware that at the conclusion of a murder trial the judge can write to the home secretary <e> <s> that facility has become formalised in order to set a date when the case of a life sentence prisoner can first be considered for release on licence <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble and learned lord will forgive me if i ask whether the situation has not been transformed since those earlier debates by the newly introduced practice in which the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord before he sits down if indeed he was about to <e>", "<cs> my lords when either the noble lord on the woolsack replies to the debate or one of the noble lords on the opposition front bench with experience of the scottish system speaks perhaps they could tell us if the appeal in scotland is one way or two way <e>", "<cs> my lords although the bill does not deal with life imprisonment it is significant that at each stage we have debated new clauses which bear upon it <e> <s> amendments in committee on report and now on third reading have aimed to make life imprisonment the maximum sentence rather than the mandatory penalty for murder and either to eliminate the power of the court to recommend a minimum period which should elapse before the home secretary releases a convicted life-sentence prisoner or if that power is retained to make it subject to appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords as my name has been mentioned perhaps i may add my voice in support of the motion <e> <s> the orders of reference reflect accurately the concerns which were expressed during the debates on the criminal justice bill <e> <s> i doubt whether i am alone in finding encouragement that the law on murder in scotland and the administration of sentences of life imprisonment are to be included in the terms of reference of the select committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it will be appreciated that this is not an easy debate for me speaking from these benches as i do <e> <s> however i have been fortified by the thought that neither is it likely to prove an easy assignment for my noble friend the minister who is to reply at the end of the debate <e> <s> i regret that the report by mr rampton and myself has become something of a political football <e> <s> originally i had hoped to maintain the neutrality that is expected of a referee <e> <s> that is why i said very little at the time of the publication of the report although i have since been drawn into the controversy by the attacks made on my independence and integrity <e>", "<cs> my lords i too served as a member of the select committee under the admirable chairmanship of the noble lord lord nathan <e> <s> i share the embarrassment of others in having missed our chairmans opening speech for which i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords that is why in assisting the home office to consider the implications of our proposals a meeting of the kind i have proposed would be constructive <e>", "<cs> my lords we have listened to some powerful speeches not least the most recent speech made by the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> he will hear no philosophy and no religion from me <e> <s> i will do no more than add my voice to what has been said about the relationship between the two houses of parliament were this bill to be rejected on second reading <e> <s> that issue may still be in the back of the minds of some noble lords who have reservations about this bill and it is worth returning to and providing some further details <e>", "<cs> my lords this may be an indication of the accuracy of the noble lords other observations <e> <s> i am aged <e>"]
