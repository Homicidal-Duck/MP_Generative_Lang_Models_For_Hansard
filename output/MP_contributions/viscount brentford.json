["<cs> sat first in parliament after the death of his father <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to my feet with a lot of fear and trepidation first because it is the first time that i have risen to speak in your lordships house but also because of the enormous size of the subject which we are discussing and the noble viscount lord buckmaster in opening this debate put the figure at million which is a very large <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord parry for introducing this motion today <e> <s> i feel rather like a minnow following a whale if i may say so speaking immediately after my noble friend lord forte who has made an enormous contribution to the tourist industry <e> <s> my own contribution is absolutely minute in that we open our <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome the bill but i am very much looking forward as are nearly all other speakers in the debate to my noble friend explaining why the government have not accepted the recommendation of the warnock committee on making all surrogacy arrangements illegal contracts and therefore unenforceable in the courts <e>", "<cs> i hope that the government will bring forward a new bill as soon as possible <e> <s> we have been considering this admirable report for nearly a year and that to me seems to be a reasonable time <e> <s> i hope that the government will not wait until public opinion veers too strongly one way or the other because i am sure that there are strongly held feelings on all sides and also entrenched interests relating to the matters that we have been discussing on clause <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment for the reasons stated by my noble friend lord swinfen <e> <s> the only problem i see is that he will need to make a diary note for years time to bring forward a bill to update the figure unless at third reading the amendment is varied to allow a figure to be laid before your lordships house by order <e> <s> i warmly support the amendment <e> <s> it seems to me to bring realism into this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the governments initiative in bringing forward the bill <e> <s> i am sure that the law on this issue needs to be tidied up <e> <s> the only way to do it whatever system is being introduced is by a government bill and not any longer by a private members bill <e> <s> i find the governments solution very attractive i might also say very seductive <e> <s> it is tidy and it is easy <e> <s> i personally love things to be tidy and to be easy <e> <s> unfortunately as your lordships know as well as i do the easy course is very often not the right one <e>", "<cs> i am encouraged by my noble friend saying that he would very much like to see a list along these lines if it could be produced and i shall take some heart from that <e> <s> i have not demurred over the difficulties of a list of this kind <e> <s> my point is that the unfairness to which the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale referred between one shop and another is far less than the unfairness of total and complete deregulation which is caused to those who would suffer from it <e>", "<cs> very briefly i should like to make one point <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham said in his opening remarks that he accepted that modifications should be made to the wording of the amendment if the principle was accepted and i am sure that is what we are talking about <e> <s> there is one difficulty about this bill which was touched on by the noble and learned lord lord denning but which has not really come out in the debate this afternoon <e> <s> that <e>", "<cs> i shall be brief <e> <s> i have every sympathy with the fear of my noble friend lord norrie about going to the receiver <e> <s> i am also very much afraid that if the bill is passed unamended a large number of other traders will have to go to the receiver <e> <s> therefore this is a mutual fear problem <e>", "<cs> i briefly make a couple of points in support of the amendment of my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> anomalies are being flung around in both directions so far as i can see <e> <s> it seems to me that the biggest anomaly in this part of the bill is that arising from whether one person is employed a week or two earlier than another <e> <s> what is a week or two in a situation which may arise five or years hence <e> <s> i believe that that anomaly should be ruled out <e> <s> the amendment will help to prepare the way for other amendments which are to come which will tidy up the first schedule <e> <s> i therefore support this amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord <e> <s> this amendment does not affect the principle of the bill <e> <s> it bears saying again that this amendment is purely to remove an anomaly from the bill <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend the minister will look sympathetically at it <e>", "<cs> i should also like to make the point as concerning anomalies and particularly in respect of what the noble and learned lord lord simon said earlier that we are only considering shopworkers and not others in the course of this bill <e> <s> further i should like to point out that to give <e>", "<cs> it is in the bill <e> <s> it seems to me that there is no condition in an employment contract for a new employee in a job in retailing to work on sundays and if this bill is passed that condition will be written into the employment contract because the employer will be able to force the man or woman to work on sundays <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend the minister <e> <s> i agree with what he says and i am quite content to rely on his undertaking <e> <s> my name was below that of my noble friend lord renton on his amendment <e> <s> there were however quite a number of points that i made which had not previously been made in this debate <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will take those into account in considering the protection of shopworkers <e>", "<cs> my lords it strikes me that this amendment is very much in the same spirit as the amendment for a two-year moratorium which has been proposed by my noble friend the minister <e> <s> he has referred to the turbulence that there will be when a bill promoting total deregulation comes into force <e> <s> i would envisage if a period like this was agreed to by your lordships that this would again be a matter that would be relevant only for a short number of years while this period of turbulence existed <e> <s> i am therefore very struck by the arguments of my noble friend lord campbell of alloway on the reasonableness of this <e> <s> the amendment seems to be in the very spirit which my noble friend the minister has already set out <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that there is here an anomaly between the new shopworker <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make one point <e> <s> the crucial issue for me in the bill is whether or not it is right to have total deregulation <e> <s> this is the vital issue <e> <s> there is probably one person in four or one in six according to whichever poll you take throughout the country who really wants the bill <e> <s> as already stressed many letters have been written to members of another place on the issue <e> <s> it worries me that a lot of conservative votes are being lost by reason of the bill being pushed through <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for introducing this debate at what seems to me to be an appropriate moment when this government have already taken steps to encourage charitable activities and when there are leaks true or not that they are intending to take further steps along that path <e> <s> it seems therefore a most appropriate moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble friend lord campbell of croy for initiating this debate on tourism particularly at this juncture in world affairs and in the light of what is going on outside <e> <s> perhaps i should say that while i would gladly answer his comments i propose to pass on what he said about the late and by many people unlamented shops bill at this point <e>", "<cs> my lords the question before us as i understand it is how we persuade the south african government to dismantle apartheid and give civil and political rights to all the inhabitants of that great country <e> <s> i should like to refer first to some underlying and less obvious problems <e> <s> the first is the lack of education among blacks which i believe has been touched on but there is also the lack of housing and lack of equality of health care for blacks <e> <s> this has stifled desperately the maturing of black leaders and particularly the educated and moderate black leaders that that country so much needs <e>", "<cs> my lords let me briefly say that i warmly support amendment no <e> <s> moved by my noble friend the minister <e> <s> i believe that it gets to the root of the problem <e> <s> i am very attracted to the proposal made by my noble friend lord coleraine to meet the problem of the other category of people who have in good faith initiated their proceedings earlier <e> <s> i do not know whether there is any way of implementing that at this late stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe for introducing this motion <e> <s> this subject is being discussed in the media and throughout the nation at the present time and i believe that it is right that your lordships should also formally consider it <e>", "<cs> my lords returning to the question of figures on enforcement is my noble friend aware that the british hardware federation recently carried out a survey of diy shops on a sunday and found that no fewer than were open illegally <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the bill although i am intrigued by the fact that the planners of the programme decided that we should discuss prisons on bastille day <e> <s> i am not quite sure of the implication of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by congratulating my noble friends lord fairhaven and lord head on their maiden speeches <e> <s> i thought they both argued their cases very clearly and forcefully <e> <s> i hope we can look forward to hearing many more speeches from them in the days to come <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend for his support <e> <s> on the figures available i believe that the service is cost effective and that he will not regret this <e>", "<cs> in supporting the amendment i welcome the principle of the sunday sports law being updated in a form in which it is right <e> <s> the question before us is what that form should be <e> <s> i support sunday recreation good family recreation or other activity <e> <s> however i am not in favour of total deregulation of all sunday sporting activity <e>", "<cs> in supporting this amendment perhaps i may briefly endorse the remarks of both the noble lords lord graham and lord airedale with whom i agree <e> <s> different groups of people would be affected by sporting activities that go on all day on sundays <e> <s> i also endorse everything that has already been said about the family <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> bearing in mind what my noble friend lord manton has said this amendment puts into the bill what he says is its intention <e> <s> it seems to me that we should have in the bill what is intended <e> <s> i feel confident that my noble friend will support the amendment <e> <s> it is an important amendment that will clarify the position <e> <s> the whole nation will know what is going to happen <e> <s> nothing else can go beyond it unless parliament were so to direct <e> <s> i therefore feel that the amendment is a right and proper move to incorporate in the bill <e>", "<cs> while my noble friend is still on his feet i wish to ask him whether if he were to accept this amendment another amendment could be moved on report to alter the figure to a slightly higher one if that was thought appropriate on reflection <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all those who have supported this amendment <e> <s> i make the point to the noble lord lord wyatt that i have no irish blood in me and therefore i shall not take any personal umbrage at his conversation about brushing aside the irish experiment <e> <s> i feel upset however that he has not paid more attention to it <e> <s> i believe that what has been happening in ireland is a fact <e> <s> what the noble lord lord wyatt has said about what will happen here is hypothesis <e> <s> what has happened in ireland is fact <e> <s> they do not have problems in ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords in welcoming this bill i am intrigued by the fact that my grandfather was involved in the debate in another place on the bill <e> <s> however i have not checked <e>", "<cs> i hope too that the minister will resist the amendment for the reason specified <e> <s> clause no <e> <s> gives to the defendant quite sufficient defence <e> <s> i hope that this amendment will not be accepted <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may express one slight anxiety <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would certainly change the law by the omission of the word substantial and the law is intended by this bill to be continued in its present form as has been so ably declared by the noble and learned lord lord denning <e>", "<cs> as has been said many times in debates on this bill copyright is a question of balance between the different participants <e> <s> i believe that to remove any payment to the copyright owner for commercial research where the business be it small or great will be gaining financially is wrong <e> <s> the cost even to a small business will not be great <e> <s> however the benefit to the copyright owner perhaps many small authors would be quite substantial in proportion <e> <s> i therefore strongly oppose this amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps with one or two sentences i may support this amendment <e> <s> i prefer the amendment of the noble lord lord willis for two reasons <e> <s> first because it makes it mandatory upon the government to make an order and secondly because it is in line with the governments white paper on the subject <e> <s> i said before in a different context in the debate on this bill that i believe that the copyright owner and i am thinking particularly of music in this caseshould be able to do his work in an environment in which he knows he will be obtaining some reward <e> <s> illegal home taping should be made legal because it is bound to continue <e> <s> what is important is that the copyright owner should receive some benefit from a massive proliferation of his music <e>", "<cs> my lords following the noble lord lord willis perhaps i may speak to the amendment in my name amendment no <e> <s> which forms part of this group <e> <s> i ought to remind your lordships that i am a solicitor and that my firm acts for the music copyright reform group among others <e>", "<cs> in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> i should like to make it clear that all i am trying to do is to implement the governments intention which i fear is not the case with the bill as at present drawn <e> <s> the amendment seeks to clarify the meaning of a provision which purports to exclude from election those giving professional advice including solicitors <e> <s> the clause excludes from election those who provide the committee <e>", "<cs> if i may answer that question briefly the example given by lord wedderburn is of witnessing affidavits which would surely not be done at the meeting of the pec <e> <s> i should have thought that my wording probably covered what was basically in my mind <e>", "<cs> i wish to thank my noble friend for offering to reconsider this matter <e> <s> i hope that he will look at the meaning of the word incidental in the dictionary as well as studying the legal implications of this <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may express my appreciation to my noble friend for the amendment which certainly meets the point which i made at committee stage <e> <s> i am grateful <e> <s> however i should like to raise one small question which one or two people have raised with me <e> <s> to paraphrase the clause as amended which we are discussing it speaks of people who may attend and speak for the purpose of providing the committee with professional advice with respect to matters taken into account by the committee in carrying out its functions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his agreement to look at one point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am slightly surprised by what my noble friend has said in the light of my understanding of the berne convention <e> <s> the question may be raised again in another place at a later stage but in view of the present position i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the very full answer given by my noble friend <e> <s> i am glad that he can see the reasonable circumstances that can give rise to it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his explanation <e> <s> i remain concerned about the balance in the bill <e> <s> the minister has not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed by my noble friends reply <e> <s> he does not seem to have answered the point put by my noble friend lord montgomery about the psychological impact of the government permitting garages to sell alcohol <e> <s> as he said i believe that that is the most important point and that it undermines the governments whole case for discouraging drinking and driving <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to put in a word at this stage to express my support for my noble friends amendments <e> <s> i have some general comments to make on the points he raised although i am most grateful to him for the clarification which he has inserted in the amendments <e> <s> however as regards his diffidence i should like to point out that the justices will still retain their discretion if it falls within the law <e> <s> should there be any doubt in their minds it seems to me that they would have no problem in refusing a licence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his usual courtesy in explaining the matter and for having explained it to me beforehand <e> <s> i should like to point out that this issue does not relate solely to rural garages <e> <s> the justices have granted a licence to a third garage in a west wales town which indicates that it is also a town problem <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the detailed reply <e> <s> unfortunately my noble friend the minister misheard my opening sentence and an awful lot of what he said does not have any bearing on my amendment <e> <s> i said that the amendment inserted into the collective community charge a family charge as well as a hostels charge <e> <s> the two run neck and neck and do not overlap <e> <s> therefore what he said about trying to apply the hostels wording to my amendment does not really take effect <e>", "<cs> i admit that i drafted this amendment fairly late at night but i beg to differ from my noble friend <e> <s> for instance i expressly excluded from the amendments the unemployed to year-old about which my noble friend the minister spoke at great length <e> <s> i am not concerned about the specific wording of the amendment <e> <s> i should have liked to hear from the minister whether he was prepared to consider any aspect of this amendment in order to promote the family in what is essentially a very individualistic community charge <e> <s> i am very disappointed at his lack of comment along those lines <e> <s> nevertheless at this late hour naturally i withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that any of your lordships will be welcome to a consultation that i am holding here today week <e> <s> secondly is he aware that when i was in scotland last week i found in talking to many residents that they agreed with the auld committee that scotland is not on a par with england <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak in support of amendment no <e> <s> b to which i put my name <e> <s> as has been said the object is to provide a protection for authors and composers that is otherwise not available to them <e> <s> i was disappointed to hear my noble friend say earlier that he was not prepared to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in a strange position in that the minister has already expressed his views about this proposed amendment amendment no <e> <s> b to commons amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> bearing that in mind i should like to make a couple of observations about it <e> <s> my amendment refers to the distinction in the copyright act whereby it is not an infringement of copyright for a person to record for private purposes a sound or television broadcast but it is an infringement to record even for private purposes a copyright musical work which is included in a broadcast programme <e> <s> that distinction is important and i believe that it should be continued <e> <s> the provision has worked well for years <e> <s> however i appreciate that technology is very different now <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i regret that reply <e> <s> i feel that this is an important point but at this hour i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord hatch of lusby for instituting this debate <e> <s> i should like to make one comment on what he said about the withdrawal of the south african army from angola <e> <s> he gave various reasons <e> <s> i should <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am very grateful to my noble friend lady cox for introducing this subject which like other speakers i consider very important <e> <s> it is important for a number of reasons <e> <s> one is obviously the increasing number of elderly in the community <e> <s> i gather that it is expected that between the years and the number of elderly people over will increase from million to million which is another <e> <s> a large proportion of those people will doubtless fall within the ambit of this question namely the infirm elderly <e>", "<cs> my lords i too want to thank my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for introducing the debate <e> <s> this is an excellent opportunity for your lordships to think afresh about this important subject on which there are of course strong feelings held by many people in many corners of the house <e> <s> i speak as chairman of keep sunday special which has produced the rest proposals as a flexible consultative document which is by no means hidebound but is open to change if improvements can be seen in it <e> <s> i shall mention some of those later on <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that if the government brought forward a bill based on the rest proposals which in a recent debate the majority of members of your lordships house appeared to support the anxiety expressed by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter about enforcement could be eased <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord ross of newport for introducing this debate today <e> <s> it is an important subject because it reveals an increasing problem in <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that encouraging reply <e> <s> will he be answering the report of the association of chief police officers shortly <e> <s> can he tell the house when he is likely to reach a decision on whether or not to set up a central register <e> <s> finally is he aware of the tremendous distress which is caused largely because there is no central register to the parents of some young people who go missing every year <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to thank the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for introducing this debate so effectively this afternoon <e> <s> i certainly believe as i am sure all of us participating in this debate also believe that the subject of the family is a crucially important one at this present time <e> <s> at the outset i wish to make it clear that by family i include the whole range of any group of two or more people who are related to each other and living together <e> <s> i therefore include the one-parent family the nuclear family of two parents and one or more children and the extended family where there are perhaps grandparents or a grandparent living with the family as well <e> <s> by family i am intending to talk about the whole spectrum without any distinction <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition to the financial contribution being made for people released from institutions and those who are members of homeless families is my noble friend contemplating any provision for the single homeless of whom there are many around our streets <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank my noble friend lord home for instituting the debate <e> <s> it is with fear and trepidation that i intervene to speak among so many other far more experienced members of your lordships house <e> <s> i should also like to apologise to the house for the fact that i am shortly due to board an aeroplane and therefore shall not be able to stay to hear the end of the debate <e>", "<cs> i oppose the amendment because i believe that the government have the timing right in this respect <e> <s> i support the government <e> <s> from the information i have received from north of the border i understand the number of alcoholic disturbances is increasing <e> <s> in my view we should restrict the hours to those set out in the bill <e>", "<cs> i believe the noble lord is also speaking to amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> i must register the fact that because of the amendment that my noble friend lord selkirk and i have tabled i am against amendment no <e> <s> even if it is being treated separately for the reasons that i would prefer to discuss more fully when we come to amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> in view of those remarks and in consideration of the hour i beg leave to withdraw the amendment but i shall certainly reconsider it for a later stage <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment and back my noble friend lord selkirk who has given the general picture so clearly <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble and learned friend the lord advocate for his explanation <e> <s> at this hour of the night i will certainly look at what he has said and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment taking note of the advice of my noble and learned friend for the alteration <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for my noble friends remarks <e> <s> i am also grateful for the forthright comments made by the noble baroness lady turner <e> <s> i should like to make clear the fact that i fully endorse the principle of indexation <e> <s> i believe that pensions should undoubtedly be indexed <e> <s> in my view that is an excellent move forward <e> <s> however i am not sure that my noble friend has made clear why there should be this discrimination between the different categories of pension <e> <s> i shall consider what he said and in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the support from the noble lord lord hampton the right reverend prelate and my noble friend the minister <e> <s> i commend the bill to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i too understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> i too should like briefly to support the amendment <e> <s> i wish to emphasise one point <e> <s> the itv companies do not promote music in the same way that an ordinary music publishing company would <e> <s> in this way the composer again loses out very heavily <e> <s> i would have said much of what my noble friend lord colwyn said about the iba undertaking <e> <s> however i do not need to do so <e> <s> but i should like to urge the minister to agree to the amendment in principle <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for agreeing to insert a new provision <e> <s> i shall certainly look at it when his amendment comes forward <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>"]
