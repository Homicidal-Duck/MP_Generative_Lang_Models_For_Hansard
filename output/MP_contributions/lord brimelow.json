["<cs> my lords in the first place i should like to join in the noble viscounts tribute to our chairman the noble lord lord cobbold and to the special advisers and the staff who have had a difficult time in preparing this report <e> <s> the only point where i might dissent a little from the noble viscount and from the noble baroness lady seear is on the question of the common agricultural policy as it appears in professor holts annexe but i shall come to that later <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down and following what was said by the noble viscount may i ask whether he noticed in the <e>", "<cs> my lords when i fist became a member of your lordships house the noble lord lord ohagan was a member of the european parliament and i was deeply impressed by the quality of the contributions which he made to the debates on community affairs <e> <s> his introductory speech tonight again shows the advantages which a diligent member of both the european parliament and this house can make to these debates <e> <s> i join gladly in the tributes which have been paid to him hitherto <e>", "<cs> my lords looking to the future would the government be willing to use the machinery of the national whitley council as recommended by the armitage committee to set up an independent review body so that when a civil servant feels that he has been unreasonably refused permission he may appeal to a body distinct from and independent of his own department so that the department will not be in the invidious position of being judge in its own cause <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord rhodes that this report of which your lordships are invited to take note does not constitute an argument for leaving the community <e> <s> i should like to dwell on that for a moment <e> <s> it is one of a series of reports by the select committee on the european communities which draw attention to imperfections in the working of the community institutions and which suggest ways in which these imperfections might be remedied or at least alleviated <e>", "<cs> my lords i was grateful to the noble lord lord mottistone for the thoroughness of his introduction and to the noble earl lord ferrers for the fulness and frankness with which he told the house of the governments views <e> <s> i also thought that of the many points which sub-committee d covered in its discussions those which were not mentioned by lord mottistone were admirably covered by the noble lord lord mackie <e> <s> so i think that i can concentrate on a single point the importance which emerges from all the previous speeches of what happens later this month in the council of ministers and what happens in subsequent years in the council of ministers because as the report mentioned and as the noble lord lord mackie of benshie emphasised continuity over a number of years is very important <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord barnett for the pleasure he gave me by his maiden speech <e> <s> i look forward to many more such pleasures <e> <s> my own remarks this evening will be narrower in scope than those of previous contributions to the debate and entirely devoid of rhetoric <e> <s> the select committee is of the opinion that membership of the exchange rate mechanism is desirable and that early but not necessarily immediate membership is desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords if this debate has demonstrated anything it is our tendency to stray outside the strict terms of the subject under debate <e> <s> i think that we have touched on pretty well every aspect of the community of which we disapprove <e> <s> the terms of reference of the report as stated in the sub-title are <e>", "<cs> my lords i read with interest the article which the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne published in <e>", "<cs> my lords i was briefly a member of sub-committee d i was a member of that sub-committee when it was taking evidence on the problem of supply controls <e> <s> i had ceased to be a member of it by the time the report was drafted and i was not a member of that sub-committee when the two other reports we are debating tonight were prepared <e> <s> as someone who was not concerned in the preparation of any of these three reports perhaps i may express my respectful appreciation of their clarity and cogency and also of the clarity and cogency with which the noble lord lord plowden introduced them this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble baroness the minister has replied so fully and so courteously to the debate my duty is simply to thank those noble lords who have taken part in the debate and the other noble lords who have listened so patiently <e> <s> they have given us their support and we appreciate it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my duty and my pleasure to thank all those who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to the noble lord the minister for the care and courtesy with which he has answered so many points <e> <s> it would be quite wrong for me to deal with individual points which have been put forward by individual speakers but i should like to say that this draft regulation in its third form is not a charter for the cowboy parallel importer <e> <s> i hope that it will make possible personal imports by those people <e>"]
