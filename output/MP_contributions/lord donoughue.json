["<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by saying that it is a very great honour and a pleasure to join this house which is making such an outstanding contribution to the national debate on public affairs and to the scrutiny of legislation <e> <s> it is also a privilege <e>", "<cs> my lords we are today undoubtedly considering an issue of great importance and for that we must thank the select committee for producing such an informative concise and lively report <e> <s> it is already clear that it is the basis for an excellent debate which has been graced by an engaging maiden from the noble lord lord clitheroe and we look forward to more which was opened with remarkable power by the noble lord lord aldington and which among many good speeches to which i have listened this afternoon was perhaps most convincingly and authoritatively supported by the very impressive speech from the noble earl lord limerick <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by thanking my noble friend lord barnett for his excellent opening speech with virtually all of which i must say i agreed and where the analysis i think and hope has spared us some repetition this afternoon <e> <s> i should particularly like to support what he said about co-operation co-operation on oil production to secure stability in oil prices and co-operation on the exchange rates and there i must say that i now feel we really should very seriously consider joining the ems <e> <s> but i have to confess which since it may breach the official secrets act i can do with more courage now that the noble viscount has left the chamber that in downing street i then advised the prime minister not to join <e> <s> but i now feel that in changed circumstances the balance of advantages certainly points that way <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord explain why some victims of the atrocity at the grand hotel brighton have been paid and some have not <e> <s> if the explanation relates to an interpretation of the legal implications of certain persons having been arrested in relation to that crime does he not agree that the role of the compensation board is to compensate those who have been injured and has nothing to do with those who may have inflicted the injury <e> <s> in replying will the noble lord bear in mind that members on all sides of this house feel compassion for those who were injured consider that they should be compensated and hope that the compensation will not be delayed by what i think might be called bureaucratic legalism <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a valuable debate which enables us to stand apart from the extremes of party ideology and to look at some of the most important questions <e> <s> we are genuinely grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington for so fully setting out the issues at the opening of the debate <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord lord brabazon presented a reasonable welcome and unhectoring attempt at a shaky case <e> <s> the noble viscount lord chandos in particular introduced a city and an international dimension which was extremely valuable and of course we are grateful to the noble lord lord aldington for the independence of his expertise <e> <s> i should like to concentrate briefly on the privatisation side of this debate because the manufacturing question has been well explored and to look at two points the competitive aspect and the haste of the privatisation programme <e>", "<cs> i am puzzled because i have a feeling that i may in some ways be representing the th century middle classes which on reflection seem to me to have some virtues that are missing in the late th century middle classes but that is an historical argument <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will be relieved to hear that i shall not attempt to do what originally i had intended to cover the whole economic landscape <e> <s> that is partly because i feel the impending urgencies of lunch and partly because the subject was so brilliantly summarised by my noble friend lord barnett in his well-pitched swan-song <e> <s> if i may say so we shall miss my noble friend from his present place up front but we look forward to many contributions from him when he sits among us lesser mortals behind <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not detain the house much longer with particular responses especially having had the privilege of an allocation of minutes at the beginning and having overrun by two minutes <e> <s> i apologise for that and hope that your lordships will forgive me as something of a newcomer a sort of novice hurdler in this kind of race <e>", "<cs> my lords i also wish to thank the noble baroness lady cox for this debate and to apologise to the house in advance if it happens that i cannot be present at the end <e> <s> that will depend on the time <e> <s> i am sorry about that particularly because it is such an excellent debate and seems so well timed against the background of the audit commissions report so giving us the opportunity to discuss our local government problems in the context of some facts and figures and not simply based on the familiar rhetoric and ideology <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to join those who have thanked my noble friend lord cledwyn for opening this important discussion with such an impressive speech <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble viscount opposite who has brought to us his seniority and experience <e> <s> some of your lordships may feel that we have been round this course before and the basic problems inadequate training of management and labour inadequate research and development provision unhelpful monetary policies and a british culture still fundamentally hostile to industry have all been well investigated and well aired on earlier occasions in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by thanking the noble lord lord thorneycroft for opening a debate on a crucial subject at such an apposite time and also i am sure with the whole house by expressing appreciation of the three quite notable maiden speeches that we have enjoyed <e> <s> the noble lord lord richardson spoke with the accustomed clarity and authority that we all envy so that suddenly if i must admit momentarily i thought i understood the problem <e> <s> i recall in downing street some decade ago seeing him once smile <e> <s> that was after the imf settlement and i hope we shall have that pleasure and opportunity again after the next g meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall all wish to thank the noble lord lord jenkins for raising this very important issue one which i feel is most appropriate to the style and intellectual quality of this house <e> <s> i should like also to congratulate the noble lord lord colnbrook on his maiden speech <e> <s> we know that apart from having a distinguished record in northern ireland he was one of the great magicians of the whips office persuading many intelligent men to support what deep in their hearts they knew was wrong <e> <s> we know that with his renowned charm and fairness he will often do the same to us <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not discuss the programme airbase which seems to me too small a wart to be worthy of the expensive time of this house <e> <s> i should like to look at some more general principles at stake <e>", "<cs> my lords it is late and we have had an impressively lengthy debate <e> <s> rafts of noble lords never imagined doing so have stood through and survived the hostilities let alone the weather on the terraces of west ham millwall walsall and oldham athletic and now emerge with deep convictions and detailed briefs <e> <s> we can understand why because as has so often been stressed scenes of violence are deeply offensive to all sides <e> <s> there is no monopoly in being offended <e> <s> i think we all feel ashamed at the sight of drunken british louts parading a proud national flag through terrified towns of europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not weary noble lords by repeating arguments and facts already deployed by ranks of educational experts who in this house exceed all but lawyers in their number <e> <s> of course in modesty and concern for the national interest rather than self-interest they exceed even our legal representatives <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to congratulate the noble viscount lord trenchard on his elegant and constructive speech <e> <s> as a former colleague we tried together to face the inscrutable challenge of tokyo i know that he has much to contribute to the debates in your lordships house <e> <s> i think that we are all equally grateful to my noble friend lord cledwyn for the positive and wide-ranging style of his opening speech <e> <s> most of us are pleased that the ec has regained momentum <e> <s> provides a target and a sense of purpose and urgency <e> <s> in welcoming that concept it is nice to see the benches upon which i sit reverting once again to their true international tradition and leaving little englandism to the benches opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords this house has perhaps too few debates on the economy but i sense that this one promises to be different and i hope a little more memorable <e> <s> hitherto certainly in my brief time here our debates have followed a certain ritualistic form <e> <s> the government have always claimed that we were witnessing an unprecedented economic miracle with a wave of the magic wand the failures of the s and s would disappear <e> <s> i think that on this side the opposition have been sceptical suspecting that this was being done by mirrors and some massaging of the statistics <e> <s> but we were accused of being jeremiahs and of selling britain short <e> <s> i must say that we resented that suggestion from the government front bench this afternoon <e> <s> i am sure that as the noble earl grows older and he is certain to age rapidly with the events of the next two years he will learn to do better than that <e>", "<cs> my lords those figures are not acceptable to me <e> <s> their effect depends on how one presents them <e> <s> one also has to look at the particular circumstances of that time <e> <s> next year will expose these underlying economic realities <e> <s> industry home owners and the unemployed will pay the price for past mismanagement <e> <s> i believe it is possibly even shabby cynicism to create a recession in order to be able to create another artificial pre-election boom <e> <s> only a radical change in policies could produce a fundamental improvement in the true economic position of britain <e> <s> perhaps only a change of government will achieve that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that intriguing reply <e> <s> since the latest in the long line of monetary benchmarks announced by the government mo is proving unaccommodating and running well above the target range set in the last budget and since inflation both the rip and the underlying rate which the government tend to prefer are running well ahead of treasury forecasts does the minister agree that an honest and logical application of the medium term financial strategy should the new chancellor be able to find it would involve higher interest rates and higher taxation or both <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to begin by congratulating the noble earl lord de la warr on an excellently argued speech <e> <s> we look forward to many more contributions from him <e> <s> he does not need reminding that he comes from a family with a tradition of considerable political independence <e> <s> we also look forward to that <e> <s> perhaps i may give him a little advice as a fellow member of the stock exchange <e> <s> one of the delights of coming to this place <e>", "<cs> my lords we are running a government surplus but the noble lord refers to a time when we did not have the benefit of billion of north sea oil <e>", "<cs> my lords given that mr wallace has made further statements since the governments last very unsatisfactory statement on this matter and that some of his former colleagues in the army information service have offered to give testimony can the minister explain further why the government do not establish a wider judicial inquiry to establish the truth once and for all in this matter and to finally kill off the disturbing rumours that former ministers some of whom are noble lords in this house were the victims of a smear campaign <e> <s> in particular will the minister give an assurance that present and former officers and servants of the crown will not be deterred from giving evidence either by departmental pressure or by threats of prosecution under the official secrets act <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply and the additional information which it contains <e> <s> however i believe that of the relatively few people charged under the two acts comfortably over a half have been acquitted <e> <s> bearing that in mind are the government and the minister satisfied with the battle against insider dealing <e> <s> do we not need changes in the law or further changes in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to join previous speakers in praising the maiden speech of the noble lord lord crook <e> <s> i particularly look forward to his contributions in the area of roads and tunnels where delays and disasters are bound to face us <e>", "<cs> no my lords they do not square with what i have been saying <e> <s> i too received that brief <e> <s> i should like to check whether its figures are given in real terms <e> <s> i know that the figures were given from <e> <s> a characteristic of the present <e>", "<cs> my lords having been close to the case relating to the brighton bomb which came before the board i can assure the house that no words yet used to describe the board are harsh enough <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister whether the governments proposals can have any hope of dealing with the mountain created by this problem and whether it does not need a more rational approach <e> <s> is the minister aware that the system would work more efficiently if management consultants were brought in to give advice on the problem of the tens of thousands of applications involving specific cases with which it is inevitably rather difficult to deal <e> <s> does he agree that if there were a basic table of compensation relating to <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that statement <e> <s> perhaps i may repeat my question and ask him what was the assumption of the rate of inflation <e> <s> is it not true that it was per cent <e> <s> is the minister aware that current city forecasts for inflation in the coming year are double that at per cent <e> <s> is the minister further aware that about three-quarters of local government expenditure is on labour costs and that about three-quarters of that is settled by central negotiations and formulae <e> <s> does he not therefore agree that it is unfair to blame local authorities for all the difficulties arising from the poll tax <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to comment as a full-time working director in the city and a former director of kleinwort benson although not at the time when these events occurred <e> <s> does the minister not accept that the statement is totally inadequate and will be seen in the city as very depressing <e> <s> in the city there is considerable confusion about what is now proper behaviour and what is not proper behaviour <e> <s> the government must give a firm lead and not leave it to others to draw their own conclusions <e> <s> we want the government to state their conclusions very firmly to the city in order to give a lead <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that the impact of high interest rates goes much wider than mortgages <e> <s> is he not aware that the present level of corporate debt the debt of industry is at almost its highest historical level <e> <s> since the cost of money is a major factor in industrial costs does he accept that such high interest rates must have an inflationery impact <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister have a different question from the one on the order paper <e> <s> that does not mention the rpi it mentions inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> has he read the report by pirc the pensions investment research consultants published in february <e> <s> it shows that around million people persuaded to contract out of serps were wrongly advised to do so <e> <s> about one-third of those contracted out are highly likely to be worse off under their personal pensions than they would have been under serps on the assumption that the stock markets and investment markets perform as well in the future as they have in the recent past <e> <s> is the noble lord also aware that investment institutions are advertising in an excessive way to persuade people to contract out of serps <e> <s> will he promise that his department will advertise advising those for whom it is best to stay in serps that is anyone retiring in the next decade that they should do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that helpful and accurate reply <e> <s> bearing in mind that each per cent fall in sterling is calculated by economists to produce an increase in inflation of up to per cent <e> <s> will the minister agree to take on a bet with me that at the year end the rate of inflation will for the third year in succession be higher than the chancellors budget forecasts <e>", "<cs> i am second time lucky my lords <e> <s> this subject has received some public airing of late and we must be careful not to keep ploughing the whole field <e> <s> we must also be gentle on the minister who will be answering <e> <s> he has been pitched in at the deep end of the front bench with the dead weight of the football identity scheme <e> <s> he was rescued from that and now has been handed this subject <e> <s> as a good northamptonshire man he deserves better <e>", "<cs> my lords this is long-running and messy saga and we are quite rightly anxious as to the matters of genuine concern <e> <s> for myself as for some other noble lords who have spoken i do not think it is of any great public concern who owns harrods <e> <s> it is a commercial bazaar like any other and owners from the middle east are as appropriate as any others assuming that they do not use it illegally <e> <s> in addition there are no victims so far as i can see of public injustice here <e> <s> the shareholders received a fair price <e> <s> we may have private reservations about either of the main parties in this battle and personally i would have reservations about any of them marrying any of my daughters though the dowry might come in useful <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to follow the noble lord lord seebohm in concentrating on the community care aspects of the bill <e> <s> that is partly because that approach will aid brevity i am sure the minister will welcome that and partly because the bulk of the debate has concentrated on the national health service as does the bulk of the bill <e> <s> i feel that my noble friend lord ennals has in particular said most of what needs to be said on that <e> <s> community care is a cosy term and has been part of the social policy jargon for the past years <e> <s> it usually receives a consensus support across parties <e> <s> like motherhood everybody agrees that it is a good thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> bearing in mind that that formula assumes that an old couple or a single person with savings of can secure a rate of return of nearly per cent <e> <s> and for those with the maximum savings of it assumes a rate of return of nearly per cent <e> <s> will the minister inform noble lords in this house some of whom may wish to draw benefit under the scheme where they can secure such a rate of return <e> <s> secondly will he inform the house whether the formula will be improved should interest rates and returns on investments ever fall <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> i note that after years of the crusade against inflation the change is just a few decimal points <e> <s> i again ask the minister whether the government will concede that the chancellors budget forecast for end year inflation will once again be wrong and for the third year in succession be an underestimate <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to the ministers sterling defence <e> <s> has he read the latest <e>", "<cs> my lords once again we are involved in public discussion of broadcasting <e> <s> in the past five years we have been presented with the peacock report the green paper on radio the white paper on broadcasting and now the clauses and schedules of the broadcasting bill <e> <s> for a government who do not believe in government interference that constitutes quite a record of involvement <e> <s> however we must not complain about that <e> <s> broadcasting is a very important public issue <e> <s> it is quite right that parliament should devote serious thought and time to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply which i am sure has illuminated the understanding of the whole house <e> <s> it cannot all be wrong <e> <s> however will he agree that the real explanation is the credit boom and the property borrowing explosion which was generated and encouraged at the time of the last election <e> <s> will he also give an assurance that no such phoney boom will be generated ahead of the next election <e> <s> further can he tell us whether the government have any further measures in mind to improve this deplorably low personal savings ratio <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of or if he is not will he promise to read the recent publication by kleinwort benson securities one of the governments most loyal supporters in the city which shows that the largest single element producing an increase in inflation in the past year a third of the total is induced by the governments own actions in raising prices <e> <s> will he tell the house how he reconciles the governments actions in raising prices with their rhetoric about reducing inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords we are today considering the role of a department which is undoubtedly seen by many as the black sheep in the whitehall flock <e> <s> it is not uncommon for departments to be unpopular with her majestys opposition since they advise and execute government policies <e> <s> it is not uncommon for the treasury especially to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> perhaps i may begin by congratulating him on his appearance in the honours list <e> <s> that i am sure gives pleasure on all sides <e>", "<cs> my lords the headline inflation rate for the uk is per cent <e> <s> and the noble earl said that the underlying rate is per cent <e> <s> noting even the underlying rate of per cent <e> <s> which is almost treble the rates in the main competitor countries which he mentioned and double the average rate for other members of the european monetary mechanism does the minister not agree that there is little hope this year of meeting the prime ministers prime madrid condition for entry into the ern namely that there should be a convergence of inflation rates <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister will help the house on the question of early entry into the erm <e> <s> all noble lords probably read in the <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that one constructive and practical way to bring france closer to britain would be to build a proper and modern railway between london and paris <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister help the house to understand the scale of the problem by providing some numbers <e> <s> will he confirm that the number of housing starts during the past year has collapsed falling by about per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> noting the extremely high percentage of water which the anglian water company derives from bore-holes i believe it to be the highest of any company does he not agree that water derived from bore-holes is much more damaging in conservation terms than that derived from reservoirs because of the long-term depletion of the water table <e> <s> is he also aware that that company has dug a further bore-holes in the past nine months and boasts of having no intention of building a reservoir for years <e> <s> will he ask the national rivers authority to suggest to the anglian water company that it should not be permitted to dig more bore-holes until it announces a programme of reservoir construction <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> it confirms the discouragingly low percentage of our exports which go to that large and expanding market <e> <s> is he aware that germany and france which the minister has confirmed already have a much larger share of those markets have recently increased the credit cover provided for exports and trade to those markets <e> <s> does he not agree that it is perhaps a little eccentric of the secretary of state for trade and industry to propose both to reduce the scale of the operations of the export credit guarantee department and to increase charges <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many people will be relieved if the implication of his reply is that charges in this area will not be increased <e> <s> is he further aware that for someone who travels there on business it is most depressing to see how small the british presence is in central and eastern europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister <e> <s> we welcome him to the latest of his ministerial responsibilities <e> <s> i am sure that it will be as satisfying and testing as previously <e> <s> does he agree that with inflation now higher than it was when the government came into office there are two alternatives which face them either to reduce inflation through deflating the economy with a high exchange rate and higher unemployment or to live with high inflation and face the embarrassments of devaluations in the fixed exchange mechanism in the future <e> <s> will he guide us on which of those courses the government propose to follow <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that one area of expanding crime is the white collar crime of fraud in the financial sector does not the noble earl agree that the decision that has emerged this week to reduce the resources of the serious fraud office by removing the position of one of the top three men the deputy director is inexplicable <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> does he agree that deficits on that stupendous scale for this year which are heading beyond the chancellors forecast of billion and which under this government are far and away the highest of those under any government in history are alarming <e> <s> now that we have entered the erm at what may be a perilously high exchange rate which puts the squeeze on exporters what alternative policies do the government have to eliminate those enormous deficits in the year ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords arising from the ministers reply to me when he cast aspersions on our commitment to the erm does he accept that the commitment is complete but does not involve believing that the measure was taken at the right time when the divergence of inflation is very high at the right rate which is perilously high or for the right reason which is to disguise the political cut in interest rates <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his answer although i am not quite clear where it will leave mr murdoch <e> <s> perhaps i may ask him this precise question <e> <s> exactly when did the government know of the proposed merger between sky and bsb <e> <s> were the relevant minister the home secretary in regard to the broadcasting industry and the relevant authority the iba informed at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister deny the statements made in the newspapers that the prime minister and downing street were alerted to this matter several days before on monday th october <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> i presume that recession rather like a camel does not need a definition but you know it when you have got it <e> <s> what assumptions and i do not say forecasts about unemployment for are included in the autumn statement forecasts as regards social security expenditure on unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords in my supplementary question i did not ask for forecasts knowing the treasury i asked for assumptions <e> <s> can the minister helpfully explain what those assumptions are for unemployment next year <e>", "<cs> my lords this is proving a very good debate <e> <s> i should like to begin by congratulating the noble baroness lady castle on her characteristically rousing punchy and i dare say in her absence but i should be more nervous if she were present lengthy maiden speech <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate my noble friend lord williams for his very effective and enjoyable demolition job and also my noble friend lord callaghan who brought his customary authority to our proceedings <e> <s> i apologise to the minister that i shall be absent from the inevitably rather late conclusion of the debate as i have to host a long-standing engagement <e>", "<cs> my lords the national debt has been reduced but that is a single aspect <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord does not think that is the only aspect of debt which concerns the economy or the million or so people of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i may not have heard clearly the ministers reply to my noble friend lord dormand <e> <s> did he deny the statement that unemployment next year would reach million <e>"]
