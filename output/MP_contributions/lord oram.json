["<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether her majestys government will continue the policy of concentrating aid mostly in the poorest countries and for the benefit of the poorest people in those poorest countries <e> <s> if that is to be the case as i hope it will be will not tanzania qualify for priority in receiving aid quite apart from the reasons advanced by my noble friend in his supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that reply may i ask whether there are not two major aspects of co-operative societies which make them particularly appropriate as instruments for rural development <e> <s> first are they not particularly suitable for the small-scale labour intensive and locally controlled projects which are so much needed in the rural areas of developing countries <e> <s> secondly since it is an important principle of co-operatives that their control is democratic on the principle of one member one vote are co-operative societies not an important training ground for the conduct of democratic government <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that recognition of a government rests on far broader considerations than those implied in the rather simplistic way in the question on the order paper <e> <s> in particular is it not the case in rhodesia that the present prime ministers authority in these matters has recently been eroded by a judicial decision so that his majority in their parliament now rests on the white votes of mps who were not elected according to the principle of one man one vote <e>", "<cs> my lords in conducting the review to which the noble earl has referred will her majestys government bear in mind that an important feature of the british aid effort has been the partnership between voluntary bodies such as oxfam and christian aid on the one hand and the government department on the other <e> <s> will the government therefore bear in mind that this advisory committee referred to in the question is a most important part of that partnership <e> <s> therefore may we from this side express the hope that the review will be favourable to the outcome of this committee <e>", "<cs> my lords are not the government in fact taking steps in the opposite direction from that suggested by the noble baroness as they are with-drawing the funds which supported consumer advice centres <e>", "<cs> my lords with reference to the womens organisations is it not the fact that the co-operative womens guild has a long-standing interest in consumer protection and would it not be appropriate to consult them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether due consideration has been given to the probable extra needs in rhodesia <e> <s> if as we all hope things go well on the security and constitutional front is it not highly desirable that generous aid should be provided in proper circumstances in order to maintain political stability there <e> <s> does not this mean that extra money will need to be provided in the aid programme <e>", "<cs> my lords recalling what the noble lord lord gladwyn said about the utterly deplorable speech by mr smith a few days ago was that speech not utterly contradictory to the spirit of the lancaster house agreement and ought it not to have called for utter condemnation by the governor <e> <s> should we not have a declaration either by the governor or by the noble lord today that whatever mr smith thinks about the outcome of the election and what he would do in those circumstances the british government will stand by the results of the election <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord invited us to wait a week or two before we hear the real figures that will be announced <e> <s> but are not my noble friends on the front bench and the noble lord lord gladwyn perfectly correct in detecting a retrogressive attitude towards aid from her majestys government <e> <s> is it not utterly deplorable that we are hearing such a statement in the week following the brandt report which in perfectly justified tones of urgency called attention to the desperate future that awaits the world unless massive aid is transferred to the third world <e> <s> is it not at least welcome that a leading conservative such as mr edward heath a signatory of the brandt report is not blinkered in these matters as her majestys government seem to be <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind that there is a well-established system of food aid in the world whereby donor countries give surplus food to developing countries and the money that is generated in those developing countries by the sale of that food is then used for internal development projects within the developing countries <e> <s> if as a result of the boycott of russia food surpluses emerge either in europe or as they may well do in the wheat lands of north america would it not be a practical proposition to enhance the system of food aid thereby following up the boycott of russia helping those who are producing surpluses in america or europe to dispose of their food and also do an enormous amount of good in the developing countries <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord stanley of alderley asks leave to withdraw his amendment i wonder whether we can have from the noble lord some information as to whether the order that will be introduced will be an affirmative order or will be subject to the negative resolution procedure <e> <s> in other words i am asking whether the house will have an opportunity at some point of examining the nature of the order that is to be brought in <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a number of notable speeches in this debate and i am sure that my noble friend lord listowel is gratified that his initiative has led to such a valuable commentary on the brandt report <e> <s> i should like to join those who have congratulated the noble lord lord chorley on his maiden speech <e> <s> he spoke most interestingly and obviously on the basis of personal experience which is always a good basis upon which to speak <e> <s> i congratulate him upon his contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be so but to a major extent it depends upon the funds which are provided through acts of parliament and it will be those cuts which will severely eat into their viability <e> <s> i say again that our task is to create markets in the developing countries for our goods and services <e> <s> that is the long-term objective <e> <s> but there is another problem to which i want to call attentionthat is the immediate and urgent task which faces us in preventing the collapse of the markets that already exist <e> <s> that is why in my concluding moments i want to say a word or two about the problem of the increased indebtedness of the developing countries and to emphasise one part of the brandt proposals in that connection <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would care to say a few words about our contribution to the united nations fund for population activities <e> <s> is it our intention to maintain that contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that his answers this afternoon are in great contrast to the note of urgency that was struck by the brandt report and while we can accept that deep consideration has to be given to the issues <e>", "<cs> my lords since the cdc relies almost entirely on government loans for financing projects such as that suggested for senegal by the noble lord lord merrivale and the other projects which the minister listed can the minister assure the house that the operations of the cdc in these respects will not be prejudiced by the governments current policies on overseas aid <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords should not the government already have indicated their views <e> <s> the term of art very shortly is one which implies a lack of urgency in this matter <e> <s> do the noble lord and the government not realise the extreme urgency of the world trade and economic situation which was so cogently analysed by the brandt report and has not the president of the world bank mr mcnamara indicated his view that the world situation is even more urgent and grave than is set out in the brandt report <e> <s> in view of that will the government treat the matter much more urgently <e> <s> may i ask for example whether the prime minister is proposing as i think she should to raise these matters at the venice summit meeting today or tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not clear from the recently issued report of the cdc that the government have already adopted a restrictive attitude to the cdc finances <e> <s> will the noble lord care to explain how her majestys government reconcile that restrictive attitude with their declared objective that they wish to administer the aid programme in a way which serves the industrial and commercial interests of this country <e> <s> is it not the case that the cdc operations are a very obvious part of the programme which serves those industries <e> <s> moreover is it not the case that the cuts in the finances allowed to the cdc are disproportionately high compared with the cuts in the aid programme as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that reply and acknowledging that good work has been done over the years by the local authorities in the south downs area in preventing undesirable encroachment on the down-land may i ask whether the minister will convey to the authorities responsible the fact that in recent years large areas of the downs have changed their scenic character as a result of changes in agricultural practice <e> <s> does not the minister consider that this calls for positive planning powers by a unitary authority rather than as at present for the negative powers exercised by a number of authorities <e> <s> and have not subsequent events since proved that in that year the hob-house committee was right in recommending that the south downs should be a national park <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to follow the noble lord lord birdwood and compliment him on having briefly filled a noticeable gap in the list of speakers with which we have been provided <e> <s> we listened to his words with appreciation coming from the only conservative back-bencher to have joined in this debate <e>", "<cs> i anticipate that when the minister comes to reply to the debate he will not only rest as has been suggested by the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls on the fact that there is a general educational provision already in the bill but he may say as has been said in connection with earlier amendments that it is wrong to write into the bill specific instructions to the authority about the educational programme to be provided by the fourth channel <e> <s> let me confess that i have a considerable sympathy with that point of view as a general statement <e>", "<cs> my lords have we not read recently that food has been destroyed in this country in implementation of the regulations under the common agricultural policy <e> <s> is it beyond the wit of man and beyond the wit of this government to devise some means of avoiding the situation whereby food is destroyed in one part of the world and thousands of people die in another <e>", "<cs> my lords since this meeting arises directly out of the work of the brandt commission can the minister inform the house a little more about the proposed composition of the summit meeting <e> <s> will it be purely governmental in character or will members of the brandt commission be joining in <e> <s> if that is so can we anticipate that mr edward heath will be there to join in the conversations with the prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister have in mind that there is another category of housing not mentioned in the question on the order paper or indeed in any of the supplementary questions namely co-operative housing <e> <s> will the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a somewhat strange contrast between this question and the preceding one on the order paper <e> <s> the noble lord lord gainford seems to want local authorities to provide fewer services whereas the noble baroness lady sharples wants them to provide more <e> <s> would the noble lord be prepared to arbitrate in this philosophical dispute between his two noble friends <e>", "<cs> my lords in seeking to improve the statistical information as the noble lord indicated will the government ensure that the information points to those businesses which are registered as companies under the companies act and the encouraging number of new businesses which are being registered as co-operative societies under the industrial and provident societies act <e> <s> will that distinction be borne in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed a privilege to follow the noble lord lord swann who has just delivered such a remarkably entertaining and erudite maiden speech <e> <s> i am quite sure that just as we eagerly looked forward to his maiden speech we shall eagerly look forward to futher contributions that he will make on future suitable occasions <e> <s> i think he was fortunate in having so soon after he had joined your lordships such a suitable debate in which to participate <e> <s> in that he was much more fortunate than i as i recall when i made my maiden speech <e> <s> soon after i came to your lordships house i was plunged into a vast number of minor technical chores from the government dispatch box and i found myself making my maiden speech on the metrication <e>", "<cs> i should like to support with certain reservations the new clause moved by the noble lord lord seebohm <e> <s> if in what i say i seem to stress the reservations rather than the support this is because the noble lord himself it seems to me has made out admirably the general case for the setting up of job-ownership companies and as he has explained they are a different kind of company <e> <s> they would incorporate some features of conventional companies and some features of workers co-operatives but they would be neither one nor the other <e> <s> when i put forward my reservations and suggestions it is in the hope that they may help the noble lord improve on the scheme which he has put forward in committee <e> <s> perhaps i should explain that i approach the whole question of enterprises owned by those who work in them from the point of view of a lifelong co-operator and maybe i should indicate an interest in that i am the chairman of the co-operative development agency which your lordships may know as a body set up by parliament for the encouragement of co-operatives and which in its first two years has concentrated particularly on the encouragement of industrial cooperatives <e>", "<cs> i am glad to hear that but i suggest that it is not contained in the new clause <e> <s> i suggest therefore that it would be an improvement if at a later stage that could be made clear <e> <s> it is perfectly clear that all members must be workers but it is not clear that all workers should have the right to be members and that should be included <e>", "<cs> as i understood the minister he wanted to confine his talks with the noble lord lord seebohm to the practicalities of the governments amendments which are on the marshalled list <e> <s> i wonder whether i may press the noble and learned lord to go somewhat wider than that and to offer to enter into discussions with the noble nord lord seebohm with a view to looking at the position which we may reach at the report stage in order to find out whether or not some other form of amendment might be moved <e> <s> i believe that talks of that wider kind might help the committee out of the present difficulty in which it is placed <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that all political parties acknowledge the great importance of developing the economies of countries in the third world although we may differ in our emphasis and methods <e> <s> do not opinion polls indicate that among the general public that acknowledgment is certainly not the same as it is among the political parties <e> <s> does not that fact point to the very great importance of the question raised by my noble friend as well as the important need for local authorities central government and voluntary bodies to give much greater emphasis to this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords the question which the noble lord lord chitnis has asked this evening refers not only to the governments policy concerning el salvador with which a number of noble lords have dealt admirably but to neighbouring countries as well <e> <s> it is on that basis that i should like to call the ministers attention to certain aspects of the situation in one of those neighbours namely nicaragua whose fortunes and future are bound to be affected by developments in el salvador <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord spens for giving your lordships a further opportunity to discuss the subject which the noble baroness lady sharples introduced a year or so ago <e> <s> i recall that during that debate towards the end of the short speech that i contributed i suggested that the small co-operative business was particularly worthy of attention and encouragement and i should like to take this opportunity today to develop that theme rather more fully <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not unfortunately the case that even this very useful exchange in your lordships house this afternoon may be given very little publicity in the press <e> <s> would the noble lord himself instead of suggesting that your lordships should individually write to the broadcasting authorities call the attention of the bbc to the exchanges that have taken place this afternoon <e>", "<cs> in rising to support the noble lord lord lloyd in his amendment may i say that i do so not through having any particular knowledge of the main subject-matter dealt with by the bill nor do i know whether the employees of amersham international are likely to be able or willing to acquire shares as indicated in the noble lords amendment <e> <s> however i am interested <e> <s> my interest was aroused by the reference in the amendment to an industrial and provident society as the instrument for the ownership of shares collectively rather than by individual workers <e> <s> that in general is certainly an interesting idea which i believe is well worth pursuing <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that aid provided by the ministry of overseas development under successive governments has been well monitored has provided for sound projects and has not been abused in the way that the noble lord lord beloff suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord recall that a few weeks ago there took place in these buildings one of the most massive lobbies on the brandt report that i can recall on any subject having been either in this chamber or in the other chamber for the last quarter of a century <e> <s> will he and his colleagues in approaching the mexico conference realise that if they can take a more positive attitude than has been indicated so far they will have the support of an important section of public opinion led i am glad to say by church representatives <e>", "<cs> my lords in the discussions about relations with the developing countries was note taken of the highly critical state of indebtedness of some developing countries and were contingent plans made to meet a situation which might arise if there should be any major defaults <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether an estimate of the cost of transferring household goods and capital to this country was taken into account when fixing the amount of aid to zimbabwe <e> <s> is that not an important factor in deciding the rights and wrongs of this matter <e> <s> despite the implication of the last question surely her majestys government have residual responsibilities in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords like other speakers i very much welcome this report and in particular as others have said i welcome the attractive and helpful speech with which the noble lord lord wolfenden introduced the debate <e> <s> i welcome especially the general conclusion which his committee reached that provision of proper consultative arrangements in industry needs to be very much improved <e> <s> on the question to which several speakers have referred of whether there is need for statutory provision or whether it is sufficient to rely on voluntarism i believe that the conclusion of the committee could be fairly stated as being that while any progress on a voluntary basis is to be welcomed nevertheless a statutory provision as in most other member states is required in order to encourage progress on a voluntary basis <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord stanley of alderley said that farmers whose spokesman he eloquently is are very good and do as they are told <e> <s> it has been my experience in another place and here that they are very expert in making sure that they are told to do just what it is they want to do <e> <s> i take a very different view from the noble lord lord stanley about the report that we are debating <e> <s> in particular i think that it is a very good illustration especially when we include the lucid speech of my noble friend lord cledwyn of penrhos of the great value of the work of the european committee and its subcommittees not least because the committee procedure gives a full opportunity both for those with expert <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept a good deal of what the noble lord has said but i am pointing to the fact that there is a contradiction of philosophy within the treaty of rome itself and the practices which have emerged in relation to the cap <e> <s> of course the whole of the common agricultural policy is subject to the criticism that i have made but this is not the time for us to go into the general question <e> <s> we have examined that through an earlier report produced under the chairmanship of my noble friend lord cledwyn <e>", "<cs> my lords i was looking at it from the point of view of the economies of the developing countries and i think that there is a justified parallel in the instances that i have given <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the cbi has recently estimated that by the end of next year there will be million teenagers on the dole <e> <s> is not this an horrific figure facing the manpower services commission in relation to its youth opportunities programme which at the moment caters for i believe some <e> <s> can the minister assure the house that despite forecast pressures from the treasury for economies his right honourable friend will stick to the pledge that all teenagers will have work or training experience <e>", "<cs> my lords while recognising the difficulty of making comparisons between two distinctly different schemes is the minister aware that <e>", "<cs> my lords in those instances was it not the case that the bills then being dealt with were controversial as between the parties whereas in this case everyone seems to agree that this is a technical bill <e>", "<cs> my lords it is i think understandable that when it is decided in your lordships house to discuss these interrelated subjects of foreign affairs and defence the main thrust of many of the speeches should be the east-west confrontation because of course the pre-eminent danger at the present stage of world history is that the relationship between the two separate worlds the communist east and the capitalist west should be so mismanaged as to lead to a nuclear catastrophe <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of statistical information to which the noble lord has just referred does he recall that soon after this government took office they introduced the tax and prices index in the expectation that taxes would go down and that the combined index would show a more favourable image than the retail prices index <e> <s> in fact that new index has risen more steeply than the rpi <e> <s> would it be helpful therefore if i were to suggest that the government might now stop publishing the tax and prices index as it has failed to meet the cosmetic purpose for which it was introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recognise that i very much welcome the revelation of the truth through that index <e> <s> i was only trying to be helpful to the government in their usual efforts to disguise the truth <e>", "<cs> my lords since it is widely agreed that cosira is cost-effective in its work and over the years has built up a valuable fund of expertise is there not a case for it to have more resources than at present and for it to be relieved of its present geographical constraints so that it could operate in larger towns and perhaps even in collaboration with local authorities in inner city areas <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of refugees to which the noble lord referred has not the austrian government indicated that the burden that it is bearing in relation to the refugees now in austria has become more than it can bear <e> <s> has it not said that other countries ought to help <e> <s> have the british government received any request in this respect and if so what response do they propose to make <e>", "<cs> my lords were not the cuts last year in fact disproportionately large compared with cuts in other areas of public expenditure <e> <s> does not the statement that we have heard today indicate that nothing is being done to restore the position as it was prior to the cuts of last year <e> <s> moreover were not these decisions taken during the very weeks when the prime minister and the foreign secretary were attending a series of aid conferences in ottawa in paris in melbourne and then in cancun and putting their signatures to declarations about the need for much more generous aid to developing countries <e> <s> is it not shameful that these fine words have in fact been followed by mean actions <e>", "<cs> my lords in his opening statement the minister gave estimates of the amount of money necessary to implement the training scheme in the next two or three years <e> <s> in reaching those amounts i suppose that the government had earlier made an estimate of the number of young unemployed likely to be unemployed in those years <e> <s> could the noble earl give the house those estimates of young unemployed people in those years <e>", "<cs> my lords but surely the figures which he gave must have some basis on estimates or calculations <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether her majestys government support the conclusions concerning rural development that were reached at rome <e> <s> if as i hope the answer to that question is yes how can that support of policies for rural development be reconciled with the decision to put as much as one-sixth of the annual aid programme into one massive industrial project in india which seems to give no promise of help for the rural poor <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that in the original question his noble friend was distinctly selective in his choice of statistics since he has chosen as his base year a year in which private housing starts had been drastically reduced as a result of the governments actions <e> <s> would he not have been better employed asking what actions the government took to reduce private housing starts from in the last year of the labour government to two years later in the first year of this government <e> <s> surely there is little credit to be gained or to be claimed in first causing a problem and then doing something to mitigate its effects <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the good work that is being done by the highlands and islands development board in the encouragement of community co-operatives and is he aware that such co-operatives can include in their membership both fishermen and crofters and therefore provide an ideal channel through which government assistance can be provided to people in both these occupations <e>", "<cs> my lords i was fascinated by the introductory exchange which the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords other speakers in this debate have been so unanimous and anxious to congratulate the noble viscount lord mackintosh of halifax on his maiden speech that i am all the more sorry that i missed it <e> <s> i do apologise to him <e> <s> i was unavoidably absent from the chamber during the short period which included his speech but i look forward to the opportunity of hearing him and i hope of congratulating him on a future occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord resumes his seat can he say whether the home office review to which he has helpfully referred is likely to be published <e> <s> it strikes me that it would be an extremely useful document for us to see in giving further consideration to this question whether on the basis of lady trumpingtons bill or through some other means <e>", "<cs> my lords although i do not agree with the purposes of the bill introduced by the noble lord lord rugby i think we can all agree that he has given us a lively and imaginative speech in introducing it <e> <s> i must say however that i felt he let his imagination run a little wild when he suggested that messrs woolworth were one of the harbingers of the socialist cause <e> <s> i think that was a little exaggerated <e> <s> nevertheless i am sure the noble lord has done a service to the house in giving us this second reading opportunity to discuss many of the questions he has raised and which i am sure others will raise concerning the supply of spectacles <e> <s> the subject has been several times raised in your lordships house at question-time but i think we all felt that those occasions were inadequate for dealing with the subject and it is for that reason that this much fuller opportunity is to be welcomed by all of us <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply but does he not realise that apart from what he has just indicated to the house the government are completely failing to take essential initiatives in relation to developing countries <e> <s> instead are not the government really putting things in reverse by for instance refusing to restore the cuts in the aid programme and more recently drastically reducing the contribution to the international development association following the american decision in this matter and has this not produced the mood of frustration and despair which is evident in the meeting now going on in delhi of third world countries <e>", "<cs> my lords of the institutions to which the minister has referred is not the international development association the one that is most helpful in offering soft loans to developing countries and is it not therefore reprehensible that it is that organisations funds which have so recently been savagely cut <e>", "<cs> my lords has not the commitment authority in respect of the current year ending in june this year reduced its commitment to the ida from billion dollars to billion dollars <e> <s> were not these the figures which the noble lord himself gave me in a written answer recently <e>", "<cs> my lords at this hour i am sure your lordships would wish me to do little more than thank the many noble lords who have taken part in this very valuable debate <e> <s> i am tempted by the ministers closing remarks to follow up some of the ida points but i shall refrain from doing so <e> <s> i am sure that i would be unpopular if i went into them in any detail <e>", "<cs> my lords when i read the motion which has now been moved by my noble friend lord beswick i was prompted as apparently my noble friend lord underhill was prompted to turn to the conservative manifesto for the election <e> <s> unlike my noble friend lord underhill who apparently keeps it in his briefcase i have been wearing it next to my heart for the past few days <e> <s> in addition i have another document which i am wearing even closer to my heart for good reason and that is the labour <e>", "<cs> my lords it was in the context of a statement by the noble lord lord marsh that it was a public responsibility to run transport in major cities <e> <s> that was quite clear and i am sure that the noble lord if he recalls the speech in more detail will agree <e>", "<cs> my lords a major part of the noble lords speech was a justification for the existing nationalised sector <e> <s> i suggest to the noble lord lord tanlaw that if he wants to read the case for nationalised industry he would do well to read lord taylors speech tomorrow and perhaps sort out between the two allied parties just where they stand in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me <e> <s> i made the point that the sectors of industry which are being sold off are those which are clearly profitable <e> <s> clearly therefore they are successful either nationalised or privately owned but it is reducing the nationalised sector to a position of great difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that particularly in relation to developing countries it is important that these commercial advisers should also be as expert as possible in the development needs of the country where they are serving <e> <s> supplying those development needs very much fits in with the kind of thing which my noble friend lord shinwell has in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords was it not in botswana that the late dr schumacher the originator of the concept of intermediate technology and author of the phrase small is beautiful did pioneering work in the construction of small easily constructed rainwater tanks <e> <s> would the noble lord inquire as to whether that pioneering work has been followed up recently and if it has not will the government enter into discussions with the botswana government as to whether that would not be a very good way of expending some of the additional grant to which the noble lord referred <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a notable series of speeches and i am sure that my noble friend lord davies of leek must be gratified as indeed we all are that he chose to introduce this subject of such importance and that it has led to such an important and fascinating debate <e> <s> whenever i contemplate this problem to which he has directed out attention like other noble lords and the noble baroness lady seear i like to start with some simple arithmetic not that when talking about billions as we are it is easy to keep the arithmetic simple <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i thank my noble friend lord paget for underlining the kind of development that i was pointing out <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am grateful to my noble friend for underlining the point that i was making <e> <s> here again i want to get away from the figures because the picture that is in my mind of those teeming towns as i look back over those travels which many of your lordships have equally made is not of the city centres not the offices factories and hotels but the shanty towns on the outskirts of these cities <e> <s> they are vast obscenities of geography <e> <s> they are masses of shacks made out of tins cardboard and wood which to the bulk of the human race are home <e> <s> it is one of the most frustrating sides of this problem that we are debating that we see people from the countryside in a process of futile migration to the towns <e> <s> i say futile because they go there in the <e>", "<cs> my lords two months ago i had the great good fortune of being selected as a member of the delegation from the inter-parliamentary union which visited china at the invitation of the national peoples congress <e> <s> let me say at once that i am always wary of those who on the basis of a two weeks visit become experts in a countrys affairs <e> <s> i do not wish to fall into that trap <e> <s> my noble friend lord rhodes with his great experience to which a number of noble lords referred himself said that he was no expert <e> <s> all that i can say is that his knowledge and experience in these matters completely dwarfs my own <e> <s> nevertheless the experience that i gained during that visit to china was so meaningful and so contributed to my own understanding of the situation in china that i am persuaded that at least a brief contribution from me to this discussion may be worthwhile <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is to be an inquiry is not the likely outcome that the democratic facilities are there enshrined in the act but that members do not make use of those facilities <e> <s> is not the problem one of apathy and one that is difficult to overcome <e>", "<cs> my lords while we should recognise that profit sharing schemes make some modest contribution to democracy in industry may i ask whether it is not a mistake to believe that they can make any really significant contribution since worker shareholders can all too readily be outvoted by other shareholders <e> <s> is it not the case that democracy in industry can be found only in those enterprises which are operating on the basis of one shareholder/one vote rather than on the basis of one share/one vote <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lords memory go back so far as mine to the day when the conservative party came out with the revolutionary slogan a property-owning democracy <e> <s> while the answer which the noble lord has given this morning indicates some approach to wider ownership of capital is it not the case that we await the day when we can have a better approach to democracy relating to the democratic decisions concerning the use of that capital <e> <s> can the noble lord give us any hope in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords it was important that the noble viscount lord caldecote should have taken this opportunity to clarify as he put it the views of his federation because as he no doubt knows back in april his director-general approached the bill in a very different way <e> <s> i have no doubt that there were considerable comings and goings about what dr james mcfarlane said before the federation through its present spokesman reached its current attitude <e> <s> i say that because dr mcfarlane referred to the federation having no enthusiasm for the bill <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what i meant by assuming that there had been considerable comings and goings in the interim before the formula had been developed <e>", "<cs> my lords while i do not dissent in any way from the advice which the noble leader has given to the house on the matter may i ask whether it is not understandable that the noble lord lord vaizey should be disappointed that his apparently negative views on the question of unemployment should not have received the attention he hoped <e> <s> however is there not another way by which the house could meet the noble lords point <e> <s> could we debate the report <e> <s> that would give us an opportunity of hearing lord vaizey but we should also be able to hear from the noble baroness lady seear from the liberal benches who chaired the committee and indeed the views of distinguished conservative members of the committee with considerably longer service to the conservative party than lord vaizey such as the <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the important aspect of all youth training schemes including this one the extent to which temporary training schemes lead on to permanent jobs <e> <s> in that connection will the noble lord and his colleagues have a particular look at a scheme recently launched in hartlepool by the archbishop of york and supported by the european social fund the msc the local authority and the church of england <e> <s> under this scheme the young people not only receive technical training but also business training and it is linked with the formation of small co-operative businesses which create new jobs and in which the young people can anticipate moving on to permanent employment <e> <s> has not this scheme got many constructive features and would not the noble lord give particular sympathetic regard to this project with a view to its proliferation in connection with the scheme he has now announced <e>", "<cs> my lords those of us who serve on sub-committee b of the european communities select committee have very good reason to appreciate the way in which our chairman lord greenhill of harrow guides us through a series of complex issues <e> <s> this subject of agricultural trade policy is but one example and by no means the most simple of the subjects with which he has helped us to deal and we appreciate his chairmanship <e>", "<cs> neither my noble friend lord <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may remind the committee of a point which i made in connection with the earlier amendment which we discussed namely that as the bill now stands the secretary of state is faced with the task of reaching a decision about events which may have taken place say six seven or eight years ago in the rather hazy distance of time <e> <s> surely therefore he must not only rely on the word of the applicant and on the recollections of the applicant as to what took place those years ago surely he must have what other evidence is available to him in reaching his conclusion <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that one of the great difficulties in this whole business would be to sort the sheep from the goats <e> <s> by sheep i mean those who have a genuine claim and by goats and there will be goats i mean those who are trying it on those who see the attraction of certain amounts of money and make an application <e> <s> the genuine ones will have a genuine conscientious objection to belonging to a trade union but the others may pretend to have those genuine feelings <e> <s> but let us remember that the amounts of money involved will be quite sizeable <e> <s> we do not know the number of cases but million is available and if there are a few cases it might be adjudicated that the amounts of money are quite large <e> <s> it worries me that after a few cases have occurred and it is seen that the amounts of money awarded are rather large this may activate in other peoples breasts some retrospective consciences <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support this amendment since it relates to a point which i made during the course of the second reading debate <e> <s> we have been reminded by my noble friends opening speech and indeed in the discussion on the amendment that preceded this that the closed shop is not as some people seem to think an instrument that suits trade unions only it suits many employers as well <e> <s> and why is that <e> <s> well it is because once an employer has negotiated a working arrangement with a trade union he knows where he stands <e> <s> he can get on with running his business and he can leave perhaps his personnel manager to operate what have become known and acceptable procedures <e> <s> but if those procedures are to be subject to reaffirmation every five years that smooth running system which he will have achieved in his negotiations with the trade union will i suggest be replaced by a situation of constant questioning and potential disruption <e> <s> a small minority of dissidents within his workforce may be constantly campaigning to get the original decision changed <e> <s> i think that that cannot but create an atmosphere of doubt all the time and therefore of generally bad industrial relations replacing a situation which may well have been a smooth and amicable state of relationships <e> <s> therefore i <e>", "<cs> during the second reading debate i quoted from an article in the <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down in relation to what she said at the beginning of her speech about industrial relations in the co-operative movement would she take it from me that neither my noble friend lord jenkins nor i was saying that the closed shop was the reason for good industrial relations in the co-operative movement <e> <s> we would say that it was consistent with and not harmful to good industrial relations <e> <s> that is different from the way in which the noble baroness put it <e>", "<cs> my lords if this country made more resolute steps to an aid programme such as we are committed to in the united nations would not that sum of money easily comprehend the small amount of money that would be needed to meet the noble lords request in his question <e>", "<cs> i was a little puzzled by what the noble earl said when he was dealing with the question of why we are now dealing with unfair dismissal in respect of union membership but not in respect of sex discrimination and race discrimination <e> <s> he said if i recall his words correctly that it is not possible to deal with everything at once <e>", "<cs> if i venture to speak briefly in favour of these amendments i hope the noble earl lord gowrie diligent sdp-watcher and alliance-watcher that he is will not suspect that here is the appearance of an extension of the alliance <e> <s> i speak merely to the merits of the amendment on the marshalled list as is my habit and i will leave the finesse of political bargaining to the noble earl <e>", "<cs> one point that puzzles me is that the minister seems to be resting his case on his claim that what is proposed in this bill is in line with normal legal proceedings <e> <s> if that is so and i am not one who can judge that was it not also the case in <e> <s> why was it not the governments position therefore to rest it on the normal legal proceedings in <e> <s> what has changed <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the proposal on grain reserves one of the most important results of the conference and will her majestys government seek to take an initiative in this matter <e> <s> for instance i gather from the noble lords original answer that at the conference our delegate played a part within the communitys delegation <e> <s> will the government continue to do that since is it not the case that in terms of grain production the european community <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord mccarthy reminded us that we are under some threat that this employment bill will not be the last and that there are other measures contemplated by the government in relation to trade unions <e> <s> reading this proposed new clause i wonder whether one of those new steps will be a change of the house of commons resolution concerning fair wages in government contracts <e> <s> in reading that and reading this new clause i believe we are on the brink of passing a clause which runs contrary to that resolution of the house of commons <e> <s> i do not say it does i do say it is a matter that we ought seriously to consider <e>", "<cs> i rise merely to make the point that noble lords who have spoken in favour of this amendment seem to be advocating the system of the national union of mineworkers which has led to the overwhelming election of mr arthur scargill <e> <s> i therefore suspect we are witnessing a left-wing infiltration into the conservative and social democratic parties <e>", "<cs> i am mildly but not enthusiastically in favour of this amendment <e> <s> during the course of discussion on several of the amendments that we have been dealing with there has been a great deal of demand for more democracy on the labour side of industry but i suspect that if we were able to put it to the test those who have been strongest in advocating more effective democracy among trade unions would not be in favour of more democracy on the capital side of industry <e> <s> at least this amendment takes us some way towards an achievement of better democracy on the capital side of industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that information may i ask whether he does not consider that britain has a special responsibility in helping to prepare namibia for independence particularly since english has been chosen as the official language and that there is every hope that an independent namibia will join the commonwealth <e> <s> that being so ought we not to be providing much more adequate facilities than were indicated in the answer <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that a number of universities have indicated that they would be prepared to provide suitable courses for educating namibians and will the government respond helpfully to the initiative taken in this matter by the world university service <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not absurd to continue to argue in percentage terms as the noble lord the <e>", "<cs> my lords while it is perhaps too much to hope that the government can be halted in their rush to privatise state-owned industry can we not on this occasion at least be spared the empty pretence that the government are promoting wider share ownership in privatised industry <e> <s> has the minister seen the evidence that was before the public accounts <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord lord rochester moved a similar new clause at committee stage i gave it my support but was unable to express myself in any terms of enthusiasm <e> <s> i noticed that the version which the noble lord has now moved includes some changes which he has explained but i must say that my enthusiasm is not greatly enhanced by the changes he has made <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it was right that my noble friend lord hatch should seek clarification from various quarters in the house of the attitude of different parties to the ballot <e> <s> he has achieved two-thirds of his objective in that we have had statements from the noble lord lord rochester and the minister who has just spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i cannot see the gesticulations of the social democratic party behind me but i should like briefly to remind the house of the purpose which my noble friend lord jacques and i sought to serve at the committee stage when we moved a similar though somewhat weaker amendment than that which is before the house now <e> <s> our purpose was to ensure that where closed shop arrangements had been satisfactorily operated over the years particularly in large and complex business organisations then those arrangements should not be easily disturbed unless there was sufficient evidence that there was opinion within the workforce in favour of a change <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate dealt with the point that i attempted to make that action is not sufficiently defined <e> <s> it might or it might not include action like working to rule where one group might be on strike and another group might be working to rule and they might be involved in a related but not exactly the same dispute <e> <s> it is the purpose of my amendment to make sure that that wider definition is incorporated in the bill <e> <s> however i heard what the noble and learned said about how in his view the present wording is wide enough for that purpose <e> <s> i wish to look at what he said more closely <e> <s> certainly i do not wish at this stage to press this particular amendment to a division and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble and learned lord will forgive me he will recall that it was at the committee stage that i raised this question of the resolution of the house of commons and indeed i read it out <e> <s> i believe he and i agreed that that was not outlawed by the provisions of what is now clause but i would be interested to know whether the noble and learned lord knew at that point that it was the intention of the secretary of state to ask the house of commons to rescind that resolution <e> <s> if he did know was not that an opportunity which he apparently missed to inform your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord aylestone and his colleagues in the social democratic party seem in this amendment as ever to be seeking the path of moderation and in general that is the path that i myself am willing to pursue but not at the expense of common sense <e> <s> it seems to me in looking at this amendment that it flies in the face of common sense in a number of respects <e> <s> in the first place it appears to be based on the belief that the rank-and-file membership of trade unions are more likely to be <e>", "<cs> my lords when i referred to common sense i had in mind the impracticability of this particular amendment and i think i gave a number of reasons why it is impracticable <e>", "<cs> my lords among the questions asked by my noble friend lord bishopston was one which referred to how much the stockbrokers would be paid <e> <s> in reply to that question the noble earl merely said that certain merchant bankers will be paid a fee for advice and that a firm of stockbrokers will also be paid a fee <e> <s> does the noble earl know what that fee is and if so should he not give it to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords in my judgment this report is one of the very few bright spots shining through the general gloom of the discussion on unemployment <e> <s> for that reason i believe that its authors the committee and particularly its chairman the noble baroness lady seear are to be congratulated for the constructive and hopeful report they have produced and which is in sharp contrast to the continual counsel of despair which is offered by the government <e> <s> speech after speech by ministers on this subject tell us that the unemployment problem is but part of the widespread world depression that there is little we can do about creating long-term jobs <e> <s> there is much they claim that they do in respect of what i would call palliatives but little they think that they or anyone can do about long-term jobs and they offer us the prospect of simply waiting for the upturn in the economy which we are constantly promised is around the corner <e>", "<cs> my lords if you have to million people unemployed their purchasing power is well below what it ought to be <e> <s> i am suggesting that that gap should be filled by the method which i have suggested <e> <s> i have suggested earlier that the weakness of the recommendations of lady seears wise report and of others is that they make no proposals to ensure their implementation <e> <s> on reflection i do not think that is a valid criticism <e> <s> it is not the committees job to ensure that <e> <s> that is the task of government <e> <s> it is a case of providing and generating the political will <e> <s> what we need is that political will expressed through a government <e> <s> it is the sadness of our present situation facing as the country does this great economic crisis that the government we have in power are not unfortunately the government which can generate that political will <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl would give way in using that expression i was quoting his noble friend lord carr of hadley <e>", "<cs> my lords i found myself in a great deal of agreement with the notable speech from the noble lord lord hill of luton to which we have just listened not only on the major questions of principle with which he dealt so effectively but on his horror which i share of modern electronic devices <e> <s> indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords further to that question on the lom convention will the government in making their contribution to these preparations bear in mind that there is a report of the select committee on the european communities of this house dealing with this question <e> <s> it includes the view that the provisions of the lom convention should be extended beyond their present acp coverage and in particular to include the indian sub-continent <e> <s> will the minister give the house the assurance that that view will be taken fully into account by the government in considering the contribution they will make to the preparations for lom iii <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the most meaningful way of measuring an aid programme that which expresses it in terms of gnp since that takes account of both inflation and ability to pay <e> <s> on that basis has there not been a decline in each year that the present government have been in office <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for his answer may i ask whether it is not the case that the minister representing her majestys government put forward a rather negative point of view when he suggested that we should not raise the expectations of the developing countries <e> <s> is it not the case that mr pisanis paper not only presents very clearly the deteriorating position of the poorest countries in the world but puts forward constructive proposals for extending the lom convention both in time indeed without a time limit and geographically <e> <s> that being so was not an opportunity missed to back up the commissions progressive views <e> <s> would it not have been much better if our minister and other government ministers had taken a much more positive line <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the important point the attitude which her majestys government are to take in the forthcoming discussions to which the minister has referred <e> <s> is it not the case that both under the leadership of monsieur cheysson who is now frances foreign affairs minister and under the present leadership of mr pisani the commission takes a much more forthright and progressive attitude towards aid and development matters than either this government or some other member governments <e> <s> ought not the government to take this opportunity to change their attitude and be more forward looking <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of the subcommittee which was chaired by the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we are grateful to the noble lord lord skelmersdale for the way in which he has introduced the bill <e> <s> he seemed to do so with rather more zest than did his colleague in another place because on that occasion mr marten said <e>", "<cs> my lords the way the minister has spoken in the last few sentences seemed to imply that i was critical of the possibility of the cdc operating in other than commonwealth countries <e> <s> i certainly was not and i said the opposite <e> <s> i approve of it <e> <s> i would not call it a split and i willingly accept responsibility for having introduced it <e>", "<cs> my lords while i agree with those who have said that the noble lord lord cockfield has acted perfectly responsibly and honourably in this matter is there not a procedural point upon which with hindsight he the noble lord lord cockfield might reflect <e> <s> when it occurred to him that because of his i acknowledge quite small shareholding he was unable to fulfil his ministerial duties under the fair trading act and decided therefore to pass these matters to his junior colleague ought he not at least to have come to this house to make a personal statement of his position <e> <s> this would not have been debatable but it would at least have been an expression of his responsibility in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that over the years ida funds have resulted in contracts to the united kingdom worth more than the actual financial contributions to those funds <e> <s> therefore is it not in this countrys interest and particularly in our trading interest that all contributions to ida should be paid promptly and in full <e> <s> although we welcome the ultimate decision of the government last year was it not the case that they delayed payment of part of the contribution because of the failure of the united states to meet its obligations <e> <s> will the minister assure the house that in future the government will continue what he calls taking the lead that is following the scandinavian countries who did pay promptly last year whereas we did not <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to thank the noble lord lord skelmersdale for explaining these three orders to the house and also for his description of the work that they are proposing to do <e> <s> in detail of course this type of order is very complex but in principle i think what we are considering is quite clear and acceptable <e>", "<cs> is my noble friend aware that in the cafeteria of another place today they were serving veal burgers <e> <s> is that an indication that the officer to whom he referred is not quite carrying out all he intended <e>", "<cs> i should like strongly to support my noble friend lord beswick in what he has had to say to your lordships <e> <s> he has expressed concern quite rightly that the work of the central council should in <e>", "<cs> my lords is not this centre one of that most valuable group of units attached to the overseas development administration of which for example the tropical products institute and the directorate of overseas surveys are others <e> <s> does not this group of <e>", "<cs> my lords only once before have i ventured to speak in a debate on defence in your lordships house <e> <s> this is because i can certainly claim no expert knowledge in this field but it occurs to me that in all political controversies there sometimes comes a point when an expression of the laymans anxieties and perhaps the laymans questions can be helpful perhaps even challenging to those who are experts on the subject and there are many in your lordships house who can make that claim <e> <s> the small boy who pointed out that the emperor had no clothes was no doubt no expert in imperial regalia but he had a point which the expert courtiers had missed <e> <s> it is in that spirit that i am venturing to raise some questions this evening about nato strategy <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say anything about assistance that may have been given by british voluntary aid organisations since in these matters they are often able to act more quickly than the official administrative machine <e> <s> is it the ministrys policy to work closely on such occasions with the voluntary agencies <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister recall that the prime minister recently met mr james grant the director of unicef and that she is reported to have expressed considerable enthusiasm for the work of unicef <e> <s> in view of the figures the noble lord has just given to the house indicating what seems to be a decline in real terms he was giving the figures in cash terms will he urge upon the prime minister that she should match her enthusiastic words with real improvement in action <e>", "<cs> but my lords surely the figure is in cash terms and in real terms it is a decrease <e>", "<cs> my lords as i read the committees report i came across a sentence in paragraph which i found most welcome <e> <s> referring to the commissions price proposals the report states that <e>", "<cs> yes my lords as a simple way of arriving at a figure i took the population because all people are consumers so even babies and people who are about to die are included in my figure <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can assure the noble lord lord mackie of benshie that they were counted too and they have a consumer interest as well as a producer interest <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of farmers incomes is an involved one as the noble lord knows only too well <e> <s> in thinking of it one needs to think of the support that the farming industry gets <e> <s> as the noble lord lord kearton was pointing out other industries could be profitable if they were as well treated as the farming industry is by the eec <e> <s> but i think it is well recognised that the farmers have not done too badly just recently and it is also the case and this was the burden of my central point that the farming industry of europe is producing surpluses and we are paying them to carry on on that erroneous road <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the minister for having set out in a written answer a few <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that a recent survey shows that british volunteers are at a disadvantage in respect of social security benefits by comparison with most other countries <e> <s> can the noble lord confirm that if volunteers pay employee-only contributions for a year that will now be recognised as a qualification for drawing unemployment and sickness benefit <e> <s> but even if that is so as i hope does it not still leave some half of volunteers unable to qualify because in the developing countries they are earning less than the minimum earnings limit <e>", "<cs> my lords does it not arise from the answer which the minister gave me that our volunteers are disadvantaged if they give good service for a very worthy cause and then come back and have to apply for supplementary benefit <e> <s> should not their benefit be better structured and will the minister look into the matter with some sympathy <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i have received from the library a closely-written six-page summary of professor gennnards report <e> <s> was that not available to the minister in preparing his answer to my question <e> <s> if i send him a copy will he not appreciate that the employers who responded to professor gennards inquiries showed by a majority that they saw more advantages than disadvantages in having closed shops because they provided improved industrial relations procedures for example by avoiding inter-union competition and increasing control over trade union membership <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord lord soames deserves our threefold congratulations first for choosing a subject which has become remarkably topical in the last few days in view of the events in brussels secondly for the power and lucidity of his speech but thirdly i think for providing the occasion for what we can confidently expect to be an equally valuable speech by my noble friend lord lever <e> <s> when the noble lord lord soames wondered whether the labour party is likely to adopt the common sense of my noble friend i wonder equally whether the government are likely to adopt the common sense of the noble lord lord soames <e> <s> we hope so and no doubt we shall see later in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord lord lyell give separate figures for exports of oil and manufactured goods <e> <s> if so do the figures for manufactured goods show as favourable a picture as the overall figures he gave in reply to the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords in regard to these matters will not the williamsburg conference be even more crucial than the unctad conference and will not all these questions of international economic policy be on the agenda at williamsburg <e> <s> can the minister say what will be the position about british representation at williamsburg if as now seems likely the conference coincides with a british general election <e>", "<cs> my lords when he introduced this bill the noble lord lord trefgarne was his usual clear and enthusiastic self but he did not go quite as far as the minister of industry in another place at third reading who characterised this bill as being the most important bill in this parliament <e> <s> i am inclined to agree with that description except that the minister there implied that it was the most important for the good that would flow from it whereas i believe it is important for us to consider it for the opposite reason that it will do considerable harm <e> <s> but in another place mr kenneth baker really let himself go when he spoke about the new arrangements for ownership in the industry <e> <s> he said that the bill would return proper ownership to the people and i notice that the noble lord lord trefgarne not only said this in his speech but is nodding approval of that phrase now <e> <s> i suggest to him that that is nothing but nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lords question arise out of the commissions decision in the anderson strathclyde case <e> <s> we recall that the noble lord the minister acted with complete honour in relation to his personal position in that case <e> <s> but will the minister now resist the suggestion of his noble friend as that suggestion was unwelcome within the department of trade that if you do not like the referees decision you think of changing the rules of the game <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl make clear what was the position taken by the minister of agriculture in respect of milk <e> <s> do i understand the position to be that he supported the proposal of the commission namely i believe an increase of per cent <e> <s> or did he advocate no increase a freeze <e> <s> when a few weeks ago we debated the matter i understood that the government were favouring a nil increase in those cases where surpluses were continuing to be produced and i am wondering whether the government have changed their attitude in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i only have time to thank all the speakers who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> i am glad that i used my good fortune in the ballot to introduce this subject because the speeches have shown that it is of great importance and of considerable interest in your lordships house <e> <s> from listening to all the speeches what has impressed me most has been the great variety of aspects of this <e>", "<cs> my lords is not one of the most important subjects on the agenda of unctad that concerning trade in commodities <e> <s> will the minister call to the attention of the minister for trade the excellent report which was produced by a committee of this house under the chairmanship of the noble lord lord roberthall which put forward a number of very practical proposals in this field <e> <s> will the noble lord have that report taken off the shelves where it no doubt is dusted down and given an airing at the belgrade conference <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the very wide-ranging scope of the opening speech by the noble earl lord cathcart he has perhaps consciously chosen by the terms of his motion a comparatively limited aspect of a much wider phenomenon in the post-war world namely the spread of communism <e> <s> the noble earls motion deals only with soviet penetration and <e>", "<cs> when the minister began his reply he gave two examples the office of fair trading and the civil aviation authority in which appointments had been made without consultation <e>", "<cs> i agree without formal consultation laid down in any statute <e> <s> i should like from my own experience to give a contrary example and it is a very small one <e> <s> my noble friend lord molloy referred to the organisation in this bill as being a mammoth <e> <s> the organisation to which i wish to refer is a minnow by comparison <e>", "<cs> in rising to support my noble friend who has moved the amendment i make only two points <e> <s> the first is that i am glad that he has made it quite clear that the addition of the words contained in his amendment applies to the phrase as to numbers just as much as to the phrase <e>", "<cs> when i spoke briefly in favour of this amendment i meant to ask a question <e> <s> i wonder whether i may ask it now and can the minister perhaps help me <e> <s> what is the governments estimate of the size of the oftel staff as at the moment <e> <s> i may have missed it in some debate or document or other <e> <s> i should be grateful to know that <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord the minister clear up the point raised by my noble friend lord ross of marnock <e> <s> as and when the advisory bodies come to be set up presumably they will be staffed by professionals <e> <s> i wonder whether they are included in the estimate of oftel staff or will they be additional <e> <s> that seems to me to be relevant to the matter we are now discussing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to follow the noble lord lord gisborough in this debate although i perfectly understand as he explained that he has immediately to leave <e> <s> however i say that because he and i had the opportunity just over a year ago as members of a parliamentary delegation to visit china <e> <s> indeed it is on that subject that i would like to say a few words this evening <e> <s> i choose that subject because i believe that in an increasingly dangerous world it may well he that the chinese nation will prove to he one of the most effective forces for the main-tenance of peace in the world and yet in our debates and today <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the right to vote a much more serious question than some of the questions and answers have implied today in view of the history of the struggle to get that right to vote <e> <s> if in any way the law is in doubt should not the government legislate to remove that doubt <e> <s> do not the acts perfectly describe certain other categories of people who are disqualified from voting and would it not be appropriate to so define those who sit on the bishops bench <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble baroness for that reply i would ask her whether it is not the case that the report to which she refers makes it clear that these institutes are under a threat of a cut in their resources <e> <s> will she bear in mind that over many years these institutes have been a very valuable british instrument in the fight against world hunger <e> <s> will she in the new position which she occupies even at this late hour try to ensure that that does not happen <e> <s> will she try to do something before the debate in this house on wednesday of next week which is to be introduced by the noble lord lord seebohm about world <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords have not leading members of the european parliament including the president mr dankert

community finance <e> <s> that being so was not the prime minister at least premature if not excessively propagandist in claiming after the stuttgart conference that she had gained there some modest triumph <e>", "<cs> my lords on the point of the end-of-year flexibility which i believe with the noble baroness lady seear to be perhaps the one feature of this statement which is to be welcomed

my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he will address himself to what i think was the last point made by the noble lord lord diamond which i do not think received an answer <e>

method can be applicable to the rebate agreed at the stuttgart meeting in respect of the draft budget <e> <s> therefore is it not doubly important that the governments resistance to that method of calculation be reinforced <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness recall the very serious loss of face that the government suffered over the earlier question of overseas students fees <e> <s> on that occasion the parsimonious attitude of the government led to a tremendous loss of goodwill overseas and to an upsurge of protest in this country from all parts of the political spectrum <e> <s> will the noble baroness assure us in more forthright terms than her answers have so far given that the government will take a much more positive attitude on the two reports to which the noble lord lord gladwyn has referred <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not important to recognise that to the chinese sovereignty over hong kong is at least as vital and as undoubted as sovereignty over the falklands is to britain <e> <s> can the minister say whether on the british side the negotiations are being conducted with that in mind and with that conceded <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the last sentence that he used in answer to the question <e>", "<cs> my lords at the commonwealth conference which her majesty the queen is about to open in new delhi are we not likely to be faced once again with third world members of the commonwealth highly critical of our declining aid programme <e> <s> would our influence in the commonwealth forum not be greatly improved if we took a more positive attitude to such questions as the undp <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord two questions <e> <s> first the original statement said that output had increased over the past year by per cent <e> <s> i imagine that to be the overall figure for output as a whole <e> <s> i wonder if that can be broken down and whether the noble lord can give the house the figure in respect of manufacturing industry <e> <s> has that gone up or has it gone down <e> <s> secondly in referring to these programmes for which expenditure will be reduced the statement used the phrase several other programmes <e> <s> can the noble lord say whether or not the overseas aid programme is among those other programmes for which reduction is anticipated <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much welcome this opportunity of supporting the noble lord lord teviot in his protest about this threat which overhangs the south downs which he and i know so well <e> <s> like him i should like to offer my congratulations to my noble friend lady nicol on her assumption of duties at the dispatch box and i wish her well not only this evening but in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords we understand that mr trudeau left the conference and went to peking in order to seek chinese help in bringing the two superpowers into a better state of relationship <e> <s> can the noble viscount say whether mr trudeau went so to speak as an envoy from the conference or whether he went to peking on his own initiative <e> <s> did mr trudeau return to the conference and report to his colleagues and if so to what effect <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that the prime minister has said that at the recent commonwealth conference she was asked to make a special personal effort to ensure an adequate replenishment of ida finances <e> <s> furthermore has not the prime minister agreed to send a message to president reagan as chancellor kohl of west germany has done urging that the united states should not reduce its contribution in the way that it has threatened <e> <s> can the minister say whether the prime minister has taken such action and with what effect <e> <s> may i further ask what action the british delegation will take at the meeting in washington on th january which i think will be the conclusive meeting on these matters to ensure that the gap is filled if the united states does what it has threatened to do <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a clear explanation of this order from the minister and i thank him for that <e> <s> we have also had clearance from the joint committee on statutory instruments and they find nothing in the order requiring our special attention <e> <s> following what we have heard from the minister <e> <s> i have no questions that i wish to put to him <e> <s> therefore it remains for me simply to indicate that we support this motion <e> <s> we understand the necessity for the order even though as the minister has explained it will have little significant effect in the united kingdom since the director and his staff are resident outside the united kingdom <e> <s> without further ado i would commend this order to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord vaizey tabled his unstarred question before the united states announced its intention to withdraw from unesco but that decision and the controversy that has arisen as a result of it i suggest makes the noble lords question this evening all the more significant and timely and i congratulate him at least on that aspect of his inquiries <e> <s> it is important in the light of the american decision that we should learn what the attitude of our own government is and therefore we look forward with more than usual interest to the reply at the end of the debate from the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a point that i accept <e> <s> it is a top-heavy organisation <e> <s> however in the opening sentences of the noble lords speech he did hint that he certainly approved of the activities of unesco in the <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister of state say whether in addition to the official aid which she has described anything has been forthcoming from the voluntary agencies such as christian aid bearing in mind the splendid record of their disasters committee which brings together the voluntary agencies for causes such as this <e> <s> have they been active <e> <s> i noted what the noble baroness said about the support to oxfam but i am wondering whether there has been a broader rallying of support in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the noble baroness for repeating the statement even though as she will not be surprised to learn major parts of it and particularly the threat of privatisation are most unwelcome to those of us on these benches <e> <s> does the noble baroness recall stating just a year ago that the crown agents were performing successfully their role <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if i may ask the noble baroness to clear up one rather general but i think important point <e> <s> she said that the immediate considerations were the reorganisation of the crown agents and then went on to say that it would be the timing and method of privatisation which would be settled in due course <e> <s> do we take it from this that there has been a firm decision to privatise <e> <s> we understand from what we have read that there has been considerable heart-searching within the government on this question <e> <s> do we take it that a firm decision has now been reached and that the crown agents are to be privatised <e> <s> and what is meant by in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that we on this side very much welcome two recent decisions by the government namely to remain in unesco and to seek to boost the funds of ida despite the nationalistic policies pursued by the united states and we regard the decisions of her majestys government as examples of pursuing internationalist policies <e> <s> but will she assure the house that she will use her influence in seeing that the government continue along this path of rectitude <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord are not overseas aid statistics a particular example of the problem to which the noble lord lord diamond has called the attention of the house <e> <s> for example in the recent information on overseas aid for figures are given for three years at current prices apparently without any allowance for the inflation factor <e> <s> since government spokesmen often claim generosity in this field is it not important to have a realistic rather than an inflated view of the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords since this is a publication issued by the overseas development administration about its work is it not important that the figures in this publication should also be correct in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords in pursuing the balance in these matters to which the noble baroness referred will the government recommend to her majesty that she should accept the invitation to visit israel as a balance to her visit to jordan <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if i missed this point through absence on other duties but can the minister say what effect if any the new arrangements about milk prices will have on the retail price of milk in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the speeches of my noble friend lord beswick and others have made a formidable case in support of the thesis of his motion namely that under current financial policies the wrong industrial and commercial activities are being encouraged and the wrong people are reaping the benefits <e> <s> it is about the last part of my noble friends motion that which deals with the third world that i would like to speak <e> <s> for it is in the third world that we see the most painful consequences of present policies and it is there that we see the most threatening signs of catastrophe the noble lord lord seebohm has just touched on the problem which i would like to deal with at a little more length <e>", "<cs> my lords while we can greatly appreciate the work that is being done in this matter by the overseas development administration and indeed by the voluntary agencies in the matter of relieving disasters is not the problem of the encroaching desert one that ought to be tackled on a long-term basis <e> <s> for example has not our own british experience with the gezira scheme some years ago and israels success in her agriculture proved that given the resources and the will man can conquer the desert <e> <s> is the minister satisfied that within our aid programme sufficient weight is given to the long-term consideration of this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords years ago during the course of the second world war sir william beveridge wrote a book which he called <e>", "<cs> my lords like others who have spoken in the debate i should like to thank the noble lord lord fanshawe of richmond for giving us this opportunity of having a debate to follow up the excellent debate which was held last week in another place <e> <s> already it has become apparent that in this house we have a number of noble lords with particular knowledge and experience of hong kong and therefore for me this has been a particularly welcome opportunity to hear them expound their views <e> <s> i hasten to add that i exclude myself from that category of peers specially knowledgeable on this subject <e> <s> we cannot of course expect the noble baroness lady young to add a great deal to what the foreign secretary said in his speech in another place last wednesday <e> <s> but we shall listen with particular interest to her comments on the notable speeches that we have heard <e>", "<cs> my lords when the minister uses the phrase lawful and acceptable in respect of the ancs activities can he explain to whom they should be lawful and acceptable <e> <s> who is to judge what is acceptable <e> <s> is the noble lord aware for instance that there is planned a mass demonstration by the anti-apartheid movement against mr bothas visit <e> <s> would it be acceptable for representatives of the anc to take part in that demonstration <e> <s> who is to judge <e>", "<cs> my lords can the leader of the house say whether before the invitation was issued to mr botha the government carried out consultations with our commonwealth partners <e> <s> if not was there not a considerable risk of damaging our relations with those partners <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say anything about the employment situation in the island <e> <s> what is the level and what are the prospects of jobs for the people there <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that answers in another place on this subject have revealed a certain complacency on the part of the government about this conference a complacency which todays answer has done only a little to correct <e> <s> can he tell the house at what level this country will be represented at the conference <e> <s> will it be at ministerial level or what other level <e> <s> since unchecked rises in population have the effect of negating much of the development work of aid agencies throughout the world is it not most important that this conference should have every possible success <e> <s> are the government playing their full part to ensure that success <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a privilege for me to serve under the chairmanship of my noble friend lord brimelow on the sub-committee that has produced this report <e> <s> if as a chairman he had a fault it was that he made the members of his sub-committee and the witnesses work most unusually hard <e> <s> but in doing so he certainly set a good example because he worked hard and he was always master of the particular aspect of the subject that we were examining in any particular session <e> <s> i am also glad to have this opportunity of joining at the dispatch box the debate he introduced so effectively <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will be grateful to the noble earl lord onslow for introducing this subject this evening and particularly for the obviously detailed consultations that he has had with the relevant bodies and the detailed information and criticism which he has put before your lordships this evening <e> <s> in view of the long and detailed examination of the act when it was a bill before your lordships house i think it is important that from time to time we should take an opportunity of this kind to review the working of the act <e> <s> my justification for intervening briefly in this debate this evening is that i am president of the society of sussex downsmen <e> <s> i am glad to see that my predecessor in that office the noble lord lord chelwood is also proposing to speak in this debate this evening from his much wider knowledge than mine <e> <s> for that reason i shall be anxious to hear what he has to say <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount the minister says that the government pay no special attention to a particular forecast but do they not at least take special notice of todays report of the oecd of which they are a member which casts very serious doubt on forecasts of economic upturn <e> <s> is it not about time that the government realised that their economic policies are failing to produce the upturn which we are so often promised <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that voluntary aid agencies play a most important part in relation to refugee problems and that therefore the announcement yesterday by the minister for overseas development of increased aid for voluntary aid agencies is very much to be welcomed <e> <s> when the noble baroness announced the pledges which the minister is making at geneva this week does that imply that he will be supporting the long-term development proposals which will be discussed at the conference in addition to the more immediate annual relief schemes that have been dealt with hitherto <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not clear from the events subsequent to th june which the noble lord has now reported upon that the people were arrested quite arbitrarily and without sufficient evidence against them <e> <s> therefore will he accept my appreciation that the government took action as i understand it during the period of five days i think when they were imprisoned <e>", "<cs> my lords this is clearly a desirable order since the organisation to which it gives legal powers is clearly a desirable organisation <e> <s> many a time in your lordships house i have called attention to the importance to third world countries of trade in raw and processed materials and increasingly it is important that these countries should not only export commodities in their raw state but process them before export and thus get the benefit of the added value <e> <s> it seems to me that this new international organisation is designed to help the third world countries in that regard <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware of the tremendous patient and diplomatic efforts that have been made by my right honourable friend mr stanley orme the spokesman for these matters in another place to bring the two sides together <e> <s> would it not have eased the situation considerably if a spokesman of her majestys government had joined in those efforts <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government at least give up the pretence that privatisation has as its purpose the democratic ownership of industrial shares <e> <s> i notice that in the original answer the noble earl did not include that among the advantages that the government now have in mind <e> <s> does not the experience for example of british aerospace of amersham international and others show that whereas small investors bought shares in the early days the vast bulk of them very soon sold out to big shareholders <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support my noble friend lord graham in his moving of the amendment and in drawing your lordships attention to the vital necessity for good training facilities for small co-operatives <e> <s> in a sense we are passing through a decade which parallels the early growth of the consumer co-operative movement more than a century ago <e> <s> those pioneers of the consumer cooperative movement wrote into their famous principles the rochdale principles the need for education <e> <s> what they had in mind in those days was education in the three rs <e> <s> when i say that we are in a parallel situation i am not suggesting that that kind of education and training is necessary in these later days <e> <s> what i am suggesting is a parallel that there are as my noble friend has illustrated growing up many small co-operatives of a different kind workers cooperatives which have grown very considerably over the past few years <e> <s> it is for them that a special kind of training and as my noble friend has pointed out special funds are needed in order that that training should be properly provided <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws the amendment i should like to encourage him to withdraw it but i want to make this point <e> <s> he has introduced this amendment specifically in relation to training but i would suggest that the illustration he gave of the need to bring together journalists and the like is not in the realm of training but in the realm of more general advocacy of co-operatives <e> <s> i would suggest that for such a purpose the original act the co-operative development agency act gives the agency full power to engage in that kind of activity indeed section <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may knock on the door about which we have heard in support of the amendment that my noble friend has moved <e> <s> i support the concept contained within the amendment of a co-operative development fund <e> <s> after all in clause the government are giving an important new responsibility to the agency a responsibility to make grants and loans which it did not have under the original act <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for repeating that answer to the private notice question in another place <e> <s> while i welcome the steps that her majestys government are taking to help relieve the situation in ethiopia which the noble lord has reported may i ask him whether it is not the case that the drought in africa and in particular in ethiopia has now reached dimensions well beyond the scope of the usual relief measures whereas i believe that what the minister has announced can be characterised as being in the normal way of relief <e> <s> is it not a major tragedy that europe is embarrassed by food mountains and bumper harvests while many thousands are dying in africa especially in ethiopia <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords do not the latest figures show a still further decline in the provision of aid as a percentage of gnp and has not that proportion declined while this government have been in office from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> are we not year by year going in the wrong direction <e> <s> is not this a shameful situation in contrast to the european countries most of which have a very much better record than we have <e> <s> in the cases of france and the scandinavian countries they have already attained the un target <e> <s> should we not be reversing the situation and going upwards rather than downwards <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to the question that was asked by the noble lord lord bauer and the answer which the minister gave to him is it not perfectly reasonable that the united nations and unctad should use a percentage of the gnp as the proper yardstick for measuring a countrys performance in these matters <e> <s> is not the gnp the measure of the resources that are available to which the minister referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister realise what a splendid speech it was that he delivered to the conference <e> <s> i suspect that he does <e> <s> does he appreciate that not the least welcome feature of his speech was the announcement that he has repeated today of further funds for population programmes including those for international agencies engaged in this work <e> <s> can the minister either now or if i put down a question for written answer say in more detail what plans the government now have for implementing the revised world population plan of action which the conference endorsed <e>", "<cs> my lord i should first like to thank the noble lord for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> on behalf of my noble friends i wish to express satisfaction that arrangements have now been made for providing air transport to help with this rescue operation in ethiopia <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with fascination to the speech which we have just been privileged to hear and i particularly welcomed the words which the noble lord lord lindsay spoke about china <e> <s> i have often been quite astonished in your lordships house and indeed elsewhere that we can talk about defence international affairs the middle east latin america and east-west relations but there is never a mention of china never a mention of a quarter of the worlds population <e> <s> therefore i warmly welcome what the noble lord has said about the significance of changes that are going on in china <e> <s> in recent years i have made two visits to china and i have some understanding of what those changes mean and i have in your lordships house on an earlier occasion explained why i believe that china is a most important factor in the world community <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the deadline for signature of the treaty th december <e> <s> can the noble lord give us any hope that the undertakings that he is seeking will be received before th december <e>", "<cs> my lords my congratulations to the noble lord lord walston go well beyond the usual courtesies on these occasions because i admire very much the drafting of his unstarred question <e> <s> it is rare in my experience to have a question such as this which in the compass of two lines of print gets right to the heart of a very complicated problem <e> <s> i would invite your lordships just briefly to look in turn at the main elements of the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> that will be unusual <e> <s> i do not doubt that on previous occasions the noble lord has called our attention and that on future occasions he will call our attention to what the overseas development administration is doing in the poorest countries in particular what the oda is doing for the agricultural sector of developing countries and what it is doing to develop various natural resources <e> <s> if one reads the report one cannot but welcome the splendid work which is being carried on by the oda <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not realise that however she presents these figures she cannot avoid the fact that year by year under a labour government the aid programme increased whereas year by year under this government the aid programme has decreased <e> <s> is she aware that we face a further reduction in real terms in the coming year <e> <s> will she therefore admit to the house that all the efforts of the charities to which the noble lord lord hunt has referred in collecting funds from a generous british public over the last year are to be cancelled out by a cut in the real value of official aid <e>", "<cs> my lords as others have said the importance of this debate is reflected and emphasised by the experience and variety of the speakers who have taken part in it including perhaps most notably in the noble lord lord maclehose a former governor of hong kong and if he will allow me to say so in the noble lord lord lindsay of birker one who told us in a recent debate that he fought with the chinese communists against the japanese <e> <s> indeed in this house we manage to gather together a variety of experience for debates such as this <e> <s> but our debate was certainly enhanced by the excellent maiden speech that we heard from the noble earl lord birkenhead <e> <s> i listened to it with really warm appreciation and i echo those who have said that we look forward to hearing him on other occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness for repeating the answer given to the private notice question in another place and for the information she has given about the aid that the government are now providing <e> <s> but no doubt she has seen the graphic description in <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that whereas after privatisation the shareholding among employees and others is widespread soon afterwards those shares pass into the hands of bigger shareholders <e> <s> secondly is it not the case that ownership is not enough but the influence that the employees and others can bring to bear on policy is much more important <e> <s> will the government therefore ensure not only wider share ownership but the ability of shareholders to exercise influence on policy <e>", "<cs> my lords if on one day a government are reluctant to approve the action of banks in raising their interest rate by per cent <e> <s> and then on the next day they order the banks to raise their interest rates by a further per cent <e> <s> can that situation fairly be called a u-turn <e> <s> did the minister at lunchtime see the interview with sir john hoskyns a close adviser and <e>", "<cs> my lords when the minister says that britain is close to other european donors does she not mean that we are close to those who are at the bottom <e> <s> do not the figures from the development assistance committee of oecd reveal that whereas during the s we were well placed compared with other european donors last year we were bottom <e> <s> it may be that we have crept just above italy but we are very much at the bottom of the league table <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not one of the major and perhaps most justifiable criticisms of unesco that as the noble lord lord orr-ewing has just said it is top-heavy and a preponderance of its expenditure is on its headquarters in paris <e> <s> on the other hand is it not the case that the scientific programmes to which the question on the order paper refers include a large number of very useful projects in the field <e> <s> therefore would it not be a tragedy if that work in the field rather than in paris was brought to an end <e> <s> can the minister assure the house that in the remaining months of this year the government will give careful reconsideration to their announcement of withdrawal from unesco and instead of meekly following the americans in this matter will make every effort to ensure the continuance of the good parts of the work of unesco <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is not that amount only an indirect support of the world banks fund <e> <s> are not the government being parsimonious in relation to this special fund <e> <s> do we not compare most unfavourably with the contributions that are forthcoming from france germany italy japan and from others <e> <s> are we not very laggard in our international responsibilities in this matter <e> <s> moreover is it not the case that the sum to which the noble baroness refers is not new money being brought froward for this purpose but comes within the normal budget of the overseas development administration <e> <s> in view of the terrible situation in sub-saharan africa ought we not to be more generous just as the british people have proved to be generous in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition to the example that my noble friend lord hatch gave is there not another most important example of multilateral aid leading to benefit for british exporters namely the international development association <e> <s> do we not get more than a pound for pound advantage from our contributions to that fund <e> <s> on the other hand is not the tying of aid sometimes prejudicial to the achievement of desirable results <e> <s> for example is it not desirable to untie the million which the noble baroness told me the other day is being allocated to support the special africa fund <e> <s> can the minister say whether any decision has yet been made to untie that element of aid <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the main lesson we should draw from the current famine in africa that we should do all that we can to help the african countries develop their own agriculture in order to prevent famine in the future <e> <s> that being so is not ifad in contrast to what the noble lord lord bauer has said one of the most cost-effective organisations for achieving just that purpose <e> <s> will the minister accept our commendation of his reply to the noble lord lord bauer <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much agree with the noble viscount lord falkland that we have had an excellent debate and we are grateful to my noble friend lord hatch for putting down in the first instance a most excellently worded motion and for his very fine comprehensive speech <e> <s> we all appreciated the maiden speech of the noble lord lord grenfell <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords the question which has been asked by the noble lord lord thomas of swynnerton refers to policies relating to development aid since with i think the implication that the basis of those policies has been the same whether the government in power have been that of the conservative party or of the labour party <e> <s> i believe that that is perhaps basically true but i would remind your lordships that there are nevertheless between the two parties important differences of which we need to remind ourselves but which we certainly need not detail at this hour this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords the importance of the unstarred question that the noble lord lord bethell has asked this evening rests not only on the significance of the helsinki final act itself but as i think he suggested on the inter-relation of the helsinki process and the nuclear disarmament talks and on east-west relations in general <e> <s> therefore if we can through the proceedings at ottawa make more of a success than we have been able to achieve hitherto in the implementation of those solemn undertakings which were entered into years ago that will not only be a real step forward in its own right but i suggest it would help if only in a small way to create an east-west atmosphere more favourable for the success of the geneva talks themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a considerable danger that these masts unless very carefully sited will be a considerable blemish on the countryside <e> <s> if that is so will the minister consider the need to draw up a code of practice for the siting of the masts <e>", "<cs> my lords in the course of the authoritative speech of the noble lord lord home of the hirsel there was one important phrase which i regard as perhaps a basic phrase in his motion to which he gave much less attention than i should have wished <e> <s> i call attention to the phrase about <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister confirm the statement of certain chairmen of football clubs that money derived from racing can be ploughed back into racing stands but that is not the case with football <e> <s> is there not a case for an inquiry not just into what occurred at bradford but into the whole question of finance <e> <s> it is no use the inquiry coming out with suggestions about what should be done to increase safety if as my noble friend behind me has said there is no possibility of the clubs in their present financial situation being able to implement those recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords have any special precautions been taken to avoid the necessity of calling in the fraud squad as in the case of british telecom <e>", "<cs> my lords since the prime minister in her speech to the scottish conservatives the other day made much of the value of wider share ownership are the government monitoring the extent to which when shares are taken up by small investors in the early days of a particular privatisation they seem quickly to get into the hands of large investors <e> <s> was this the reason why in the case of british telecom there had to be an in-built incentive for investors to hold their shares for a prescribed period of years <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many of us on this side of the house recall that it was indeed the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter who introduced the bill in and that we also recall that what he introduced was a very bad bargain indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords does that government position include a refusal to support the united states embargo on trade with nicaragua <e>", "<cs> my lords was not our aid to ethiopia kept within the confines of the contingency reserves of the overseas development administration <e> <s> will not the famine in the sudan according to the experts be considerably more serious even than that in ethiopia <e> <s> if so will the government this time make funds available beyond the normal budget of the oda <e>", "<cs> my lords are not the results of the drought in africa far more serious than the normal tragedies for which the contingency reserves are budgeted <e> <s> is this not something that needs to be dealt with on a larger scale than normal budgeting <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house the date of the last allocation of aid to nicaragua <e> <s> what negotiations have taken place for further aid since that date and with what result <e> <s> if the minister does not have that information available this morning will he be good enough to write to me with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully share the concern expressed by the noble lord lord taylor and the minister about the policies of the ethiopian government <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether she agrees with me that the paramount objective should be getting food through to the starving peasants <e> <s> does she agree that the government and the voluntary agencies must continue to do all they can to achieve that objective even if there is some expense in overcoming the administrative and fiscal barriers erected by the ethiopian government <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the reason why there is a hold-up in this replenishment the refusal of the united states government to bring forward their contribution <e> <s> is it not the case that in recent years the united states government have been displaying a particularly negative attitude to international aid agencies <e> <s> i instance the international development association unesco and the world banks special fund for africa <e> <s> is there any reason why united kingdom action in these matters should be tied to decisions by the united states <e> <s> can we not take a more robust stance in this respect and be independent of american decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friends i can certainly welcome this third lom convention which the noble baroness has outlined to us <e> <s> it is not that we believe it to be a perfect arrangement but it continues for a further period of five years a unique contractual arrangement concerning aid and trade between two very different groups of states one of which has well developed and comparatively rich economies and the other of which has newly developing and comparatively poor economies <e> <s> that i think is its distinctive feature as indeed it was the feature of lom i and lom ii <e> <s> those two arrangements have proved to be sufficiently successful for it to be wholly desirable that this third agreement should be reached and ratified so as to build upon the achievements of those earlier agreements <e> <s> but at the same time they were in some respects disappointing <e> <s> there have been defects which have been analysed and that made it important that this new convention should embody some important improvements <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness explain more fully the proposed status of this secretariat <e> <s> for example would it speak collectively for the ec in other international forums perhaps for example on such a subject as sanctions against south africa or is it merely a co-ordinating mechanism that is in the proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the chilean governments record on human rights which was already deplorable before the declaration of the state of siege last november becoming very much worse including murders by death squads <e> <s> therefore is it not quite wrong for us to supply arms of any kind to such a regime <e> <s> how is it possible to differentiate those arms which are ostensibly supplied for external defence but which in fact are used for internal repression <e>", "<cs> my lords when the minister says that the british attitude at that committee meeting was reflected in the statement issued afterwards does that include agreement by the british delegation with the opinion that full and adequate compensation should be paid by south africa to botswana for the damage to life and property <e> <s> may i ask the minister what action the government have taken to ensure that that compensation is being paid <e>", "<cs> my lords in recent years has not one of the most encouraging features in respect of small businesses been the growth of small co-operatives owned and controlled by their members <e> <s> whereas some five or six years ago they numbered perhaps they now number with some worker members <e> <s> however has not that expansion taken place despite certain special handicaps which co-operatives suffer such as the number of members required for registration under the industrial and provident societies act <e> <s> there are also certain <e>", "<cs> i should like just briefly to support the noble lord lord grimond the more so since when some years ago i was chairman of the co-operative development agency he was very helpful with the work of that agency on a number of occasions <e> <s> i rise merely to point out to your lordships that cooperative ownership of transport undertakings is a perfectly feasible and viable proposition <e> <s> perhaps i <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness for repeating the statement which was made in another place <e> <s> we on these benches very much welcome the decision to continue the hercules <e>", "<cs> my lords are there not some serious social and economic problems that were once seen as being almost exclusively the concern of third world countries but which are now developing into problems for the developed world as well <e> <s> is not the problem of homelessness a very good example of this common concern between the developed world and the developing world what the brandt commission called our common crisis <e> <s> if that is so when the government are making plans for with the overseas development administration understandably taking the lead on behalf of the government is it not important that it should have the support of other ministries particularly i would have thought the department of the environment so that the problems of homelessness in this country get due attention during that year <e>", "<cs> my lords if the purpose of the original question was to prove that the soviet union is cynical self-seeking and ungenerous in its attitude to developing countries is that not something that is well known has been very much on the record for some years and applies as much to ethiopia as to the third world in general <e> <s> however if the purpose of the question was to seek to prove how generous our government and the united states government have been why compare them with the soviet union which has such a drastically poor record in this matter <e> <s> would the noble lord not be well advised to study the report of the all-party foreign affairs committee on famine in africa which was highly critical of the degree of support that the government have given <e>", "<cs> my lords has not mr bob geldof struck up a partnership with usaid in this matter and was there not an opportunity that possibly our government missed in offering help in the distribution of the funds that he and his colleagues have raised <e> <s> did we miss an opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords has not one of the major messages coming out of africa these last months been that for too long agriculture in that continent has been neglected by the major donors <e> <s> despite what the noble lord lord bauer has said is it not the case that ifad is one of the most effective means of channelling aid to the small peasants of africa and indeed of other continents <e> <s> should we therefore not take a positive attitude towards this fund <e> <s> would not those many hundreds of thousands of people who are voluntarily contributing to help the situation in africa be very disturbed if they knew that the major donor governments were playing a game of after you claud after you cecil and not making a move because the others will not <e>", "<cs> my lords since her majestys government and indeed previous labour governments have such a good record in support of family planning programmes including support for the unfpa and the ippf i am glad to hear the noble baroness say that she included a reference to this subject in her opening statement she made the point in response to the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> can she indicate whether that subject was taken up very fully in the conference and if so what the attitude to it was <e> <s> was the controversy which has arisen recently in the united states reflected in the proceedings of the conference <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a serious anomaly in having the aid and trade provision within the oda <e> <s> has not the oda declared that its policy is to help the poorest nations whereas the list of countries which the noble baroness read out in answer to the first supplementary question is a list of countries of the middle income bracket <e> <s> while i can accept that there is a lot to be said for having an aid and trade provision particularly because our competitors exercise that kind of procedure should we not make it clear that the provision is there for the promotion of our exports and not primarily for the development needs of the developing countries <e> <s> would this not be made clear if the suggestion of the noble lord lord beaumont was carried out and the administration was transferred to the department of trade and industry <e>", "<cs> my lords this report is not a dramatic report still less the revolutionary report to which the noble baroness pointed in her opening sentences <e> <s> indeed it would not be so good or so useful a report if the sub-committee had tried to make it dramatic and had tried to catch the headlines by putting forward radical proposals <e> <s> i very much agree with its somewhat cautious but nevertheless very constructive approach <e> <s> like other noble lords i congratulate the noble lord lord kearton both on the achievement of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i join most readily and most warmly with those who have thanked the most reverend primate for introducing this subject and giving us the opportunity to review the work of the united nations over years <e> <s> during the review that we have had in this debate it is understandable that the main theme of most speeches has been the role of the united nations in the prevention of war <e> <s> but while acknowledging that that is the main purpose set before the united nations most speakers have also drawn attention to other equally important functions particularly those in the economic and social spheres <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a twofold lesson to be learned from the chaotic situation that has developed <e> <s> should not the prices set under the commodity agreement have been gradually and in a planned way reduced in line with the decline in the demand for tin <e> <s> should not that have been combined with an adequate compensatory financial backing for the third world producers of tin <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble baroness for introducing the bill in such a clear way and for explaining it to us <e> <s> as she has said it is a short technical bill and so far as we on this side of the house are concerned it is a welcome and uncontroversial bill <e> <s> but it gives us an opportunity to comment upon the work of the corporation and i was glad that the noble baroness took advantage of that opportunity to describe some of the work that cdc does <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the amendment which was moved by the right reverend prelate and indeed to congratulate him on the wise and moderate formulation of his amendment <e> <s> as we have seen in this debate this issue of shopping hours produces a vast complexity of opinions and interests and it seemed to me when i saw the right reverend prelates amendment on the order paper that he had produced a wording which can unite the maximum of your lordships who perhaps for quite different reasons can all agree that this bill goes too far <e>", "<cs> my lords do not the dac figures to which the noble baroness referred show that britain is very much the worst performer in aid terms in comparison with all the other members of the oecd <e> <s> for instance italy has a positive record over the last six years of some per cent <e> <s> france per cent <e> <s> and germany per cent <e> <s> whereas our performance has been negative <e> <s> we have been declining whereas they have been impressively increasing their aid programmes <e>", "<cs> my lords it is appreciated that the noble baroness is repeating a statement that has been made in another place and i thank her for doing so <e> <s> but is it not a sad and disgraceful announcement that she has had to put before your lordships <e> <s> should we not remember that unesco was the result of pioneering efforts in this country under the leadership of sir julian huxley and should we not remember the long line of distinguished british public servants who have served unesco over the years and brought great credit to this country in that organisation <e> <s> is it not sad indeed that their work should have had the unhappy outcome announced today <e>", "<cs> my lords it is understandable that the noble earl lord kimberley should wish to call attention to the situation in southern africa because obviously it is among the most dangerous if not the most dangerous region in the dangerous world in which we live <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be that many firms conform with that code but the code is pretty miserable anyway and there are plenty of firms that do not conform with it <e> <s> i do not think the noble lord would suggest that the general lot of the black population in south africa is a happy one or is as it should be <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps at the outset i should declare a special interest in this report <e> <s> certainly it is not a financial interest but i am privileged to be the chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on overseas development which initiated the study which led to this report <e> <s> in view of what my noble friend lord hatch said earlier i feel a little tempted to enter into a discussion with him about the value of all-party work but i only point out to him that in addition to this report which i think he acknowledges is a very valuable contribution to the study of the problem of africa we have had a whole series of meetings over the past year in which we brought distinguished speakers to considerable and influential audiences upstairs which have increased the understanding of the very problems to which my noble friend lord hatch called attention <e>", "<cs> in view of the cordial nature of the exchanges on the previous bill i am glad that there is nothing in this amendment that causes me to detract from the atmosphere then generated <e> <s> it is as the noble baroness has explained a technical matter <e> <s> i assure her that it is completely non-controversial so far as this side of the committee is concerned <e> <s> i thank the noble baroness for explaining the matter so clearly <e> <s> it is <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say what is the level of the aid programme which she says will now be maintained <e> <s> can she say whether contingency funds will be available either to meet the sort of expense that the airlift proposed by the noble lord lord walston would entail or for long-term rehabilitation of the economy if it suffers from the present action of the south african government <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to my noble friend lord jacques for raising this subject and for doing so in that crisp no nonsense style with which we are familiar and which we appreciate so much from him <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord understand from his noble friend who asked this question that the word strong in that question meant a strong multi-fibre arrangement on behalf of our textile industry <e> <s> indeed that was implied was it not in the supplementary question by the noble viscount <e> <s> but would the noble lord appreciate that there is another partner in this matter as indicated by the noble baroness lady seear that is the developing countries who also need strong support <e> <s> will the noble lord recognise that as to the use of the word effective in his original answer and of the word balance in subsequent answers these are words which are welcome to those of us who are concerned with the welfare of the developing countries <e>", "<cs> the minister has explained why eighteen is in the bill because that is the age which applies to employment in other categories of commerce and industry <e> <s> he has also agreed with my interpretation of what mr tom king said that the wages councils bill will provide wages council protection for those aged upwards <e> <s> but for the gap in between those aged or i find his answer most unsatisfactory <e> <s> as i said in my opening remarks it is leaving them without the statutory protection of either wages councils or the similar provisions in the act <e> <s> they will be completely without protection other than their trade union membership <e> <s> as i have explained and as the auld committee makes very clear that is a most difficult piece of organisation to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recognise in the generally dismal record of recent years on inner cities that there has been one small but encouraging development namely the increase in the number of small co-operative businesses <e> <s> i have in mind housing co-operative societies and small producer co-operatives in the service sector which have grown in number from some five years ago to now employing in new jobs some members of these co-operative societies in a distinct form of self-employment <e>", "<cs> my lords both at second reading and in moving an amendment at committee stage i drew attention to a very serious gap which is being opened up by this bill and it has again been explained by the noble lord lord rochester <e> <s> below the th birthday of a shopworker he will continue to have the protection at present afforded by the act <e> <s> after his st birthday he will receive the protection of a wages council <e> <s> however that wages council will be a very much weaker body than the present wages council <e> <s> in between the th birthday and the st birthday a retail worker will have no statutory protection at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would give way <e> <s> before he leaves his explanation of amendment no <e> <s> will he please explain what is to me a particularly difficult phrase <e> <s> it says that part ii of schedule will be one of the provisions which will be suspended for two years <e> <s> but if we turn to schedule we find no part ii there or indeed any other part <e> <s> it it simply the schedule which repeals certain parts of acts <e> <s> there must be an error here <e> <s> can the minister explain <e>", "<cs> my lords having raised the difficulty may i say that i am much more puzzled now <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly join with other speakers who have complimented my noble friend lord rhodes on his initiative in respect of this debate and indeed on the many other initiatives which he has taken over the years towards improving chinese-british relations <e> <s> he has done a great work and we are glad to join him in this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the continuing tension in cyprus and in view of the visit of the turkish prime minister which is impending is not the question by the noble lord particularly timely at this point <e> <s> will the noble baroness notice that in the question by the noble lord there is the suggestion of involving the commonwealth in the seeking of a solution <e> <s> will she take particular note of that and always make sure not only in relation to cyprus but in relation to other difficult areas that our commonwealth partners are drawn in in a helpful way <e>", "<cs> my lords did i understand the minister in a supplementary answer to say that for a period the figures will be given in parallel that is in two series so that it will be possible for a period to make comparisons of the new figures with the old <e> <s> that sort of thing i recall is done for instance in relation to cost of living indices <e> <s> did i understand the minister to say that that is being done <e> <s> if so when the figures are announced month by month will we have equal publiciity given to the number of unemployed on the new list as well as on the old list <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not suprising that the noble lord was unable to give a population figure for a london borough <e> <s> will he not try again more successfully so as to give my noble friend lord stallard a fuller answer than he was able to give him in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the first answer of the noble baroness indicate that there is considerable linking between the provision of aid to tanzania and their performance in relation to imf proposals <e> <s> is it not wrong that we should be appearing to administer our aid programme almost as the agents of the imf because has not that organisation already imposed deflation on quite a number of economies in the third world and thereby substantially contributed to the global slump <e>", "<cs> my lords we must all recognise the many competing claims on the all too limited resources of the overseas development administration but has not the noble earl called attention to one of the most urgent problems in developing countries <e> <s> for instance do not peasants in many parts of africa face a great dearth of wood fuel for cooking <e> <s> is not the problem of soil erosion closely connected with the rapid deforestation that is going on in many parts of the world <e> <s> with these problems in mind will not the overseas development administration put more capital resources into this rather than just the pound-for-pound support of a voluntary agency <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who earlier had some responsibility for the aid programme may i thank the noble baroness the minister for assuring my two noble friends on my left or right that the overseas development administration in my day and i am glad to hear in her day has a very good record in ensuring that the aid that is provided is well spent and well monitored <e> <s> but is not this a reason why we should now make rapid progress towards fulfilling our undertaking regarding the united nations per cent <e> <s> target <e>", "<cs> my lords whenever the noble lord lord chitnis speaks in this house he does so on the basis of expert knowledge and sincere dedication to the causes that he espouses and never more so than on this occasion when he has raised the question of the vietnamese refugees <e> <s> the noble lord has raised this subject in his capacity as chairman of refugee action following as he has explained an intensive study of the problem on the spot a few weeks ago <e> <s> my own knowledge of the problem is not a direct one <e> <s> it is derived from my reading of the report of the home affairs committee of another place the governments reply to that report and most useful of all the report of the delegation that the noble lord led to hong kong <e> <s> it is indeed a formidable document <e>", "<cs> my lords we can all welcome the support given from official funds to voluntary agencies because as the noble baroness has said they disburse the funds directly to the people who need them more quickly sometimes than official projects can get under way <e> <s> may i ask the noble baroness how much of the funding that she has announced is under the pound-for-pound scheme which recognises in a practical way that the voluntary agencies do a great deal of fund raising themselves <e> <s> this was true particularly during the course of the past year <e>", "<cs> i anticipated and was therefore not surprised to hear the main argument which the minister has put forward against my amendment namely that the four considerations standing in the clause at the moment are under the direct control of the british government whereas the consideration that i have put forward was different in that the british government were only one authority among many that would have to take policy decisions in the international sphere <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the important aspect of ifad that of all the international organisations it is the one which specialises in aid to agriculture and indeed that per cent <e> <s> of its funds go in that direction <e> <s> is it not therefore an outstanding channel for dealing with the famine conditions in africa making sure that agriculture there is supported <e> <s> is it not also the case that this admirable organisation has very small funds <e> <s> can the government not therefore reconsider their attitude to this special appeal for extra money <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister saying that the money which was requested for this special fund will be extra money on the bilateral programme <e>", "<cs> i am prompted to speak briefly on the basis of several of the remarks that the minister has made in dealing with some of the amendments <e> <s> i was delighted to hear the minister in dealing with amendment no <e> <s> take as an illustration the south downs as a possible designated area <e> <s> my delight arises from the fact that i have the privilege of being the president of the society of sussex downsmen <e> <s> the fact that the south downs came so readily to the ministers mind encourages me to think that this area is possibly not only on the short list about which we know but perhaps even on a shorter list <e> <s> i hope that this is so <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side can readily support the noble baroness in this amendment <e> <s> looked at the report of the short debate in another place and i noticed that the honourable member who moved this amendment claimed nothing more for it than that it would have a humble and limited effect <e> <s> i think that is very true <e> <s> it is in fact a useful addition to the bill <e> <s> as the minister explained there is a close working relationship between the oda and the cdc and it is clear that if the minister was wanting to make a grant to the cdc he would in any case have consultations with that body <e> <s> there is certainly no objection to making it a statutory requirement that he should have such consultation and therefore i support the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness accept that we on this side very much welcomed what the minister for overseas development said in relation to food aid particularly when he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness for explaining the bill to us <e> <s> as to its central purpose there is nothing of a controversial nature i think between the two sides of the house <e> <s> i notice that in another place when they reached the committee stage they started at in the morning and finished one minute later <e> <s> i rather anticipate that when we reach the further stages in this house we can perhaps be even more expeditious <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the recent devaluation of the chinese currency an indication that china is anxious to increase its exports and to conserve its resources of hard currencies <e> <s> that being so should not our exporters seek to concentrate on capital goods such as those indicated by the question of the noble lord lord tordoff that is goods which enable the chinese to develop their economy and earn the hard currency that they are so anxious to have <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say what money is involved in the provision of the survey <e>", "<cs> then my lords can that initiative not be described in the same way that the prime minister described her concessions about sanctions at nassau namely is it not teeny weeny <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness recognise that the overall aid statistics such as those that the noble lord has asked for can be somewhat meaningless unless they are broken down to reveal the nature of the aid <e> <s> therefore we welcome the additional information she gave to a supplementary question about aid to agriculture in africa <e> <s> in the light of the recent history of famine and the need to prevent future famine emphasis on aid to agriculture is of greater importance <e> <s> can she assure the house that it is her majestys governments policy to increase the proportion of aid that goes to agriculture <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to join with others who have spoken in this debate in complimenting my noble friend lady lockwood not only on the nature and purpose of her unstarred question and indeed on the speech with which she introduced it but also on her perseverance in bringing this important matter to your lordships attention <e> <s> your lordships will recall that she tried to do so last june when she first tabled this question but unfortunately at that time she was a casualty of a very congested timetable in your lordships house <e> <s> it is still congested but at least we seem to have come to discuss this question at a more reasonable hour than was possible when my noble friend first raised the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords on previous occasions when i have taken part in foreign affairs and defence debates arising out of the gracious speech i have dealt always from the back benches almost entirely with the problems of the third world much as today the noble lord lord walston and indeed the right reverend prelate the bishop of leicester were speaking <e> <s> on those occasions i have stated my belief that the conquest of poverty is the only foundation for a lasting peace in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that correction but i am sure that he was instrumental in getting money from both quarters <e> <s> of course the matter of the queens visit to china was mentioned in the gracious speech and the noble baroness lady young referred to it in her introductory speech <e> <s> but she seemed to concentrate only on the trade aspects of our relations with china <e> <s> this seems to me to be an unwarranted limitation <e> <s> my noble friend lord rhodes said in agreeing i think with what i have just said about it not being just trade that matters that friendship is what he asks for friendship with china <e> <s> yes indeed <e> <s> i myself have been some three times in recent years to china <e> <s> i remember that when i was in chungking i sent a card to my noble friend lord rhodes because of his leading role in these matters <e> <s> when i got back he said thank you for your card <e> <s> i was there in chungking when you sent it which shows that we are both diligent watchers of china <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to come to that question later in my speech if the noble lord will exercise patience in the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord cledwyn adequately answered the noble viscount on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i would welcome the noble lord lord kennet explaining how nuclear weapons in that situation could be used defensively because in my view if they were used in that situation the victims of that dropping of the bomb would be our own forces we would kill our own people <e> <s> surely the lesson from chernobyl a much less tremendous explosion but <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well he but i think that we have had sufficient exchange on this point and i rest on what i said earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with care this afternoon to the opening sentences of the noble lord lord mayhew <e> <s> i regretted that i was not able to hear all of his speech but i heard him say that the alliance policy includes persuading nato to adopt a position of less reliance on nuclear weapons <e> <s> i share that view that we aim to reduce natos strategy as being a nuclear strategy <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord would look at his notes again <e> <s> that is what he said in relation to the alliance policy and i said that i agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords when a long-term unemployed person has been through the restart process then fails to get a job and returns to the register is that person no longer regarded in the category of long-term unemployed <e> <s> to what extent is that a factor in the announcement of the reduction in the long-term unemployed to which the minister referred <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will recall that when my noble and learned friend moved his amendment at committee stage he indicated that three boroughs were particularly affected by the formula namely newham brighton and gateshead <e> <s> my noble and learned friend particularly pointed to brighton because he is a resident there <e> <s> i am too and i share his concern for brightons welfare <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for offering to write to me <e> <s> will he be able to do so by shall we say monday morning in case i wish to prepare a case for statement on tuesday <e>", "<cs> i should briefly like to support the amendment moved by my noble friend <e> <s> it was a relief to see that he had tabled a manuscript amendment <e> <s> i puzzled for quite a while over the earlier sentences and could not make sense of them <e> <s> however i am assured that the manuscript amendment clarifies the position <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate has been so wide ranging that i doubt whether at this hour it would be helpful or indeed welcome if i attempted to reply to the many interesting speeches that we have heard <e> <s> rather what i would wish to do is to put more emphasis on two matters which have not been fully dealt with by previous speakers but which i believe to be important <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister recall that in october last year in a lengthy written answer to a question that i tabled he listed in great detail the very many changes that have taken place in the calculation and definition of unemployment figures thus producing figures lower than those produced by previous calculations <e> <s> how does that square with his claim in answer to the question on the order paper that there have been no such changes <e>", "<cs> my lords as the welfare of women is involved in practically every aspect of life in developing countries should not every project undertaken by the overseas development administration be monitored to see that it takes account of the needs of women <e> <s> i believe that to be the procedure in the oda in respect of family planning projects <e> <s> every one is vetted from that point of view <e> <s> would it not be suitable to use the same procedure in relation to womens questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords since mr mayor has indicated a positive attitude to reforms of unescos operations is it not important to discover to what extent his proposed reforms match up to those that her majestys government have indicated to be desirable <e> <s> in order for such an assessment to be made is it not best to have a face-to-face meeting and should not the invitation to mr mayor be direct and official rather than a mere indication that a minister will talk to him if he happens to be in london on other business <e>", "<cs> my lords the article to which the noble lord lord greenhill has called attention deals mainly with europe and the soviet union as have the questions which have been put <e> <s> perhaps i may ask whether the minister will take note of the paragraph which deals with china and the developments there as being even more significant than the developments in europe <e> <s> will he ensure that his department takes due note of professor brzezinskis views on chinese developments <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government resist pressure either from the heritage foundation or elsewhere to deprive the united nations specialised agencies of their rightful funds <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that very welcome reply <e> <s> is it not the case that mr mayor is currently putting before his executive council an action programme involving considerable cuts in unescos expenditure <e> <s> is that not in line with what her majestys government have said is a condition for our renewal of membership <e> <s> therefore is not this forthcoming meeting to be welcomed with a view to our becoming members again <e>", "<cs> my lords this evening we have heard a series of speeches which taken together give an effective rounded picture of the problems facing the continent of africa <e> <s> the speeches included the welcome maiden speech of the right reverend prelate the bishop of salisbury who spoke so effectively on the basis of his personal experience in the sudan <e> <s> we look forward to hearing from him in the future on these and other subjects <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that the figure of quoted by my noble friend lord hatch has not been published <e> <s> is he not aware that it was given in a written answer in another place just before the recess <e>", "<cs> my lords since have there not been some changes in the way in which unemployment is calculated <e> <s> have not most of those changes had the effect of reducing the number of unemployed <e> <s> is it not important that we should be able to make a real assessment of employment policies and to do that to have a frequent and perhaps continuous comparison similar to that asked about by my noble friend lord jay <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that two years ago i asked his noble friend lord young about the changes and he gave me a six-page reply of changes that had been made at that time <e> <s> two years have passed since then <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not important to distinguish between a conference of the party that is in government and a conference of a party from the opposition <e> <s> in brighton for instance where i am a ratepayer it is estimated that the conservative party conference cost in extra policing million whereas in the previous year the labour party conference was only <e> <s> is not that an enormous difference and does it not make out the case for paying some of the cost of conferences when a government party is in the chair <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister appreciate that the figure of increase that he gave in his original answer is totally misleading because it goes back to a base line which is no longer relevant <e> <s> does he agree that in answer to my noble friends question the comparison that must be made is between what is being disbursed in this current financial year and what the government plan to disburse in the forthcoming year <e> <s> if he looks at those figures in the public expenditure white paper he will find that the increase is only million <e> <s> that figure <e>", "<cs> my lords i support my noble friend lord graham of edmonton in his severe criticism of the order <e> <s> some years ago he and i were happy to be in at the birth of the cda <e> <s> we are correspondingly sad this evening to be present at its death <e> <s> it would be better if instead of passing the order we reversed the famous words of mark antony of old saying we come not to bury the cda but to praise it <e> <s> i say that because as was said by the minister and my noble friend i was privileged to be the first chairman of the cda and to help launch it on a decade of constructive work for co-operative development <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be one more minute <e> <s> is the minister aware that my noble friend lord molloy was not overstating the case as illustrated by the highly unsatisfactory situation in brighton <e> <s> there the government are providing million for the building of just one city technology college whereas there is a great shortage of money for dealing with a backlog of repairs and capital programmes <e> <s> does the minister not agree that that money could be spent to much better educational effect <e>", "<cs> my lords as other speakers have said this report is a welcome one <e> <s> the noble viscount lord caldecote and his colleagues are to be congratulated upon it and thanked for it <e> <s> i regard it as a most important contribution to meeting one of the basic problems of overseas development <e> <s> that problem is now to give the developing countries the benefit of modern science but at the same time to ensure that that is done without imposing on them technologies which are suitable for the developed world but not for the under-developed world <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the success in creating jobs achieved by rural co-operatives particularly in parts of scotland ireland and wales <e> <s> does the minister not agree that that success has been achieved despite the difficulties which small co-operatives have in raising capital for their enterprises <e> <s> therefore should not the government be considering ways and means of providing capital for rural co-operatives in order to spread their effect throughout the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that helpful reply <e> <s> i hope that there will be a good outcome to the discussions that are going on <e> <s> however is she confident that this matter is being approached with a sufficient sense of urgency <e> <s> i understand that there is considerable danger that the deadline for publication of the degrees is february next year <e> <s> a great deal of preparation has to be undertaken before that properly can be done <e> <s> can the noble baroness give the house the assurance that sufficient money for those degree courses will be forthcoming and in good time <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the present training units are being phased out <e> <s> is there not a danger that they will be phased out before a satisfactory alternative arrangement is made <e> <s> will the minister ensure that that dilemma is avoided <e>", "<cs> my lords the motion we are debating this evening and most of the speeches draw attention to one of the many vicious circles that face developing countries <e> <s> the motion starts with poverty moves on to illiteracy and the environment and then to rapid population growth <e> <s> my noble friend lord rea might well have traced the circle the other way round starting with population growth and leading to poverty <e> <s> it does not matter which way round we go poverty is both a cause and a consequence of rapid population growth <e> <s> wherever we look in the developing countries we find that one problem leads to another and we go round again full circle to where we started <e> <s> the outstanding circular problem is debt <e> <s> a country is poor it borrows to feed its people it is then charged interest which it cannot afford and so it borrows again <e> <s> that is the nature of the development problem we face <e>", "<cs> my lords do the figures which the minister has given include those workers who are collectively self-employed in workers co-operative societies <e> <s> is he aware that having been thrown out <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a danger that aid given to eastern europe may be at the expense of that given to the developing countries <e> <s> for instance are not some oda staff already being transferred from third world duties to eastern european duties <e> <s> will the minister give a water-tight undertaking that those people will be replaced in their original posts by people of similar calibre and experience <e> <s> is it not clear that the oda will need more money if it is to undertake the additional duties it is being given and if the aid programme to developing countries is to go unharmed <e>"]
