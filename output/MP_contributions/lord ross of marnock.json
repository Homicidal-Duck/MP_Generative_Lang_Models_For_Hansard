be done if the bill was passed <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to make my maiden speech and strangely enough crave the indulgence of the house <e> <s> it is not the first time that i have used that phrase

earl can tell me who is going to bear the expenditure <e> <s> the expenditure is going to be borne by the local authority <e> <s> the government have approved of their spending the money <e> <s> at

very glad that the noble lord lord foot mentioned the thomson committee <e> <s> i set it up but when i go to the printed paper office i cannot even get a copy of the report <e> <s> that is the paper on which the most important matters are dependent and it will be pleaded by the noble lord the lord advocate or the noble earl <e> <s> lord mansfield in support of what they say <e> <s> my noble friends on this side and the other side of the committee will have to take for granted that what they are saying is right because the report is not available it is out of print <e>", "<cs> it is becoming more and more obvious we are at a disadvantage by the fact that we do not have copies of the thomson report in order that we may read in full what their evidence is <e> <s> as i understood it the noble lord lord foot suggested that there were experiments going on somewhere <e> <s> frankly i would rather wait to see the result of these experiments before i put this into the statute <e> <s> it can be introduced as far as i know without any statutory reform at all <e>", "<cs> this is a matter that concerned me as secretary of state way hack in and <e> <s> we were under considerable pressure particularly from the police in glasgow to give them this power <e> <s> they felt it would solve the problem that the noble and learned lord lord wheatley mentioned <e> <s> i have heard the case that he put forward about the proximity to a hospital an infirmary meaning the difference between life and death <e> <s> no one has a better record of supporting the police than i have but the more i thought about this the less i liked it <e> <s> this does not come from the thomson committee although one might have had the impression reading the memorandum that it did <e> <s> the thomson committee only made a comment in passing <e> <s> it said that one of the problems relating to a power of stop and search for offensive weapons is a fear that this will lead to police harassment of young persons particularly where such persons have a police record <e> <s> i think it would lead to difficulties not only with those with a police record but with many others as well who are quite <e>", "<cs> yes but not always in the public highway <e> <s> many of them concern domestic situations where knives and such things are very much handier <e> <s> i think that if we look at statistics in relation to that we discover that not all serious crime takes place in this particular way and to give people the idea that this power will somehow wipe out this it is just not going to happen

confirmation bill as well as those dealing with kirkcaldy lochaber strathkelvin and west lothian <e> <s> if they are examined <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl tell me what on earth stray dogs in scotland have to do with local authorities in england <e>", "<cs> by the tories my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister inform me as to how this is interpreted in scotland <e> <s> since the wiping out of burgh courts i do not think that the term lay magistrate has much effect now and this bill deals with scotland as well as england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords we dealt with this bill rather perfunctorily on committee rather late at night on tuesday <e>", "<cs> well my lords we dealt with it or did not deal with it as the case may be <e> <s> there is only one point i wish to raise <e> <s> i welcome the bill of course and i am glad that the government show their confidence in the highlands and islands development board and that they are prepared to give to that board now the authority of a harbour authority and the exercise of all the functions of a harbour authority <e> <s> i believe that in this particular case the board bought a piece of land for development and discovered that they had bought a rather derelict and dangerous jetty which had formerly belonged to the private company barra atlantic and it has now got to the stage where it would perhaps be rather better to put up a notice warning people of the dangers of using it <e> <s> so now we have to give them the full statutory authority to become a harbour authority and to erect a new jetty <e>", "<cs> but surely the noble earl knows because i understand that something has already gone before the scottish office to the effect that the secretary of state will approve or disapprove of the spending of this money and also the timing <e> <s> it is important that we should have some information about that <e>", "<cs> may i say that the vagaries of the post from scotland have prevented me from dealing with the same point but in a different way <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate says that the purpose of this amendment is to bring the matter into line with page line where that phrase can be read <e> <s> is it not however very strange that we should be seeking to bind not only the present parliament but any future parliament <e> <s> i may be a very simple-minded scot but i did not think that it was possible or even desirable to attempt to do this <e> <s> it may be possible if one is dealing with any enactment which is already on the statute book and which the draftsmen may have overlooked but to talk about any future enactment is going far too far <e> <s> with all due respect to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate i think that he has been ill-advised on this amendment <e>", "<cs> with all due respect to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate it is both unnecessary and unwise <e>", "<cs> in view of what the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has said i will withdraw the amendment unless he wants it to be put into the bill now <e>", "<cs> what we are doing of course is making a new offence <e> <s> it is certainly complicated by the fact that the person is summoned by the sheriff he is there before the sheriff but it is not the sheriff who questions or cross-examines it is the solicitor for the accused or the accused himself

that he made <e> <s> you cannot deal with a person for contempt of court if he is not in court <e> <s> so i presume this is why we resort to this new offence <e>", "<cs> i think if lord fraser knew some of our sheriffs he would withdraw that one <e>", "<cs> it seems that my defence of witnesses has raised quite a bit of discussion which only shows how wise i was to blunder in where even some of the lawyers fear to tread <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for saying that he will look at the matter and on that understanding i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise to move the deletion of clause <e> <s> i do so not because i want to see it deleted but in order to give an opportunity for the government to justify what they are doing <e> <s> although quite a number of people approve of what is being done there are others who think that what the government are seeking to achieve could have been done by a much simpler formula <e> <s> i understand that what was put forward by the noble lord lord thomson in his report is not exactly what we have here <e> <s> in fact his solution was to give more time for the defence to prepare for the first diet and that would make it much more meaningful and far far better from everyones point of view <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that that is very reasonable indeed <e> <s> the words as the noble and learned lord lord fraser of tullybelton has said have a ring to them <e> <s> i can remember a long time ago sitting in consideration of a bill to consolidate and bring up to date i think the naval discipline act and that the words of pepys in that act had such a ring and history about them that we decided to leave them <e> <s> it may well be that the lord advocate could do the same here and leave these time honoured words <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord wheatley has something here <e> <s> there is no doubt at all that experience of proceedings with summary justice in scotland today shows that days would be the exception rather than the rule and while it is entirely commendable that the government should seek to insert this provision <e> <s> i think it is giving a false impression that there will be such a speed up unless there is much more information of something new that is to happen than is evident to the rest of us <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord said it will lead to a very considerable further blockage in the high court in finding a judge probably to sit all the time dealing with many of these cases <e>", "<cs> this clause introduces into the summary procedure what is to be called an intermediate diet <e> <s> this particular diet can be called for specific limited purposes that is to find out the state of preparation of the prosecution and of the accused with respect to their cases and whether the accused intends to adhere to the plea of not guilty <e> <s> i think the purpose is admirable because it is to try to get at the person who pleads not guilty and then eventually when the trial diet comes along changes his plea having put off for as long as possible the evil hour of conviction <e> <s> but this clause has not been all that well received in scotland <e> <s> i do not know whether the lord advocate has seen the statement on the bill by the law society of scotland but in that they totally reject this clause <e> <s> i do not necessarily say that i do but i think it is as well that your lordships committee should know exactly what the councils opinion of it is total and complete rejection of the clause <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the government want to make an experiment but they cannot proceed with it unless they get statutory approval <e> <s> i do not think that it was entirely right of the noble lord lord kinross to suggest that i misled the committee about the law society of scotland <e> <s> it may well be that the law society of scotland has been misleading us all by sending us different communications <e> <s> i will read out mine <e>", "<cs> as i understand it it is the court <e> <s> this gives <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has not been at all helpful in regard to this amendment <e> <s> let us bear in mind that it has never happened and is never likely to happen <e> <s> with all respect to my noble <e>", "<cs> i think in the committee stage in another place it was suggested by someone sitting on the other side of the house that he could remember only one case in which something like this had happened in scotland and that the judge was able to deal with it <e> <s> the suggestion that the whole court is helpless and that nothing can be done is quite wrong and from that point of view i am very disappointed <e> <s> i was prepared to go half way with the lord advocate <e> <s> he has been very helpful so far today and he admits that if something like this happened in the summary court it could well be removed to the high court so i think he could have accepted this amendment standing in my name and that of the noble earl lord selkirk without losing anything at all of his powers grudging as i was at that time to give him that particular power <e> <s> it means that we shall have to look at the clause as a whole now since he does not wish to amend it in this way <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> we have done without logic for a long time so far as jury procedure in scotland is concerned <e> <s> as long as we have had jury procedure in scotland we have been operating the right of peremptory challenge in respect of five <e> <s> the government propose now to reduce it to one <e> <s> i suppose we should say that they are generous because when in opposition on the labour bill they wanted to wipe it out altogether <e>", "<cs> i feared that that would be the answer <e> <s> i regret that i was not able to discuss the matter with my noble and learned friend lord mccluskey but in view of what the lord advocate says i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think the noble and learned lord the lord advocate will know that there are many people who are opposed to this <e> <s> it is almost a breach of holy writ so far as scottish law is concerned <e> <s> my noble and learned friend lord wheatley will remember the time when he breached it in the salmon and freshwater fish act <e> <s> i too have a reasonably good memory <e> <s> i remember the row that there was at that time and the row that there has been about any approach to the question of convicting anyone in scotland on the evidence of a single witness without any corroborative evidence <e> <s> i think that we have got to get the noble and learned lord the lord advocate to get up and justify the fact that he is the person so to breach it on this occasion <e>", "<cs> in view of what the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that many of us expected very much worse than this judging by the kind of things that we have heard mooted around the country such as that the government were concerned about real jobs and not about the kind of jobs that were being provided under these schemes <e> <s> so i am very glad that there has been a change of heart <e> <s> i am disappointed that the noble earl the minister told us that he is not going to indulge in forecasting <e> <s> surely what he means is that he is not going to publish forecasts because i should be very surprised indeed if the government would have gone about spending this amount of money and being able to say that it would help more people without having made some kind of forecast <e> <s> what i am concerned about is how this fits in with the real need for this kind of scheme because we know that at the present time unemployment is rising <e> <s> in scotland over people are now unemployed <e> <s> we used to be appalled when the figure was <e> <s> does the noble earl think that this is going to be in any way adequate to meet the real needs in respect of the unemployed young people <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws the amendment i should like to ask whether any thought has been given to the question of feudal restrictions in scotland <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord appreciates it but most of the land in scotland is held on feudal tenure and the charters granted usually contain restrictive conditions <e> <s> not so long ago i could have taken the noble lord to a village in scotland where one person and i shall not name the person concerned owned the one hotel and all the rest of the land and would not allow any other hotel to be built in that village or any other place in that village to be used for that purpose <e> <s> surely if anything is that is anti-competitive <e> <s> i thought perhaps the government would have looked at this to see whether or not they are satisfied that conditions relating to the land code in scotland are adequate <e> <s> but could it not be brought within the <e>", "<cs> i sincerely hope this question is brought up again at the report stage for the simple reason that it is of very considerable importance <e> <s> here we seek to give some real power to the organisation that will replace the price commission and which will do a better job although they are going to have very few people with which to do it <e> <s> i have looked at the number of people who are going to be employed <e> <s> for all these things that we have been talking about all day i think the number to be employed is about <e> <s> i heard one minister today talking about the price commission being cosmetic <e> <s> this is not even pale whitewash <e> <s> here we have a chance to give power to the director himself to carry out an investigation hut no he must get the permission or the direction from the secretary of state also <e>", "<cs> i am sure the noble lord appreciates that in scotland at least in a public inquiry a reporter is appointed by the secretary of state for scotland and the first thing he does before he delivers his finding is to send out to the parties concerned a statement of fact <e> <s> if that is all that is required there is something to be said for it but by what the minister said latterly it may well be that he is going a bit beyond that in respect of this amendment <e> <s> however there is precedent for a statement of fact <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl tell us the extent to which our agricultural production contributes towards this surplus <e> <s> many of us feel that this has not been a very good decision for the country and that it is a very high price for suicide <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i will delay your lordships long and i do not think the noble lord needs to reply <e> <s> i just want to ask the noble lord whether he appreciates that this is a united kingdom parliament <e> <s> i certainly should have liked to hear what the statement was in respect of scotland because from the point of view of housing undoubtedly we have a very much worse position particularly in our older cities <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are all very grateful indeed for what the noble earl the minister has said and certainly i was very pleased at the attitude taken up both by him and by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> it showed a willingness to be flexible with which i have not hitherto credited lord advocates but then although my experience of them in another place was long it may be that my experience here is going to be much more pleasant <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl make one point clear to me <e> <s> the only obligation upon the potential witness is to give his name and address i gather and there is no obligation on him to make any explanation at all <e> <s> the explanation arises only if he himself willingly gives one <e>", "<cs> a good lawyer <e>", "<cs> my lords what i sought to do by putting this amendment down is to highlight exactly the implications of making this a legal duty instead of leaving it as a moral duty on the citizen <e> <s> this is not going to be the law of england

clause it says <e>", "<cs> my lords by making it plain i think the nonsense is made equally plain <e> <s> the prevention of crime act is a very short statute and if we were to read it here it would be fairly easy to see just exactly what i am getting at <e>", "<cs> all right <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be much easier if here we actually put words as to what an offensive weapon is and then

gangs <e> <s> surely that is not the purpose of this <e> <s> are we to understand that the police at the moment are quite powerless to deal with armed gangs <e> <s> this is the point <e> <s> there is a lot of emotive stuff being poured out that if only we pass this then somehow suddenly everything will be lovely in the cities and the streets <e> <s> it is not true <e> <s> the noble lord lord kinross would be the first to appreciate that the police are not powerless <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl suggested there was no precedent for this kind of thing <e> <s> i wonder what we did in all those years when we had what was called the expiring laws continuance act <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble earl appreciates it but i think that the mph speed limit was introduced in or and was not made permanent legislation until long after the war <e> <s> long after the s it was continued year after year <e> <s> there used to be the aliens law which was continued year after year <e>

penalties or disciplines that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this shows the character of the lord advocate that he was prepared to be persuaded by what was said earlier <e> <s> this reflects great credit on him and is one of the reasons why both the committee and report stages have proceeded so smoothly <e> <s> i am certainly grateful for what the noble and learned lord has done and i am sure that the noble and learned lords whom he has mentioned will be duly gratified <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate will do so <e> <s> i do not think he has entirely convinced me about this particular one but i am not going to go on that <e> <s> if he is going to look at this again will he look at the first three lines of the clause <e> <s> i never saw

defining what we are talking about <e>", "<cs> that would be one good reason for leaving the proposal out of this bill altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness make it clear that it was the association of county councils in england and wales and that this power was not sought by the education authorities in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble baroness tell me what the

apt to be very speedy and concise at all times it depends very much on the lawyer <e>", "<cs> my lords as i was secretary of state at the time when the original powers were given to the secretary of state to assist air transport in the areas covered by the bill i am very glad that the government have brought forward this bill <e> <s> the original experiment was expected to last five years and if nothing were done the power to assist was to lapse <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the changes we suggest would make mandatory the provision of meals whereas at present as i understand it the bill only empowers a local authority to do it <e> <s> this is a step backwards in respect of both meals and milk <e> <s> i was touched by what the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood said about milk <e> <s> it was her husband walter elliot who as minister of health introduced milk in schools it was one-third of a pint one penny for those who paid and those who required it and could not pay for it got it

directions to be issued in scotland or for that matter in england and wales <e> <s> because if we are to give freedom to the local authorities we do not then proceed to direct them <e> <s> i remind the minister that the position as he outlined it was the position that existed until when his government decided that we should have a national scale for the simple reason that as i said before in scotland different schemes came forward from local authorities despite the fact that the government had issued a model scheme <e> <s> the local authorities paid no attention to it <e> <s> however to get the best out of the bill as it was then the tory government introduced a national scheme <e> <s> now we are returning to the unsatisfactory position and flying flags declaring that this is

house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not entirely satisfied bearing in mind that section is to be repealed <e> <s> but the night being what it is and the stubbornness of the government not to allow us to

time of night <e> <s> the last time we discussed nursery schools was at a quarter to eight in the morning after an all-night sitting <e> <s> but i suppose we had better go on with the farce and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that this is the time to go into the question of david anderson certainly at this stage of this bill where this matter has been raised for the first time <e> <s> i was secretary of state and involved in a debate as well in another place <e> <s> i also happen to live in the place where the offence took place <e> <s> i think that the sheriff to whom the noble lord referred is now dead <e> <s> there is one thing clear so far as certain of the procedures are concerned in relation to the examination of cases both in the sheriff court and the high court there has been a considerable improvement as a result of this bill and that has been further improved during the course of the consideration of the bill <e>", "<cs>

should quietly forget about this one <e> <s> it will not solve any problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the government on the speed with which they have been able to incorporate in a consolidation measure a bill which made changes in respect of scotland and which was before the house just over a week or so ago <e> <s> i noticed that they wasted no time at all in getting changes made in respect of nursery schools and school meals provisions <e> <s> on the basis of the assurance that has been given by the minister of state that there is no substantial amendment which of course would cause the government very considerable trouble and open up the whole bill for amendment in another place if not here i certainly would support the second reading <e>", "<cs> but there is a very considerable sense of grievance among pensioners about what is happening because effectively it is a loss of two weeks <e> <s> had the law not been changed <e>", "<cs> that being so could we have a promise from the government that they will no longer tell us that in the cuts that are being made they are going out of their way to make sure that the pensioners do not suffer <e> <s>

because it is a very important point <e> <s> is the noble baroness prepared to answer right away <e>", "<cs> that means that the noble baroness is not going as far today as the tory party went in its election manifesto <e> <s> that is a very serious breach indeed <e> <s> no wonder the noble baroness refers to some lighthearted television programme <e> <s> she is turning the whole thing into a farce she is turning politics into a farce <e> <s> it was winston who at one time said that simply because something is stuck into a manifesto it does not mean to say that it will become law <e> <s> i thought that the tory party had got away from that <e> <s> they place great faith in manifesto commitments <e> <s> we have already had two budgets so they have had time to think about this <e>", "<cs> i hope the minister will think again on this because it is very serious <e> <s> i think he underestimates considerably the number of people who are concerned about this matter <e> <s> for my sins and for quite a long time i did the same task as the noble lord is doing when lord boyd-carpenter was minister of pensions and national insurance <e> <s> unless you are dealing with this fairly directly the amount of literature you have to accept is quite incredible <e> <s> every time there is a change there is a whole range of new leaflets new pamphlets <e> <s> the noble lord spoke about the

whole range of leaflets <e> <s> you go through them and you discover that that one is out of date <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> i am glad to note that my name is ross and not hutchinson <e> <s> i am not the next one to speak <e> <s> but if i may just strike another note there were many occasions on which i had to pass on the opinions of lord mountbatten to the war cabinet offices because i was for quite a time his special signals officer <e> <s> i was certainly in full agreement with many of the things that my noble friend said about lord mountbatten <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to those noble lords who have spoken and given their support to the bill <e> <s> i was touched by the thought that the noble lord lord ferrier would in any way be inhibited i have never appreciated that he could be inhibited whether by time or anything else <e> <s> as far as the paucity of public transport is concerned all i can do is agree with him <e> <s> but i cannot see any local authority providing under any piece of legislation which at present exists tokens for transport on buses that do not exist <e> <s> this is the great weakness of his scheme albeit illegal and it was a very unwise man who rose in this house to declare the illegality of what was happening i do not believe it for a minute in the north of scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord appreciate that there has been a continuing concern <e> <s> the hopes of the professions supplementary to medicine were raised thinking that professor clegg would produce some long-term solution to the question of their status and relationship to other professions within the medical field <e> <s> will he not be deceived by the fact that they are reasonable people <e> <s> they have agreed to co-operate so far as is possible but further negotiations are continuing into the next pay round and it really is not satisfactory that the situation for these people should carry on like this year after year <e>", "<cs> i should like to think that i was persuaded that the government have shown great imagination and have foreshadowed great changes in regional policies which were going to be effective but i must confess myself deeply disappointed indeed by what the noble viscount has said <e> <s> i have been involved in regional policy for the greater part of my life in another place <e> <s> that was a matter of years and for a quarter of that time i was secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> i was deeply involved indeed <e> <s> the noble viscount says look

unrelated to certain things which were said in europe about what we could do and what we could not do and i certainly had no responsibility for taking us into that mess some of the repercussions of which we have heard about today <e>", "<cs> yes indeed but we are giving the grant at per cent and the industry must find the rest of it per cent <e> <s> the fact is that with the present interest rates that stem from the governments economic policy we are not getting the investment which was supposed to be the basis of the chancellors first budget last year <e> <s> it is getting too late for

by which to solve the problems of scotland <e> <s> it does not begin to do so <e> <s> the noble lord should strengthen the position of the scottish development agency giving them more freedon to go out instead of hamstringing them in the way he is doing it <e>", "<cs> far be it from me to defend the government but somebody has to do it <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord who moved the amendment appreciates that he would not achieve throughout the whole country what he wants to achieve <e> <s> as i understand it and i hope i shall not be told i am wrong section of the scottish development agency act is still unrepealed <e> <s> if the noble lord looks at that he will find in subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give us some idea as to how many such regulations

not pay any attention to it the first six months of the life of this particular bill <e> <s> it is asking a great deal to take on trust that this shall be done <e> <s> if that is the case it undermines the position of the advisory committee right from the start <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord answer one simple question if the amendment is passed does it give the advisory committee more freedom or less freedom <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble viscount will think again about some of the things which are implied in this clause <e> <s> i have an interest in it and particularly regarding subsection where he deals with the scottish development agency act <e> <s> as he knows i was secretary of state at the time when that act was passed <e> <s> it is interesting

and see what they can do <e> <s> they were not all that helpful when it came to the passing of the act and the creation of the agency and indeed it looked at one time as though they were going to get rid of it <e> <s> there were times when they spoke in this way about the neb and the welsh development agency as well and then they probably suddenly realised that they had better have some tools in their locker if they were even to keep up a pretence of dealing with the rising tide of unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government give us a little more information <e> <s> it is a bit much to come along and say we know how many we are aiming for but we do not know how we are going to do it <e> <s> as does the noble lord lord campbell of croy i recall the scottish office very well <e>

officers of the house for their guidance to the government for their co-operation and to noble lords for their support <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i had hoped that a scottish minister would have

have legislation before us in respect of council rents and private rents in scotland england and wales <e> <s> is it not the case that there is more money laid aside there or expected to be laid aside there in respect of rent rebates <e> <s> surely that implies increases of rents <e>", "<cs> when this scheme was introduced can the noble lord tell us what changes were made in respect of payments made by those who were insured <e> <s> it is all very well for him to give us a long lecture starting in and jumping to and then <e> <s> it is a great pity that the minister of pensions and national insurance at that time is not with us he was the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e>", "<cs> we are in committee and it is very easy for me to sit down and resume my remarks later <e>", "<cs> may i say that i have quite finished now <e> <s> i can say anything more that i want to say on the next amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord would now proceed to answer the question which i asked him <e> <s> when earnings-related benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the very mention of a common fisheries policy makes scottish fishermen shudder <e> <s> but i think

taken in the next two to three months <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down can he answer a fairly simple question <e> <s> who determines whether or not a person can afford to pay this <e> <s>

that means that it is the tenant who makes the decision <e>", "<cs> the only bit further that the minister can go is to give an indication of what the regulations contain <e> <s> we are near enough to the end <e>", "<cs> i am sure the noble lord will appreciate our difficulty here <e> <s> am i right in thinking that the tenants in these rural areas still to be specified will have the same right as

"<cs> i trust that we shall have this in writing in <e>", "<cs> it is discretionary yes <e>", "<cs> i am reasonably content with the noble earls explanation but i would ask him to have another look to make sure the words are accurate and i specifically have in mind the word any it gives the impression that one might be able to track back considerably <e> <s> the minister said earlier that the tenancy could be transferred only once although the local authority out of the goodness of its heart might allow some other member of the family to carry on <e> <s> i suggest we must draw the line somewhere as to liability in respect of work done earlier which could be considered for payment <e> <s> i appreciate it is only discretionaryi have been dealing with bills for quite a long timebut often by common use this sort of thing comes to be expected by tenants giving up a secure tenancy and therefore perhaps we need a limitation of some sort <e> <s> that is why i suggest that the predecessor or his predecessor might be preferable to any predecessor <e> <s> i see the difficulty with a joint tenancy but i am not entirely satisfied that the wording is clear <e>", "<cs> with that explanation i am sure that my noble friend lord mackie of benshieif i may dare call him a friend after the kind of things he has been saying during the daywill permit me to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> twice within a few minutes <e> <s> we should have had dinner about three hours earlier if food arouses the passions of generosity towards the opposition in the heart and mind of the minister <e> <s> we are grateful for his acceptance of the amendment and hope he will carry on in that vein for the next six or seven hours while we are considering the bill <e>", "<cs> it is far too early in the evening to start arguing about a small point like this <e> <s> at one stage i spent quite a long timeadmittedly it was in glasgowteaching english <e> <s> certainly it was a long time ago but i am prepared to dispute this matter with the noble earland to dispute it at length <e> <s> however i do not think that it is worthwhile <e> <s> i think that people understand what is there and so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> am i right in thinking that at the moment local authorities cannot so arrange matters that they have a surplus and that now this provision will allow them to raise the rents as high as they like regardless of whether they make a surplus from doing so subject to any other limitations that there may well be <e> <s> so they are now being encouraged to fix their rent policy so as to enable them to make a profit <e> <s> it is almost an encouragement to raise rents is it not <e> <s> that is one of the dangers unless there is some other provision whereby the secretary of state will safeguard the interests of the tenants <e> <s> i have no objection to the proposal provided that there is such a safeguard elsewhere <e> <s> can the noble earl tell me whether there is such a safeguard <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has answered one of my points but not the other <e> <s> probably he appreciates that it might arise in another amendment that i may or may not move <e> <s> it is clear that the local authorities can make a profit they will he encouraged to make a profit <e> <s> they can put the surplus into the general fund not into the housing fund <e> <s> so they can do virtually what they like with it within their duties as local authorities <e>", "<cs> i wish i could be as confident as is the noble earl that no local authority tenant will be disadvantaged <e> <s> what this whole clause means then is that local authorities can raise their rents as high as they like and the secretary of state will not interfere <e> <s> he has thrown away the power he had of interferingand interfering for the protection of the tenant <e> <s> the real reason for subsection for which i sought an explanation earlier is that of course if they raise the rents they will make a profit out of the houses so that way was cleared by the withdrawal of the restriction which said that they should not make a profit out of housing <e>", "<cs> it is not unreasonable <e> <s> i think the word is reasonable <e>", "<cs> i am trying to save time too <e> <s> i have not raised any question on clause stand part much as i could <e> <s> the noble earl should not try to encourage me <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for advising me that i can do what i like as to how we conduct the opposition on this bill <e> <s> if he looks at the clause there are three separate points <e> <s> the first is in relation to surplus the second is in relation to how you use these surpluses and the third is in relation to rents <e> <s> i cannot think of any clause in which it is more appropriate to amend each of the separate entities within it and then if necessary debate clause stand part <e> <s> i do not know <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> it certainly does assist me <e> <s> i think it is fine that a government will stand and make absolutely clear to everyone that as a result of government action they are going to make it more expensive for people to buy their houses <e> <s> that is the gist of what the noble earl said <e> <s> he said that it is only fair to the building societies that we should not have this unfair competition <e>", "<cs> because people are lenders to building societies it does not mean that they will become borrowers from them or that the building societies will accept them as borrowers <e> <s> what they look at of course is the property which is their safeguard it is there <e> <s> what the minister is saying comes to this that it is only the very best of houses that are going to be sold and in respect of which the building societies are going to enter the field <e> <s> he knows as well as i do that there are a great many local authority houses that the building societies just will not touch <e>", "<cs> this is a splendid amendment and it certainly has my full support <e> <s> it is in line with the kind of thing that we started way back in the year when the labour government introduced the improvement grant scheme <e> <s> although we hoped that it would be taken up by owners of tenemented property to help stop the slide into slumdom that was then in evidence we were disappointed by the results <e> <s> we discovered that it was owner-occupiers who became interested and abused this scheme <e> <s> that scheme was developed and has spawned other aspects of repair grants and standard amenities and this is something similar which will be available to owner-occupiers <e> <s> admittedly it is very limited <e> <s> first get your house and then get your agreement with the local authority <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that they are simple but where a local authority undertakes to indemnify a building society in respect of <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that information <e> <s> the information i was looking for was to confirm what i had already learned from my own experience as secretary of state and my continuing interest in the subject was that we had hoped to interest the building societies in the way of making loans available to people for the properties that were less desirable <e> <s> sadly although we have offered that inducement which was really a sharing of the loss in fact one-third of it only going to the building society they have not to any extent in fact not at all come into this particular field although i remember it being announced that a sum of money was being made available by the government to meet this <e>", "<cs> it is clear that in both cases there will be very considerable increases in rents <e> <s> of course we shall see the order when it eventually comes but the minister has told us that in the first year following the completion of the present registration period of three years whenever that may be in respect of any particular rent the maximum will be <e> <s> of course there will he other years to come after that <e> <s> he said that there would be more or less the equivalent of a per cent <e> <s> increase <e> <s> i think that the present maximum over the period is <e> <s> so there will be a very considerable increase <e>", "<cs> i do not think that anyone would quarrel with the new clause here <e> <s> it is interesting to see the sidelines into which these new clauses take us <e> <s> i should have liked to embark on the activities of the crown commissioners in scotland <e> <s> i had a certain measure of responsibility at one time <e> <s> the only quibble i would have with the noble earl is when he says that they have so many properties involved mainly in certain parts of the country <e> <s> i was waiting for him to mention edinburgh becaue they have been active in respect of properties in edinburgh as well <e> <s> they may get beneficial help if protection is needed from the rent acts under the new clause <e> <s> now is not the time to embark upon the activities of the crown commissioners in this respect and i certainly welcome the new clause <e>", "<cs> of course the noble earl appreciates that when i was talking earlier about home loans and the kind of property that young people were buying their way into to become owner-occupiers much of it was this kind of property because when it became vacant there was no question of re-letting it <e> <s> there is no doubt at all about it that property owners in glasgow were delighted to be able to sell it and sell it they did <e> <s> it is a sad position <e> <s> i do not think for a minute that if they get an increase of another a week in rent they are going to spend a penny of it on repairs and maintenance <e> <s> what can you do with these ancient properties in glasgow over years old some of them in the situation that i mentioned in the discussion on an earlier amendment where you go up the close and on each level there is the landing in the middle and the room and kitchen on each side <e> <s> they have been there for a hundred years without any facilities <e> <s> they do not reach any standard at all and it is sad to think that in this day and age and after all the efforts made by all sorts of governments to improve things in many cases they are still there <e>", "<cs> we were very much in favour of the change originally made <e> <s> i think this is even more helpful <e> <s> i welcome the fact that the government are prepared to anticipate and to plug loopholes before they ever arise <e> <s> it also shows that they have considerable experience now in the scottish office of the scottish property owners <e> <s> i am glad that the noble earl confirmed what i said earlier that the dice is loaded against the tenant <e> <s> we have had this experience over a long time much to the distress of people who are sincere supporters of the fair rent system who discover that the tenant is helpless there against the barrage of evidence that is brought by the landlord which <e>", "<cs> i will proceed now in my most dulcet tones to tempt the noble earl the minister <e> <s> surely bearing in mind the potential load we are putting on sheriffs in the earlier part of this bill whereas hitherto there may have been no trouble i do not think it is a great burden on sheriffs but it might be better to relieve them of this burden in view of the other work we are throwing their way <e> <s> after all i am perfectly sure that people would accept the decisions of valuation officers as readily as they accept those of sheriffs <e> <s> the valuation officer or assessor as he is better known in scotland is doing this all the time <e> <s> in england and wales i believe it is done by the inland revenue they get it for nothing <e> <s> in scotland apart from one area where it is done elsewhere it is done by the regional valuation officer <e> <s> i think he would do a good job <e> <s> certainly so far as cost is <e>", "<cs> thank you <e> <s> on that understanding i am delighted to be able to ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the point is that from its formation in there have been blank periods <e> <s> however that did not prevent it coming along at various times for instance at the end of the war it dealt with the question of the modernisation of scotlands homes <e> <s> indeed it did so in and later <e> <s> it did not cost anything at all to keep going and in being <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the government on the bill and the fact that they have brought it forward <e> <s> it is some months ago since i addressed myself to the confirmation order on the ardveenish harbour bill <e> <s> i can remember asking the government at that time whether we could be assured that the secretary of state would bring forward the necessary authority for financing it <e> <s> i just discovered today of course that there has been no action taken to forward that harbour <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very enthusiastic in relation to the last bill <e> <s> i cannot say the same about this one for the simple reason that as far as i can see this bill is occasioned by local government reorganisation in scotland which took place in i think <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the legislation was passed before then and effectively from the point of view of its operation <e> <s> then of course things like boroughs were wiped out sheriff substitutes have also gone <e> <s> reference to the police act is of course long outdated <e> <s> let us compare what is here with what was in section of the british transport commission act which was a local act <e> <s> if you are looking for it remember to ask for the local act <e> <s> these are the only changes that are made plus so far as i can see one other change <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to cover the changes that will be necessary in this particular bill the government could have done it within their own public act which would save money to the board <e> <s> if he goes back and has a look at section of the british transport commission act i think subsection that is the only change that is being made <e> <s>

can appeal to the land tribunal and all the rest of it <e> <s> but the noble earl still has not justified why this formula should apply to houses built after th may <e> <s> we all know that was the period of the takeover from the housing authorities when the county council was a housing authority and small and large boroughs were all housing authorities but why is there a different formula in respect of that <e> <s> can he spell out why this formula for these houses which will apply to any house that is built as from this moment as well <e>", "<cs> my lords there is nothing untoward about it but why should it apply to a house built after th may and not to on built in say or <e> <s> i hope the noble earl appreciates that every local authority house built since has still got an outstanding debt and the earlier it started the lower the outstanding debt unless very considerable sums of money have been spent on it for modernisation <e> <s> in the case of some houses more has been spent on modernisation than the original cost of the house <e> <s> why th may <e> <s> quite apart from the fact that that marked the takeover of the new authorities there must be some

enlightenment and have not got it <e> <s> it is going to prove troublesome to some of the tenants perhaps in adjoining houses as to why formulas apply to them and not <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not

"<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl reads subsection it is up to the local authority to put in the conditions and they may be specific conditions with regard to that house <e> <s> i do not know when the purchaser is going to be so informed that he can appeal against the conditions if he objects to them if it is in relation to the actual purchase it is to the lands tribunal and if it is later on in relation to the loan it is to the sheriff <e> <s> all this is nicely complicated <e> <s> but is it not far better to let the purchaser know his rights from the start <e> <s> nobody will tell me that every local authority tenant has read this bill <e> <s> i should take a lot of convincing that every noble lord has read it and understands it hut somehow or other you have to get the information over to the tenant and to the tenant who is really interested in purchasing that is the right time to tell him <e>", "<cs> my lords so did i <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it took me about half a minute to move the amendment and i am sorry that the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood was not here but it took the minister a considerable amount of time more to explain why they were wrong in respect of the housing bill in england and how misguided the house was in passing that particular amendment <e> <s> the point remains that that amendment was passed that amendment is part of the housing bill <e> <s> so there is a dilemma for the government or a dilemma for the scottish office in that formulae which started out the same are now diverging diverging to the disadvantage of the tenant who has taken the fixed price option and to the advantage of the local authority <e> <s> somehow or other the government must make that right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to notice the element of particiation that we have had from the noble baroness lady faithfull for instance who wants to know why there are different standards <e> <s> i just draw attention to the fact that we are giving to council tenants new rights which they have not had before <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e> <s> in exercising those rights the local authority has the power to put in certain conditions <e> <s> it cannot refuse the right to purchase unless and this is the only reason the information given on that form about which we spoke earlier is inaccurate in a material way <e> <s> that is the only ground <e> <s> surely in respect of this matter the noble baroness must face the fact that already within the bill we are exercising a different standard because in the schedule it says that this is one of the reasons why the tenant can be evicted <e> <s> he cannot be evicted for that if it is a privately tenanted property he can be prosecuted but not evicted <e> <s> that standard has already been laid by the government and it is in the schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords that is perfectly true <e> <s> i did not put it forward because i thought that it was self-evident <e> <s> we shall come later to the effect upon the amenity and the value of other houses <e> <s> the government already have something down about that in a further part of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords clause says <e>", "<cs> my lords that was just about as disappointing a reply as many of the others <e> <s> the noble earl said that this house has been responsive to the needs of the rural areas <e> <s> how right he is <e> <s> but it was usually against the advice of the government when we voted <e> <s> the government were wrong <e> <s> i suggest that they are wrong again here in thinking that there is any protection in this possible pre-emption the designation and application by the local authority and then the secretary of state making the order after more than a third of the number of dwelling houses had been sold and the secretary of state is satisfied that an unreasonable portion of the houses sold have been resold <e>", "<cs> my lords you have to appreciate the frustrations of the people of scotland <e> <s> they have already voted for a labour government <e> <s> in another place there are twice as many labour members as there are conservatives <e> <s> so far as mandate is concerned they had no right in mandate and manifesto or anything to introduce this at all <e> <s> there is such a thing as democracy and that democracy is being frustrated in scotland at the present time <e> <s> i am afraid that there will be further consequences of that <e> <s> not on the heads of noble lords will it fall but on the heads of their comrades in another place who have to bear the brunt of the inflexibility of this government and their unwillingness to do justice and be responsive to the needs of the people of scotland <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord lives in scotland or whether he has any knowledge of the situation in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not remember having many political meetings in inverness but i am sorry to see that i failed to convert the noble lord <e> <s> i think the liberals won inverness at that time and the noble lord will bear me out that we still have a liberal mp in inverness <e> <s> even inverness itself is complaining about this bill and what it is going to do <e>", "<cs> my lords blessed is he who expecteth little for he shall not be disappointed <e> <s> the bill has been on its way for over six months <e> <s> am i to understand that the government have been discussing this matter with local authorities for six months and yet cannot give even a glimmer of information about it to your lordships <e> <s> i can remember a time when very distinguished members of the party opposite used to go around the country with statutory instruments and orders speaking on the evils of delegated legislation <e> <s> delegated legislation is sometimes absolutely essential <e> <s> we could not govern the country or carry out acts of parliament without it <e> <s> those gentlemen who toured the country speaking about delegated legislation should be the last people to allow a government to take powers without that government saying what those powers are to be <e> <s> here we have four instances of the government taking powers <e> <s> first we have the phrase shall by order secondly there is the word may <e> <s> the third example is mandatory and in the fourth the word may is used again <e>", "<cs> my lords i sought at committee stage to get some full explanation of what the government wanted to do <e> <s> we have had more information tonight the point about the public inquiry <e> <s> we are thankful for small mercies <e> <s> i see some of the disadvantages here but i think that if i had desired to be obstructive i could have suggested the affirmative resolution procedure rather than the negative procedure because as the noble earl knows the negative procedure would still allow the secretary of state to act and thereafter could be followed by parliamentary action which may or may not take place <e> <s> it does not always follow that there will be procedure invoked by parliament <e> <s> however in view of what the noble earl has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble earl has a poor opinion of scottish local authorities he has told us about it before <e> <s> i have a very much higher opinion of glasgows administrative capacity to deal with that number of tenants and their problems <e> <s> this has already been proved by their activities <e> <s> i have confidence that they could do it in a year and it is important that the tenants should have this lease as early as possible <e> <s> it is unfair that they should have to wait for two years <e> <s> however i bow to the noble earl <e> <s> he says they cannot do it <e> <s> i am perfectly sure that most of them could but i am not going to fight about it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords how generous i am <e> <s> i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt that there has to be a housing list <e> <s> we have had complaints <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether it is a good clause from the point of view of the local authorities <e> <s> it means that the building <e>", "<cs> well my lords if it is a standard provision and that is the standard explanation i am perfectly sure the house is unenlightened <e> <s> i think it is time we looked into this kind of thing and suggested to the draftsmen that they should be a little bit tighter in their language and not give such open powers to the secretary of state supplementary and incidental provisions as the secretary of state thinks fit <e> <s> that is a fairly wide power and i would hesitate to agree with the noble earl that this is standard practice <e> <s> i doubt very much if it is <e> <s> i will not at this hour go any further on the point <e> <s> i have seen the day and i could think of the people concerned some <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to suggest that the substance of the noble earls speech was that the amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> that being so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have been delighted to consider that if the noble lord had made his point succinctly but then he proceeded to argue that i was wrong in the general principle <e> <s> he proceeded to examine another clause altogether which was a justification given by the government in respect of that and other amendments <e> <s> the noble lord cannot have it both ways <e> <s> it was very undesirable i think of him and he would have been ruled out of order elsewhere when he strayed from the actual amendment and proceeded to tell us about something entirely different <e> <s> it took him far longer to tell me about my undesirability than it took me to move the amendment and we should probably have been finished with the amendment by this time but for his intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his last remarks and in relation to the last point the noble earl lord selkirk of course follows our proceedings very well <e> <s> i do not know whether he tried to get a <e>", "<cs> my lords a qualified right <e>", "<cs> my lords i have certainly highlighted the fact <e> <s> the noble earl suggests that this would open up the way for an endless succession of tenants

the automatic translation of the first succession would be from the mother to the son or to a daughter <e> <s> there is a definition of qualified person which itself provides a limitation <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e> <s> i thought we were doing what is done in another place where amendments are taken together and discussed together and if an amendment is not moved then it is not moved <e> <s> in those circumstances amendment no <e> <s> and amendment no <e> <s> are not moved by me <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no desire to prolong the agony <e> <s> i never expected that at this late stage there would be a change of heart on the part of the government <e> <s> i think my toll of accepted amendments is one or one and a half but i am not complaining about that <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the best reason i have had yet for the turning down of any amendment of mine that it conflicts with a money resolution <e> <s> if the noble earl is interested in the proceedings in another place and he seeks to get a volume devoted entirely to money resolutions he will find many a speech of mine on the subject of the money resolution which was always taken after a second reading and which we always insisted upon having available to us before we started the committee stage <e> <s> if it is outside the money resolution then nobody can do anything about it except blame the government for drawing the money resolution so tightly that such a desirable amendment would not be in order to be put forward and accepted in another place and of course here <e> <s> irrespective of how the other place occasionally treats this house and the disrespect which it showed the other day we treat them with due respect so far as money resolutions are concerned and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this is more or less the last lap on this bill and it may well be the last housing bill in which i shall participate <e> <s> i have participated in every housing bill since on the committee and when i was not on the committee i was the person behind it who took responsibility for it <e> <s> i do not think that we shall have another one in the lifetime of this parliament unless things are very bad indeed <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think it makes much more sense with the words than without them and i am very glad that at this belated stage whoever is responsible for the bill discovered this omission and got these words in just in time <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be churlish of me not to express my delight as a scot that this change has been accepted by the government <e> <s> i cannot thank your lordships very much <e> <s> you will remember that exactly the same amendment for the people who need the same protection was turned down when we came to the scottish bill <e> <s> to my mind it was an exceedingly foolish thing to do <e> <s> the same protection is needed in scotland as was recognised and accepted for england in this house <e> <s> i am grateful that as a result of what has happened in another place and indeed starting with the acceptance of the principle of the amendment we are now discussing for england and wales that the government have thought again and have made a promise that the same protection will be incorporated not into the scottish bill alas <e> <s> we cannot do that but into the new legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i gladly follow my noble friend <e> <s> i will not inflict upon your lordships the full burns quotation although it is short <e>", "<cs> should we not have this information <e> <s> i am sorry i missed the short speech of the lord advocate on this point <e> <s> it is strange to have a second thought at this very late stage in the bill and to introduce something applying to scotland which was not there originally <e> <s> as i understand it there has been no agreement with the scottish local authorities about this <e> <s> i find it difficult to justify this sudden thought by the government that they should be able to demand information from local authorities at a time when they are seeking to restrict the expenditure of local authorities <e> <s> can we be given clear information about the convention of scottish local authorities and their attitude to this <e>", "<cs> this would apply to the scottish local authorities too <e>", "<cs> yes but there has been no agreement so far <e>", "<cs> i listened with considerable interest to what the noble and learned lord the lord advocate had to say about the draft codes of practice that had been submitted to this or that person but he will not be surprised if i ask him what has happened in scotland <e> <s> originally when this bill was produced so far as i know scottish local authorities were not in the bill so i presume that there were no discussions with interested bodies other than the so far unfruitful discussions with the scottish local authorities <e> <s> has the secretary of state for scotland produced any codes of practice and discussed them with the trade unions in scotland or does he intend to do so <e> <s> if i had known about the amendments which were eventually tabled not only would i have supported this amendment but probably i should have added the scottish trade union congress as well <e>", "<cs> that means that there have been no codes of practice because there has not been agreement <e> <s> if there is agreement there will be consultation and if there is no agreement there also will be consultation <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am pursuing the same point i had before as to why at this late date we should have scotland introduced into this clause <e> <s> i do not think it is good enough for the secretary of state or the lord advocate on behalf of the secretary of state to say well we had hoped to get voluntary agreement as a result of our discussions with the local authorities <e> <s> this makes a bit of a mockery of the claim that the whole thing is voluntary <e> <s> if he had got voluntary agreement there would be no need for legislation at all <e> <s> so he is now taking the fall-back position of inviting us into this position where the duty is laid upon the secretary of state and thereafter having to issue a code of practice in relation to publication of information <e> <s> once you get to that particular point and appreciate that it is the duty of the secretary of state then the secretary of state is going to have his way <e> <s> the duty is laid upon him whether he reaches agreement with local authorities or not and that includes police authorities fire authorities and the ilea in this part of the world <e>", "<cs> can the noble and learned lord the lord advocate just answer the simple question why was it not made applicable to scotland right from the start <e>", "<cs> we have had quite a lot of talk about direct labour organisations and i think without exception in reference to local authorities <e> <s> but that is not what clause says <e> <s> indeed from clause through to clause which i was very happy to vote against the reference is not just to local authorities but to a development body <e> <s> here in clause we have the definition of a development body <e> <s> in relation to england and wales i leave that to those who know something about england and wales i know nothing at all <e> <s> but the clause reads <e>", "<cs> i am hoping that they are alive and listening although there is not a scottish minister there <e> <s> he cannot blame me when there is not anyone there concerned with scotland <e> <s> i am glad that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate is not here <e> <s> he is not a scottish office minister <e> <s> this is one case in point <e> <s> why is there included in the clause the scottish special housing association <e> <s> which was set up to build where even the local authorities had not the resources to do it <e> <s> when we established an aluminium smelter in the north of scotland one could not expect the local authority with its resources to build houses so we gave the task to the local authority aided by the scottish special housing association <e> <s> the same thing applied to different parts of scotland they were all in the north which have been affected by north sea oil <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble earl will confirm what i have said that there has been no complaint at all about their inefficiency or slackness <e>", "<cs> i draw attention to page subsection <e>", "<cs> of course it has <e>", "<cs> that is all wrong <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has been anticipating a lengthy speech that i am going to make when we come to clause <e> <s> i can assure him that it is wrong in more than that considerable part <e> <s> he will appreciate my difficulties in trying to relate the various references in various parts of the bill to what clauses apply to scotland <e> <s> in many cases they are quite wrong too <e> <s> i think that the lord advocates department must bear some responsibility for this in not keeping the changes that were made elsewhere up to date in respect of this particular bill <e> <s> of course we have made further changes that will necessitate further amendment of for instance clause with reference to clause <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment moved by the noble earl lord minto <e> <s> the issue is separate from the special responsibility payment and all it would do would be to bring the position of scotland up to that of england and wales <e> <s> you can imagine a local authority like strathclyde which embraces half the population of scotland <e> <s> of course the work has to be shared out there has got to be a vice-convenor and in that case i do not think there is any justification for scotlands not being in the same position as the local authorities south of the border <e>", "<cs> that would be quite feasible quite relevant and a good argument but unfortunately as far as i can see this will apply only to england and wales and i presume that any reform to get rid of the rating system would apply to the whole country <e> <s> i am surprised that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate is to reply to this debate <e> <s> of course he will be able to tell us that it will not apply to scotland and that scotland has had the quinquennial revaluations <e> <s> mind you they are not very popular <e> <s> the last one cost me very considerably indeed when they upped my valuation by a multiple of i think <e> <s> but the argument was that it was time to sort out the variations between one area and another <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord further replies will he consult also ministers in the scottish office about the implications of this with respect to shetland <e> <s> i was the secretary of state at the time when the agreement was made there and i can assure him that the understanding in shetland is very clear that this is quite separate from revenues to be used in respect of rates be it rate support grant or capital control <e>", "<cs> this is a bill which applies to scotland as well as to england and wales <e> <s> i should apologise for my sporadic interventions but i can explain my difficulties <e> <s> i look first at the explanatory memorandum to find those parts of the bill which apply to scotland and i search in vain <e> <s> paragraph of the explanatory memorandum says <e>", "<cs> the lord advocate says it is a new power but was two years ago <e> <s> does he mean to say that this was placed on the statute book and that no use was made of it by local authorities <e>", "<cs> it is quite clear but that expenditure by local authorities last year would be relevant expenditure in respect of rate support grant <e> <s> so the government should have some information as to how much money was spent by local authorities in this case <e> <s> if we do not know that figure then we do not know the likely cost to the government of this generosity <e> <s> it may well be that these disabled people got their rent rebates under the normal rent rebate scheme which is related to income <e> <s> before we give plaudits to the government for generosity we must know exactly how much it is going to be <e> <s> somebody must have made some calculation as to what it is going to be for england and wales and how much for scotland <e>", "<cs> we want to know <e>", "<cs> can the scottish office tell us since this is going to be applied to scotland the number of local authorities that have evinced an interest in providing caravan parks for gipsies in scotland <e>", "<cs> nothing much to do with gipsies <e>", "<cs> it does apply to scotland <e>", "<cs> oh yes it does <e> <s> i took the trouble to look it up <e>", "<cs> i hope the minister will realise that when we come to discuss regulations be it on an affirmative or a negative motion the one thing we cannot do is amend them <e> <s> from that point of view it would be far better to get into the bill some sensible exception to cover specific types of operation <e> <s> for that reason i would certainly support this amendment <e> <s> there is no other one before us <e>", "<cs> this clause applies to scotland <e> <s> i wonder why <e> <s> the secretary of state has bowed out of a lot of this because none of the aspects of finance as regards rate support grant and capital control apply to scotland <e> <s> however this matter does apply <e> <s> i should like to know what the secretary of state for scotland did about it <e> <s> it is now a better clause than it was originally because we have got rid of subsection <e> <s> however i must say that subsection is the one that probably cost the government a little more money than anything else because i can assure your lordships that it takes a long long time for the civil servants to get round to appeals and then those concerned must await the decision of the local authorities <e> <s> those appeals and the hearing of them probably cost more money than would be taken up by a thousand of the small owner-occupiers who will be caught in this <e>", "<cs> i hope to hear some information from scotland <e> <s> i do not see political ministers on the front bench but i do see the lord advocate who has been doing a sterling job on this bill <e> <s> i do not know why <e> <s> could he explain how this will work in scotland <e> <s> that the secretary of state may direct a corporation to pay him on the date specified such sum as is so specified is a clause that should not be passed <e> <s> it is not specified in the bill <e> <s> it is a sum to be thought up by the secretary of state <e> <s> in this case we are not talking about the secretary of state for the environment but the secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> i know the secretary of state for scotland very well <e> <s> he is my local mp <e> <s> i have never voted for him but that is beside the point <e> <s> i am perfectly sure however that neither he nor the scottish office thought this up <e> <s> this bears the hallmark of a political dictator <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will be able to do so before the report stage <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister appreciates that we <e>", "<cs> unless it is in this part <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies i am not a lawyer i am just a simple-minded scot and i read this subsection <e>", "<cs> i had a point on clause but i shall let it go just now if the draftsman will have a look at subsections and <e> <s> they are pretty haywire and could be amalgamated much more satisfactorily <e> <s> i come to clause <e> <s> i have been trying hard to take an interest in this bill from a scottish point of view <e> <s> every time i

exceptional <e> <s> the noble and learned lord mentioned only a leak being possible from police sources <e> <s> is he satisfied that there was no leak from the crown office <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very glad that the lord advocate has looked at this <e> <s> it is rather intriguing that on an earlier amendment i heard a minister say that he would look at some <e>", "<cs> my lords does this also mean that any application by a prisoner to be transferred to a scottish prison will automatically be turned down <e>", "<cs> my lords we should congratulate the government on their good sense in

to clause stand part about extending it to ensure that information is provided by governments as well in respect of some of the subjects that are mentioned specifically in the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords this is my main concern about it <e> <s> we have already got information that certain agreements have been reached with the local authorities in england about quarterly publication in respect of certain aspects <e> <s> i do not know what has been agreed in scotland <e> <s> i can assure your lordships that the government are very chary about giving local authorities in scotland powers to publish information because the great majority of local authorities in scotland are socialist <e> <s> they are anxious to give information to their ratepayers about the activities of the government and the effect upon their functions of what the government are doing <e> <s> but when it comes to requiring the local authorities to publish certain things i do not believe for a minute that the government are going to allow that kind of thing <e> <s> it is the government who are going to determine <e> <s> of course it is a permissive power <e> <s> they do not need to introduce regulations if in their opinion everyone behaves himself but evidently they have made up their minds <e> <s> they are having certain troubles <e>", "<cs> yes delighted my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it was there for me to see when i took over in <e>", "<cs> we talk about moratoriums my lords we inherited those too <e> <s> i do not want any partial history from the noble lord about what anybody took over <e> <s> i took over twice and i know the mess we inherited on those two occasions in relation to what we are discussing and i know the improvements we made and the new planning procedures we introduced <e> <s> the point here is that all this work will land on the local authorities <e> <s> it is they who must produce all this information the kind of information the government want not what they may want and in my view it cannot be called much of an improvement <e> <s> subsection of the new clause reads <e>", "<cs> my lords that reply was very disappointing indeed <e> <s> there is no equity or equality involved in respect of the treatment of local authorities and the scottish special housing association <e> <s> as i pointed out the association is the creature of the secretary of state <e> <s> he appoints the members he can sack them he can direct them <e> <s> he sits down with them every year and decides which programmes should go on <e> <s> if he is not satisfied with their efficiency he just says you will not build this you will not build that <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very important amendment <e> <s> i am vet y glad that the scottish office was awake at the time that i made the point at the committee stage that to put in that it would not apply to scotland when what we are seeking to do is to put a new clause into a purely english act was otiose <e> <s> but i hope that the scottish office realise what they are doing <e> <s> we cannot make one amendment without making sure that all the consequential amendments are also made <e> <s> if any scot wants to know how much of this applies <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down i should like to say that today i heard him answering a question about enterprise zones and saying how anxious he was for developers <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we are in this difficulty because of the words that were used in another place by the leader of that house when he said at column of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i sympathise very much with the noble <e>", "<cs> now we know it is the noble earl who has got in with his coach and horses and with his gateways which must be barred against those coaches and those horses driven by mad district councillors <e> <s> and then he forgot to clear some of the other little openings he was so obsessed with his coach and horses but we will come to that later on <e> <s> but surely to goodness even he appreciates that what is being left to local authorities does not meet the need <e> <s> we are told that the english amendment gave to the english authorities an extra houses and yet we scots have got to be satisfied with <e> <s> if we go away from definitions under the same categories of housing there is no justice in that <e> <s> scotland is not being treated along the same lines <e> <s> i see the noble lord lord strathclyde there <e> <s> he will remember that everything used to be quite clear in relation to scotland and england <e> <s> we got eleven-eightieths <e> <s> if by any chance they built an extra houses there appeared an extra in scotland and no reason was given <e> <s> it was just the automatic working of the goschen formula <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that is a bit beside the point on this particular amendment my lords for the simple reason that although we are dealing here with a clause we are amending only a part of it and the important part as lord bellwin said in relation to the english bill is that the determination by the secretary of state remains <e> <s> but on the simple point for england and wales scotland it does not meet the need <e> <s> in population terms our need is even greater <e> <s> in terms of the countryside our need is even greater <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl allow me to intervene <e> <s> would it not be helpful if we knew what was the statement that he announced <e> <s> it was that the government had decided to widen the exclusion so that genuine elderly persons accommodation is excluded <e>", "<cs> my lords it is that coach and horses of his <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a hope that is going to be deferred if the noble earl knows anything about me and my reactions to sedentary interruptions as we called them in another place <e> <s> he should think again about the actions of the local authorities <e> <s> it is amazing how the government can rush to close up loopholes perfectly legal ones that certain people have found and which cost dearly the generality of the taxpayers or the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed but not surprised because i feel that the noble earl the minister is acting very much under instructions <e> <s> we can sympathise with the government in the troubles that they are in <e> <s> they have got to take this to another place <e> <s> they will have to go through the hoops of second reading committee stage report stage and then third reading <e> <s> it is indeed a very interesting bill <e> <s> there was a time when a very young member for kilmarnock would have kept them there for a long long time <e> <s> the bill is capable of very considerable variation and amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness said that we would not allow it but the trouble is that we shall not have any option because the right will be that of the existing pensioner to sell and to sell to anybody and the council will not come into it <e>", "<cs> and my lords what action will they take <e> <s> will the noble earl tell me when last they took action in respect of a privately owned house <e> <s> he can give me the information about that surely because obviously it has been exercising his mind for a long time <e> <s> when did a local authority take action at law against a private tenant who was overcrowding his house <e> <s> it is a different matter with a slum but we were not speaking about slum houses we were speaking about allowing situations to occur which will create slums where we now have perfectly good old peoples houses <e> <s> that is the problem <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been seeking to be helpful to the noble earl <e> <s> indeed no one could have been more helpful i took the last five amendments together so i am not being obstructive <e> <s> there is a very different principle here <e> <s> it took more than six months for this bill to reach the statute book <e> <s> it went through every stage second reading committee stage report stage as many stages as there are members on the front bench opposite talking away at the present time <e> <s> i was hoping that one of them would listen <e> <s> the bill came to this place and it got second reading committee stage report stage and we could possibly amend it even on third reading and then there would come the question that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> well my lords the noble earl says i do not know what i am talking about <e> <s> i am beginning to wonder whether the noble earl knows what is written down <e> <s> there is no doubt at all about it he admitted it it looks like retrospection and indeed it is retrospection <e> <s> if after a bill has passed after it has become law after it has come into <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the rest of the house is satisfied <e>", "<cs> but i can tell the rest of the house that i spent quite a bit of time in the library and i have here in my hand the conveyancing scotland act and i turn to section <e> <s> what surprises me is why the government missed this very important point right at the start <e> <s> i said earlier that the noble earl and maybe some others as well were so obsessed with the obstructive local authorities that they were closing up main gates and forgetting that there might have been some holes and hedges with the result that this question of doubt in respect of this matter has arisen <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the tone of the ministers speech but i cannot agree with it <e> <s> everything that has happened in relation to getting the million from the scottish new towns shows that this power is unnecessary even from the attitude of the scottish office and of the new towns <e> <s> i do not know where the new towns are in england and wales but i know there is not a new town in scotland further away than two hours drive from the scottish office <e> <s> in fact if they want to meet in glasgow they can all he there within an hour which is indeed what happens <e> <s> the secretary of state know the people concerned because he appoints them <e> <s> scotland is a convenient administrative unit and in respect of these new towns there has been no trouble over getting agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no intention of addressing any further remarks on this bill <e> <s> i think that i have let the house know exactly how i feel about it and how it has been handled over this past week or days <e> <s> however i cannot but respond to the noble earl the minister <e> <s> he said that per cent <e> <s> of local authority houses in scotland are occupied by elderly people by pensioners <e> <s> that is true and most of them are in receipt of rate rebates rent rebates and supplementary benefits and if he thinks for a minute that they are all racing to buy their houses then he is quite out of touch with the public in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords may we be informed whether this amendment applies to scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we are grateful to the minister of state for producing something with which we very nearly agree <e> <s> i just wonder though whether his first amendment is really necessary the amendment which refers to part xii <e> <s> after all when we look at the part which is referred to it says that that part does not refer to scotland and refers us to a reference in a schedule <e> <s> so to my mind there was no real need for him to make that change <e> <s> but i can understand that he was anxious to do something that appeared to indicate that they had read the bill and fully covered it <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed but there is not just one printers error there are about seven or eight <e> <s> at one point it becomes part of the page number of the bill <e> <s> if we had had an <e>", "<cs> my lords even those of us who learned latin at school were a bit confused by this one <e> <s> it goes right through the bill <e> <s> it is right at the beginning as well <e> <s> latin is the normal lunchtime language between civil servants and ministers they do not talk in any other language <e> <s> we could have spotted this <e> <s> anyway the amendments will be helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords i dare not be here and not support this amendment such is the power of the noble baroness <e> <s> but honestly it is only fair and right that in this particular section we should have justice and equity for scotland and for the nursery people <e> <s> it gives me great pleasure to support this amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not want any delay either my lords <e> <s> it is eight months since we first heard of these enterprise zones <e> <s> then what we had in scotland was a battle between part of renfrewshire and clydebank and other places as to who was going to be selected <e> <s> i am appalled at the delay which has already taken place <e> <s> i want to minimise the delay in getting the thing drawn up designated and then functioning <e> <s> the point is that the impact of this zone which is only one little island of industrial dereliction within a greater area has a considerably greater impact than those other areas surrounding it and renfrew and glasgow and dumbarton and milngavie and bearsden all want to have some kind of protection <e> <s> they are not going to get it from the district of clydebank <e> <s> i know the people in clydebank and they are pretty good but when it comes to the industrial concern for the whole area that is a matter for strathclyde by statute <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add a few words from this side of the house <e> <s> i can understand the feelings of noble lords about this bill because many of them think that it is an english bill <e> <s> certainly from the front bench opposite i have had nothing but courtesy and i return nothing but admiration to the noble lord lord bellwin for the way that he has conducted this bill <e> <s> he has shown a knowledge of local government that must have surprised many people who did not know him <e> <s> when we appreciate that this bill has followed the housing bill the cast may have changed at times but not the cast on the front bench because he was there during the housing bill and showed the same mastery of the subject <e> <s> i am delighted about that <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us whether the monies from the eec supplement or replace national monies <e>", "<cs> my lords we thank the noble earl for his explanation of the new rgime but i think that he made rather light of some of the difficulties that have arisen <e> <s> it is probably also worth examining the present difficulties and to ask him what he sees as the future for a very important sector of industry not least scottish industry <e> <s> he will of course appreciate that this has been a long time coming in fact i can remember being involved in some of the negotiations about four years ago <e> <s> noble lords should remember that i am not a fervent marketeer but we are members of it and we must make the best of it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> we consume only about per cent ourselves <e> <s> the less favoured areas have a very big stake in this and these are the areas we must protect <e> <s> first there must be a payment to make up for what we lost in the last year concerning the delay and secondly there is the whole question of the future in respect of the developing export market <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has been away too long <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl appreciate how difficult it is to understand exactly where we are when we are told that a bill is going to be introduced in another place dealing with some of these points and at the same time there is a consultative document <e> <s> what are the policy aspects that are firmly determined which surely must be when the are in a bill and what are the aspects there for consultation <e> <s> he was very short today on targets although my noble friend pressed him twice on that subject <e> <s> i think we want a little more information <e> <s> it is not good enough to say that it will go on more or less the same as it has since the end of the war <e> <s> if the noble earl knows the position since the end of the war he will realise that there has been considerable variation from five years to five years <e> <s> most of us who are interested in forestry were hoping that there would be a considerable stepping up in relation to forestry <e>", "<cs> my lords my first duty is to thank the noble lord the minister of state for this statement <e> <s> i think that it is the first time that the rate support grant order has merited a statement so it is unique <e> <s> i do not know why i think that they are suffering from a guilty conscience in the scottish office and the department of the environment in respect of places where they should have made statements and neglected to do so <e> <s> i shall not mention anything about colleges housing or anything like that <e>", "<cs> that still remains <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl appreciate that i have quite a lot of experience in rate support grant in respect of negotiations with local authorities <e> <s> i used to have a final meeting which usually lasted all day <e> <s> i used to ask a simple question did they accept as fair the total of relevant expenditure <e> <s> secondly did they agree to the governments reduction of per cent <e> <s> in their percentage of that relevant expenditure which comes to just over per cent <e> <s> i should tell the house that per cent <e> <s> is an average if you go to orkney it is probably somewhere nearer per cent <e> <s> and the highland area is fairly high too <e> <s> the reduction of the per cent <e> <s> amounts to very much less when you come to edinburgh and glasgow <e> <s> lastly the important thing and we seldom have disagreements about this within the scottish local authorities is the distribution formula <e> <s> it usually is agreed <e> <s> was it agreed on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble earl lord cromartie should be very pleased about the response to his debate <e> <s> some of us think and it has been stated that it is pretty well mistimed <e> <s> but then those noble lords went on to make rather interesting speeches and not all opposing some of the ideas that he put forward <e> <s> i have been involved in this <e>", "<cs> my lords their status is the same and do not try to suggest otherwise to the lord provosts of edinburgh aberdeen dundee or glasgow <e> <s> they are still as the noble lord lord campbell of croy said lord-lieutenants <e> <s> i thought that that was sometimes a bit unfair to convenors of counties who never had the status <e> <s> this is equally true of a chairman or convenor they can choose their own name in relation to their regions <e> <s> they do not have status and yet their functions are far far heavier than any others <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> the bill was seven years ago but there was a year of preparation <e> <s> then in there was the first election <e> <s> the whole thing got going in about <e> <s> i should have thought that a distinguished member of the liberal party would have appreciated that <e> <s> it was far too early <e> <s> this was said at the time when we reorganised it <e> <s> the previous reorganisation of local government was in <e> <s> in those days my father was a parish councillor <e> <s> they were wiped out <e> <s> i can remember the same thing being said within five years as is being said now it is not as good as what it was <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the first of three identical bills and by the way we have a scottish and rather idiosyncratic way of pronouncing m-i-l-n-g-a-v-i-e we pronounce it mulnguy <e> <s> the people of that part of scotland are very particular about that <e> <s> the point that i wish to raise is as follows <e> <s> shall we have any more than these three <e> <s> this to my knowledge is about the tenth bill that we have had in the last year which is absolutely identical <e> <s> i think that probably most of the district councils have now gone through the expensive procedure of having a private bill obviously with the support of the government to allow them to spend money <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to compete in the opening of harbours but less than years ago i too opened not the fishery part of the harbour but that part that was timeously built for the oil industry <e> <s> i am concerned that whereas the total of the existing authorised borrowing is the new limit is <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to ask her majestys government a question of which i have given private notice <e> <s> the question is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are grateful to the noble earl for his making this statement <e> <s> he probably will agree with me that the gravity of the statement for west-central scotland and the glasgow-paisley area in particular is no less heavy because it has been trailed over recent weeks <e> <s> it means that in an area where there is already per cent <e> <s> unemployment the plus probably another in supply jobs industry and services making it about will drag this up probably to about to per cent <e> <s> unemployment and that is serious indeed particularly in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble earl saw an article in the <e>", "<cs> my lords in many ways this bill is a courageous measure and indeed a wise one <e> <s> i have more than a passing interest in it <e> <s> it comes from the law commission and i was secretary of state when the law commission was set up <e> <s> the origin of its work stems from when the law commission put forward its second programme of reform and included that aim of reforming scottish family law <e> <s> it had already started on reforming scottish family law before considerable prominence was given to the problem of violence in marriage by the select committee report of another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure my noble friend lord peart will be very gratified by the response that has been evoked by his motion that we should discuss dare i say it <e> <s> regional unemployment and the fact that we consider it unacceptable <e> <s> we have won one victory anyway everybody agrees it is unacceptable even the front bench opposite <e> <s> but of course there is another reason why i think my noble friend should be gratified <e> <s> that is because this debate has evoked probably one of the finest maiden speeches that i certainly have heard in my experience in either the other place or here <e> <s> the right reverend prelate charmed us and cheered us with performances at lords <e> <s> he is just as much at home in the lords <e> <s> he knew his subject too <e> <s> his sincerity came through because he was talking about something he lives with and those of us who have very strong christian leanings and feel that the church must be involved in all these things were very grateful indeed to hear what the church in liverpool was doing <e> <s> the peoples problems were their problems <e> <s> it was part of christianity and christianity is part of life <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of books with titles which come from burns <e> <s> i will give the noble earl a few of them if he likes <e> <s> he should come to my next burns supper in kilmarnock <e> <s> of mice and men is one of them <e>", "<cs> i cannot even say that i was using the royal we can i <e>", "<cs> the people of scotland did not vote for them <e> <s> i hope the government will listen to what the people of scotland are now saying that it is time to change their policies <e> <s> they can disguise it with whatever words they like u-turns or anything else <e> <s> the same goes i am perfectly sure for the people of the regions of the north for wales and the west midlands and even the south-east and yorkshire and humberside <e> <s> the government can afford to do it <e> <s> they have got to do it because if they destroy the faith of the people of this country in democracy then they will be doing inestimable damage to the future of this country <e>", "<cs> we are proceeding very well indeed and very amicably <e> <s> there must be something wrong wth the scots today <e> <s> this is sensible <e> <s> i tried to find suitable words that would result in this half-way house <e> <s> however i do not accept the circumstances that the noble earl thought would justify the renunciation <e> <s> i have never heard of circumstances like that <e> <s> it is not a very good basis for a marriage in the first place <e> <s> remember that all this has to be entered into before the home is bought <e> <s> after the home is bought and they are both there it is then that the renunciation should take place to give anybody a right of this kind <e>", "<cs> i think we should have put in the term we all know solicitor and it would have been even clearer <e> <s> on the basis that we are all going to search for better words i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble earl appreciates that under clause <e>", "<cs> we had better change it then <e>", "<cs> i did not think the ministers reply was laboured in any way <e> <s> i found his remarks most interesting <e> <s> for example he told us what clause <e>", "<cs> in that case i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely happy about what the minister has said on the matter <e> <s> there remains the point that the man might have left his spouse he might have disappeared with no intention of returning home <e> <s> how long a period must elapse before the requirements of the bill are satisfied in terms of his having been <e>", "<cs> that being so i think that the government ought to look at the whole of clause <e> <s> we are dealing first with the application for a court order which does the real damage <e> <s> then there is the provision <e>", "<cs> i can only visualise this being applied after a hearing or during the consideration by a court <e> <s> i will take the word of the scottish office <e> <s> if they say the words are unnecessary i am glad to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in the first four lines we have titled spouse non-titled spouse and non-applicant spouse which in the first instance was an afterthought and was put into inverted commas or brackets <e> <s> frankly i had never intended the word other constantly to be used instead of non-applicant spouse <e> <s> if i had sought to change that i would have done so earlier where it is first mentioned even in the last amendment that we were dealing with <e> <s> i am concerned about the immediacy of understanding <e> <s> let us read it as amended <e>", "<cs> i would agree with the noble earl on that <e> <s> we will need to read this with the changes that are already going to be made regarding this question of protection <e> <s> there will be some changes in subsection of this clause which are mainly of a drafting nature <e> <s> i too will have a look and see whether it is right that the anticipation of violence or the words which i hope will lead the court to take action in anticipation of violence should be put in somewhere else <e> <s> i realise that the minister is sympathetic towards the points that have been made and with that in mind i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should have hoped that the court would do that anyway <e> <s> if my amendment were accepted that injunction would still be laid upon the court <e> <s> subsection reads <e>", "<cs> no but i will allow it to be voted down <e>", "<cs> the noble earl kept using the words in a specified area but the bill says in a specified area in which the matrimonial home is situated <e> <s> this is very much more limited than what the noble earl seemed to imply <e> <s> he even used the word scotland <e> <s> if common sense is used i think the sheriffs will be able to specify the area in which the matrimonial home is located in a very much more restricted way than that <e> <s> i certainly could not support this particular amendment of the noble earl <e>", "<cs> i can assure the noble earl in relation to the kind of case we are dealing with and the kind of persons we are dealing with the violent husband who is determined to continue to be violent in respect of both the wife and the children that shortly i am going to move an amendment which he may think is even wider but which i believe to be absolutely essential in relation to the history of the cases which have built up in scotland over a period of time <e> <s> i do not think that there is very much question about the desirability of specified area in which the matrimonial home is situated <e> <s> that really means the street and what the noble and learned lord lord fraser of tullybelton suggested the immediate surroundings of the home <e>", "<cs> but not in the area of the home <e>", "<cs> i think the explanation has been foolproof <e> <s> we have to remember that we are dealing with unreasonable and unhappy people and it may well be that we have to give them both express permission in order to enter and once they have entered if they are to be allowed to take something away it all has to be listed and duly signed and sealed <e> <s> i think one of our difficulties in relation to this is that <e>", "<cs> i am not all that keen at times on half-way houses <e> <s> i am still not convinced of the undesirability of removing these lines but at least the government have gone some way in remoulding this by leaving out the clause <e>", "<cs> what a poor argument <e>", "<cs> it was because i considered it absolutely necessary that i put the amendment down <e> <s> i would not have done so otherwise <e> <s> this is not a question of drafting <e> <s> here was i prepared to defend the noble lords and the scottish offices drafting against the noble earl and he turns round and suggests that i take a different point of view altogether <e> <s> i am putting in the need for this other area point of view and i am very glad of the support from the noble baroness in regard to this <e> <s> it is true that this is what happens <e> <s> i had a letter from the womens aid committee in edinburgh who are dealing with this kind of thing day in and day out <e> <s> they know far more about it than people who are drafting legislation or even than those of us who are sitting solemnly deciding what should be done <e> <s> they feel that protection is required because it does happen a husband has been able to predict where his wife will be at a certain time of the day perhaps collecting the children from school and has gone there and made scenes <e> <s> the same thing applies to the place of work <e>", "<cs> had given notice of his intention to move amendment no <e>", "<cs> i should like to make only one point and that is to draw the governments attention to the fact that even the termination of marriage be it divorce or anything else does not mean to say that the troubles of the wife or the ex-wife are over in respect of the ex-husbands activities and actions <e> <s> it may well be that the continuation of an exclusion order would be required <e>", "<cs> a very unusual conjunction the noble earl lord mansfield and the lord ross of marnock but i welcome on this occasion that the government have adopted the suggestion of a very suitable amendment <e> <s> i think that it would have been unfair to limit the protection or to deny it in respect of caravans and the like <e> <s> i am very glad indeed to have the support of the noble earl as regards this particular amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall gladly withdraw my amendment in the knowledge that the government have realised that they have sinned and that they are going to do penance in some other way <e> <s> the penance is that the poor old draftsmen in the office will sit down for hours and decide what to put in its place <e> <s> i could give them a few ideas but they are there to do the work and we are just here to make them do the work and see that it is right <e> <s> i shall not press this amendment and i am glad to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i cannot understand why the minister says that it was never intended to be permanent <e> <s> scottish local authorities have had the power to transfer tenancies since there were local authority houses <e> <s> who is going to stop them <e> <s> who tried to stop them <e> <s> nobody <e> <s> they can still do it and they will continue to do it <e> <s> what i am suggesting is that in respect of this there is no justification for saying take away this power from these particular people under the schedule which i have before me <e>", "<cs> local authorities are landowners <e> <s> they own the houses <e> <s> it is to them that tenants pay rents and it is they not the courts who decided who the tenants should be in the first place <e> <s> i assure the noble earl that for generations they have been able to change the tenancies <e> <s> indeed recently they have been making them joint tenancies in scotland without reference to the courts or anybody else <e> <s> i really do not understand the ministers attitude on this <e>", "<cs> it is being done now and they have been doing it for long enough <e> <s> the answer to the noble earls question is yes that is what they are there for <e> <s> the people elected them and they have been carrying out these responsibilities for long enough <e> <s> i am surprised that the minister refuses to see the point <e> <s> there are two ways of dealing with this issue one simple and costing little or nothing <e> <s> but no if it must be done then it shall be done in a costly way <e> <s> the noble earl speaks like a lawyer <e> <s> he should have declared an interest <e> <s> i am approaching this as a simple humble peasant who has not been in the law courts in his life <e> <s> i know something about local authorities however and how the people of scotland react <e>", "<cs> i am more than slightly worried because we are dealing with clause relating to the power of arrest whereas everything that has been said by the minister of state seemed to apply to what will happen after the arrest which is dealt with in clause which we have not yet reached <e> <s> is the minister saying that he is to look at clause and clause or is he satisfied with clause and does his concern lie with what follows after arrest <e> <s> a matter which is not before us at the moment <e> <s> all that is at present before us is clause indeed only the first line of the clause <e> <s> i should like to know the position <e>", "<cs> i almost had tears in my eyes when i heard about this trivial case <e> <s> how did the noble earl know it was trivial <e> <s> how did he know the intent or purpose of the person going to

appreciates the problem and the difficulties that the courts will be in if we leave the matter entirely to them <e> <s> they are the people who will be blamed or otherwise <e> <s> but i appreciate the

amendment comprehends and accepts amendment no <e> <s> i welcome it <e>", "<cs> yes the noble lord was here but not heard we are glad to say <e>", "<cs> i just said no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the government must be very pleased indeed by the general welcome that has been given to the bill this follows a similar welcome given in another place and indeed co-operative efforts to improve the bill although it is true to say that the government had second thoughts on one decision that was made in the committee there <e> <s> there is no doubt at all of the value of the bill but let us please not overestimate it <e> <s> the trouble at the moment about the fishing industry arises from the changes that have taken place within a relatively short period the changes in relation to the deep sea fleet by the dispute with iceland and the fact that we did not come to any settlement satisfactory to us <e> <s> i must say that although it was urged on me at that time i was a fishery minister at that time that we should allow the eec to come in and help us i am afraid that they did not help us to a very great extent <e> <s> that was the first thing <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister make it absolutely clear that everything she has just said applies only to england <e> <s> if she wants some real guidance on how to deal with this problem will she look at what happens in

spouses applicant spouses titled spouses non-titled spouses and we want a little bit of simplicity in this bill <e> <s> it will mean that they are not entitled and we say that <e> <s> why do we manufacture this new suggestion which is so confusing if not embarrassing to your lordships <e> <s> i support the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble earl for the amendment

swearing as the bill is at the moment her rights <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble earl for the changes he has made <e> <s> this certainly meets the point that i made <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl does not take too seriously his defeat in the first instance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am equally happy that the amendment is on the marshalled list and i agree with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether to be gratified by all that is being said <e> <s> i think i had an amendment down at the committee stage suggesting that the proper word or the most simple word would be other and i drew

respondent and non-applicant <e> <s> it might be all right for lawyers but i do not think that the ordinary person reading the bill would be confused by applicant and non-applicant <e> <s> having said

meets the point that i raised <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the wording is not mine it comes from the scottish law commission <e> <s> indeed it goes further <e> <s> the noble earl complained that the words evidential facts would require definition <e> <s> i am happy to tell him that the scottish law commission go on to define evidential facts however i do not want further to elaborate a statute

further to complicate it <e> <s> my feeling about this bill is one of danger and it was underlined when i heard the minister of state say that anyone using the new rights given here will have to consult lawyers before they exercise them <e> <s> i think that very fact and the complexity of this matter will mean that many of the people who would otherwise benefit will be put off <e> <s> so i want the statute to be as simple as possible <e> <s> i know that there are difficulties in achieving that and i take what the noble earl said about corroboration so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> or the husband my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that i said the exercising of the right <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very nice to hear the minister of state say that but

aware of the fact that we cannot go back prior to the tenants rights etc <e> <s> scotland act because that is where a certain amount of the trouble comes in <e> <s> it comes in on the basis of the fact that the tenant now has security of tenure and the tenant is the husband <e>", "<cs> my lords i approve of this <e> <s> the only reason i hesitated was because it was probably wrong of me to try to look at this and the next amendment late last night when i was preoccupied with matters of the prayer book <e> <s> i just wonder how this is going to read after it is finished <e> <s> we have two amendments nos <e> <s> and both of which say <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know what the governments attitude to this is but i could not accept the amendment because i have a certain respect for old scottish phrases and their meaning <e> <s> the amendment says the couple <e>", "<cs> habit and repute is the well-known phrase my lords but it refers to people who in what was scottish law were actually married they were not living as man and wife but were married and the situation was that people living together could call themselves by their names if there was no other bar to marriage they were married and that was legal in scotland <e> <s> the noble earl has put the two things together namely cohabitation and this perfectly respectable phrase in scottish law and life <e>", "<cs> i am

judiciary <e> <s> it will be absolutely open to the judiciary first to turn down the application or secondly to grant two months three months four months or six months <e> <s> i am prefectly sure that within his legal experience the minister of state must have come across cases where it would be unfair to differentiate to this extent and to limit the initial period of protection to three months with the periodic trailing to the court for another six months another six months and another six months <e> <s> why not leave it to the courts <e> <s> why not trust the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords

when i said the applicant partner had no right to apply for a change of tenancy <e> <s> the partner has a right <e> <s> i was misled by the fact that the noble lord lord drumalbyn in an amendment that he did not move was going to make a change in respect of clause to limit that right <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that i am very glad indeed that the minister has resisted the amendment to leave out the whole clause <e> <s> it does not mean to say that we approve of the tendency of people today to by-pass marriage for one reason or another but let us remember what we are dealing with and what led originally to the bill was the need for protection <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are all grateful to the minister of state for his handling of this bill <e> <s> he lost the head on just one occasion

statements made in another place we should carry on until about three oclock <e> <s> of course if challenged i daresay we could do it with a few suitable interventions all round to keep me going but

as well for me not to prolong my speech on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i would ask my noble friend not to say hear hear <e> <s> the fact is of course that i like other secretaries of state have had experience of being a forestry minister <e> <s> i was one for eight years and one thing i certainly discovered very quickly was the uniqueness of the partnership in forestry between the industry

felled scythed by a hurricane <e> <s> what a problem it was for the industry the people who were marketing the owners the forestry commission and the contractors <e> <s> i can remember how well that

am i to disagree with the government when they are prepared to submit themselves to the scrutiny of parliament in what they do <e> <s> the only thing is that as it is the negative procedure probably nobody will notice it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> no i am afraid that i do not accept very much of what the noble lord has said <e> <s> he came down eventually to what i had been trying to suggest that my amendment would be of greater benefit to the appellant ratepayer than the formula produced by the government <e> <s> that with all due respect was my intention it was not a trap <e>", "<cs> his chance of power has gone <e> <s> the minister of state has come back <e> <s> we should not be led too far along the path of optimism when the noble lord says that he is

from the noble lord lord drumalbyn <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for all the help i have received in connection with the amendment <e> <s> it is a matter about which i feel strongly in view of the experience of friends and others but mainly its relevance now is due to the whole change in price and attitude to the installation of central heating <e> <s> there were people who installed oil-fired central heating and whose valuation went up so they ripped it out because they could not afford it <e> <s> where they were in the fortunate position of having retained coal fires they relied on those

that one can apply to the valuation officer but with all due respect if there has been no material change in respect of the house itself then one need not bother applying to the assessor <e>", "<cs> all i sought was information and i have now received information <e> <s> i am appalled that we cannot make sense of the realities in scotland by means of the valuation acts themselves and it <e>",

whole of scotland have kept within the government guidelines <e> <s> so if the government believe in the guidelines all the local authorities are spending excessively <e>", "<cs> i am concerned about

were certainly the cause <e>", "<cs> the only comment that should like to make as regards the girvan and the ncb case is that although the minister thinks that it has been finalised and everybody is happy i am afraid that that is not true in respect of the local board or at least one of its very influential members <e> <s> it is the type of case which could arise elsewhere because pits in

words <e>", "<cs> i said that the noble earls knowledge of english law was probably greater than his knowledge of scottish law <e>", "<cs> there is only one point about this matter <e> <s> the actual clause that we are amending gives powers of disposal <e> <s> to the extent that i am still in favour of powers of disposal i am not opposing the principle of the bill but it would seem to be the implication of what the minister says that any amendment at all is opposing the principle of the bill <e> <s> that is going a bit far in enshrining this new principle that a minister can sell anything he likes to anybody he likes for any purpose that he likes and for any sum that he likes <e> <s> if that is going to be construed as the principle of the bill then i am opposed to it but i am still in favour of the power of the commission on instruction on the authority of the minister to dispose of land that is not needed for forestry and indeed could better be used for other purposes but not on the kind of terms given here <e>", "<cs> i do not think i should <e> <s> if it is novel but sensible why baulk at it <e> <s> as for any suggestion of what i would have done at new st andrews house i

this bill in the first place and i see nothing constitutionally wrong about consulting and getting the agreement of the forestry commission <e>", "<cs> it would be equally interesting to learn which department it is because there are three ministers involved a scottish english and welsh <e>", "<cs> the air which i suggested earlier had been blue but had become red has now evidently become scarlet

commission it is not the secretary of state for scotland the secretary of state for wales or the minister of agriculture in england <e> <s> neither the english minister nor the secretary of state for

i will seek to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> under the present section they can do that at the moment <e> <s> they can dispose of such land <e>", "<cs> no quite wrong <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble earl is right <e> <s> one of the troubles is that the minister under the present section has a limited power enabling him to dispose of land <e> <s> he is now seeking to take a power which is far too sweeping <e> <s> it is unlimited <e> <s> it is open-ended <e> <s> what we have been trying to do on this side of the committee and in other parts of the committee as well is in some way to limit this <e> <s> the trouble is and i do not know whether noble lords have appreciated this that they start by wiping out what is already there in section which gives the minister power to sell land which in his opinion is not needed or ought not to be used for forestry again <e> <s> of course forestry ministers and the forestry commission have been doing this for years <e>", "<cs> well i have not but it is not beyond the wit of a place with the experience and knowledge of your lordships house to look at the problem and see a way around it <e> <s> it is not a case of having any cards up my sleeve <e> <s> if i had cards up my sleeve i would have played them a long time ago <e> <s> but i am not given to that kind of attitude <e> <s> we have a problem <e> <s> we have to find a solution <e>

we are not all anxious to be in this privileged committee but i thought this was the point that the noble lord lord mackie was going to ask the minister about this <e> <s> i think we are entitled to know <e>", "<cs> could i put the record straight <e> <s> there is a transfer of woods act <e>", "<cs> the error is in the wording of the amendment in which there is a reference to the crown commissioners <e> <s> this is fairly obviously a reference to the forestry commission <e>", "<cs> here we have this reference to a letter part of which has been read out and the promise in respect of which is that it should be placed within your lordships library <e> <s> i do not think any assembly is prepared to accept this kind of thing <e> <s> in the first place we have not seen it we have only heard part of it and we are relying entirely on what we could comprehend from that <e> <s> in any case i have never heard that it was acceptable in respect of bills with which i have been concerned where the opposition always insisted that they should see these things in full and very often demand and have been granted their demand that it should be included in a schedule <e>", "<cs> i am very glad indeed that the minister has taken up this position <e> <s> so far as i know powers of compulsory purchase by the forestry commission have not been exercised in scotland <e> <s> i asked about that a long time ago but it may well be that the noble earl is better informed although he cannot tell us at the moment where it was exercised <e>", "<cs> no the amendment does not apply to scotland <e>", "<cs> if that were so and if i understand correctly what the noble lord feels he really should have voted against clause stand part because if you vote against clause stand part you go back to the position as it is at present <e> <s> that gives the ministers power to tell the forestry commission to dispose of land which is not suitable for forestry or which could be better used in another way <e> <s> what is done here is to give them overriding powers over anything at all without any limit <e> <s> the noble lord asks are we seeking red revolution are we terrified by nightmares <e> <s> i can tell him that the document that i have was sent to me by the national trust for scotland <e> <s> is the trusts fears justified in relation to balmacara inverewe kintail or brodick <e>", "<cs> it is the right of pre-emption <e> <s> they have that right <e> <s> it may be that what the government have done turned out well from the point of view of the forestry commission and those who have an interest indirectly through having sold to the forestry commission <e> <s> i am sure that if that right were there and was exercised in respect of those areas so far as the national trust are concerned they would be delighted <e> <s> it would be the forestry commission who would pay and not the national trust or the national trust for scotland <e> <s> i think this is very sensible <e> <s> they cannot do it without the say so of the treasury <e> <s> i do not know whether people realise the extent to which the treasury already confines every activity of the forestry commission through the forestry fund <e> <s> we shall come to that in my next amendment <e> <s> i am far from satisfied with the answer that the minister has given <e> <s> i do not know how my noble friend feels about this amendment whether we should press it to a division <e>", "<cs> i was talking about the general reaction we have had from the minister to everything else <e> <s> we have let him off with so much and got so little from him <e> <s> the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe was so disgusted that he did not even move his amendment <e>", "<cs> yes a long time ago <e> <s> there is more than one person agreed about the shortness of the dinner hour and i am not talking about myself <e> <s> i managed to get to the bar of the house to save my amendments affer two very important amendments were swept aside <e> <s> this amendment reads <e>", "<cs> i think we are grateful for small mercies in tidying up but it prompts the question as to why the tidying up did not go further because i am perfectly sure that a full reading of this clause would show that there is a little more tidying up to be done and included in that tidying up i think would be something to do with subsection with which i should deal in the next amendment if i proposed to move it <e>", "<cs> we are very grateful to the minister for giving us at least something we can watch in the future to see whether he was right or wrong <e> <s> he said that as disposals increase the grant-in-aid will increase <e> <s> we shall watch it <e>", "<cs> for reasons that escape me i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord hughes is quite right i found the reply very unsatisfactory <e> <s> i cannot understand this repetition of the word flexibility as though it has some special virtue of its own bearing in mind that we are being reasonably flexible <e> <s> we are giving the government two years delay and remembering that the government will probably have to make up their mind about it at least a year before the revaluation because they must start some time earlier in order to get the job done in time for that particular year they will need to start virtually next year probably although we have not had the information that they are going to delay for whatever period they make up their mind about <e> <s> bearing in mind that might be a difficult year because it will probably be the year of a general election and a general election means work for the electoral officer who in scotland is also the assessor and his staff there could be difficulties <e> <s> they would need to know fairly soon whether or not the government are going to delay <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a question of the sinister quality that i am concerned about <e> <s> i am concerned about the actual facts as to how things will turn out <e> <s> i am certainly glad to notice that there has to be consultation with the scottish valuation advisory council <e> <s> remember one of the duties of the scottish valuation advisory council when it was originally created in the act was to try to get uniformity of valuation between property and property not a ratio within an area <e>", "<cs> you must not mix up friends with colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i was allowed to withdraw an amendment by speech <e> <s> since i am not allowed to withdraw it i shall just sit still <e>", "<cs> my lords like it or not the sweeping powers are there <e> <s> they remain <e> <s> it may be that the intention of the government is not to use them in a sweeping way that i can understand but unfortunately these words are there and nothing could be more sweeping than <e>", "<cs> my lords i am no lawyer but when the minister of state suggests that this is all very well quite unnecessary that it is all covered by regulations and all we need to do is change the regulations all i can suggest to him is that he reads section <e>", "<cs> the section has been repealed <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly have a look at it before we come to the next stage of the bill <e> <s> i know what i am talking about in relation to this question of the informal discussions <e> <s> i had two informal discussions with two separate people who came to me who were anxious that i should not proceed with an appeal <e> <s> the noble lord probably knows or the scottish valuation advisory council will know that they were probably deluged by appeals from the part of the town i lived in because of what was considered very considerable unfairness in terms of valuation <e> <s> i am still to be supplied with a list of relevant properties on which the valuation was based <e>", "<cs> you are very lucky <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount allow me <e> <s> the one thing the region does not do has no control over pays nothing at all towards is housing <e> <s> that is a district function <e>", "<cs> the act i think we will discover was a consolidation measure and the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside who until recently i called my noble friend will find that the power to which he referred has been in existence for a very long time and certainly was there prior to the labour government of which he spoke <e> <s> i can also tell him that that power was never used because local authorities pretty well accepted the role and spirit of the understandings that existed between central and local government <e> <s> that has been true until this very time and the more this government have been shouting for the past couple of years about how they were going to do something about it the more they made confrontation with some authorities absolutely inevitable <e>", "<cs> my lords the point was that it was bringing forward into a bill powers that were already there <e> <s> there is a joint committee i was once a member of it of this house and the other house appointed to deal with consolidation and the one thing that one cannot do with consolidation is to amend <e> <s> it might well be that our names were connected with it because we happened to be there at the time and to that extent we are culpable <e> <s> but the government had a consolidation measure last year and now they are amending a part of that statute in this bill <e> <s> one could not do that in a consolidation bill one can do it only through new legislation <e> <s> that was my interpretation of the situation <e> <s> it might well be that as a whole it was not a consolidation bill but the matter that we are now considering was certainly included <e> <s> the government have admitted that the power in the act has been there since the s <e> <s> your lordships can take it from me that it was there before <e>", "<cs> my lords nothing that i would insert in relation to drafting could make the bill any worse than it is at the present time particularly in relation to the amendments which are proposed to this clause <e> <s> but far be it from me to cause any more troubled half-hours to draftsmen <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord hughes said it is true the word is not in the bill and to that extent i prefer words which are actually in the statute rather than words which are only implied <e> <s> the act only makes reference to an opportunity of making representations <e> <s> the noble lord went on to say that local authorities would be able to make a report before the house of commons but it is not the local authorities who report to the house of commons it is the government who do that <e> <s> the government are commanded by statute because the act states <e>", "<cs> my lords i am fascinated by the tender regard that the minister of state has for the local authorities that he does not want me to put in words which might make it easier for the secretary of state and involve the local authorities in much greater difficulties <e> <s> the trouble is that the words are already there <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble earl would look at the paragraph we are amending <e> <s> the original words which were spoken about in section of the act were <e>", "<cs> i do not agree with everything that the noble earl has said and i do not understand this point of it being far too late <e> <s> the report has to be made anyway <e> <s> he cannot get the order without the report and the report must contain this information <e> <s> why does the noble earl suggest it is far too late at that time <e> <s> i do not think it makes sense what he has been saying about that <e> <s> it has to be made public at that time <e> <s> i have been trying to ensure that the things which are said are actually included in the report <e> <s> remember that the report is not in this statute that we are considering but it was in the original statute <e> <s> this is one of the difficulties about trying to mould a statute that is already there and to import new powers and then take it for granted that certain things will follow <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not surprised i am astounded by some of the reasoning <e> <s> let me take the last reason that local government has a part to play in the procedure of rate support grant that they are asked how they feel about it and that their response is included in the report that is laid before parliament <e> <s> the noble earl said that local ratepayers should not have a statutory power in relation to voted money <e> <s> but we are not dealing only with the question of voted money <e> <s> we are dealing with the power which is given to the secretary of state to refuse local authorities their traditional right to raise monies to pay for their services <e> <s> not only have they had that right the government used to insist that they put money into those services <e> <s> for about years a housing subsidy could not be obtained unless the local ratepayers also paid a certain sum <e> <s> it was part of the bargain <e> <s> you got a subsidy from the government only if you provided money levied from the local ratepayers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not see it in that light because i read subsection and it is that which gives the power in relation to the reassessment of the lower rate not subsection <e> <s> at the present time in scotland once the rate is fixed one cannot declare a supplementary rate to get further money or declare a new rate which is lower and give money back <e> <s> that is not on in scotland <e> <s> i gather that in england and wales a supplementary rate can be declared and so more monies can be obtained from the people <e>", "<cs> my lords in no way do i approve of unnecessary undesirable and extravagant expenditure but it is this house that has placed the local authorities in the position they are in apart from the other place by wishing upon them a tremendous number of duties and insisting that they maintain certain standards <e> <s> that cannot be done without spending money <e> <s> because of the national aspect the government have supported them up to a point but this government have manipulated the formula in respect of rate support grant in the calculation of the expenditure that they have to make which they have kept deliberately low and then they have even more deliberately reduced their share of that expenditure <e> <s> the result is that there must be an increase in rates but the responsibility for that is not that of the local authorities it is the responsibility of the people who manipulated the formula and that is the government themselves <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble viscount was not present earlier to hear about what was included and what was not included in respect of categories of expenditure and he will be sad to know that one <e>", "<cs> no my lords i think the country and scotland are entitled to know exactly how determined the government are to get this vicious legislation and scotland should have the right to know who votes for it and who does not <e> <s> i have no intention of withdrawing it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the minister did not deny the figures which form the basis of my amendment <e> <s> he suggested that we should keep in measure with increases in earnings <e> <s> the government lay down a rent figure to local authorities <e> <s> in rate support grant calculations the government are not going to support any increase of wages or salaries that go beyond per cent <e> <s> as i have pointed out rates are bound to go up on that basis because of the increase that has been allowed in respect of teachers firemen local authority workers and others in negotiations in which the main voice has been the voice of the govern <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what i expected <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that it will infuriate a certain person in a certain part of scotland not unknown to his noble friend who is sitting beside him <e> <s> i put the amendment down only because this particular person had never heard of it and what idiots they call the people who wished this upon scotland <e> <s> i am not going to mention any names at all <e> <s> i am going to send this person a copy of <e>", "<cs> my lords i have raised this matter even though the government have it in mind to do something about it <e> <s> they realise that there is a problem <e> <s> the hope was that a draft bill would be introduced this session <e> <s> local authorities are now led to believe that it will be introduced next session <e> <s> if that bill were introduced next session power will be in the hands of local authorities to ban particular processions upon certain conditions at the earliest by the year <e> <s> nobody will stand up in this house and say that the kind of trouble we have had in the past in scotland will not occur during the remainder of and throughout <e> <s> the minister says that this clause is unnecessary yet at the same time he says that it is desirable <e> <s> he says that it is unnecessary because the public order act can be used <e> <s> but that act can be used only if in seeking to ban one particular procession all processions for a period are banned <e> <s> there is certainly the question of exemptions or exceptions but as the government have themselves admitted this is a very difficult area in relation to words which may allow one type of procession to escape a seemingly total ban <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the government are absolutely sure that these words are right and that they themselves are covered <e> <s> i am more worried about the local authorities and the liabilities into which they enter <e> <s> it may be preparatory that having obtained the consent a certain amount of expenditure is involved before they enter into the contract <e> <s> i am perfectly sure that every local authority will look at these words very carefully in relation to what the minister has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not think that i would require to venture a word at all on this subject <e> <s> i really thought that the government would have accepted this amendment <e> <s> if noble lords who are now present had been here earlier they would have heard exactly the kind of attitude that the government have been taking towards local authorities and local authorities expenditure <e> <s> this is a scottish bill although i think most of the house is now composed of people who are generally speaking less interested in scotland <e> <s> but they see an opportunity within the bill that opens up the whole field of local authority work to do something in respect of the disabled <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the government have shown themselves very responsive indeed to the powerful pressure brought to bear on committee stage <e> <s> the government did the right thing and said that they would look at it again <e> <s> if they had not given that assurance i think they would have lost the division and it would have been amended <e> <s> but the government have used the time well <e> <s> the minister not only looked at it again but has produced a reasonable set of amendments and i am grateful for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i can appreciate the importance of keeping commercial negotiations confidential but i think that that point could have been got over by means of a slight change in respect of the amendment itself <e> <s> i know that the government had very considerable sympathy with this point but if what we have been told is the ministers view about it i shall not divide the house this evening and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had explained that i have no sympathy with the action taken by the majority party on kirkcaldy district council but what they did was legal <e> <s> we may think that it was not the right behaviour but it was legal <e> <s> what the aggrieved parties then proceeded to do was to go and see what was going on in the committees <e> <s> but not being authorised to be there as members of the committee or as observers they were not there officially <e> <s> the question now arises what is it they have done in not officially attending but claiming an allowance <e> <s> from my recollection of the intention of the act what they did was illegal <e> <s> it is going to be settled by this test case and the noble lord the minister says the best thing to do is to wait if the matter is settled to the advantage of the authority and as it was intended by parliament then that is that and nothing need follow <e>", "<cs> my lords that being so would it not be much more appropriate in the question itself to refer to english supporters rather than british supporters <e>", "<cs> my lords the house should be grateful to the noble earl lord selkirk as should the original sponsors of the bill in another place for taking on the onerous task of seeing this bill through your lordships house and for treating us to a very clear lucid and comprehensive introduction to the bill <e> <s> like the noble earl i believe it is a pity that this bill received no second reading in the other place because when one reads the debates at committee and report stage in another place one does not get a full picture of the proposals within their full setting as a further extension or projection of the act and its relevance to the present day <e> <s> i am sincere in offering my congratulations to the noble earl <e> <s> indeed i feel that i should extend those congratulations to the government because there is no doubt but that this is not a private members bill it is a government bill <e> <s> it has been known in the past for governments to persuade a private member to take over a bill for which they cannot find time in their legislative programme <e> <s> this is obviously the case in respect of this bill <e> <s> i notice for instance that when the noble earl lord selkirk sought an explanation he did not go to the sponsor of the bill but to the scottish office <e> <s> how very sensible of him in respect of this particular bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the helicopter flight must have created a lot of noise <e>", "<cs> my lords with this statement local government in scotland as we know it responsible and independent and accepted as such is at an end <e> <s> hitherto it has been the advice given to electors in scotland that the hope of the conservative party was to make scotlands local government more financially independent and responsible <e> <s> you could paper the walls of this chamber big as it is with white papers and papers of speeches made to that effect by members of the party opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the minister does not want to mislead the house and those who are unfamiliar with the bill that is now passing through the house but it is not simply a question of being unreasonable and excessive <e> <s> there are also certain comparisons to be made and regard to be had to financial situations and economic situations of comparable local authorities as well as all kinds of other things <e> <s> we have been given no information at all about the seven which have been selected <e>", "<cs> there was none my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords there must be very few bills of this importance of this complexity and so open to the amendment of so many facets that have gone through this house without amendment <e> <s> well one amendment <e> <s> i am the first to praise the organising ability and the stamina of those who at very considerable inconvenience to themselves stayed until about a quarter to one one morning they were able to impress upon the government that if they did not at least make a promise and hold to that promise they would be defeated as they would have been that night <e> <s> that is the only thing that has been done on this bill <e> <s> there must be very few bills in respect of which that kind of thing has ever happened even in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords my recollection is that when we came to that part of the committee stage the noble lord was not here <e> <s> if he spoke i will gladly withdraw <e> <s> my memory is fairly good and i was here during the whole proceedings <e> <s> the only contribution we got at report stage was i think from the noble viscount lord massereene who spoke about strathclyde and must be very disappointed that strathclyde is one of the good authorities and not one of the bad authorities as he expected <e>", "<cs> my lords a mistake was made by those who were marshalling these matters <e> <s> if the noble earl will look he will see that the word for on line comes before insert a at the end of line so the one that relates takes precedence in relation to the actual mention in the line <e> <s> so we take amendments nos <e> <s> and together and then we come back to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i have not neglected <e>", "<cs> i can tell the noble earl that the murray that gave him his first title the first mansfield in his title came from down there <e>", "<cs> all right i am sorry <e>", "<cs> yes i know it is but when <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has said that they were able to dispose of the part that was not used for forestry <e> <s> i am continuing within my amendment that power so that they could still do what he thinks it is right to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am retaining the power <e> <s> i shall read the words that are being retained <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept most of what the noble earl has said <e> <s> the minister says that there are certain doubts about who will determine whether or not certain aspects of this amendment will be carried out in relation to rational management and so on <e> <s> the situation is exactly the same because i am leaving in subsection the words the minister may <e> <s> it is the minister may that must be satisfied as in the present statute <e> <s> so if there are difficulties in my amendment there are difficulties in the present statute <e>", "<cs> he did not my lords <e> <s> let him remember something about the forestry developments in the highlands the forestry developments in the borders and the forestry developments in ayrshire dumfriesshire and galloway and what we have achieved there and let us retain that as much as we can <e> <s> for that reason and for that reason alone i am moving this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl asks me why we should treat scotland differently <e> <s> why did we treat scotland differently in the last bill we were discussing today <e> <s> why did we not treat it the same as england <e> <s> it concerned local government and dealt with the same kind of services as obtain in england and wales but the treatment in respect of scotland was far more harsh <e> <s> why did we treat scotland differently in the forestry act which i have just quoted <e> <s> section indicates how a minister can dispose of land at the present time <e> <s> they are not going to be bothered about subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords it is distressing to find that the government are not prepared to accept this <e> <s> the noble earl asks who is going to decide whether it is rational land management <e> <s> we can easily get rid of that <e> <s> if he will accept it i will put down a simple amendment and the simple amendment will be of the kind that the government are very fond of saying that in the opinion of the minister <e> <s> that will save him from any vexatious customer who comes along seeking to frustrate the beneficial and generous desires of the government in relation to the disposal of land <e> <s> unfortuntaely the minister is not himself taking notes but i am sure that the noble lord lord lyell is doing it for him <e> <s> we have been <e>", "<cs> i know my lords <e> <s> it is not until july <e> <s> but let us see whether he is worth it otherwise we might remove him before july <e> <s> this is the way in which he could endear himself to the house to say that what ross is saying is sensible and that he agrees with it <e> <s> i will put down an amendment protecting the minister dearly as i love him <e> <s> on that understanding i am prepared to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> and a scot founded it too <e>", "<cs> my lords on past occasions i have called the minister of state a master of the infelicitous phrase and i am perfectly sure that my noble friend lady white will appreciate from her own present experience that maybe i have had some justification for saying that to him <e> <s> now he tells us that this would be too restrictive and indeed so did the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the provision refers to the land the last noun before the word it the land shall not be disposed of <e> <s> i used to teach english but it may well be that the fact that i did so in scotland <e>", "<cs> it could mean all sorts of things <e> <s> the minister is an english lawyer and he had no difficulty about it but if we want to nit pick we shall always be able to find something like that <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord lord sandford we are not legislating in the proper way <e> <s> i am sure that members who have just come into the house who have not been here during our discussions because they have been detained elsewhere will be mystified about the letters <e> <s> this is not how we should legislate <e> <s> we have heard about the letters <e> <s> how many people have seen them <e> <s> i have not even had time to read properly the last one which i received because i was involved in a piece of legislation which came before us for consideration prior to this legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords the national trust certainly want it and it is by no means academic <e> <s> how many times has this compulsory purchase power been used <e>", "<cs> i am obliged for that information my lords it has never been used which means they are removing a power which has never been used <e> <s> nevertheless its use was once threatened and that was by the noble lords own government <e> <s> that happened in in relation to something that occurred in the north of scotland <e> <s> thus it is not academic and probably the national trust would not have asked for it but for the behaviour of the then tory government in when they threatened compulsorily to purchase a piece of land that was held inalienably <e>", "<cs> i wondered what new clause was being talked about when the noble earl spoke to amendment no <e> <s> and when i heard the noble lord lord dulverton withdraw the new clause i was even more mystified <e> <s> now we have received an adequate explanation <e> <s> it is a forestry act which we are amending <e> <s> the forestry act has antecedents which go way back to <e> <s> we are now in and in the proposed new clause a we see <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are grateful to the minister of state for repeating the statement that was made elsewhere <e> <s> indeed i am very happy that i am in a position to congratulate the chairman of the committee a former colleague of old days lord stodart of leaston <e> <s> it is not exactly a world-shattering statement but then we need not blame the committee of inquiry for that because they were governed and limited by the terms of reference which precluded a major examination of the kind of changes that the minister said he really could not advise <e>", "<cs> i think that that is fair enough <e> <s> i feel strongly about it from the point of view that when a secretary of state has to give a direction to a body which is under his control but which has statutory obligations and statutory rights whether the secretary of state should do it or whether the person who receives the direction should do it is a moot point the correct thing should be for the attention of the public to be drawn to the fact that a direction was given by the secretary of state <e> <s> it could be quite important and it is not the sort of thing that should be hidden away <e> <s> after all if we set up a body to do a certain thing and then we discover that it has to receive directions from the secretary of state either to do something or perhaps not to do something from the point of view of safeguarding the commission itself and of safeguarding the secretary of state so that the people should know just exactly what it is all about that should be recorded somewhere <e>", "<cs> that was my guess <e> <s> in view of the commitment that has been given that the first part of the amendment is fully covered and that the noble earl the minister will think about the second part i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it was only an effort and i thought it would be helpful i thought we could find a way round the suggestion about boundary changes though the minister made me jump a little when he used that phrase because it is not very popular around glasgow at the present time nor is it popular in other parts of the political world <e> <s> perhaps the amendment would not achieve what i had hoped it would <e> <s> nevertheless i hope the message has got home to the government and the countryside commission that they must work to get the co-operation of the local authorites not just the planning authorities but the district authorities as well because there may be conflict in one way or another within a region <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it was <e>", "<cs> that is not surprising <e> <s> it does not satisfy me because i am not satisfied that we should spend so much money and get so little access in return for preservation of scenic beauty which never was endangered in the first instance and was never likely to be endangered <e> <s> it is not the question of the rightness or the wrongness of the statute <e> <s> of course all this was fully discussed and all the information which the minister has repeated was given by mr rifkind in another place <e> <s> i accept that and i accept the value of the statute but i do not like to see the abuse of a statute <e> <s> this is why i am afraid <e>", "<cs> that was a very strong appeal <e> <s> may i say that i noticed particularly that every time the noble earl tried to say impracticable he actually said impractical <e> <s> perhaps he has not been able to work out the difference between impractical and impracticable and that is what is there <e> <s> i was secretary of state for a long time and i interfered a lot with the drafting <e> <s> this must be one that slipped up <e> <s> that is all i can say about that <e> <s> i did not find his argument at all convincing <e> <s> is it not much simpler to say that they were not able to do it <e> <s> what is the difficulty about it <e> <s> none whatever <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble earl must stick to this word impracticable which even he finds difficulty in differentiating from yet another word which was impractical <e> <s> let us not have a division but i am prepared to stand by my own drafting this version of the drafting and have the thing put to the committee <e>", "<cs> i am not very happy about this one <e> <s> i am concerned about the extensive area and whether you take a substantial part of it <e> <s> a substantial part of an extensive area must be fairly substantial <e> <s> then again when we look at the words devoted to the recreational needs of the public it seems to me that many people would think of a kind of playing area <e> <s> obviously that is not what is intended <e> <s> this is an area for walking and climbing and there will be pretty well free access apart from certain areas where there are limitations on access such as private land <e> <s> but for the greater part of it a regional park will be open for the public to go anywhere <e> <s> that is what is really meant <e> <s> otherwise it would not be a regional park <e>", "<cs> i wish that the noble earl had anticipated my next amendment because his conception of a regional park is of a great area that is not owned by the council whereas my idea is different <e> <s> i keep the word substantial and my next amendment would read <e>", "<cs> it is a great pity that it is twenty minutes to eleven and it is a great pity that the noble earl and i are the only two scotsmen taking part in this debate <e>", "<cs> well we are talking about back benchers <e> <s> the government may have ideas they have spent seven months looking at the stodart report so i think they may well have some ideas about it but i do not know what is meant by the special regional parks <e> <s> and i have read the report of the committee stage in another place and there are very many people there who do not know <e> <s> i do not know what the noble earl knew about these special parks before this bill was wished on him but i do not think the conception is right yet <e>", "<cs> but i do not think that the government have been logical in relation to the stodart report <e> <s> we should remember that stodart set out and was asked to set out by the government to consider the overlapping functions functions that were given both to the district and to the region <e> <s> here the noble earl comes along and tells us we will have overlapping functions in respect of parks and in respect of the provision of by-laws so far as i understood what he said although i should like to see that in cold print before i make up my mind about it <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble earl appreciates just exactly the nature of the power he is giving to parliament <e> <s> you cannot criticise and delete this word or that word or this part and that part you have to accept the whole or nothing <e> <s> parliament does not play a constructive part in the building up of these regulations <e> <s> the part that parliament plays is the part we are doing just now <e> <s> we should be examining this carefully line by line and we are not <e> <s> we have not had a reasonable explanation from anybody as to what this new experiment is <e> <s> we are going to have a new experiment <e> <s> we do not know what we are experimenting on <e> <s> we do not know what the hope is <e>", "<cs> the noble earl missed out what is the best reason for opposing my amendment and i gave him a clue <e> <s> i referred to the by-law-making power of a local authority <e>", "<cs> i think there could be quite an argument about this <e> <s> the clause states <e>", "<cs> that was why i did it <e> <s> i added to the catalogue which was a public path creation order a public path diversion order a long-distance route which passes through the area a public right of way a country park provided by them land or a waterway in relation to which an agreement or order has been made by them to which public access has been given and a new subsection <e>", "<cs> they can only make orders within their own area <e>", "<cs> well if they can make it where they like they can make it anywhere they like in terms as it stands at the moment <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble earl has read the stodart report in respect of this but he says that all things in relation to the country should go to the district authority <e> <s> this is making by-laws in respect of country parks and country parks are to be district parks according to stodart <e> <s> in respect of the existing country parks there are only two of them in strathclyde and two in grampian that are regional parks and are so described <e> <s> but according to the definition earlier from the noble earl you could not even describe them as regional parks <e> <s> i do not see where his question about the planning authority under the district should worry him <e> <s> the districts are planning authorities they are the planning authorities <e> <s> this is the point i raised earlier <e>", "<cs> only in certain cases <e> <s> they are not <e> <s> these three cases are the highlands the borders dumfries and galloway <e>", "<cs> later on we are going to slice this amendment <e> <s> i suggest that it should be hung drawn and quartered and left out of the bill altogether <e>", "<cs> how can we be in order to have the question that the clause stand part agreed to and then make it into two clauses <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt that whether one likes everything in this bill or not it is an important bill <e> <s> in many cases it deals with things that as has been suggested by the noble baroness lady elliot are long overdue <e> <s> i noted the comments of the representative of the democratic socialist party <e> <s> is that what one calls them <e> <s> they have got to be careful not to get into a holier than thou attitude <e> <s> they stand apart but to take every <e>", "<cs> i said that it was unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed but not surprised for the simple reason that the noble earl is concerned about time <e> <s> he told us the other day that the bill must be elsewhere and through by i do not know whether he has an american bias th july <e> <s> i can understand that <e> <s> but he must be aware that there are already parks that are called regional parks which once this bill is through will not be regional parks <e> <s> there are the regional parks within strathclyde the muirshield regional park and the strathclyde regional park <e> <s> i think that it would have been far far better to have had a different name <e> <s> he must know the genesis of this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that that is clear to everybody <e> <s> this is a new amendment it is not one that i have tabled before but i may be wrong <e> <s> it was intended to be helpful <e> <s> i realise that it might well have to be qualified by some other words to deal with the point that the noble earl has mentioned because the information would have to be conveyed to all the other people concerned <e> <s> as i understand it if there is the slightest modification it could be sent to the secretary of state he being asked to make the modification he would pass it or those concerned would then drop the order and proceed with yet another one which included this matter and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i am sorry i did not go ahead with it on committee but as he knows some people object to scotland taking up any length of time at all in this place so from that point of view i withdrew the amendment <e> <s> the noble earl now tells me that it <e>", "<cs> frankly my lords i do not think the clause itself adds anything of value to the bill because it is so vague and contains no definition of quiet areas <e> <s> why was that phrase not defined <e> <s> indeed countryside itself has not been defined except by reference to maps <e> <s> indeed anyone who wants to pick a hole in the clause legally will have no difficulty and the noble earl is a lawyer <e> <s> quiet areas of the countryside will be very difficult to define in such a way that we get at the troublesome engine noises of vehicles and aircraft which are disturbing the public <e> <s> the noble earl said the amendment would open the provision too wide and disturb for example quarrying activities <e> <s> bearing in mind that such developments would already have planning permission i suggest that if he examines the matter a little further he will find that that would not arise <e> <s> i believe difficulty will arise over the question of defining quiet areas of the countryside and we must bear in mind that it will not always be the district council which will have to deal with the subject <e> <s> for example in the highlands the regional council will have the planning powers and the same applies to dumfries galloway and the borders <e> <s> the regional councils may not always be the right people and therefore had it been the district with which we were concerned then what is proposed might have been worth while <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be a district council power but they do not have planning powers in these areas <e> <s> next session we shall be looking at the whole question of the by-laws of districts and the hangover from the old days of borough police acts and by-laws in towns that are presently being continued by special processes <e> <s> perhaps that would have been the time to have dealt with this sort of matter and in my view the way the bill deals with it is not the correct way <e> <s> i do not think it will work and that is my simple view of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to support the amendment of my noble friend and i should like to congratulate him on his first speech dealing with forestry <e> <s> he is uniquely qualified to speak on this subject since he is the most recent ex-chairman of the forestry commission <e> <s> his previous concern and experience had been in agriculture something which tended at one time to upset certain foresters <e> <s> however my noble friend showed by his personal attitude and work that sensible integration was not only possible but desirable and that there was too much fear of clashes between two sets of opinions <e>", "<cs> but my lords it was overthrown by a tory government and we had to take action later in the s <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not long and i will not be long <e> <s> i want to express my appreciation of the way in which the noble earl has conducted the proceedings of this bill <e> <s> there is a representative of the government here <e> <s> i am sorry not to see the noble earl lord mansfield <e> <s> this is not really a private members bill it is a government bill <e> <s> i am sorry that my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby is no longer in the house because he might have been interested in what i have to say about private members bills <e> <s> if you want a private members bill through late make it a scottish one <e> <s> if you can get the whips and every unruly back-bencher to keep their voices down and no one shouts object <e> <s> on a friday then it gets through without a second reading <e> <s> it then goes to a specially set-up scottish committee <e> <s> that happened to this bill <e> <s> it does not go to the bottom of the list in another place <e> <s> it goes straight to the scottish committee and within one week this bill was back for report <e> <s> that is why we have got it here <e>", "<cs> a bogus decision <e>", "<cs> i just wanted to make sure whether the noble earl the minister did say a bogus decision <e>", "<cs> i am sorry about the reply from the government which was very unhelpful indeed <e> <s> i begin to wonder why on earth the government put in these two sections in the first instance <e> <s> if there has been any confusion or any misunderstanding it is the governments decisions that created it <e> <s> they put in the sections <e> <s> they discussed clause stand part in committee they went through it week in and week out and there was no indication from the government that there was any dissatisfaction or any raising of the standard of parental revolt in respect of the oppression of local education authorities <e> <s> indeed i think that the confusion is in the minds of the government themselves <e>", "<cs> in other words the cost will be met in the usual way through the rate support grant to the extent of whatever the particular local authority receives <e> <s> it may be anything from per cent <e> <s> to maybe in the orkneys and shetlands about per cent <e> <s> which still leaves the local authority to find per cent <e> <s> the noble earl will be aware that at the present time there is considerable pressure being exercised by the secretary of state on local authorities to cut down the amount of money they are spending and he should be very conscious indeed that here within this section is a demand on the local authorities to spend money <e> <s> the noble earl says it is not going to be applicable until january which means it would then be available for the intake of children <e> <s> so parents are going to be denied the benefits of this great new charter which as i suggested earlier is quite unnecessary but if we are going to have it let us look at it for another three or four years or so <e>", "<cs> no i am afraid that i cannot do so <e> <s> the government say that they are steering a narrow course and they talk about heavy weather but they have not told us anything <e> <s> they have told us that there is controversy over this matter but discussions are still continuing and the government have not made up their mind <e> <s> it is a bit much for the government to ask for powers and to ask for the trust and confidence of this house or any other house in respect of education matters in scotland in respect of which they have no majority and no mandate and say leave it to us we are steering a narrow course <e> <s> we must not make heavy weather of it <e>", "<cs> no the grandfather <e>", "<cs> i was interested in what the minister had to say about my off-the-cuff reference to junior ministers and mortality <e> <s> he will be disappointed to know that mine were also well treated that even those who served me in are all alive and well <e> <s> i am afraid that cannot be said for all the under-secretaries of state who served conservative ministers <e> <s> i remember at least two old friends of mine dying in office <e> <s> but i will not trouble the minister of state with these morbid details of gil leyburn and dick brooman-white and others <e> <s> let no one think that the secretary of state for scotland has the easiest of jobs but it is certainly sometimes much more difficult to serve under one and see legislation through and i really took exception to the reference made to the present under-secreary of state in charge of education <e> <s> political matters apart i think that the noble earl should not have made that oblique reference that people would not be satisfied that he was handling matters in respect of appeals <e>", "<cs> there are lawyers in front of me and sheriffs behind me and as a simple layman i am pleased that at last they have entered into the debate on education <e> <s> i do not think that sheriffs are the best people to make the decisions about a childs education <e> <s> i do not think that sheriffs are the most suitable people to determine matters relating to a childs age aptitude and the rest because it is an educational decision that is being made <e> <s> irrespective of what is in the bill the parents can take a point of law to the sheriff <e> <s> that is fair enough <e> <s> but i do not think that the sheriff is the right person to make decisions on the childs education on what can be provided <e>", "<cs> i think that is a perfectly satisfactory explanation and we can all understand it <e> <s> but here we are into the business of appellants legal advisers and all the rest of it just the kind of thing we should not get into in respect of a simple case of a decision about where a child should go to school <e> <s> however the committee has decided that this is how it should be done <e> <s> i have no objection to the explanation which has been given and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i say that i knew the minister would give way and it would have hurt me which is why i did not make any appeal to him <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has misunderstood what is at stake here <e> <s> it is not the action to be taken in respect of the children we are dealing only with the dissemination of information <e>", "<cs> no i am not entirely satisfied <e> <s> we have experience of the health education unit and the campaigns that from time to time they carry out throughout scotland <e> <s> it would be all very well if we were satisfied that the job is being properly carried out at the moment but from the fact that we put this amendment down here at the present time and that the whole problem has been highlighted by warnock makes it i think more conceivable to ensure that the job is done and the responsibility left with the secretary of state <e> <s> of course there could be national campaigns in respect of the information but part of that is to inform the local education authority what they have got to do and also to tell the local health authority what they have to do <e>", "<cs> that is a very touching appeal from my noble friend <e> <s> but i can assure him and he will be the first person to appreciate it that education authorities take different views of their responsibilities <e> <s> as you go through scotland you find that what appeals to one local authority as important does not have a similar appeal to another local authority <e> <s> if you appreciate the importance of this for say a child in orkney the western isles the borders glasgow edinburgh or anywhere else you want to make sure that something as important as this is not left to the whims of local authorities <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the minister for his remarks about my amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the minister <e> <s> he appreciates the reasons why i put this down and the attitude i adopted <e> <s> i think that in the warnock report it was stressed time and time again that we shall not make any inroads into this problem and meet the real needs of children unless we get co-operation at every stage <e> <s> to wield the big stick and so obviously not even hiding it behind their back i found rather offensive and i did not think it would be helpful in obtaining that co-operation <e>", "<cs> it is not my intention to oppose the motion that clause shall stand part of the bill but there are one or two points that must be made <e> <s> if we look at the final new section which is part of this clause new section f we learn that <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that there are bound to be difficulties for the minister of state in explaining what the regulations might be but after all the minister is putting forward a government bill requiring powers to make regulations <e> <s> it is a wee bit much to expect us to give him a blank cheque to carry on and do all this when he cannot tell us what the regulations will contain <e>", "<cs> in actual fact consultations about this bill have been going on since before the beginning of the year <e> <s> i thought that there would be some indication of finality about the regulations <e> <s> this is not the first time that the government have told us that there is controversy that the government are steering a narrow path or we are making heavy weather <e> <s> but we as an opposition are no further forward <e> <s> i asked a simply question on clause stand part <e> <s> it would be easy to put down amendments i could spatter the whole place with amendments <e> <s> i explained the difficulty about conducting a coherent debate on clause stand part <e> <s> we have got new clauses <e> <s> the difficulties are not of my making they are of the governments making <e> <s> we have in these <e>", "<cs> i think the last speech of the minister was not technical it was very informative <e> <s> it even answered the point i asked on my first intervention <e>", "<cs> i am not surprised at all <e> <s> after all this is the second amendment we have had accepted so the people who will be surprised are those who support the minister blindly on everything sometimes without even knowing what is being discussed <e> <s> i said my amendment made the provision much more factual in relation to the scheme <e> <s> i did not say i supported the scheme <e> <s> far from it and we have other amendments to come about that <e> <s> however light seems to have dawned somewhere they appreciate that they made a mistake and it took us to put it right <e>", "<cs> but <e>", "<cs> well gordonstoun is gordonstoun i had the impression that gordonstoun did not take day pupils but i am open to correction <e> <s> it may well be that they are going to change the rules in respect of this <e>", "<cs> it only means that the government will not pay and that the parents will need to pay <e> <s> i think that is the conclusion <e> <s> i am very glad to have that further support for my argument that the parental charges will be very strictly limited in those particular cases because the parents will have to meet a considerable bill <e> <s> i know that something has been laid down to which we shall come later on about the parental contribution according to the income of the parents and i believe there is support in relation to the tuition <e>", "<cs> i am very glad we have got them on the record because i want this to support further arguments later on in relation to what else they will need <e> <s> i have a long list of prices supplied by caird not unknown to the noble earl because if he was at that

different <e> <s> the whole question of fees outside of those that are compulsory the whole question of many aspects of discipline and the like are very different because individual schools in the

than has been given to the scottish business <e> <s> i am sorry if he does not like the amount of time we take on scottish business but i can assure him that it is not always my fault <e> <s> he should hear some of the explanations we are given <e> <s> we have not yet had an explanation of this <e> <s> has he read this clause <e> <s> i ask the noble lord has he read the clause that i am complaining about at the moment <e>", "<cs> i do not know what the point of that remark was but the noble lord did not come to it very quickly <e> <s> my opinion about scottish business in this house so far as i can find is that people just cannot be bothered with it <e> <s> i have suggested before that if you insist on having scottish business here instead of at an assembly in edinburgh then i want to see that the clause is thoroughly debated and thoroughly understood <e> <s> clause after clause of this is never properly understood <e> <s> does the noble lord realise that within one clause there are sections <e> <s> he asks us to treat the thing gently to go on nicely let us get it through quickly and everybody will be happy <e> <s> if we are given time we shall do the thing properly but i can assure the noble lord that so far as i am concerned the clause will be understood at least by the minister <e> <s> if he does not know it at the start he will understand it at the finish and so will i but i still have not had an explanation of this clause and i should like it <e>", "<cs> i can assure the noble lord that scottish education is a very boring matter <e> <s> it is a very boring matter indeed to go into the details of it <e> <s> it is very different from the english and of course you do not understand it <e>", "<cs> it will be if this kind of debate goes on i can assure the noble lord <e> <s> we have not seen him all day <e> <s> he has not contributed a single sentence to any scottish legislation that i have known come before us although he has taken his time on other matters <e> <s> but he has not shown the slightest interest in these things <e> <s> i am sure the noble duke the duke of norfolk does not think that the consideration of denominational schools is a boring matter <e> <s> when we were here discussing denominational schools in relation to assisted places and i moved an amendment to ensure that consideration was had for denominational education in that respect the noble lord was not here <e> <s> but when i was not satisfied with the reply i received was i wrong to divide the house <e> <s> i am sure the roman catholics in scotland thought i was right to divide the house <e>", "<cs> can we have an answer <e>", "<cs> i think really what we should do is to ask the noble lord lord mottistone for an explanation of the explanation that has been given <e> <s> he has guaranteed to be precise and not to be boring <e> <s> if he heard anything more boring than the explanation we have had i do not know what it was <e> <s> but having listened to the explanation he might realise why we are not making a great deal of progress <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether he knows what happened <e> <s> there was for long enough a battle in england as to how much the roman catholic hierarchy and the anglicans could get in relation to financing their schools <e> <s> it was not necessary in scotland because of the agreement made very sensibly in puritan protestant scotland in to take over roman catholic schools and treat them for all practical purposes as local authority schools <e> <s> but in relation to religious education certain guarantees were given to the hierarchy which remain today in respect of religious education <e> <s> there has never been any complaint about it as far as i know and for eight years as secretary of state i upheld that position <e> <s> so let the noble lord not think that in the amendment i am moving i am trying to do down the roman catholic system <e> <s> but the government are making changes <e> <s> until this bill is passed the government have to approve the closure of any school in scotland whether it be a roman catholic school a protestant school or a non-denominational school <e> <s> now a change is being made in the law and the roman catholics said quite rightly if you are going to change the law you are not going to change it so far as we are concerned <e> <s> that is the position in the bill <e>", "<cs> it was not my intention to make worse the position of the denominational schools <e> <s> the reason for my amendment was that the government made the changes <e> <s> in order to circumvent these changes the hierarchy eventually persuaded the government to put in these new clauses <e> <s> that may help the hierarchy <e> <s> it may help the roman catholic schools <e> <s> but it still leaves the other schools in a worse position than their present position <e>", "<cs> the noble earl need not worry about that but <e>", "<cs> i accept all the criticism of the quality of my drafting <e> <s> it was done very quickly <e> <s> having taken out something that i thought was unfair i had to put something in its place <e> <s> it obviously was not sufficiently accurate <e> <s> the noble lord can make inquiries because somebody will tell him that it was never my intention to press this amendment for of course it would have removed the protections that roman catholics had fought for and that were there <e> <s> why did they have to fight for them <e> <s> they had to <e>", "<cs> are they on the staff of the directors of education <e>

government down a dangerous path they are very fond of treading such paths anyway <e> <s> i hastily seek to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely satisfied <e> <s> i think the matter was relevant to the provision of the new building at dalkeith <e> <s> it might well be equally relevant later on and i do not think anything is gained by the governments doing what they are doing here <e> <s> it may well be that the treasury insisted upon it and the secretary of state for scotland could not resist it or could not resist the idea of being popular with the treasury in doing something he knows or hopes will cost him nothing and indeed gain them nothing <e> <s> i think it is unwise but i will not press the matter and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that the minister of state did his best with a bad principle <e> <s> to attack the correctness or otherwise of my amendments and their effect is fair game but i did not anticipate that he would rest upon that <e> <s> i thought that he would give us some great new discovery in respect of the secretary of state <e> <s> i do not object to the present position <e> <s> i had to work under it when i was secretary of state <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> that really is very disappointing <e> <s> they are in the act <e> <s> they were put there at a time when we decided to set aside both in england and wales and in scotland the award or to have the power to set aside the award <e> <s> it was specifically stated that they would only depart from the <e>", "<cs> as i have said this clause itself brings within its orbit clauses <e> <s> it makes considerable changes in respect of how in future we are going to conduct the negotiations in respect of teachers salaries <e> <s> there was one thing in the present situation that is not brought in and i was really surprised that that should be so <e> <s> we have not found a name for the new body and they are to be given the power to christen themselves <e> <s> i wonder what they will come up with but i am sure that all suggestions will be considered <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the minister of state there <e> <s> we are now going to have only one committee and it means that the powers that the secretary of state has in respect of salaries he will also have in respect of conditions of service <e> <s> at the present time on conditions of service there is no agreement with the local authorities that the secretary of state has a veto so we shall have a very different set-up in respect of what is in the bill <e> <s> it should not be related to one particular committee working very well which does not have an independent chairman <e> <s> the important committee has an independent chairman <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister of state will agree with me that the present situation under the education scotland act is that a chairman is appointed by the secretary of state as an independent person <e> <s> that has been so for a long time and i do not see any justification for a departure from that <e> <s> to suggest that it works quite well in respect of the other committee which deals with conditions of service is a very different matter and the conduct of that committee is very different indeed from that of the teachers salaries committee <e> <s> the teachers salaries committee is now taking over that responsibility and it is probably all the more important that the chairman should be an independent person <e> <s> that is the first point <e>", "<cs> i set out to be conciliatory and understanding and i told the noble earl that i agreed with the main changes being effected by the bill arising from the houghton committee <e> <s> getting rid of an independent chairman is not a main change but it could be important and i hope the minister will give some thought to the matter between now and the next stage of the bill <e> <s> meantime i shall not hold up the progress of the bill or seek to get rid of the whole of clause but i hope that by the next stage we will be given some information as to how salary negotiations have been conducted up to now and how they will be conducted in future <e>", "<cs> on the whole after listening to what has been said i think that i agree with the government on this occasion <e> <s> in many ways the amendments are misdirected <e> <s> after all the authority appoints and the members who object to the unobjectivity of the committee have had no objection at all to the fact that it is the authority that does the appointing of all the people <e> <s> this was pointed out very well by my noble friend lord hughes <e> <s> there is something else that people seem to forget about education authorities and indeed about regional authorities of <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that these first two amendments are purely drafting amendments and that the substance of the amendment is contained in amendment no <e> <s> which refers to the sheriff holding the appeal in chambers <e> <s> let us be perfectly perfectly clear the hearing will be private the press will not be present and all that will happen is that the discussion and the decision will take place in private and will then be announced to the press <e> <s> i can understand the concern some people may have about the lack of a public hearing but from my own experience of even the present machinery a public hearing can lead to considerable embarrassment and distress in respect of the children involved and perhaps the parents do not always think about this aspect at the time <e> <s> the parents may be able to bear a certain amount of publicity if it arises but their children may not <e> <s> on balance i believe this amendment is right and i am certainly prepared to go along with it <e>", "<cs> and and <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one thing about the noble lord if he wants to blind us with science he will do it <e> <s> as i understand it subsection simply says <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know who discovered it very late but this will change the words in their area that is the local education authoritys area into the words belonging to their area in accordance with section of this act <e> <s> i used to be concerned about english and i do not know that children belong to an area <e> <s> i do not know that they belong to anyone <e> <s> but if they belong to anyone it might well be to their parents <e> <s> belonging to an area is rather a colloquialism and to my mind is no more precise than children in their area which is precise and correct <e> <s> i think that we are being far too finicky and bending over too much to the whims of draftsmen <e> <s> certain styles and fashions come along in respect of draftsmen <e> <s> the draftsmen change and so do other things <e> <s> i do not think that this is worth bothering about but if it pleases the draftsmen and if it pleases unquestioning ministers let it be <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say at this point that i do not know whether the noble earl appreciates in jumping to amendment no <e> <s> and discussing it that there is an error there which is probably due to my bad writing <e> <s> it refers to a sound opportunity but it should be a second opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful that the government have at least listened to the arguments that were presented in the committee stage <e> <s> the noble earl says that he has made a change in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the minister of state has been fairly generous over this <e> <s> he has realised that the government were wrong and he has gone half-way <e> <s> i know he is concerned about the length of time the process takes and that he does not want to prolong it but one must remember that a great deal of this process is outwith the control of the parents <e> <s> to give to the parents who are concerned about the future of their children the designation of being recorded and to the type of education which may well be on offer a matter of days is to my mind far far too short <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister of state has some new wisdom to give us in respect of belonging as a case of in i think he really ought to divulge it because he left us all rather mystified by his last intervention <e> <s> there are many children in <e>", "<cs> my lords i have enough trouble looking at and trying to understand the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am perfectly sure that this will follow on fairly smoothly and that the process will not take as long as three months <e> <s> that is the implication of what the minister of state said <e> <s> the only person who he mentioned was the secretary of state he did not mention the other aspects of the appeal procedure <e> <s> i am perfectly sure that they will not take as long as that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to accept that but i am appalled that it reached this stage of the bill before the government realised the need for a change <e> <s> i am not being ungracious <e> <s> i am perfectly sure that the noble lord lord lyell had not given his full attention to the matter <e> <s> he was more concerned about things that were happening to the government changes and all the rest of it or he indeed would have had the amendment down himself <e> <s> however i am very grateful to the noble lord for the help which he has given in respect of this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that as far as it goes that is very good news indeed <e> <s> it now remains for the government to go forward from the consultative document and put their suggestions into actual regulations <e> <s> of course we give them power to produce the regulations indeed we now state that it is mandatory that they shall produce the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords surely one of the barriers to that is the fact that at the moment in regard to the hostel system where it is necessary and has been <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl to say how many pupils have been taken into gordonstoun <e> <s> the last figure i saw was nil <e>", "<cs> pupils not parents <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may enlighten my noble friend i can give her all the information she wants about that i shall probably do it privately but the term that is used in the tables is relevant income <e> <s> although the low income that is suggested after which certain remissions take place is i think the actual cut-off figure is somewhere about a year at which figure there is no entitlement to remission at all <e> <s> so per cent <e> <s> of the that we have heard about are not of the poorest <e> <s> i doubt whether they have the information about the financial circumstances of all the and i should like to know what the noble earls sample is and which particular schools they came from because they are much more likely to come from an industrial area than from the other areas <e> <s> but it means that even there per cent <e> <s> are not of the poorest <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that the improvement would be minuscule so bad is this particular clause <e> <s> i do not want to take up the time of the house but having in my hand the governments own statements in respect of the actual allowances for the assisted places scheme i assure the noble earl that in many cases they do make allowances for things that are required by the school as obligatory where for instance the school does not provide them but requires them and they have to be provided by somebody else <e> <s> believe it or not the government make provision in their scheme for payment in respect of those things <e> <s> so if we had more time i would certainly carry on with this <e> <s> but it really does not matter so much <e> <s> if the noble earl wants to pass through an inaccurate bill so be it <e> <s> it may well be that everyone will be as ignorant as he is in respect of its inaccuracies and no one will worry about it <e> <s> that being so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the secretary of state does not sit in his desk surely <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am not at all convinced because all the noble lord the minister has proved is that in the case of denominational schools there is a right of veto and in event of failure to agree with the local authority the local authority cannot proceed and the matter must go to the secretary of state <e> <s> that procedure applies only in the case of denominational schools and that is the point i am trying to make that that exception is likely to cause trouble <e> <s> the minister spoke about the ruthless closure of schools <e> <s> local authorities are not ruthless when it comes to the closure of schools but i know that the government are ruthless in the pressure that they are putting upon local authorities with regard to the cost of keeping open these schools <e> <s> i do not want to return to another bill to produce the figures in respect of the extent to which the borders region failed to meet its cash limits or the highland area either but the noble lord the minister should remember what was said by a noble lord on the cross-benches about the governments cash limits <e> <s> the noble lord can force local authorities into a position where they have to close schools <e> <s> i can well remember a man who is still in charge of education in scotland a junior minister telling people that they would have to close schools <e> <s> it is not going to be popular and now it is going to be left to the local authority <e> <s> the greater the pressure which is placed on a local authority in respect of rates the more they will have to act and say this year we must do it or the government will apply the squeeze and withdraw our rates support grant <e> <s> this applies in the case of education more than anything else <e>", "<cs> my lords not surprisingly when i listened to all those objections about national economic circumstances i began to wonder who put those words into the statute <e> <s> it was not a labour government it was a tory government <e> <s> of course i followed a very heated battle in england about teachers salaries and the behaviour of the government <e> <s> so the government put them there <e> <s> now they say that this procedure is cumbersome <e> <s> why is it cumbersome <e> <s> because it is not so easy to throw aside the arbitration award <e> <s> the government want something easier <e> <s> arbitration has not been used says the minister <e> <s> so he has devised something which he will be able to use <e> <s> that is great news for teachers is it not <e> <s> it is going to be easier for the government to set aside awards <e> <s> and it is not limited now to national economic circumstances <e>", "<cs> this my lords is probably the most important change that has been made in the bill since its inception <e> <s> but remember my lords this bill has been through every stage in the house of commons second reading a lengthy committee stage a report stage and third reading <e> <s> it has come to this place and we have had the second reading we have had the committee stage and here we are on the report stage and now we have this new clause introduced at the report stage when debate is considerably restricted as indeed the minister of state took it upon himself to remind us earlier and when only one speech is allowed <e> <s> there is no debate of any kind <e> <s> and here we are dealing with something that is of fundamental importance to scotland <e> <s> i do not say i disagree with it but let us not deceive the people of scotland that this has been debated it has not been debated <e> <s> i understand that there was an answer to a written question at the end of the session <e> <s> i did not know anything about it at all <e> <s> as the minister of state will remember i was preoccupied with another scottish bill at that time right up to the very end of the session and it was not until th september that i saw this on the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble duke means this new clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be fair to say that it is only an anomaly since we have expanded the university provision in scotland <e> <s> it certainly was not an anomaly when all the ancient universities with the exception of edinburgh were in this particular position <e> <s> there was nothing anomalous about that <e> <s> indeed it may have been just as well <e> <s> anyone who reads the history of our universities and of the trials and tribulations and divisions that there were in the senates and the courts of the universities and the battles that went on over many other things would appreciate that it was a pretty good anomaly for a long time <e> <s> it was probably one of the few positions in the university where there was less trouble in respect of the appointment than in any of the others <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly an improvement <e> <s> it was pointed out i think even at second reading how wrong it was to have this very important bill spattered about with rights given to titled spouses which seemed rather as though we were dealing in many ways with our own affairs here <e> <s> i regret very much that it had to wait for another place to put this right <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an important amendment <e> <s> we are giving a completely new right mainly to spouses who do not share the ownership or tenancy of a house and if we make it too easy to obtain renunciation then virtually in the same clause we are giving the right and allowing it to be thrown away <e> <s> many people were concerned that the informality of swearing before a justice of the peace made it a little too easy to allow people to renounce their rights without appreciating how important they might be in three or four years time when the circumstances of the marriage might be very difficult indeed <e> <s> so formalising it in this way and ensuring that legal advice will be available to the wife before she renounces or to the husband if that be the case is right and fair <e>", "<cs> my lords on the face of it this amendment seems to be reasonable but it has been suggested to me that it might have some undesirable consequences <e> <s> the effect of this amendment would be to prevent the courts from granting occupancy rights to the applicant non-entitled spouse if the effect of that order is to exclude a non-applicant spouse who is also the owner or tenant of the house <e> <s> it has been suggested to me that there is a glaring defect where the non-entitled spouse is also applying not only for occupancy rights but also for exclusion probably because of violence <e> <s> it has been suggested to me that if the application for the exclusion order was granted then its effect would be to exclude the entitled spouse <e> <s> but by this amendment the court is then obliged to refuse the application for occupancy rights <e> <s> the absurd conclusion one comes to is that neither spouse can then occupy the matrimonial home <e> <s> i do not know whether this is true or not but if it is true then it is virtually a nonsense <e> <s> i wonder whether the government have looked at this and whether or not the suggestions which have been put to me by the scottish womens aid are true <e> <s> if they are then this is a pretty serious defect <e>", "<cs> my lords i have something more than a feeling that this bill is becoming so complex that many people will not resort to the advantage it gives <e> <s> hitherto in this clause we have been giving guidance to the courts but here we are saying to the courts thou shalt not <e> <s> no discretion is given to the court here <e> <s> there is nothing here to say that this provision does not apply where there is violence <e> <s> it may well be that there is a need to grant an exclusion order and remember we are here talking about interim orders and if it had been absolutely clear that if domestic violence was alleged or clause applied it would be a different matter and that such cases could be excluded then it would be much better <e>", "<cs> my lords we all know that the bill is going to pass probably this week or next week at the latest but when is it going to commence <e> <s> until such time as commencement day is fixed by the government of course these rights are denied not just in respect of this clause it takes us to clause <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the dangers that are bound to arise over the complications that are envisaged and rightly envisaged by building societies is that building societies may well in the case of first-time purchasers require a renunciation <e> <s> if that takes place as a matter of routine it would virtually destroy the protections that we are offering within the bill <e> <s> i do not know whether or not it could be avoided <e>", "<cs> this was a commons amendment my lords <e> <s> we were satisfied with the clause when it left us and the change was obviously made <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earls reply was not unexpected but it is still disappointing <e>", "<cs> my lords these are our last few words on the bill <e> <s> this is an important bill but to my mind it does not do justice to the needs of education in scotland <e> <s> there is the first part which is a new parents charter choice for the parents <e> <s> in actual fact as i think is already well known in scotland this may well be limiting the amount of freedom of choice that there is to parents in respect of schools they select for their children because for the first time we list a certain number of barriers <e> <s> before that there was full discretion to local authorities which they used and i think that in most cases they were able to meet the wishes of the parents <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we have had a fascinating debate and the house should be duly grateful to the noble viscount lord thurso for initiating it <e> <s> he certainly told us about his interests and that spread of interests certainly gives him a very considerable knowledge of the subject <e> <s> it was one of my trials and tribulations at the scottish office to have to deal with the subject of the hunter report <e> <s> the noble viscount made it sound so easy <e> <s> he never mentioned trout at all <e> <s> but perhaps he will recollect that one of the great central themes of the hunter report was that the trout was to be given the same protections as salmon <e> <s> according to the number of suggestions that arrived from all the varying interests some welcoming the report and some suggesting the nationalisation of rivers it was not so simple as he suggested <e> <s> it was quite wrong of the noble viscount to say that nothing at all was done <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but the point was have the government cut back on the finance available to him <e> <s> half of its finance comes from elsewhere <e> <s> it comes from the oda it comes from commerical interests and it comes from the likes of the <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister of state for his very full speech and his elucidation of the civic government scotland bill <e> <s> it had its beginnings a long time ago even before because it was i think between and that three attempts were made to get that police bill through parliament and they failed <e> <s> one has to consider that it was tried again in and that it did not get through until <e> <s> it then consisted of clauses and schedules <e> <s> that was after the dropping of a considerable part of it <e> <s> in fact there was a cry which must be a cry that goes up from the heart of any draftsman who sees a favourite child being slaughtered in the draughtsmans introduction to his annotated edition of the act which reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are grateful to the minister once again for bringing in something that is fairly well agreed in the house <e> <s> i was delighted to hear him saying how much he welcomed this quango and to see how he managed to avoid the use of the words closed shop <e> <s> he might have been more careful about his use of the term free-loaders and about compelling anyone who will get a benefit to pay whether they want to or not <e>", "<cs> my lords people must be getting the impression that scotland is overrun by stray dogs <e> <s> i think this must be the twentieth such bill before us in the past two years <e> <s> i thought that even the very name midlothian was enough to make the government see red and that it would be inclined to impress on them the need to save money <e> <s> these bills cost quite a bit of money <e> <s> i know it is all right for lawyers and parliamentary agents they are not concerned about it and the government do not seem to be terribly worried <e> <s> this is really to shed the load in respect of looking after stray dogs <e> <s> at present under the act it rests with the police <e> <s> this is to give it to local authorities and authorised officers in other words they are going to employ more people to do this <e>", "<cs> no kyle and carrick <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he deal with the more important point that i raised about the amendment of the same clause in the civic government bill and explain how the two things fit in <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very grateful to the minister for his full explanation of the content of the bill <e> <s> behind his rather cold words <e>", "<cs> are there any other such harbours on estates owned by the secretary of state my lords <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has started well <e> <s> i say that i have shortened the bill so that it makes room for some of the longer amendments later on which i am perfectly sure the noble earl will accept <e>", "<cs> i think that this is an admirable amendment but probably not too accurate in wording <e> <s> i think that what the noble lord really means is not previously subject to licensing but already subject to licensing <e> <s> i hope that we do not get that excuse from the government to turn the amendment down <e> <s> i am sure that that is what the noble lord really means <e>", "<cs> the noble earl will appreciate of course the confusion that will arise under the bill because in one area there will be licensing authorities of a different kind <e> <s> there will be a licensing court which is mainly for the local authority to deal with liquor there will be something called a licensing authority after we have passed this bill which must deal with the things which are either mandatory or which by the optional clause they will decide to license then there may be another licensing authority to deal with the odds and ends that are in other legislation which will be the responsibility of the local authority <e> <s> we start with the idea of having a great new scheme of licensing and we finish up with something that may prove to be rather confusing to the public mind <e> <s> however i am glad to think that the government have not shut their mind to this and are prepared to look at it <e>", "<cs> can the minister tell me what would be the effect of dropping this clause from the bill <e> <s> has it any meaning or substance at all <e>", "<cs> i think that is a useful contribution <e> <s> the noble lord might have added activities in church halls and such areas where they depend on the funds raised for contributions but of course that is probably much more apt later on <e> <s> it is my contention that clause adds nothing at all to the bill <e> <s> if it sets the scene i would ask any noble lord who happens to have a copy of the bill to read it <e> <s> i would challenge him to be able to tell me what scene it is that is being set <e> <s> if it is so necessary to do this in this scottish bill and indeed to take about four clauses to set the scene can the noble earl tell me how in the english local government miscellaneous provisions bill which covers exactly the same point they managed to do this in one clause <e>", "<cs> i do not expect the noble earl to do that <e> <s> there must be very few bills for which we are handed a correction leaflet as we come in <e> <s> there are corrections to clauses and schedule <e> <s> i spent quite a lot of time in respect of i think clause and actually put in an amendment about it and then discovered that a whole line had been left out <e> <s> we received the document only yesterday <e>", "<cs> i think it is true to say that we come to the question of fares later in a separate clause <e> <s> the first amendment that i moved was purely a paving amendment for the second one and i am very glad that everyone understood that what was intended was to give power to the region in respect of this particular licensing <e> <s> i wanted to hear the arguments <e> <s> i think it important that before reaching any decision your lordships should know both that there are arguments and what they are <e> <s> i can appreciate the position about the highlands but we must remember that the acts with which we are here concerned the burgh police acts dealt with populous places <e> <s> they were concerned less with the scattered areas than with the populous areas <e> <s> actually there is no obligation on any authority regarding taxi licences at all <e> <s> was i right in thinking that the minister said something to the effect that the authorities already license hire cars <e> <s> do they <e>", "<cs> i am not asking for a reply merely as far as the minister knows <e> <s> i should like him to find out whether any authority licenses hire cars at present and whether this is something new perhaps brought in after the working party suggested that since taxis have to be licensed hire cars should be licensed too <e> <s> let us get the thing clear <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has not got to satisfy me he has to satisfy the whole committee as to what we are talking about <e> <s> i wanted from him instances of cases where local authorities will have to apply for licences <e> <s> i think the fairly obvious one is public entertainments in respect of premises town halls and such places <e> <s> i expected that he would be able to give me and the world information in respect of all these instances where a local authority has to sit in judgment upon itself <e> <s> of course i really wanted to get the views of the shirley/david play group about the justice of this in view of their past relationship on this kind of thing happening but nothing has been forthcoming <e>", "<cs> i shall waste no more words on it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> no you are wrong again <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the amendment was to have the government explain why they departed from what was laid down in their own proposals under the draft bill <e> <s> i am quite satisfied that it may be so <e> <s> but let the noble earl appreciate that where you have the three months it does not add very much in terms of the expedition of the licence if they have to wait for about three months for it <e> <s> it might be dealt with even more speedily if we had statutory meetings of the council <e> <s> many councils that i know would prefer to have statutory meetings where they know exactly when these things will come up <e>", "<cs> it will be the council in other words <e> <s> it is up to the council to decide how they exercise their responsibilities and how they administer this function by setting up a committee or otherwise <e> <s> we cannot give any direct answer to that because the words are the council and in the schedule there is no laying down of how many members shall be there what shall be a quorum who will be the chairman or anything like that <e> <s> there is no formalisation of the actual committee or authority that will be set up <e> <s> i can appreciate what the minister says <e> <s> my desire is to get these matters dealt with as quickly as possible <e> <s> however he obviously appreciates that we are dealing with the normal and with the abnormal <e>", "<cs> i would hope that we would take schedule before clause although that was not the original intention because i strongly object to passing a schedule that we have not even examined <e> <s> that is what we should be doing if we took clause just now <e> <s> i think we should do far better to look at the schedule and make all the changes there and then say it will take effect rather than the other way round <e>", "<cs> with regard to amendment no <e> <s> which i propose to move we now dash away from the main bill and go to the schedule which is on page <e> <s> the first amendment to this very very long schedule is <e>", "<cs> what does the minister propose we do now <e>", "<cs> this is the point i was on <e> <s> i thought it was very unwise of the committee to pass the schedule because that is virtually what we do in clause and then go on to the schedule and seek to amend it <e> <s> it is as much my fault as anyone elses because i ought to have raised this when we passed the procedure motion to take clauses to <e> <s> i should think it would be much more sensible to take clauses to then do the schedule and then say that it shall have effect <e> <s> but i am in the hands of the lord chairman as to what is the right thing to do <e>", "<cs> before we do that will the minister tell us what the effect of clause is <e>", "<cs> very well <e>", "<cs> it could happen it depends on how the council or the new authority conduct their business <e> <s> i have another amendment later which might be helpful to the applicant and it is the applicant i am considering as well as the council we should give them some information as to when things are going to be considered <e> <s> i appreciate the difficulty of time and instead of five weeks we could have said two weeks or three weeks what i want is to get licences considered by the authority more expeditiously <e> <s> we want to be as helpful as possible certainly in respect of the form so that people know exactly what is required of them <e> <s> but i am not fussed about this one and so i am prepared to withdraw it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am delighted <e> <s> of course the draftsmen have changed their minds since last year because the phrase an individual natural person was in the draft bill <e> <s> i should not be at all surprised as we go through this bill if we find that it is also here <e> <s> it depends on the draftsmans mood as to whether it is a natural person or an individual natural person <e> <s> i am not going to quarrel but have i a promise from the minister of state that if i find the phrase an individual natural person later on he will then remove the word individual <e>", "<cs> yes but the noble earl has not answered my question <e>", "<cs> i know it is there <e> <s> i have got it marked in clause <e> <s> the noble earl surely does not think that something so obvious as this would escape a teachers eye <e> <s> i noticed that the draftsmen used the phrase a natural person first and then later on an individual natural person <e> <s> we have had the minister getting up and explaining why they dropped the word individual <e> <s> i would rather he did it now <e> <s> when we come to clause he will need to explain why they replaced the word individual <e> <s> or has he already promised <e> <s> maybe i am a little bit dense on a thursday afternoon <e> <s> but later on when we discuss amendments to clause are we going to take out the word individual <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think it would be sensible to have these words out <e> <s> the local authority would not be restricted in seeking or getting this information <e> <s> the words have little relevance to many of the kinds of <e>", "<cs> i fully appreciate the difficulties which have arisen because of the rejection of what was first thought of by the working party to have as of right statutory meetings <e> <s> i am concerned about the fact that this application will go not only to the authority <e> <s> in respect of premises it may go to the people who live next door or to the people living above them or to the people sharing the same building <e> <s> all the information in the application has got to be given to them <e> <s> i am sure that the one thing they will want to know is how long they have got in order to forward their objections either to the person who is applying or to the authority <e> <s> if they do not have any idea about the time when the meeting will be held that may be ruled out to be out of time <e> <s> or if they say that they are going to send in an objection and ask that there should be a waiting period until it has been formalised there may be a considerable hold-up in the consideration of the application for the licence <e>", "<cs> i am very glad of that but as the noble earl the minister of state will appreciate he has got to give the matter further consideration because if he turns his eye to page he will find in paragraph <e>", "<cs> since i gave way on the noble earls without unreasonable hesitation or delay he should surely accept this single and well-intentioned word <e> <s> but if he has hardened his heart against the word having looked in the dictionary i may say that i did not require to look at the dictionary to see what it meant but then i have a different attitude to words he after all is a lawyer i will not press it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very glad of that it may speed up our discussion because i think my amendment no <e> <s> deals with paragraph <e> <s> i think it would be worth while leaving it out here <e> <s> there is no point in being able to cover it twice <e>", "<cs> the noble earl will appreciate from what he has said that it is the intention of <e>", "<cs> no the noble earl rather thought not to include them within a prescribed class <e> <s> am i wrong in assuming that <e>", "<cs> let us suppose that according to the secretary of state they did not fall into that class

to do anything that might endanger scone palace and the right of those living therein to object because this is what we are dealing with to this kind of licence for the mobile chipper <e> <s> i shall certainly have another look at this between now and the next stage of the bill <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> so long as i have the solemn promise of the noble earl after all i helped scone palace in the last amendment so he should help me in my efforts to study the bill and know exactly what it is all about that he will do this then i gladly withdraw this particular amendment <e>", "<cs> that being so i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble earl should take it back and look at it <e> <s> if this behaviour is all that important it should be made an offence <e> <s> then it should be a matter for the courts and let them deal with it rather than let it be dealt with by a licensing <e>", "<cs> i am prepared to withdraw the next two if that is all that is wanted <e>", "<cs> it would bring me to a particular point that would suit me <e>", "<cs> i think that is very sensible and reasonable <e> <s> if the noble earl wants an easy way out of the difficulty change the shall into may that in itself would give a certain amount of latitude to the local authority <e> <s> in view of the <e>", "<cs> how disappointing <e> <s> the minister of state rather defeats himself in his argument <e> <s> he starts off by saying that it is desirable in respect of <e>", "<cs> the fact that people have a right of appeal against the decision of the licensing authority even objectors means that it is desirable that they should have an opportunity to see the decision and the reasons given by the authority <e> <s> bearing in mind that this hours business which i think is far far too short is in itself a restriction if the licensing authority is to give reasons to one it should give reasons to the others as well <e> <s> the noble earl said that it might well be the public at large the public at large have to put forward their objections in writing and even be heard or anyway be given a chance to be heard by the licensing authority <e> <s> i do not think that it is a question of or people turning up to do so they would do it through a spokesman or agent <e> <s> if that agent is not present at the time of the decision in fact the decision might be taken at an adjourned meeting not necessarily on the same day and then he has to learn that there are only hours in which to object he might be very happy at the fact that someone had requested reasons and that he would get the benefit as well <e> <s> if you are going to give reasons to one you should give reasons to the others <e>", "<cs> i think that the government are only guessing here <e> <s> all they have suggested is something about the edinburgh festival <e> <s> for that matter six weeks might be too long for that <e> <s> but there may be instances where something may happen or develop over the whole summer period perhaps for two months <e> <s> the whole point about not exceeding months which is how the amendment would have the line read means that it is left to the licensing authority which can say a month a fortnight or a week-end <e> <s> it is not tied to three months <e> <s> it may well be that the six weeks will be too restrictive <e> <s> from that particular point of view i should prefer that it was a longer period <e> <s> i think that six weeks is too restrictive i accept the purposes that the government suggest that it might be desirable to have this licence for a shorter period and therefore lose all the rights of objections appeal and everything else but i am quite satisfied that six weeks is far too short <e> <s> it may well be that three months is too long <e> <s> i can return to that at the next stage <e>", "<cs> the minister said that he was going to think about this and he has had a whole weekend to think about it and i had hoped that he could have made up his mind and come here in triumph <e> <s> the triumph would have been mine but the glory his if he had said that he accepted the amendment but he has not done so <e> <s> i do not know what he has been doing over the weekend <e> <s> it may be that he has been polishing up his bible reading <e> <s> on the basis of what the noble earl has said i am quite happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will ask the draftsman to tell him why the word below is not used twice but three times in paragraph <e> <s> at least three times <e> <s> indeed having mentioned paragraph below and the arguments put by the draftsman to the minister of state which he accepted that it would be otiose to use it again i draw attention to the fact that paragraph <e>", "<cs> the minister is talking a lot of nonsense <e> <s> if it is good enough the second time it is good enough the first and he should go back and tell his draftsmen to make up their minds <e> <s> after all it might not be on that day as in the phrase that is used <e> <s> it might be considered over two days so it might be the second day <e> <s> somebody might be summoned and not have the opportunity on that day to be heard <e> <s> it would be far better from the point of view of the authority if we said <e>", "<cs> i realise that the governments decision has been reached after they had full consultation on the basis of the suggested provisions that i have copied in my amendment but with all due respect i do not think that either the suggestion in the draft bill or the suggestion that the government now make is necessarily adequate and i think that the minister himself appreciates that <e> <s> let us appreciate that we have not yet discussed a single licence we have not discussed a single activity involving a licence <e> <s> mention has been made of taxis <e> <s> the minister himself mentioned a point about boats though of course in that case the licence would refer to the actual boat and i do not suppose that that situation would be affected by anybodys death <e> <s> but there are other aspects of licensing which so obviously apply to a business <e>", "<cs> no i am not answering questions i am asking them at the moment <e> <s> if the minister is to rely purely and simply on a sub-committee or on the fact that there are powers to delegate even to an official i think we should make it much clearer that there should be automatic transfer in particular circumstances <e> <s> that is all i am asking for and i am prepared to accept that the amendment does not meet the particular case <e> <s> i believe that the minister will cause confusion whether it be for a liquidator a <e>", "<cs> without this amendment we would not even have discussed the whole question of the difficulty that arises when a licence-holder dies goes bankrupt or anything else and your lordships would not have been aware that there was such a problem <e> <s> an amendment had to be proposed <e> <s> what better amendment should be proposed than the words which were in the governments own draft proposals <e> <s> they dropped the proposals and i have given them an opportunity to justify that and to state the reasons for dropping them <e> <s> i accept their reasons for dropping them but i draw their attention to the fact that that still leaves a gap and that gap is something that was referred to in the report of the governments own working party set up in which worked over all these years and came to the conclusion set out on page of their report that there should be provision for automatic transfers <e>", "<cs> this amendment merely says or to transfer a licence <e> <s> as i understand the logic of what the minister said on the last amendment no licences will be transferred and therefore this amendment does not make sense <e> <s> that is what he really means <e> <s> that being so i propose to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i keep thinking of the people who want to see these registers and to check on whether somebody has a licence somebody who is a window cleaner or whatever it could be anything <e> <s> we have not yet discussed who will have a licence <e> <s> i should have thought that the government would look on this with favour <e> <s> it does not mean to say that the local authority will charge a fee but it leaves it open to them to do so <e> <s> at one minute the government is anxious that local authorities cover all their expenses in this field and there will be some expense in someone getting a register watching over what happens and seeing that the register is properly returned and not defaced <e> <s> i should have thought that this was a sensible amendment without tying down the local authority to charge people <e>", "<cs> it could also tell them that nothing may apply to window cleaners unless the local authority passes a resolution under yet another clause <e> <s> so far as i recall the licensing of window cleaners is one of the optional things so that we would need a dozen cross-references to deal with this <e> <s> once again here we are talking about licensing and powers in relation to carrying licences when we do not know what is to be licensed <e> <s> that is the weakness of the bill from the point of view of anyone reading it to find out what it all means <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely happy about that <e> <s> i said that i was not entirely happy about the phrase that i used <e>", "<cs> i apologise <e> <s> this made sense with my amendment but not with the correction <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister said that arguably it was right to do this and he then gave us a hypothetical case about the detriment of the public <e> <s> we are dealing here not with licensing in the usually accepted scottish sense of public houses and the like but with peoples livelihoods in a wide variety of other areas <e> <s> it is not fair when a person has a right of appeal against a conviction that it should be taken for granted that he will be convicted finally and that the licensing authority should be told about it <e>", "<cs> the minister said that he has made me think about it and i am beginning to wonder whether nine months is long enough because the secretary of state has to produce models of conditions and to prescribe lists and all sorts of other codes <e> <s> we have not dealt with them all and we shall come to them in due course <e> <s> but if all this must be done before we can start the procedure bearing in mind how long it took to produce this bill i doubt whether nine months is a generous enough time to allow the government to do their bit of work <e>", "<cs> what the noble earl has said is very interesting <e> <s> i congratulate him on a very fine third reading speech <e> <s> i was too well brought up in another place i know what is in order and what is out of order i realise that in this place anything is in order <e> <s> however i still congratulate the noble earl <e> <s> at the same time i wonder what on earth would have happened to that speech if i had not put down this amendment <e> <s> it is such an important amendment that i wonder whether we should let it go so quickly <e> <s> but just in case there is another third reading speech up the sleeve of the minister of state i had better hurriedly withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> it is not only reasonable but but very sensible <e> <s> i am most grateful to the government for having given that very lucid explanation of why this tailpiece phrase is included <e> <s> in view of his explanation i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> with all due respect what the noble earl the minister said in his last sentence is not true <e> <s> he said that there was no ban on sub-missions <e> <s> it is stated specifically <e>", "<cs> in that case at the next stage i am going to move an amendment to leave out clause ii <e> <s> if there is no objection to people sending in applications and it is only that they will not be considered for a month afterwards why not say so <e> <s> we already have that in clause <e> <s> if what the noble lord the minister says is true this does not make sense and it is not needed <e>", "<cs> i am sure that my noble friend must be disappointed at the governments reply <e> <s> yet there is some semblance of light that the noble earl is prepared to talk to the local authorities about it <e> <s> i hope that he would extend that discussion to the association of owners as well <e> <s> the noble earl says that he has not heard any arguments for it <e> <s> it might well be that he has not heard any convincing arguments for it that would have been fair enough <e>", "<cs> there were representatives of the scottish development department local government division the scottish home and health department and the solicitors office <e> <s> they met all sorts of people who were not bureaucrats <e> <s> even a bureaucrat can hire a taxi <e> <s> even a bureaucrat can stand and wait for a bus even a secretary of state can <e> <s> i think that this categorisation of the people in the scottish office eminent with long service and the rest of it as completely devoid of any knowledge of the rest of the world and how people live is quite unworthy of the liberal party and even more unworthy of the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> i can assure him that i probably have more contact with these people every single one of them than he has and i would not dismiss their experience in that particular way <e>", "<cs> not at all <e> <s> there are far far too many taxis all charging the same <e> <s> let us remember that the fares are laid down by the traffic commissoners <e> <s> there is a point when you do not get sufficient customers for the number of taxis <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e> <s> there is no custom because there is an over-provision <e> <s> that is the point <e> <s> it has been made by the taxi owners and by the working party these distinguished bureaucrats as the noble lord lord mackie calls them <e> <s> it is a good thing that we are in committee <e>", "<cs> that is typical of the liberal party let us have a superfluity let everyone go bust and do something else such as work in agriculture for the noble lord or something like that <e> <s> but what about the actual taxis <e> <s> they are very expensive vehicles <e> <s> they have to go through all the hoops of being licensed as taxis <e> <s> the secretary of state another bureaucrat will lay down exactly what kind of taxis they will be how they will be equipped and all the rest of it <e> <s> he thinks that after spending all this time we should endanger the economic use of the taxi <e>", "<cs> if i understood the minister aright he suggested that this was a very abstruse amendment <e> <s> i suggest that in considering abstruseness he examines the governments own proposals for a code of civic government in scotland <e> <s> on page he will find in relation to the proposed clause the words <e>", "<cs> i shall really need to read that speech to find the grave import of it but i could not press an amendment after a speech like that <e> <s> no i must withdraw it and reconsider it <e> <s> while i am on my feet i can inform the noble lord the lord chairman that i shall not be moving the next two amendments <e>", "<cs> i think the minister should make up his mind <e> <s> he should be very careful of his use of words <e> <s> i do not see the word frivolous mentioned in this sub-paragraph <e> <s> nor did i mention it <e> <s> he was the one who mentioned it <e> <s> the word <e>", "<cs> i thought it one of the clearest explanations we have had for a long time from the noble lord <e> <s> i hope he will have another look at it because it does not entirely fit in with my ideas of justice of fairness and the right way to proceed with this new form of appeal bearing in mind the question of a final appeal <e> <s> there is no appeal even from the point of view of law you have got to get it right in this particular instance <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is right but it is in clause <e>", "<cs> i want to ask a question on hire car or taxi <e> <s> does this cover minibus <e> <s> here

traffic but from the point of view of taking people to particular functions obviously on the basis of hire <e> <s> is this covered in this definition of hire car <e>", "<cs> so the answer is yes <e>",

down <e> <s> i beg to move the amendment in my name on the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> i thought that the attention of the deputy chairman had been drawn to it <e> <s> it says page line <e>", "<cs> my lords this will be the last time on which i shall have to weary the house on the problem of stray dogs in relation to a council order confirmation bill because another bill that is at present before the house contains in clause these words <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i do not think he should mislead the house <e> <s> all we are doing here is to give to the district council powers which are already available to the police <e> <s> so there is no problem in relation to no one looking after stray dogs <e> <s> so far as concerns his facts about the pound sterling and the scots pound he had better have another look at that again because he will find that his relationship is quite wrong as from time to time it changed <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are all grateful to the noble lord lord lyell for moving this important bill <e> <s> he said it was modest <e> <s> i do not think it is unless of course it is a reflection on the sums of money that are just bandied about by governments nowadays <e> <s> here we are giving an association the right to spend another million <e> <s> i would not have called it modest but it is important and it affords us the opportunity to pay a tribute to the scottish special housing association after some years <e> <s> i think it was in the s when walter elliot and i am glad to see the noble baroness lady elliot in her place put on the statute book the act creating the ssha and gave it the right and the money to build houses where nobody else would build them in the highland areas in the islands in country areas and

intervene <e> <s> we are coming on to another very important order when we can discuss this very fully <e> <s> but there has been a certain measure of frustration at the scottish office because the bill on tenants rights has been held up in respect of certain of their houses <e> <s> however i can assure the noble lord that they are in the bill <e> <s> one of the things that worries me is the houses that were built for executives young people who may be there for only two or three years <e> <s> what is the use of building houses if they can be sold to a sitting tenant and if the purpose is

buy a public authority house <e> <s> i remember agreeing to their building houses to be let at economic rents and very desirable places there were too <e> <s> but the purpose for which they were built will be lost if the sitting tenants can buy them and sell them to whoever they like at a very considerable profit <e> <s> this is one of the weaknesses of the bill on tenants rights <e> <s> but the short answer to the noble lords question which i am sure will be confirmed by the noble lord lord lyell is that they are affected by the bill on tenants rights in the same way as any other public sector house <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say how many houses <e>", "<cs> just throughout scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would include me in this

like raising the standard of scottish revolt on this one <e> <s> it is only my very considerable respect for the traditions of this house and the superiority of another house which has already passed this order that makes me hesitate <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord make it clear that that is out of over million <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the outstanding features of this closure is the brutal sudden-ness with which it was announced and the speed with which it is being effected <e> <s> in any other area of scotland or of the united kingdom for that matter the loss of jobs would be

on-stream at the moment <e> <s> we also may need the aluminium smelting capacity <e> <s> from the point of view of the economic wellbeing of the country i hope that he will continue his efforts to try and find someone who is prepared to do it and that he will he a little bit more forthcoming to them than he has been in respect of british aluminium there <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are grateful to the lord advocate for the statement he has made and the speed with which he has made it bearing in mind that he was abroad yesterday and the urgency for a statement may have come as a surprise to him <e> <s> he will appreciate that this is the third statement from the crown office and that this last one is much more in line with the first one <e>", "<cs> this is a very important clause in a very important bill <e> <s> we have already covered in the schedule the whole general procedure in relation to licensing and here we come to one of the first regulations in respect of certain trades

will be subject to a very considerable burden of paperwork <e> <s> they are going to have to keep records about the time and date that an article is acquired a description sufficient to identify it the price paid the name and address of the person from whom acquired when it is sold and to whom <e>", "<cs> we are all glad to hear what the government have to say about this that there is going to be some guidance given to local authorities as to what phrase should be included and what should be excluded <e> <s> unfortunately the bill does not say that <e> <s> once a resolution is passed to give them power to deal with the licensing of second-hand dealers and that is just the one phase then second-hand dealers must be licensed <e> <s> there are the words shall be required <e> <s> then we

not construe it as fair <e> <s> it is very much to the advantage of the dealer rather than the seller as the dealer has only to act in good faith <e> <s> how one proves good faith i do not know <e> <s> i am perfectly sure that neither would the minister of state <e> <s> the other point is on the words <e>", "<cs> i shall rest content <e> <s> but the clearing-up process means that there will be an intimation and paper work in respect of conviction which will be repeated in respect of an appeal and then thirdly there will be another intimation in respect of the decision on the appeal <e> <s> i know that the lawyers want to be kept working and far be it from me to prevent that measure of triplication <e> <s> i certainly would not dream of imperilling their employment by pressing this amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i still think that one has to listen to glasgow when it gives its opinion <e> <s> if it says that it is inappropriate and would be difficult to enforce this is of considerable value because glasgow is speaking from long experience <e> <s> the minister of state nearly had us in tears about the fate of the itinerant metal dealers and the tinkers <e> <s> i hope that the tinkers will all read clause and find out what they are able to do and what they have got to do <e> <s> they have got to keep invoices in respect of everything that they purchase for two years <e> <s> these itinerant metal dealers whom the noble earl said used to be described as tinkers have also got to keep a receipt showing the weight and description of the metal the name and address of the buyer and the price paid for the metal for two years <e> <s> i doubt whether they will do all that which is one of the reasons why this is not enforceable <e> <s> we should look at the matter from the point of view of tinkers and find some other way of dealing with it <e> <s> if they can do all that they can certainly apply for a licence wherever they are peddling their wares <e>", "<cs> yes i can <e>", "<cs> we have had rather a disorderly debate so far as i can see supposedly dealing with the question that clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> that being so provided i can come back to one or two points i will be very happy to deal with clause right away and come back to the others <e>", "<cs> the point raised by the noble lord lord mackie of benshie is relevant here because many people who are metal dealers are in this business in a big way and may well be supplying and urgently supplying other metal-using industries <e> <s> indeed those are the industries that i spoke of earlier to the minister of state and as regards which i asked him whether he would look again at the -hour limit that is laid down because it says that they shall not <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble earl could make clear that this is the only clause of the group of clauses into which we strayed that affects itinerant metal dealers <e> <s> the concern is only as regards the keeping of receipts and invoices for two years in relation to the people from whom they purchase and to whom they sell <e> <s> later on the mention is of metal dealers so the question of buying and selling to people <e>", "<cs> i think that we have stumbled into some complexity in relation to the itinerant metal dealer <e> <s> i must say that i am even more perplexed after the explanation by the noble earl <e> <s> i should have thought that if we meant a metal dealer we meant a metal dealer apart from the itinerant metal dealer and where we meant an itinerant metal dealer we specifically said so as indeed we do in clauses and <e> <s> but the minister of state informs me now that thereafter in these other clauses where we say metal dealer it will include itinerant metal dealer <e> <s> we should bear in mind if that is the case and bear in mind that clause says that an itinerant metal dealer goes round farms houses and so on and disposes <e>", "<cs> while the noble earl is thinking about that he will probably say that he has already answered it i do not know whether the noble lord was here earlier the point i should like to make is that i am getting rather tired of itinerant metal dealers being only tinkers or gipsies or travelling people <e> <s> it is relevant to the amendment which was eventually withdrawn by the noble earl lord selkirk that the kind of metal dealer that i come across and who knocks at my door occasionally is a person who wants to buy anything with gold or silver in it <e> <s> they go around various places and offer prices which are generally not the prices that a person would get selling his grandfathers gold watch or chain or anything else to a <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> whatever is clear in the bill it is not clause <e> <s> however i am reasonably satisfied with the ministers reply <e> <s> i hope that local authorities with the flexibility and powers given to them by clause will be able so to licence street traders that they are limited as achieved by the english bill which has been printed <e> <s> i wondered whether under the scottish bill such traders could be limited to a particular stance <e> <s> after all we talk about a public place at one point in the clause and later refer to the public place <e> <s> the ministers reply is reassuring and i gather the intention is that the local authority shall so delimit within the licence the place and area within which they will trade that it will be a restriction on the kind of damage these <e>", "<cs> that is rather a pity bearing in mind the obligation on the local authority in respect of the food and drugs acts <e> <s> in scotland we do things very differently even in relation to the food and drugs acts and i should have thought it desirable that the local authorities should satisfy themselves about conditions at markets other than their own markets <e> <s> most of the markets in scotland are for the sale of livestock <e> <s> certainly in ayr and in other places that i know such as glasgow the fruit market is owned by the local authority <e> <s> i believe that markets for livestock and for fruit and vegetables should be under the control of the local authority <e> <s> i might have to return to the point but i do not want to pursue it at the moment and so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have no desire to have an economy of words at the expense of clarity of intention and i would ask the government to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> as against the next clause which deals with a swimming pool <e> <s> this also raises questions <e> <s> the working party report was not enthusiastic about billiards and pool rooms <e> <s> they referred to the fact that there were local and general acts giving powers at the moment and that there are not many of these establishments nowadays <e> <s> they advise that the powers are still useful and might be retained <e> <s> the one thing that they did not mention was the one thing by which the minister of state justified it <e> <s> that was crowd control <e> <s> they were concerned just that the provisions governing licences should be simple basically a requirement to hold a licence and the offence of failing to hold one and that the conditions of the licence should specify such matters as hours of opening <e> <s> that is all <e>", "<cs> my interest in this matter was raised by a gentleman from lanark <e> <s> he was concerned about churches and the use of church halls <e> <s> he said unless this is covered by the definition of educational establishment it took me immediately to the library and i had a look at what educational establishment covers here <e> <s> it is on page <e>", "<cs> i am certainly grateful to the minister for what he has said <e> <s> he has obviously thought about it and i think the conclusion he has come to is right <e> <s> i had not appreciated the difficulty about the churches that i know are used during the edinburgh festival <e> <s> indeed the minister is quite right i will withdraw this amendment and i will not move my next amendment <e>", "<cs> i think the clause should come out of the bill <e> <s> it is so confused and so muddled <e> <s> most of us were fairly clear about it until the noble earl the minister of state told us that window cleaners could not possibly be trading as a business when obviously he had not had his attention fully drawn to the point that had been made <e>", "<cs> i raised this simply because it is a bit pettifogging in view of the difficulty people <e>", "<cs> may i make one short point <e> <s> since this is so terribly important and everyone wants to retain it will the noble earl tell me how many <e>", "<cs> we are at a very early stage of the bill and there are quite a number of activities that require the consideration of the com <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i have very much objection to the expansion of the definition to cover public transport <e> <s> however it raises interesting points <e> <s> there is the question of loitering loitering on a train for instance but i do not doubt that the legal experts have worked it out <e> <s> it is interesting that one will be prevented from soliciting from a car but not from a taxi or a hired car <e> <s> am i right <e> <s> if prostitutes are in cars and it has been known for prostitutes to be in cars in public places there is no bar at all upon them as far as i can see they can be charged <e> <s> but if they do it from a taxi or hire car that will not be possible because of the definition which specifically leaves out taxi or hire car <e> <s> i hope that some people do not get many ideas about how to go about this particular business because as my noble friend lord howie of troon knows this business of exceptions being included can be difficult <e> <s> it may well be that it is quite wrong here but i am perfectly sure that the scottish office will ask us to accept it now and say that they will look at it and like good kindly citizens of scotland we shall do that <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> i believe there is haggis on the menu tonight <e>", "<cs> the minister of state has heard the views of the committee from all parts and from both sexes <e> <s> i think it is quite clear <e> <s> however there is one other danger if you arc going to put the age as low as seven you will get to the point where you will say the child is and the child is in charge of the father <e> <s> therefore subsection becomes very dangerously defective <e>", "<cs> yes it could be a mother but it is most unlikely <e> <s> scots mothers are not like that as i am sure the noble lord will fully appreciate <e>", "<cs> i think the important thing is that you have a person in a public place with a firearm and people do not know whether it is loaded or unloaded <e> <s> the other important thing is that the person is himself loaded <e>", "<cs> i am sorry about that <e> <s> i think that there should be degrees of nuisance as well <e> <s> in relation to drunkenness what is outlined in subsections and is fairly obvious <e> <s> to be drunk in charge of a child is more serious and to my mind should merit a heavier penalty <e> <s> the same is true of what we are addressing ourselves to now <e> <s> the minister of state cannot have it every way <e> <s> he has already persuaded us to leave out the word loaded so that all we are talking about is a firearm <e> <s> i still think despite all he said that it is far better when we are legislating in this way to be rational and to put our degrees of nuisance in here <e> <s> if the government want to make any consequential changes in another bill that is going through the house they can do so <e> <s> but i still think that this merits a fine greater than <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mackie agrees with the minister at the same time as he agrees with me that it is more serious to be drunk in charge of a child than it is to be drunk in charge of a firearm and it is only for each of those <e> <s> i originally drew attention to this anomaly in logic <e> <s> there is another stage and the liberals and we shall together i hope press upon the government the need to do something more than is being done here <e> <s> meantime in view of <e>", "<cs> i assure the noble earl that i warned them to have their burns ready <e>", "<cs> if for the time being is between now and report stage i shall agree with the minister of state <e> <s> but if a person is drunk you can charge him anyway and fine him <e> <s> for some reason or other the government are not going to change that unless we convince them that this should have been dropped along with some of the other things which were in the now obsolete private legislation of the old burghs <e> <s> however i shall not press the amendment now <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister of state for his response to the concern that has been expressed not just by this side of the committee but by his own <e>", "<cs> i do not want to prolong this debate too long but the noble lord should have come here armed with the number of offences that have been created and the many lives that have been saved by having this provision on the local authority statutes for over years because that is what he is implying <e> <s> he is saying that we have had this for over years and we cannot do without it <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble earl lord perth for initiating this debate and unlike the noble lord lord ferrier i believe it is an important one <e> <s> you cannot tuck scotsmen into a corner for long and i am glad to see that the principal deputy chairman of committees saw fit to be clad in a kilt as she presides over our proceedings tonight <e> <s> let us appreciate exactly what the committee had to do <e> <s> we have heard from a member of the committee and from the father of a member <e> <s> let me make it clear at the outset that i was not the father of that committee <e> <s> we are talking about february <e>", "<cs> be that as it may my lords but at that time i was a humble back-bencher <e>", "<cs> always humble my lords even as secretary of state <e> <s> it was my successor mr bruce millan who set up the committee in february <e> <s> i wish to express my appreciation to the members of it and the way in which they worked and i was glad to hear tribute paid to dr alwyn williams the principal of glasgow university <e> <s> they invited me there to speak in october of last year about a week after the report had been published and i got rather than the job i was on lobbying by alwyn williams about the scottish heritage report <e> <s> and if that was not enough it was followed by a letter from the noble earl followed by another letter from a friend of mine who happened to be the chairman of the trustees of the national museum of antiquities of scotland mr kennedy <e> <s> i am therefore well enough briefed on this matter apart from which i have a little place in the history of it as well <e>", "<cs> i have been there <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to noble lords for having given us the benefit of their experience and wisdom <e>", "<cs> i think we have had a reasonable starting debate on this question <e> <s> we are promised that we are going to have an opportunity of yet another debate on it at report <e> <s> did i understand the minister to say that he was going to put down draft clauses rather than definitive clauses <e>", "<cs> they have been in draft for a long time <e> <s> i feel that the government have been waffling on this for far too long <e> <s> i think it is quite wrong to suggest that the scarman report should have held us up <e> <s> we in scotland have not had anything like toxteth nor are there circumstances that are likely to lead to that situation <e> <s> even the processions in glasgow with a religious connotation have not caused any trouble in the past <e> <s> one is amazed at the kind of people who have turned out to see some of these processions <e>", "<cs> i can understand the transport undertakings unwillingness to get rid of the responsibility for lost property <e> <s> from what the minister says it is a very rewarding matter for them <e> <s> but what i am concerned about all through this is the question of the public itself <e> <s> it was the government who pressed the law commission to expedite their report <e> <s> they might as well not have bothered because they are paying little or no attention to it <e> <s> the minister of state will remember and as a lawyer he probably appreciates how right they were that they looked at the matter from this point of view of general law and they did not regard it purely and simply as a matter for civic government <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed with that answer <e> <s> i should have thought that half way from the existing six months that is three months would have been reasonable <e> <s> i should not like to be one of the per cent <e> <s> who according to the lothians and borders survey went to report a loss to the police after two months <e> <s> even from the point of view of that per cent <e> <s> it would be worth while making it three months rather than two which was the suggestion of the scottish law commission surely they must have got something reasonably right <e>", "<cs> if something was lost in girvan and the chief constable was in glasgow there would need to be communication about that and it would be interesting to know what changes have been made since the reorganisation of local government when we had this tremendous new police force in strathclyde covering such a wide area and so many <e>", "<cs> i consider that the minister of state has been far too considerate about the convenience of the police forgetting that the police are there for the convenience of the public <e> <s> the minister said that i did not discuss amendment no <e> <s> e along with this amendment <e> <s> i admit that i did not <e> <s> but that does not justify his discussing amendment no <e> <s> e and saying that because a claim for compensation must be made within a year there is no point in keeping records for a longer period <e> <s> the argument is the other way round it is necessary to justify keeping records for only one year as against my suggestion of two years <e> <s> if the committee felt that i was right that it was being fair to the public to provide for records to be kept for two years it would follow that the period for claiming compensation should be two years as i propose in my second amendment <e> <s> the noble earl <e>", "<cs> i think it is a valid point <e> <s> but to come back to the point of this amendment the it is certainly a new provision and certainly the law commission did not put in a figure <e> <s> i should think they must be incensed by the idea that the government are now doing their thinking for them and suggesting that if it is less than in value then no compensation should be paid at all <e> <s> with all due respect i think the thinking of the government here is quite wrong <e> <s> if they want to obviate unnecessary work for the police and in the processing of compensation and the rest of it certainly to many people who lose articles is quite a lot of money <e>", "<cs> the point i wished to make is exactly the point that the noble earl lord selkirk has made <e> <s> it seems crazy to me that we should have this clause dealing with section of the dogs act and then in clause of this same bill what does it do <e> <s> it amends section of the dogs act <e> <s> that is a strange way to deal with things and how there could be anything other than confusion in it i just do not understand <e> <s> i am surprised that the government themselves have not produced a better and more intelligible amendment to the dogs act <e> <s> the noble earl will recollect of course that at an earlier stage i drew attention to the fact that it needed even further amendment according to the document that i was given by the scottish office i do not know why they sent it to me it was probably a mistake because we had the business of the shilling appearing in it and it is going to remain in the bill even after these amendments <e> <s> this clause and clause remain so please will they have another look at the whole question of stray dogs <e> <s> if they must stray into this bill let them stray into one place and not into two separate clauses <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord howie <e> <s> this matter has been side-stepped entirely by the minister <e> <s> for some reason he says that all this has been put here because of the concern of the conservation lobby <e> <s> he could have deceived me <e> <s> may i assure him that the national trust has not been subtly pressurising me for this particular clause <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble duke the duke of athol has been pressured about this particular clause <e>", "<cs> i am happy to hear that and i will certainly consult again with glasgow to see about their position <e> <s> in view of that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very glad for that so far but i am not entirely happy about the noble earls proposed amendment <e> <s> i should have thought something along the lines of what my noble friend lord howie of troon suggested to ensure that the withholding of consent is not unreasonable would have been better <e> <s> it is certainly absolutely essential that we should retain the rights of the individual in respect of what could he a very undesirable project which was going to lead to considerable depreciation of the value of the property <e>", "<cs> that is fairly reasonable <e> <s> in view of that explanation i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i must apologise to the minister of state <e> <s> i had a telephone call to make at pm and i am afraid i missed it <e> <s> but never mind <e> <s> it meant that i did not hear his explanation <e> <s> i gather that the minister said that this matter has to be dealt with in general legislation and that this would be the wrong time to do it although what we are proposing to do is right and so we must wait for a roads act <e>", "<cs> i know but they do nothing about it <e> <s> they accepted something about processions as well but they have done nothing about it <e> <s> i do not know what they have been doing <e> <s> it is not for me to ask but it may well be that they have been so tied up with the problems of chimney sweeps and window cleaners that they have not been giving proper attention to the things that really matter <e> <s> but in view of what the noble earl has said i do not have any alternative and i will withdraw this particular amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that local authorities are rushing to spend money where it is unnecessary to do so <e> <s> this has been an argument that the government have been using time and again that local authorities will be anxious to save money in many police aspects and all the rest of it <e> <s> it strikes me as being quite unnecessary but i will bow to the wishes of the government and will not proceed <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is good to know that we have a criminal justice bill coming along and being considered at present which will deal with litter in scotland <e> <s> is it a scottish criminal justice bill <e> <s> if it is not a scottish criminal justice bill will the section dealing with litter and the fine be specially amended to make it applicable to scotland <e>", "<cs> so scotland will be dealt with in this english bill <e>", "<cs> in this united kingdom bill <e> <s> whether or not it is or is not we shall determine once we see it but as far as i can see it is just going to be a vehicle of convenience for the government in order to make changes <e> <s> reference has been made to the fine <e> <s> the minister says why worry about it there will not be very many prosecutions <e> <s> the minister has not answered the question which prompted my amendment <e> <s> does a person include the residents <e>", "<cs> the noble earl says that naturally it includes the residents <e> <s> it may well be the residents who deposit <e> <s> remember the phrase is or otherwise deposits litter <e> <s> the only place where the residents can get rid of their litter is in the back green where there is a receptacle for them <e> <s> surely they are not going to be rendered liable to an offence for that <e> <s> it is with that aspect that i should like to sec the government concerned <e> <s> it could quite well be that the only person who will be prosecuted under this subsection is a resident <e> <s> someone who casually comes through and dumps an old bed or bedding or any old rubbish at all will get away with it <e>", "<cs> i think that the weakness here is in the actual language that is used in this subsection which is trying to prevent litter being dumped in common property <e> <s> i think that the mistake is first limiting it to a person and secondly the use of the words otherwise deposits because otherwise deposits is not dumping <e> <s> depositing is just placing <e> <s> i do it every week with the amount of paper that i have to throw out <e> <s> i cannot put it into the dustbin i put it into a carton which i leave beside the dustbin outside my front gate that is otherwise depositing <e> <s> it is litter <e> <s> so in the circumstances of this particular clause you are liable to an offence <e> <s> so if he is concerned about dumping let us use the word dumping <e> <s> everyone knows what it means and if the lawyers do not it is time that they did <e> <s> in the belief and hope that someone will look at this again i shall certainly not press the amendment <e>", "<cs> there is one point on clause that worries me a little <e> <s> subsection of clause says <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the deputy chairman is looking at me very appealingly and i think asking me to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i gladly do so <e>", "<cs> did i understand the minister of state to say that he

noble lord lord lyell for the care he has taken over this because he has proved my case <e> <s> what he has just said is that whatever else local authorities can do they cannot dispose of waste in any way they think fit <e> <s> that is what he has just said <e> <s> they cannot do as they like <e> <s> why have these words in <e> <s> they mislead us they mislead the local authorities and everyone

baroness lady elliot of harwood when she says that she has turned over a new leaf because i am sure that she is as devoted a politician as ever she was <e>", "<cs> in view of what the minister said earlier about the problem of stray dogs and what he is going to do about it i do not propose to move that clause shall be left out of the bill <e>", "<cs> this is a local government bill and it should

lords there is a certain amount of merit in what the noble lord lord drumalbyn has put forward because when you take the whole spectrum of licences that are involved here it may well be that the weights and measures authority has an interest <e> <s> i am wondering whether the government would think about it not by making it statutory to consult but by giving them the right in specific cases to object <e> <s> i think that that would probably meet the point that the noble lord has in mind <e> <s> as the bill stands at the moment i do not think that they have any right to object to a licence being given to any person and it may well be from their own experience that they should be able to exercise that right <e>", "<cs> my lords he said doubts <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord appreciates that not all applications for a licence are subject to public notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i dare not speak for the noble lord lord stodart but speaking for myself i am grateful that the government have seen fit to do this <e> <s> it is eminently sensible and so long as we can be assured that there is no deprivation of chippies by fire around any part of perthshire then i shall be delighted to accord a vote of thanks to the government in this case <e>", "<cs> never <e>", "<cs> i accept that the amendment alone would not do what i want to do my lords but when it came to the consequential changes that would need to be made i am sure i should get the help of the scottish office draftsmen or failing that i should burn some midnight oil in order to do it <e> <s> and remember we have a long way to go with the bill we have third reading to come and then it must go to another place and having pointed the way i am sure there are people there capable of dealing with the necessary consequential amendments <e>", "<cs> and i am seeking to influence him so that he comes on my side in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been considering this for how many years is it <e> <s> years <e> <s> the current state of knowledge spans quite a long time <e> <s> indeed when the minister says that there are no procedures at the moment in respect of some of these activities for local authorities to issue licences perhaps he will tell me exactly how the cities of glasgow and edinburgh have been dealing with the question of taxis over the past decade <e> <s> let us go back probably or years <e> <s> of course they have powers but in later parts of the bill we are taking those powers away by taking away the powers that they have under <e>", "<cs> my lords during the earlier stage many noble lords queried whether window cleaners should require licences at all <e> <s> it came out that it was the police who from the point of view of prevention of crime were concerned that there should be a licence for window cleaners <e> <s> originally it was not just the chief constable or an authorised officer who could ask the window cleaner to show his licence but any other person with a reasonable cause for concern <e> <s> what immediately jumps to the mind in the case of any other person is the person most concerned the person who is having his windows cleaned <e> <s> there have been many recent cases and i read of one a fortnight ago not in scotland but in engand where a burglary took place <e> <s> in recollection the person concerned realised that some people had cleaned the windows two days before and indeed had cased the joint <e> <s> there may therefore be some justification for the police concern <e>", "<cs> my lords if this was done for the purpose of clarity may i suggest that the government have another look at this <e> <s> it is far from clear <e> <s> it is confusing to find the words an order will be on line and also on line <e>

reads now i presume he has done this it says <e>", "<cs> my lords compelling arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords it was disappointing to hear from the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords the importance of this is emphasised by the fact that we have clauses from clause to clause dealing with taxis <e> <s> there is no question of leaving local authorities to decide for themselves <e> <s> all these clauses are there and they will all become law <e> <s> apart from that within these clauses the secretary of state takes further powers in relation to the type of vehicle and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i hoped to

particular point <e> <s> i do so not because i am all that interested in this amendment but because i am very interested in the next <e> <s> nevertheless i congratulate the minister for having given me a substantial argument in respect of my next amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not at all surprised by that because when we discussed this matter on the last occasion the government made the point of principle that competition in this field was a good thing that we should not worry at all about what we were told by the working party and that it was a long time since the working party actually reported <e> <s> the working party were conscious of the need and said so to limit the number of taxis licensed because they were conscious of the need to ensure a working wage for those who

helps to clarify the bill <e> <s> we became really confused and then the ultimate confusion came when the minister of state told us that metal dealer included an itinerant metal dealer <e> <s> well it

that the police gave in respect of the number of years the length of time that other people have to keep books and receipts is strangely different from what they commend in respect of themselves

it is something which should be dealt with within the bill and not left in this roundabout way for the government to make amends about something which was an oversight in the first place <e> <s> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a considerable duty being placed on the licensing authority and it arises from the fact that the originally issued licence allowed the itinerant metal dealer to deal anywhere in scotland <e> <s> this was the point i was rather sorry about that that phrase is still there and it may well be that we shall return to consider it <e> <s> one of the consequences is that one authority licenses the dealer for the whole of scotland and not just for the authoritys own area <e> <s> the result is that if the dealer is convicted the authority has to inform the rest of scotland whereas had the dealer been limited in respect of his activities to the authoritys own area this would not arise <e> <s> this is just a consequence of something that should not have been there in the first place <e> <s> but i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we should all be grateful to the noble earl the minister for his reaction and his fairly honest expression of concern about the problem <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside said that this was not the time <e> <s> i do not consider that this time is late at night i may have been badly brought up in a parliamentary sense or late in the bill for that matter <e> <s> i blame myself <e> <s> i put down a new clause on glue sniffing at the committee stage <e> <s> i do not remember any great interest being taken by noble lords about it but the government took it seriously <e> <s> i blame myself because i had another new clause which i did not put forward and that was on this particular subject <e> <s> it was simply because of the inadequacy of my drafting <e> <s> i felt it was not even good enough to put on the marshalled list

that the second amendment marked no <e> <s> should in fact be no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of the more important provisions since it relates to one of the areas of compulsory licensing <e> <s> i always thought it a weakness to give a catalogue of places that have to be licensed because a catalogue can possibly appear exhaustive yet it gives an indication to a local authority and who is to blame them if they start making their own exclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl in respect of my concern about church buildings <e> <s> i accept right away that the wording he has <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that he can rest assured that in future he has brought upon himself considerable unpopularity if the young farmers are not going to he allowed to use an establishment <e> <s> he knows the young farmers better than i do <e> <s> there <e>", "<cs> bearing in mind that the whole purpose of the red deer commission is to control i find it difficult to

prosecuted because in this case the word of one witness is enough <e> <s> is this epidemic that we hear about supported by a number of cases or is this great epidemic something which escapes the law

occasion the noble lord thought this was right to put into the bill <e> <s> i know the arguments very well but i think that the secretary of state for scotland will probably know fairly well the circumstances in relation to scotland and certainly to that part of scotland where we are concerned about the use of firearms in respect of deer and will be in close touch with all the organisations

like to know just exactly what it means to be in trade as a window cleaner and we must remember that we shall pretty well wipe this out by the other amendments that the noble earl has set down on the

could <e> <s> i am sorry that the minister of state has fled the field <e> <s> he probably spoke for far too long and has gone away to have a rest <e> <s> this is an amendment which we really must support <e>", "<cs> the speed with which we are getting through this admirable bill is due entirely to the readiness of the noble lord to see the force of <e>", "<cs> i think of all the amendments here <e> <s> there is one saying the red deer commission and the police another saying after consultation with the red deer commission and then the noble lord lord glenkinglas says after consultation with the chief constable <e> <s> the best one is consultation with the police <e> <s> i do not think we should give a new function to the red deer commission <e> <s> i do not suppose they want it <e> <s> i do not suppose they will know very much <e> <s> it is probably as well that they know who the people are but i do not think they can give the kind of information the police can give <e> <s> at the present time it is the police dealing with contraventions of the law <e>", "<cs> before the noble viscount completes his remarks i should like to say that i am not clear about what was said by the minister of state <e> <s> the suggestion was that we are to treat this in the same way as we have treated everything else under the civic government scotland bill <e> <s> but under the civic government scotland bill although in respect of certain of the licensing there is an order-giving power to the secretary of state to require the local authorities to comply with certain directions it is clearly in the bill that the local authority has to consult the chief constable <e> <s> i want to know whether that is going to be in this bill <e> <s> that did not seem to be the case from what the minister of state said yet i gained the impression from the noble lord lord glenarthur that the police should be in the bill which means that the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord glenkinglas is the right one to accept and the question of whether they consult the red deer commission could be part of the order that the secretary of state is going to produce later on <e>", "<cs> of course we are giving the secretary of state a very wide power here <e> <s> i do not know whether the secretary of state is willing to have this power <e> <s> the amendment certainly says including power to authorise which means a power to do other things <e> <s> but what other things <e> <s> the question of appeal is not mentioned <e> <s> in most other cases in the civic government scotland bill where a licence is denied the right of appeal exists <e> <s> i know that the noble lord mentioned this when he explained what he was doing here but if we reckon that this is important and most people reckon that this is important be it an appeal against the refusal of a licence or an appeal against the withdrawal of a licence it may well be that it could have been mentioned here <e> <s> we have time to do this <e> <s> it is not a very controversial suggestion <e> <s> it opens out the powers that are to be given to the secretary of state to regulate the applications and to do this by order <e>", "<cs> i have a little experience of this <e> <s> i think that it was in the salmon and freshwater fisheries act that a labour government breached this cardinal principle of scottish law <e> <s> you can well imagine what fell upon the head of hector mcneil who was then secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> it was about the only bill we passed in that particular parliament and we were never allowed to forget it <e> <s> indeed it is probably because of this that it was introduced elsewhere <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord lord northfield appreciates that even say in a civil action for compensation in respect of an accident in a railway yard in the middle of the night where there could not possibly be corroboration until only just a few years ago there was no hope of the injured person being able to prove negligence on the part of the railway authority <e> <s> the same thing applied in relation to mines and i can remember the row that took place when the government decided that they would allow the judge in the case where he thought it was likely to be right to be able to give the benefit of the doubt to the person concerned <e> <s> i could not possibly agree to such a widespread breach of scottish criminal law in this respect and i think that the noble earl the minister explained the matter very well indeed <e> <s> i am grateful to him and i think the committee should be <e>", "<cs> we started out here to restrict <e> <s> looking at some of the amendments i felt that we were going to finish by very considerably widening the number of people who could fit into the exceptions in respect of night shooting and close season shooting <e> <s> i am very glad indeed that the noble lord was able to find the strength to resist all the pressures that were put upon him <e>", "<cs> but does not the noble lord appreciate that the small farmer or crofter might prefer an able-bodied neighbour whom he can trust to do it <e> <s> this need not necessarily be a poacher <e> <s> we jump to conclusions <e> <s> the ease with which one could obtain authority from an occupier to shoot is the whole screen which is afforded to the poacher to go on and be protected by this letter which he has obtained from an occupier <e> <s> we are oversimplifying <e> <s> it may be that the noble lord is creating a hardship by the restriction which he is introducing <e> <s> at the same time we see that there is a change the owner can be allowed to do this <e> <s> with due respect it is not the owners crops which are being damaged or substantially damaged <e> <s> it does not necessarily follow that all owners will help somebody out by providing a proficient marksman <e> <s> so the noble lord is generalising in one case to the disadvantage of people who at present have a right and he is generalising in the second case to the advantage of the owners <e> <s> so long as <e>", "<cs> but does not the noble viscount appreciate that at present there is nothing to prevent the occupier inviting the owner or the owners stalkers to do it <e> <s> we are singling him out as one of the few people who can be brought in <e>", "<cs> i have the report before me and i cannot find the table <e>", "<cs> that is correct but that refers only to venison dealers <e>", "<cs> i was surprised to learn when i first saw the bill that it was a private members bill and then when i read it i felt that it was really a government bill <e> <s> the reason why its introduction has been allowed as a private members bill is that there is probably a better chance of getting time for it ont he floor of the house and in the scottish committee <e> <s> i have always felt that private members bills should be relatively non-controversial and that is demonstrated by the way in which my noble friend lord northfield expresses his fury <e> <s> there is controversy over this and my noble friend is challenging it if not this year then next year or the year after and so on he says <e>", "<cs> and therefore we must not forget the suggested increase in penalties the licensing <e>", "<cs> a bit late <e>", "<cs> i would remind my noble friend with respect that we are here concerned with deer and deer are not other animals <e>", "<cs> could the noble lord tell us whether or not any boats horses or any other animals used in respect of poaching of deer have already been confiscated <e>", "<cs> i know <e>", "<cs> this is quite an important amendment <e> <s> so far as i know we have had two references to hybrid in a definition <e> <s> it was mentioned in an amendment moved by one of my noble friends <e> <s> i wonder whether this bill covers the whole situation in respect of hybrid <e> <s> i do not know whether the minister of state has any information on this <e> <s> he is generally an expert on the rather esoteric subjects which are contained in these schedules <e> <s> i think we should all be grateful for the information <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> we had a definition of deer <e> <s> but there was one other point <e> <s> i think it was in one of the amendments that was accepted <e> <s> we have had so many and we have raced through them at such a rate that it may well be that it has been forgotten <e> <s> the point is that if i am right in my recollection of this definition of deer we do not need here to mention or to any hybrid mentioned in section of that act <e> <s> the definition of deer includes the hybrid <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord lord burton can help <e>", "<cs> i apologise <e> <s> the noble lord is quite right in the point which he has made <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord northfield has got something here in respect of his desire to try to stop this cruelty in relation to transportation <e> <s> personally i do not see how it is going to fit in just with the question of equipment <e> <s> it is really a method of dealing with it in circumstances in which i think most people would agree with an aircraft or helicopter being used <e> <s> how are you going to limit that just by equipment <e> <s> if the government are satisfied that they can in some way cover this certainly i would be reasonably well pleased with it but at the moment i cannot see that amendment no <e> <s> is adequate to cover the point and i think that most of your lordships would want this to be covered <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble earl the minister for his explanation so far as it went of the order the reasons for it and the effect of it <e> <s> there is no doubt that it is a very timely order <e> <s> people are probably more conscious certainly in scotland at the present time of valuations and rates than at other times of the year <e> <s> i have just received mine <e> <s> it may well be that noble lords from scotland will equally be shivering at the prospect of what they have received and the demands being made from them <e>", "<cs> my lords could the minister tell me what that really means that the assessor will take the result into account in future assessments <e> <s> there is not going to be a future assessment for another five years which means that there is no appeal <e>", "<cs> we have already done so <e> <s> the appeals are nearly finished <e>", "<cs> they must <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down when he speaks about rights of appeal does he mean rights of appeal in respect of those subjects which are being revalued <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me the only remaining limited right of appeal beyond that <e>", "<cs> yes but i hope the minister appreciates that it is a very different scheme from the existing local authority scheme with which local authorities are very much more familiar <e> <s> the noble lord has already explained the complications of this and i hope he appreciates that as well as being complicated for people who are in local authority houses i receive considerable correspondence from the federation of scottish housing associations who have a great deal of trouble in even being supplied by the scottish office with the original paper <e> <s> i am far from satisfied that the noble lord can brush it away like this <e> <s> i know that he is not really brushing it away but he is pleading for time <e> <s> we have already heard somebody say today that we cannot deal with this matter because this is the committee stage <e> <s> but if you cannot deal with a matter in committee stage when can you deal with it <e> <s> as the noble lord knows it will be very much easier for the government when we come to report stage because everyone is very much more limited in the time that is available <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i can just say a word <e> <s> it surprises me that the government want to control or to have any participation at all in any of these oil companies because having got it and this is one of the things that were supposed to satisfy us and still our fears the government go on to say and i am quoting the actual words of the minister that they <e>", "<cs> if the minister will allow me to intervene this is not a non-scottish bill <e> <s> bnoc is sited in scotland <e> <s> it is very much a scottish bill and his department has a lot to do with the whole organisation and with getting it going <e> <s> the noble earl knows that better than anybody else <e>", "<cs> i did not say at once <e>", "<cs> i do not doubt that the noble earl the minister will reply that this is no way to run a company that a company cannot wait to get the approval of parliament every time it wants to sell shares and that the whole operation has to be run like a normal company <e> <s> my answer to that is that it is not the company that has to sell the shares but it is the british national oil corporation <e> <s> indeed parliament is being very generous in clause where it says in the bill that the oil corporation shall <e>", "<cs> oh yes he is listening do not worry <e> <s> he is probably going to be listening for the whole of this session judging by what is coming up from another place in the way of scottish legislation <e> <s> in any case there we have the lord advocate listening to every word that falls from my lips <e> <s> i know that he has probably got to leave us to look after the moderator when it comes to the general assembly of the church of scotland but while we have him here we want him to bring his mind to this <e>", "<cs> you were lucky <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the gas corporation will be agreeably pleased with the way in which this debate has gone apart from the gripes and troubles of the noble lord lord thorneycroft as regards his daughter trying to get a gas cooker and cases like that which are just a few out of millions <e> <s> that argument is not very convincing to me at least <e> <s> i too bought a gas cooker in recent days and i had no trouble at all <e> <s> i installed central heating just a few years ago and there was no trouble at all with the gas corporation <e> <s> there are million people using gas and using appliances that they bought very successfully from showrooms <e> <s> there are showrooms scattered throughout the country <e>", "<cs> as regards gas and it is gas with which we are dealing here the facts of safety are on record <e> <s> one has only to compare the record of safety appliances and gas bodies in west germany holland and belgium with that of our gas corporation <e> <s> occasionally we ought to blow the trumpet for britain <e> <s> we have the finest gas industry in the whole world and we have a government determined to run it down <e>", "<cs> to provide better candles <e>", "<cs> surely these assets did not suddenly appear out of thin air <e> <s> the gas corporation had to spend money out of its general funds creating these assets <e> <s> is it not quite wrong that it has simply to be sold and then the asset is deleted and the money taken by the consolidated fund <e> <s> i wonder what people interested in local authority matters and housing policy would have had to say if apart from local authorities having to sell off houses and that is virtually the position they were told that the money from those disposals would not go to the local authority but would go to the consolidated fund <e> <s> with all due respect there is a relevance here in the analogy <e> <s> it may well be that the government will argue that it means that loan consents for the building of other houses will not be required but it is still a matter for the local authority to determine how the money will be spent <e> <s> it was actually out of the resources of the gas corporation that these assets were created <e> <s> we have no objection to the government taking the profits <e> <s> the minister asks what will they use this money on <e> <s> who has provided all this money anyway <e> <s> it has been the consumer <e> <s> could not they use this money to do some research and development to the advantage of the consumer <e> <s> could not they use it to provide the daughter of the noble lord lord thorneycroft with cheaper gas <e> <s> his interest in his daughter and her gas appliance and in buying candles to keep her going really means that he should be interested in the cost of the gas <e> <s> there would be a great deal of argument as to what priority one gives to this matter or another matter in relation to the continuing work of the gas corporation <e>", "<cs> the whole point is that parliament and the public are concerned about the ultimate disposal of the shares what will be the terms who will get the shares and what control there is <e> <s> this is the point where public interest is liveliest <e> <s> this is the kind of thing that the public accounts committee has been concerned about <e> <s> this is the very point at which we must have some parliamentary control <e> <s> we are grateful to the minister for saying that he will look at the matter again and i think my noble friend has achieved something by getting that undertaking from the minister <e>", "<cs> as has been said this is an important bill and i will ask just one or two points very quickly <e> <s> after all the dinner hour is fairly flexible i believe <e> <s> this clause concerns the powers of the secretary of state <e> <s> in this clause he is mentioned no fewer than times <e> <s> in the first instance <e>", "<cs> much of all this depends on the ability of the gas standards branch of the department <e> <s> can the noble and learned lord tell me how many people are employed there at the present time <e> <s> apart from what the noble and learned lord says about the general order application being a hit of an administrative convenience it will still require detailed examination of every particular case <e> <s> that is what the minister said <e> <s> have the government the manpower to do that <e> <s> are they going to get the manpower to do that <e> <s> if so where are they going to get that manpower and what will it cost <e> <s> before we can accept that everything is all right in relation to safety we must have from the government reliable proof that we can be confident that what the minister states will in fact be carried out <e> <s> this is far too important a matter just to be written off with words of administrative convenience <e> <s> that phrase could be considered a matter of parliamentary convenience just to get over this particular point <e> <s> the minister has said that the examination will be done by the gas standards branch of the department of energy <e> <s> how many people are employed there <e>", "<cs> is that all <e>", "<cs> what worries me is that the possibility of consent is a nationwide matter <e> <s> there are people covering the whole of great britain but how many of them will be in scotland <e> <s> i doubt whether the number would run into double figures <e> <s> the minister wants to convince me that all these safety precautions are going to be adequately taken but i doubt very much that the department can do this to the satisfaction of the house <e> <s> we are not being given very much chance to probe this matter much further <e> <s> it is an important matter because the safety of lives is concerned as is the safety of the industry as well <e> <s> does the noble and learned lord have figures for the number of people working in scotland <e> <s> am i wrong in thinking that there are probably no more than people for the whole of scotland <e>", "<cs> we hear some strange words now <e> <s> we hear the objection of the lord advocate to bureaucratic intervention <e> <s> but this whole bill is bureaucratic intervention intervention in something that has been giving a perfectly good and desirable service from a consumers point of view the british gas corporation <e> <s> suddenly bureaucratic intervention becomes a dirty phrase <e> <s> to what are we applying this intervention <e>", "<cs> we are most grateful to the noble lord the minister for this information he has been very helpful <e> <s> but does he have the information i asked for about the number of people in scotland <e> <s> was i right in thinking that the number is about <e>", "<cs> i think the committee should be grateful to the noble lord lord tanlaw for having raised this important issue and there should be no complaint about the length of time we take over it <e> <s> in fact i think the real complaint is that at such an hour we should he dealing with a matter of such importance <e> <s> because we should remember that what we are dealing with is protecting people from <e>", "<cs> i am not concerned about an even-handed approach <e> <s> i do not want the private people in at all <e> <s> i think that it is wasteful and destructive of an efficient organisation <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord who has asked that question raises a matter of very considerable importance <e> <s> indeed if he casts his eye down the marshalled list he will discover that there is an amendment in the name of the opposition and the noble lord lord tanlaw in respect of the compatibility of the gas that may be used <e> <s> however here we are dealing mainly with the pipe-line aspect of it <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister to enlighten us by saying exactly where in the bill that is stated <e>", "<cs> these are new pipe-lines <e>", "<cs> will the minister read again paragraph <e>", "<cs> i am very glad that so distinguished a scholar as the noble lord lord robbins has had the same difficulty as i have myself <e> <s> crystal clear used to be one of the favourite phrases of the secretary of state <e> <s> after i pointed it out to him a few times he changed the phrase but it is coming back <e> <s> if ever we required crystal clarity it was in this connection <e> <s> it may have been a good explanation but i think we must ask the government to promise that with every publication of this bill when it becomes an act there shall be appended for the benefit of all who read this clause and subsection <e>", "<cs> of course it takes time and requires planning permission <e> <s> it requires all the <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord rises i am really concerned about one point <e> <s> he did not answer my question about payment <e> <s> will there be any initial payment by those who make representations which may or may not lead to the direction to be given by the secretary of state to the gas corporation <e> <s> there is nothing in the clause about it and i instanced the fact that in relation to an important order which the noble earl lord mansfield will deal tonight people are going to be charged for all sorts of things in relation to their own homes <e> <s> for example if they are going to put up a gate or build an extension to their house and so on there is going to be an increase of per cent <e> <s> on the already unjustified charge that the government have introduced <e> <s> have they thought about this because the expenses are going to be very heavy on his department <e>", "<cs> yes as well <e>", "<cs> they are statutorily bound to give supplies <e> <s> there may be difficulties at some times <e> <s> i do not know whether a private company in which the noble earl might be interested would give us any better supplies <e> <s> i can assure him that the supplies that were given by the british gas corporation in scotland during a very difficult time indeed were available there only because of their ability to control an integrated system and to use supplies from elsewhere and so put them into the area that was using most of the gas <e> <s> the position now under this clause is that they can be compelled to increase the capacity of their <e>", "<cs> with all due respect a contract is a contract <e> <s> i do not know what the noble earl is talking about <e> <s> if they were not complying with the terms of the contract the noble earl would have some justification for interrupting but we are talking about their statutory obligation as regards supplies which they guarantee to most of their customers unless they are of the specific type which the noble earl quite irrelevantly introduced in his interruption <e> <s> that is what we are dealing with now <e> <s> we are dealing with the directions to be given by the secretary of state <e> <s> we do not know who advises him but i am perfectly sure that he has not got the people at the moment and he will need to get them <e> <s> he is dealing now with a very intricate point in respect of an integrated system which can be broken by doing the wrong thing <e>", "<cs> we are talking about the obligations of the british gas corporation to provide supplies throughout the whole country <e> <s> it may well be that if the wrong modifications are made and the wrong apparatus is put in for which they are not responsible it could i do not say that it will impinge upon their ability to carry out their statutory duties under the original gas act <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> well we are making an advance <e> <s> the minister is going to look at it again read it again and he is going to have the lord advocate by his side i hope when he does so <e> <s> or it may be that the lord advocate wants to consider it on his own <e> <s> i think the advice of the noble earl lord lauderdale was right <e> <s> what we are concerned about is that a technical judgment should not be taken without the government knowing fully the express opinion of the british gas corporation in relation to that <e>", "<cs> yes it is the responsibility of the british gas corporation once the gas is in the pipes <e> <s> if the gas is then found to be incompatible the corporation will be placed in considerable difficulty in regard to making it compatible and safe in relation to first the pipes and secondly the appliances <e> <s> what concerns me is whether it is right that the corporation should be put belatedly to that expense <e> <s> who is responsible for testing the gas to ensure that it is compatible before it goes into the pipe-line <e> <s> the work should be carried out at that particular point <e> <s> i do not want to see in the pipes any gas that is incompatible and it would he far better to ensure at source that it was compatible <e> <s> that is the reason for the amendment <e> <s> this is an important matter and doubt has been cast on the adequacy of the present wording of the bill <e> <s> so i should have thought that the government would have been prepared to accept the amendment and i am very disappointed that they have not accepted it <e>", "<cs> i listened carefully <e> <s> i did not see any great advance by the minister remembering that he already has promised to look at amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i think that amendment no <e> <s> is more tied to amendment no <e> <s> than any other amendment because it deals probably more generally with the question of safety <e> <s> this deals with one specific point that access has been granted and the direction has been made in respect of access but to achieve that access to achieve the supply going to a particular customer of the private supply a junction has to be made <e> <s> all that <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> it was under my control for only eight years <e>", "<cs> i can assure you that things may well have gone wrong then too <e> <s> where there is the technical expertise and everyone admits that it is there with the bgc surely this amendment which is a good amendment is harmless to the governments main purpose and principles of achieving competition <e> <s> how the technical aspects are going to be dealt with surely should be left to the bcg <e> <s> that is what this amendment does <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed grateful or should be grateful to the noble lord lord lyell for his very lucid explanation of these rather complex regulations <e> <s> admittedly he was selective in <e>", "<cs> this is clause and i gather that the lord advocate suggested that this <e>", "<cs> yes i know we get that in relation to the act but i thought the noble and learned lord referred to yet another act <e> <s> he referred to two acts <e> <s> this is where it is confusing because somewhere else in the schedule there will be in reference to these acts that he has mentioned something saying leave out or repeal this section that section or some other section <e> <s> i think there should be an indication there as indeed there is in the next clause that we are coming to clause where it says <e>", "<cs> from the two speeches that we have had we get a fair indication of the complexity of what is being done and the consequences of what is being done <e> <s> i am going to make a simple drafting point <e> <s> clause says application act <e> <s> this is the mineral workings offshore installations act not this bill <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> this is a change in the offshore petroleum development scotland act <e> <s> i tend to look after my own children with a certain amount of care and i want to know what this wicked government are doing to them hence my interest in clause <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that under the seabed is under the sea so why change it <e> <s> that is already contained in the original act <e> <s> what the government are doing is distorting this and thinking up new ideas which do not lead to clarification of the law but rather to its obfuscation <e>", "<cs> it may well be that the noble and learned lord does not have the information but it seems to me to be so important and so valuable a piece of legislation that it has got to be extended to cover the storage of gas <e> <s> may i ask whether the power contained in the act has been used <e>", "<cs> in england <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl the minister tell us what is the effect on the hill sheep industry of the price review which the government had imposed upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister for his very clear though rather galloped explanation of the bill <e> <s> i had certainly been looking forward to a bill based upon the stodart report but we have got something rather different from that <e> <s> it is not to the advantage of the kind of discussions that we are bound to have to begin with angry rows about what has been done in respect of local government finance <e> <s> may i say at the start that though i thank the minister there are no thanks to those who arrange business in this house that on a shortened day they see fit to put down two major measures for discussion and see further fit that those who have furthest to go shall be last <e> <s> i do not know why the scots have put up with this for so long but here is one scot who is not going to put up with it <e> <s> i was also concerned as i listened to the previous meandering through matters relating to mad dogs and sex-starved englishmen that we were more than slightly unfairly dealt with in scotland in this regard <e>", "<cs> you have improved too <e>", "<cs> i am glad to dissociate myself from the parentage of the stewart committee but not from the findings of the stewart committee <e> <s> it must be terrible for english peers to find that we have an entirely separate not legal system alone but way of dealing with the law <e> <s> simply because the noble lord lord lucas is troubled that we have this advantage that we have somebody who is independent of government and indeed independent of the judiciary who is concerned with prosecutions in scotland he suggests that we should forget all about that when it comes to traffic offences <e>", "<cs> it might be <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of the branches of nuclear science in which we in this country have long held a lead <e> <s> for how long has the fast breeder reactor been putting electricity into the national grid <e> <s> also for how long has this review been taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl agree that it is years since a labour government gave the go-ahead for a prototype fast breeder reactor at dounreay so that we have had plenty of experience of that <e> <s> would it not have been better for the noble earl the minister to acquaint himself and the house with the fact that the safety factor involved in fast breeder processing is very much more reassuring than with other processes <e> <s> will he not under-estimate the value of this to the highland area and continuing work there <e> <s> we do not want another invergordon further north <e>", "<cs> we are grateful for that explanation by the noble earl the minister although he did not reply to the point i made about section of the act and the fact that i consider this to be an unnecessary duplication <e> <s> indeed it might well be that under the power he has the secretary of state could amend section of the act <e> <s> has the noble earl given any thought to that particular point <e> <s> my difficulty is that the bill does not say that it will deal only with orders <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am entitled to speak again but i will ask leave just in case <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought so <e> <s> it is great that i still have some rights left <e> <s> local authorities have not many rights left <e> <s> my noble friend should read this <e> <s> no one is required to prove that the local authority have anticipated the evil intent of the secretary of state <e> <s> subsection says if the secretary of state is of the opinion that subsection has been contravened <e> <s> it is just the opinion of the secretary of state <e> <s> what could be worse than that <e> <s> what could be more tyrannical or dictatorial than that <e> <s> it may well be a completely prudent local authority anticipating only that there is going to be a gap between what is produced by rates and what they have to spend offsetting that by use of their loans fund quite prudently <e> <s> but they are now going to be in the position that if they do that even for the best of purposes it is going to be construed by the secretary of state as anticipating that he was going to take action against them <e>", "<cs> no my lords i would not agree <e> <s> the fact is that the words do not mean anything at all and do not extend as the noble earl suggests this particular power <e> <s> however this is the report stage and it is no time to argue the matter out <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not like it when the minister tells me that it will be all right when i look at the <e>", "<cs> my lords we have this strange business that the local authority is counted as a plural body and the government having seen the amendment tabled hurriedly raced in to change <e>", "<cs> my lords it has not been accepted <e> <s> my goodness <e> <s> this is one of the changes that there are to make <e> <s> is it not incredible <e> <s> they are not accepting it <e> <s> they are insisting on are here and they are putting are in the other one <e> <s> surely not is it not crazy <e>", "<cs> my lords i was a very young chalky then <e>", "<cs> that is world-shattering my lords such a noise like scotlands second goal against russia <e> <s> it still rings in my ears <e> <s> if only the referee had allowed the other two minutes of extra time we would have scored a third <e> <s> i shall not press the minister on the other matters though i must apologise to the house because having tabled this simple amendment i was then faced with the government to save their own face putting down another four amendments to get consistency <e> <s> it is the old business of everybody being out of step but our jock so we change everybody else so that jock can be in step <e> <s> i was about to say that this was a case that called for the lord advocate <e> <s> we used to resort to that calling for the lord advocate <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are grateful to my noble friend lord jenkins of putney for this amendment mainly because it gives us an opportunity of once again expressing the fears which have been relayed to us by certain authorities <e> <s> i can think of the lyceum theatre company in edinburgh the citizen theatre company in glasgow and the borderline in irvine not to mention the others of more scottish context and support like the scottish orchestra the scottish ballet and scottish opera <e> <s> i think myself that probably the government have gone as far as they can <e> <s> of course the trouble is that the obligation rests upon one authority now and it is just open to the other authority to contribute <e> <s> the real danger at the present time as i see it is that with local authorities being pressed by the government in relation to their overall expenditure too often the kind of expenditure which is sacrificed as a result of that pressure is money spent on something which may be of majority interest to some of us but which really is a minority interest <e> <s> the cultural aspects of life are those which are shed first and that to my mind is the real danger <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not here at the committee stage so i was denied the opportunity to allow my noble friend lord stodart i do not think he will mind me calling him that to quote what i said in <e> <s> i apologise to him for that <e> <s> i am sure that he spent a long time trying to find out how what i said then is in conflict with whatever i might say now <e>", "<cs> my lords we have to thank the minister for his explanation of this order <e> <s> i have been sitting here waiting wondering what the explanation was going to be whether it was that they had found some legal snag because remember the last order came before us only on i think it was th april <e> <s> i am the last person who should forget that date because it happened to be my st birthday <e> <s> but that order was no birthday present because it was departing considerably from what we in scotland had prided ourselves on namely that apart from the one period that the minister mentioned which really was created by the reorganisation of local authorities we have a very good record in maintaining the quinquennial revaluations in scotland <e> <s> that is essential because unless you keep the rolls up-to-date and unless you give the opportunity many people would argue that five years is long enough for that to get rid of the anomalies that come to light during those five years then you get into very considerable elements of unfairness <e> <s> it was disappointing to me though not surprising that we got this partial revaluation promised us for <e>", "<cs> my lords and also to the secretary of state for scotland who is the member of parliament for ayr <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister will allow me he is quite wrong there <e> <s> they could introduce points into an act of parliament as indeed they did in respect of certain aspects of revaluation in the last local government act we had <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say as a preface that i do not expect we shall be terribly long because i do not think my voice will last out <e> <s> i attended a well-known and important international seminar in scotland last wednesday at hampden <e>", "<cs> my lords i think these are all reasonable drafting amendments <e> <s> the only one that raises any question is the one that defines a reasonable time for production of a licence by the individual as five days <e> <s> i do not suppose there is any application to the sheriff for an extension of those five days <e> <s> having heard of six months being reasonable in respect of something else i should have thought that five days might not be a good figure bearing in mind that a weekend might intervene and there might be some hold-ups <e> <s> i am not going to oppose this but i do not think there has been any very clear thinking in respect of these specific periods put in elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a sensible amendment <e> <s> it was my honourable friend the member for glasgow garscadden who raised this matter <e> <s> disqualification means a loss of livelihood until such time as the licence is then granted <e> <s> in keeping with the disqualification in respect of a road traffic licence where a person can apply up to the period stated in the transport act it is only fair that we should apply the same measure of reconsideration for the licences now required for all sorts of things in this bill <e> <s> i congratulate the government upon having made the change <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not make any effort to go through the list of amendments <e> <s> it would have been helpful to have known that the amendments were to be taken in that order <e> <s> i received something a couple of hours ago as to how amendments were to be taken together but capable as i am of going through the bill i do not think two hours is quite sufficient <e> <s> this particular batch was not included in that advice and i think that makes matters more difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my thanks to the noble earl for his generous offer <e> <s> i think he said that something would be ready about the th of this month that was last week <e> <s> but i am not a full-time politician with a whole band of civil servants behind me and i have one or two other responsible duties as well at least they are duties that i consider responsible and worth doing <e> <s> i was merely referring to the grouping of the amendments <e> <s> that information would have been helpful to anyone who was concerned to see how the matter would be handled in the house <e> <s> no offer was ever made as regards that <e> <s> as i say i received it sometime this morning without even having asked for it <e> <s> but i shall not quarrel over this kind of thing <e> <s> i think that the noble earl is doing very well at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not call the noble earl gracious i never call him that <e> <s> soon after i came here i christened him the master of the infelicitous phrase <e> <s> i am afraid that he still is at times <e> <s> he still has a lot to learn but we will carry on with the educational process <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister for his explanation and to the government for their actions in this respect <e> <s> the only thing i would suggest is that this bill started out somewhere about years ago <e> <s> then a few years ago we had a model bill <e> <s> then we had the actual bill which left this place in march <e> <s> it is a pity there had not been a little more consultation with the people concerned the local authorities and with the federation of taxi owners and the hire car organisations although i gather that they more or less come into being with the bill <e> <s> they suddenly realised how important it was that their voice should be heard so i cannot blame the government for not consulting them <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the really important matter is that the fare is controlled <e>", "<cs> and fixed by the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad the government have taken the action they have <e> <s> the minister will remember that we pointed out that this point was made in a report over years ago <e> <s> it was surprising to me that the government rejected the advice given to them by that working party <e> <s> nevertheless i am glad they have come round to this form of wording because i do not agree with the noble lord lord mackie that it is competition in the accepted sense <e> <s> it is often unfair competition <e> <s> part-timers will not give a service except at times when they think it proper to provide that service and all they are doing at those times is reducing the facilities available by knocking out those whose whole livelihood is earned by providing a service to the public at all times <e> <s> it results in a very patchy service because if you knock out a full-time man the part-timer will not be there say in the morning or in the afternoon when there is not a lot of business about so from the point of view of service to the public which should be paramount the government have come eventually to the right decision and i am grateful to them for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that what the minister has said is right in regard to the first two amendments but i do not think that it is equally true about the final amendment in the group amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> what is meant is not readily understandable whereas what was already stated in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the changes that have been made here <e> <s> it is a complete departure from what we had in the original act <e> <s> we had no reference to second-hand motor dealers specifically in the bill as it first came to us <e> <s> after reading the debates in respect of this both in committee and on report and appreciating what i did not realise that about million second-hand cars a year are sold as against a figure for new cars of only the importance of this and the importance of dealing with all the tricks that somehow or other can <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl recalls these clauses were subject to criticism in this house as well <e> <s> clauses like that were quite impossible and certainly very unfair <e> <s> i am very glad that the government have changed their minds and are prepared to rely as they should have in the first instance on common law <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of the most important amendments in the bill <e> <s> i hope that the government and the scottish office will have learned the lesson that when they come to consider licensing they should look at the practicalities and realities behind it and that all scrap dealers are not people who just go about the streets buying up this and buying up that <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> and the amendment dealing with the schedule which goes with it virtually introduce a new bill <e> <s> many bills have come before this house which were smaller than this one clause <e> <s> there are pages dealing with the licensing of sex shops <e> <s> it is only fair to say that to handle the matter in this way simply by commenting on a commons amendment does not reflect the importance of the subject <e> <s> certainly this subject is of importance to many people in scotland <e> <s> admittedly there was full discussion in another place but that cannot be said about this amendment <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords do i take it that this is purely drafting and for clarification we leave out the phrase in one part of the clause and put it in at another <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly wholeheartedly agree with what the government are doing here <e> <s> i think that it is absolutely essential that we should protect our children from this utterly appalling practice <e> <s> it must be offensive to every right-thinking man and certainly to everyone except the most sickeningly abnormal <e> <s> there are one or two who defend the right to do this kind of thing but i do not think that anyone here would do so <e> <s> i only hope that the government have gone far enough <e>", "<cs> my lords at last we have something satisfactory to all concerned and it has <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought for a minute that the noble lord was offering me compensation for the loss of my voice but i gather it is not that <e> <s> this is a point that i think i raised during proceedings in this house earlier and i am very glad that the government have changed their mind about it <e> <s> i think is too high <e> <s> the new figure is <e> <s> the loss off is an awful lot to some people and the figure is rightly amended in this particular case <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this is pertinent to what we are discussing <e> <s> we should be very grateful if we all got a copy of that suggestion of how the apportionment is going to he made <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend has missed a lot of opportunities for barking about dogs over the years <e> <s> i do not know whether it has escaped his knowledge that over the past three to four years i have been complaining about the unfortunate minister on the other side coming forward to support private legislation applying to local authorities the powers that were given to the police in the act and giving the right to appoint dog wardens and to be active in respect of stray dogs <e> <s> every single district one after the other had to mount a separate piece of private legislation <e> <s> just imagine the cost of it my lords <e> <s> where was my noble friend when i sought to get general legislation <e> <s> he was silent <e>

lords i appreciate that <e> <s> i have noticed the difference in my noble friend since his translation from one part of westminster to the other <e> <s> this is all very good but we have the legislation in relation to dogs scattered all over the place <e> <s> i want to ask just one question <e> <s> shall we get for scotland some measure of consolidation in relation to dog acts or is it as i suspect that we are not yet finished with the legislation and there is more to come <e> <s> there could be very much more since we made advances even in clause after the bill left here <e> <s> we have something new put into it and it becomes all the more important that we have some consolidation and look to see exactly what is still left in relation to the unsatisfactory position <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord melchett on having raised this subject <e> <s> it has enlightened many of your lordships about the western isles <e> <s> we do not have very many debates about the western isles and i hope that in future much more sympathetic attention will be paid to the needs of the western isles <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will convey to his noble friend lord mackie my apologies for having mentioned his name not knowing that he was going to apologise <e> <s> he is always there so i turned round with confidence thinking he would he there <e> <s> the fears may well be real and i think they can be dissipated <e>", "<cs> no my lords i want to finish this very good story <e> <s> having got there and seen this and admired it and seen the trouble there was to get it done and learning it was the co-operation of the people of the township that had done it i said mr macleod how did you do it <e> <s> he held up the biggest fist i had ever seen and said by persuasion <e> <s> sometimes i think we need that kind of thing in this house <e> <s> i hope our persuasion will be such that our fears although they may be real if we

for the better <e> <s> there can be benefits from it <e> <s> it is neglect that has produced some of the habitat and you are not going to persuade me that we must continue to neglect people <e>", "<cs> well my lords i have not always said that he was the most gracious of ministers but the instance he quoted was about a civil servant saving to him that it had been done in the past and i am saying that of course it had been done in the past <e> <s> it is being done today under the less-favoured-area grants and under reseeding grants and schemes like that <e>", "<cs> my lords we must be grateful to the noble earl the minister for giving us this information <e> <s> it is important that we get a settlement here because until we do we will not be able to plan ahead in respect of the size and the support needed to obtain that size of the fishing industry <e> <s> it has gone on far too long <e> <s> i would like to wait and see the exact details of this matter before i join with the praises <e> <s> i notice that the <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful to the noble lord lord tanlaw for raising this matter which is so dear to the heart of every scot and sadly enough becoming dearer to the pocket of every scot <e> <s> he will appreciate that he is only obeying probably the most historic injunction ever given to representatives of scotland at westminster <e> <s> on the very same subject of the tyrannous attitude of the department of excise and the closing down of distilleries in scotland there was quite an outcry and scotlands national bard penned some words an <e>", "<cs> delighted <e>", "<cs> my lords do the recent planting and replanting figures show that we are reaching the target set by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl tell us what the cost of these new jobs will be <e> <s> while we are grateful for anything that is done does he appreciate that at clydebank in scotland which was the first enterprise zone we lost more than jobs which is the number of jobs the noble earl boasted about as having been created for the whole of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl the minister referred to the fact that his father had spoken on the original bill now the act the main act <e> <s> the noble lord lord campbell of croy referred to the speeches that he had made on it <e> <s> need i say that i remember very well the bill going through the scottish committee and i believe that one or two speeches were made by myself at that time <e> <s> the interesting thing is that that bill was regarded as representing quite a radical change and indeed itself it marked a radical change in the attitude of the public to mental illness <e> <s> for the first time it was considered that mental illness was just as likely to afflict anyone as was bodily illness and the stigma which i am sorry to say someone spoke about today i think that it was the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe was removed by the bill <e> <s> it was seen to be natural that people might become mentally ill and it was right that that fact should be marked by a new attitude in legislation <e> <s> it was a great step forward <e> <s> bearing in mind that the old board of control that had existed was wiped out and was replaced by a mental welfare commission years before the english got round to it it was a very important development <e>", "<cs> my lords may i tell the noble lord that i followed his father and i did not pull his leg <e>", "<cs> my lords the house and indeed the country are indebted to the noble earl lord halsbury for initiating this debate not only for recognising the timely need for it but for his ability for at once enlightening and entertaining so that even simple minds like mine can take in some of the abstruse technical matters which have been concerning us today <e>", "<cs> my lords before we give a third reading to this bill may we be told something about it <e> <s> i have a very special reason for speaking now and that is because i have a very sentimental attachment to the area <e> <s> during the war i used to parade with <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down there is only one other point that i should like to ask <e> <s> i should like to know whether or not he has had protests about this <e> <s> after all we are reclaiming land <e> <s> this house is experiencing strange times dealing with the western islands and the isles of scotland <e> <s> lots of people are concerned <e> <s> the concern is not so much about the crofters but about birds <e> <s> if one is going to reclaim land it is going to affect the habitats of many of the waders which are dear to the hearts of many people in this house <e> <s> have there been any protests from people about this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there are certain fascinations about this particular bill which will not have escaped your lordships notice <e> <s> in days when we hear much of privatisation and of the curse of public ownership it comes strange that the secretary of state should set forth this bill for our consideration <e> <s> it actually gives powers to a local authority to run a bus service <e> <s> why are this government forced to do this <e> <s> it is something which they abhor <e> <s> the simple reason is that the private individuals do not want to do it <e> <s> there is no money in it <e> <s> there is very little money in the western isles anyway but i would have thought that all the proponents of this great principle would have been there opposing this bill and demanding that something be done in respect of the privatisation of the bus services in the western isles <e>", "<cs> my lords surely at the present time the private organisations are being paid by the local authority under the scottish office and there is already something in the rate support grant for that purpose <e> <s> could we not have these <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not dream of opposing this bill <e> <s> in fact i am surprised that we are having a debate at all on it <e> <s> i should have thought that this would have been ruled as a money bill but i gather that it has not been so ruled <e> <s> certainly in another place there was quite a lot of discussion which to my purist mind would have been well outside the rules of order normally in relation to <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i suppose i should come to the penitence stool because i was secretary of state when the bill went through <e> <s> confession is always good for the soul and probably even more good at christmas <e> <s> i commend it therefore to the minister himself <e> <s> there is no doubt at all about it this machinery causes potentially a substantial loss to local authorities in scotland in rateable revenue <e> <s> it is because of the aspect of the removable plant and machinery for heating and lighting in buildings used for trade business and manufacturing <e> <s> the result of the dropping of that particular phrase meant that they were no longer subject to valuation <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should apologise to the house for the absence of the noble earl lord selkirk because he it was who was perplexed worried and concerned about the clause as was the noble lord opposite who spoke so well <e>", "<cs> out of fairness to the noble earl the minister i should explain to the committee before he replies that in the last two lines of my amendment which read <e>", "<cs> the noble earl the minister has put his points very fairly <e> <s> remember the present maximum is and the present size of the commission is <e> <s> if we accepted the first part of amendment no <e> <s> that we should only put in a minimum and set no specific number as a maximum it would simply mean that the government could leave matters as they are <e> <s> judging by what the noble earl said about a quorum he could have the same number as we have at the present but with an increased quorum which would not make very much sense <e> <s> if the noble earl is promising that then having accepted this increased quorum as he says he is going to do he ought to give a pledge that there will be more than members <e>", "<cs> in view of what the minister has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister said there were three members left who had been appointed under the old rgime prior to and that that included the chairman <e> <s> what has been happening since <e> <s> has the tendency been appointment for four years and that may well be that as far as these post- appointments are concerned <e> <s> has there been a greater rate of changeover since <e> <s> i do not think there is any actual term laid down in statute it is a matter for the secretary of state <e> <s> i do not necessarily disagree with what has happened knowing lord mcdonald and knowing what he has brought to the work of the commission <e> <s> i think it would be quite wrong statutorily to rule somebody out because they have been there for eight years <e> <s> i can think of chairmen of forestry commissions and things like that they might grow with the term of office <e> <s> when you apply that to some of the other offices we would object to such a severe limitation <e> <s> i think that once again we should leave it to the common sense of the secretary of state to decide what is done <e> <s> i should be grateful if the minister could tell me what the tendency has been since <e> <s> after all it is nearly years <e> <s> have any of those appointed since had more than two terms of four years <e>", "<cs> i think that formally to move an amendment and then to claim that it is an important amendment is a little too much <e> <s> after all this could mean nothing at all <e>", "<cs> the minister of state has gone some way in that he managed to utter the words voluntary organisation <e> <s> he must appreciate that since when the principal act was passed there have been fortunately far more interest and at times sadly more concern about what has been happening in this field <e> <s> it would be quite wrong if the secretary of state limited his consultation to people in the legal and medical professions and to people with that kind of interest in the body <e> <s> there are many parents who as a result of concern about this matter have built themselves up to a position where they know far more about it than many lawyers and many of the welfare commissioners of the past <e> <s> i should like to have had a little more reassurance from the minister that the secretary of state will consider people connected with the voluntary organisations <e> <s> i do not think for a minute that the secretary of state will be asking for nominations <e> <s> he does not do that in this kind of matter any more than he does on many other aspects <e> <s> wide as the provision is it lacks the detailed pledge <e>", "<cs> we are dealing with a very different point from that which we were dealing with in lord mansfields amendment <e> <s> his amendment was in relation to consultation <e> <s> i am sure that the secretary of state will be prepared to consult everybody in the whole of scotland for that matter but this is a different matter and to that extent it is a much more important matter because it deals with the recommendations that the secretary of state makes to her majesty for appointment as a commissioner <e> <s> we are now dealing with the actual appointments where lord taylor of gryfes amendment specifically states that the secretary of state has to ensure that the commissioners <e>", "<cs> the secretary of state is still in command because the provision concludes with the words <e>", "<cs> all these commissioners since the year when the commission was set up have been labouring under this situation and i have never heard a single complaint <e> <s> not one <e> <s> the position at the moment is that the secretary of state may pay to the said commissioners such remuneration and allowances as he may with the approval of the treasury determine <e> <s> if the question is one of full-time commissioners then i can understand <e> <s> in fact where anyone is employing anybody at all under the laws of this country there has to be superannuation <e> <s> it might not be very much in the government scheme but that is part of the terms of employment <e>", "<cs> that is to say the new funding of the commission <e>", "<cs> so all this arises out of the changes that we have already made which are to my mind illusory in giving a greater measure of freedom and independence to the commission whereas we have already discovered that they are independent and free so far as the secretary of state will allow and so far as the treaury will allow the secretary of state to allow them to allow <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> why does the secretary of state need to do this under the new rgime the new power the new freedoms that we are giving to the commission <e> <s> why do they not do it for themselves <e>", "<cs> of course they have to have the cash <e> <s> we have already been told that they are going to get the cash <e> <s> they are going to get the cash from the secretary of state <e> <s> all this comes from the change which is quite unnecessarily being made by the government <e> <s> it does not end there <e> <s> i have another amendment which i shall come to i think we had better come to it right away so i shall withdraw this amendment <e> <s> we are getting nowhere anyway with may and shall <e> <s> i shall proceed to the next amendment with more hope <e>", "<cs> but why should that be so <e> <s> clause of the bill says that the mental welfare commission may appoint under <e>", "<cs> surely the question is whether or not they are doing it <e> <s> the feeling is abroad and we should like to be corrected on this that the commission are a very passive organisation that they sit and wait for complaints and that they are not the kind of dynamic organisation which should be improving the whole care and attention that is being paid to people who are suffering from mental illness <e> <s> that is why we hoped that we would get a different bill a new bill and a bill in advance of what is being done instead of this jogging amendment bill which nobody can understand without a great deal of trouble <e> <s> that is because even if you have available the original act you discover that that has been amended three or four times <e>", "<cs> i explained that i was concerned about the implications of this not really in respect of the mental welfare commission but i think that if there has to be guardianship the functions of the mental welfare commission should comprehend those functions covered by guardianship <e> <s> what i was trying to get from the government was an opinion about the merits and value of guardianship at all in the present day <e> <s> that the noble earl said it was very little <e>", "<cs> this amendment instead of giving us annual report as i understand it gives us a report every two years <e> <s> i am not entirely satisfied that this is right <e> <s> most bodies report annually <e> <s> if it is a matter of giving time to the commission to get into the way of the amended act as it will be they are not going to start until and that is pretty generous to them <e> <s> but then every second year thereafter i cannot accept i do not think that is right <e> <s> we are coming to the further amendment to be considered <e> <s> if we pass this amendment that kills the debate on an annual report <e> <s> if we decide it is going to be a report every two years we cannot then discuss whether it should be an annual report <e> <s> so we have to discuss this now <e>", "<cs> i expected that final comment that is why i said i was prepared to change the time from months to two years <e> <s> i would even grant the minister three years <e> <s> the minister said that this would be a herculean task <e> <s> we are recreating the scottish mental welfare commission <e> <s> we are already giving it new duties so why not this additional <e>", "<cs> the noble earl says large complex and expensive and yet we are told by the minister that they already know the deficiencies <e> <s> a lot of this is known to the secretary of state already <e> <s> it is purely a matter for a little co-operation between the secretary of states department and the mental welfare commission so that the mental welfare commission would be able as regards the deficiencies to highlight the priorities in respect of improving the situation <e>", "<cs> it is the way in which the government tell them they will carry out their duties to which i object <e> <s> trust a lawyer to come along here with special pleading for lawyers <e> <s> i have always been suspicious of lawyers <e> <s> it was interesting that when the government set up a commission on legal aid and matters relating to the legal profession it was not a lawyer an advocate

himself and keep a little calm <e> <s> he will get his meal in about minutes <e> <s> we have plenty of time <e> <s> so far as getting on to the next amendment is concerned i hope when we do

defective would remain in the statute <e> <s> that is the sole effect of the amendment <e> <s> frankly i was faced with the same problem as to how to raise this particular point <e> <s> i came to it

handicapped and not mentally defective <e> <s> whether he as a lawyer likes it or not i as an ordinary person moving among people am telling him that they feel it very strongly and they put it very strongly to the scottish office <e> <s> the scottish <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed that the minister has given the very old reply that the people just do not know which bill these measures are in or

given a lot of attention to this <e> <s> we have made advances in the early detection of handicap and have placed responsibility for that on the local authorities and health authorities <e> <s> we

probably reappear in another two or three months <e> <s> is it purely a matter of dependence on alcohol or drugs <e> <s> the point which the noble earl lord selkirk makes is very relevant <e> <s> maybe there is the implication that they are being treated when according to the act they should not be treated because that will certainly be the case if we pass this clause as it stands <e> <s> i sincerely hope that the minister will look very carefully at the implications as regards not only people detained but treatment that can be given to voluntary patients in respect of both drugs and alcohol <e>", "<cs> we have to thank the minister of state for that response <e> <s> i am sure it was in <e>", "<cs> i shall be able to withdraw it though i am slightly troubled about a few other drafting matters to which we will come later and which relate to the possibility that we shall have different standards throughout the country <e> <s> as the noble earl said they are guidelines there

those standards to be followed by the local authorities <e> <s> perhaps we should wait to see what the guidelines are <e> <s> the noble earl suggested that it would be up to the local authorities as to whether they accepted the guidelines and standards and he hoped there would be uniformity of standards <e> <s> we must go beyond that if we are really concerned about the matter <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to those noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> i think that they appreciate the complexity <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord lord winstanley appreciates that we started off in the act under a different local government set-up in which the medical officer of health really was <e>", "<cs> if the noble earl lord selkirk allows me to withdraw the amendments i shall gladly withdraw

bill from this point of view <e>", "<cs> when a government bring forward a bill containing a power as new as this they should already have all the arguments <e> <s> i can only assume that when the minister says <e> <s> let us have the bill and i will bring along all the arguments later he does not have them and i think he does not have them because he does not have any <e> <s> however i shall not divide the committee on the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords any agreement that we have within the common market is bound to be a compromise <e> <s> this one is an acceptable compromise and let us not shout too loudly about successes victories and who has won <e> <s> it is an acceptable compromise which the industry very much needs because if we are to have years of stability we shall now be able to start the planning <e> <s> that could not be done and governments on all sides said that it could not be done until we could see the way ahead with a common policy <e>", "<cs> my lords when the minister says that he is consulting local authorities does he include within that the scottish local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the minister must know <e> <s> he is concerned with scottish local authorities in view of a great section of the bill at present going through the house which concerns social workers and their training <e> <s> that is already there and the government have some view about it <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful to the minister for his explanation of this important order <e> <s> when you boil it down we approved it without any division in this house when we passed the act because it was bringing a measure of fairness between the industrialists concerned in scotland as against england and wales <e> <s> but then we looked at the practical effects of the order and the minister rightly said that it will mean a loss of million of rateable value to scottish local authorities <e> <s> that figure of million is not to be sneezed at and when you consider that this is borne mainly by three local authorities orkney islands council shetland islands council and the central region we come down to the question whether the government have adequately met the difficulty that will be there <e>", "<cs> my lords before we leave this bill and give it our blessing perhaps the government will answer a question that arises from information which the government have given on the bill <e> <s> the work on this new pier is to be in two stages work no <e> <s> and work no <e> <s> <e> <s> i notice that work no <e> <s> is to cost and the government themselves have stated that they have received an application which they have accepted in principle and are prepared to pay i think it is to the trustees of the ullapool pier <e>", "<cs> my lords it comes from the financial memorandum on the very front page of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the very opposite less <e> <s> the financial memorandum states <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the minister for repeating the statement which i notice was probably prompted by discoveries made by the scottish special housing association <e> <s> a figure of houses built in scotland has been quoted <e> <s> can the minister tell me how many of them were built by the scottish special housing association itself <e> <s> secondly may i tell him that they are not the most satisfactory house that ever was built and he may discover that there was a history of complaints <e> <s> i can remember that as a back-bench member of parliament in the forties i received complaints about orlit houses <e> <s> the minister may discover that these houses are in the constituency of the present secretary of state for scotland in ayr <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly am and i am sure others on this side of the house will be grateful to the minister for what he has done <e> <s> i do not take any exception to any of the drafting <e> <s> i do not take responsibility for it either if it is twisted around in another place <e> <s> personally i always like to do my own drafting <e> <s> it is usually safer that way <e> <s> i do not think that in this day and age we need to limit the number of women who are on a committee <e> <s> if there are four women who are worth while we should have four <e> <s> but the feeling is that if one stipulates three one will get only three at the most <e> <s> that is the only slight quibble <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble earl will not close his mind about this matter <e> <s> we have a very confusing picture of this new body <e> <s> the name is the same but we have changed the whole purpose of the body <e> <s> it has been given a completely new status and a greater measure of independence from the secretary of state a matter about which much has been made by the minister <e> <s> one of the difficulties about the whole set of the bill is that there has not been a completely new look at the problem and we have been carrying on patching together from the present into the future <e> <s> it is a curious form of commission where there are three people on that commission who are not advisory alone but are actually executive and who are going out and making up their minds about something and then coming back either to the whole commission or even worse to a sub-committee which of course they would undoubtedly be able to dominate <e>", "<cs> my lords all that remains for me to do is to express my gratitude to the minister and to point out to the noble lord lord winstanley how open-minded scottish ministers are and how easily they can collect the will of the house and how to that will <e> <s> that to my mind typifies a good minister <e> <s> the noble earl lord mansfield is improving <e> <s> having set out in this way let him carry on <e> <s> do not let him run away with the idea that the noble lord lord drumalbyn is entirely wrong <e> <s> if there is some important change made during a year i would hope that that would be forthcoming within the annual report if it is worth reporting <e> <s> but enough be said thank you <e>", "<cs> it does not my lords for the simple reason that if the subsection were not there then if there were such a case the commission could appoint such a person <e> <s> the presumption that all cases this arises out of the word shall in this instance are like that is wrong <e> <s> it may be something meriting inquiry but is not of the nature of the case cited by the minister in which case it might be eminently suitable for a lay person or non-professional person or a person from a different profession altogether to do it easily <e> <s> he would still have all the powers in the schedule in respect of administering oaths and i know many justices of the peace who are not lawyers who can administer oaths <e> <s> from that point of view therefore the government are on a weak point <e>", "<cs> i will not pursue the matter my lords <e> <s> i should have thought that if we are to give them the measure of independence we are told about they should have this power <e> <s> i could mention many commissions who have power to provide their own accommodation <e> <s> i do not know for example how the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe feels about this occasionally we tried to persuade him to do certain things <e> <s> be that as it may we should not be dogmatic about where the accommodation should be the size of it and the like <e> <s> however i leave it there and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords once again we are grateful to the minister for having fulfilled a promise and i am glad to welcome the help given during the committee stage in respect of this clause <e> <s> i know that the noble baroness lady masham was delighted to see the amendment on the marshalled list <e> <s> had it not appeared she would have been here <e> <s> but the government have more than fulfilled their promise and for that we are duly grateful <e>", "<cs> i have a considerable amount of sympathy with the noble earl on this matter <e> <s> he and i have discussed it <e> <s> we felt that the clause was far too vague and as a matter of such importance could not be left there <e> <s> it may well be that he has been setting his sights too high in respect of this point the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not going to take exception at all to anything that has been said by the minister <e> <s> the noble earl said that i inspired the amendment <e> <s> one has only to read it <e> <s> it reads like poetry and covers all the points very succinctly <e> <s> the only thing that really matters is that the secretary of state will be in the hands of the central council for education and training in social work <e> <s> it is they who will determine the qualifications for entry to the courses which they are going to lay down and may i say to the noble earl not necessarily the university <e> <s> i think that in scotland it is being done at murray house in edinburgh as well as in glasgow <e> <s> of course these are colleges <e>", "<cs> my lords there is room for amendment here and i leave it to the minister to <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to cause any difficulty in respect of the harmony between myself and the noble earl lord selkirk but it may well be that the minister will say that this amendment is not necessary <e>", "<cs> and in what terms my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i was wondering why the noble earl was looking at section because as far as i know we are dealing with section <e> <s> however the suggestion is that i should withdraw my amendment and rely on what has been said in respect of the acceptance in principle of the noble earls withdrawn or unmoved amendment <e> <s> this begs the <e>", "<cs> my lords no i do not <e> <s> i rest my case on the fact that in section of the principal act we have now changed the definition of mental disorder <e> <s> it is only a line and a half and it reads thus <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i must say that it has taken him some time <e> <s> if he reads his argument on that occasion he will see that he said i was completely wrong he did not say that he would look at the matter again <e> <s> i am very glad that someone else had obviously been listening on that occasion and has prompted him to the idea that six hours detention under the clause as then defined meant that the writing of the report may be two or three hours later and then the six hours followed after that although he had already been detained from the point at which the detention actually started <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad indeed because on this one i want scottish support <e> <s> i have more than a feeling that this clause is here in this bill only because it was in the english bill <e> <s> i have been asking around and i have not heard of a case where it was felt necessary for this power to be used <e> <s> i do not think that the government produced any during the committee stage <e> <s> it is all very well saying that it might have arisen <e> <s> we have had a closely-guarded mental health administration since and even before with the old board of control and this power has never been resorted to <e>", "<cs> perhaps <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the government for the attention that they have paid <e>", "<cs> my lords they are not groundless <e> <s> the noble lord comes along and tells me well we do it for water boards <e> <s> we have no such thing in scotland <e> <s> in scotland water comes under the local authority <e> <s> here he may have exactly the same position <e> <s> somebody serving on a water board in england will get a pension <e> <s> what happens in poor old scotland <e> <s> the local councillor will do the job he does not ask for a pension and he does not expect a pension <e> <s> we would be horrified if he was even offered one because it is way outside the type of thing that we are used to in scotland <e> <s> when the noble baroness considers all the public work that she did is she not horrified at the idea that we have to lure people in to do these jobs and say if you are there long enough you will get a pension <e> <s> it is absolute nonsense and we are going completely the wrong way in respect of this matter <e> <s> people are prepared to do public work and are prepared to accept it as part of their duty their public service and they are not looking for pensions <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord does not seem to appreciate that people ordinary people not members of this house sometimes attend these meetings and take time off their work to do so <e> <s> there was a time when the only way in which they could get any remuneration was owing to loss of earnings <e> <s> it was a conservative government that introduced the allowance rather than the loss-of-earnings allowance <e> <s> so the noble lord does not catch <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the government had taken over my amendment <e> <s> i shall be delighted to allow them to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i would think that it is as good a way of drafting it as has been devised but i think it must he improved <e> <s> the words who appear to him are far too wide <e> <s> as regards the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for having explained this very important new clause as far as he felt it was wise to do so at this time of night <e> <s> this new clause appeared on the marshalled list i understand on friday <e> <s> i first saw it yesterday afternoon and therefore i was all the more grateful for the fact that the ministers private secretary had seen fit to write to me explaining the new clause <e> <s> but really this is not good enough <e> <s> the noble lord lord winstanley raised a very important point at committee stage in respect of these clauses about treatment <e> <s> again that was at just about this time of night <e> <s> so for the second time we have had important aspects of this clause being dealt with in the house at a time when obviously the house was anxious to hurry things on and we have not had adequate discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful for the attention that the minister has paid to what was said at the earlier stages of the bill <e> <s> he certainly has not met the objections that i have had to the bill <e> <s> effectively this is purely and simply a redraft but what we have to appreciate in any redraft is that it has to be settled and slotted into the whole bill <e> <s> you cannot understand what is being done here and the implications of this unless you go back to the act and the changes we have already made in that act and now this further change <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down he says that the mental health officer will be the only person who can make an application <e> <s> but with all due respect to him section of the principal act which this amends says <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think there is a doubt that the drafting in respect of the first amendment is neat <e> <s> i do not know whether it is an improvement but it is neater so we will take that one <e> <s> but to remove the word professionally and to insert principally concerned i think is the word that follows without any reference to the profession of nursing or anything else i do not know whether that makes it clearer or not <e> <s> it extends the discretion of the doctor who is to find the supporting person from his profession from the hospital or from whoever gave the treatment or was concerned with the treatment <e> <s> i am not entirely happy with principally but i will not argue at this stage <e> <s> i think the minister said that he had not consulted his thesaurus or dictionary <e> <s> it might have been better if he had but i am prepared to leave it at that <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill is in its way an important bill but it could have been so much better had the government at the start not limited themselves to making changes as they said to bring the act more in line with present attitudes but had followed so far as they could within reason the changes made in the english act <e> <s> the changes give greater safeguards and further strengthen the rights of appeal and we are grateful for that <e> <s> but at the same time we must appreciate that there is a new power to detain that is the power in clause which gives to a nurse the authority to detain for six hours <e> <s> i do not think that the government have produced figures to justify that power nor have they justified it by argument or by history in scottish terms and this will be one of the points that will face them when the bill is dealt with in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister of state for the information that he gave us <e> <s> he did not seem to draw any lessons at all from the events in scotland in relation to the redistribution of seats <e> <s> i had hoped that he might have done so <e> <s> although there has not been the degree of complaint in scotland that there has in england it has not been without its complaints <e> <s> it would be surprising if it was <e>", "<cs> subject to appeal my lords <e>", "<cs> before my noble and learned friend sits down i think i can agree with him in relation to undefended cases and the simpler cases in respect of which counsels fees would not be very great <e> <s> however let us take the more celebrated cases and the ones which he cited which should go before the court of session <e> <s> is he suggesting with regard to those which may raise difficult questions of law and so on that the fees will be equally small <e>", "<cs> i am only a simple layman <e> <s> i have heard my noble friend lord hughes in respect of

royal commission advised <e>", "<cs> it is not a case of not exactly <e> <s> i can understand no and if it is no i would be happy if the noble and learned lord stopped at that <e>", "<cs> since the lord advocate has mentioned kilmarnock in which i once had a constituency interest can he tell me what conceivable advantage there could be in someone bypassing the sheriff court and the local solicitor employing an agent and also a counsel in edinburgh <e> <s> what could be the advantages <e> <s> i am prepared to be persuaded <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord was talking about the simple kind of matter to which my noble and learned friend lord mccluskey had referred cases where counsels fees were not very great indeed he was talking about the cheapest possible form of divorce today <e> <s> it is in that context that i want to know how there could be advantage from the point of view of going to edinburgh in employing both another agent and counsel <e>", "<cs> i should apologise to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate and to your lordships for the fact that i was not present at <e>", "<cs> am i to understand that the substance of what my noble and learned friend lord mccluskey has said is being accepted by the government and instead of being done by statute it is going to be done under existing powers by the scottish courts administration <e> <s> they are going to do it <e>", "<cs> the point i am seeking to make is that parliament would know nothing more about it <e> <s> that regulation does not require to come to parliament at all <e> <s> i think parliament likes to know exactly what power it is giving to courts and to administrations <e> <s> it may well be they already have this power and we are as it were remoulding or formalising it in a particular way at the will of parliament as a result of what is being suggested <e> <s> but thereafter would parliament see this new regulation <e>", "<cs> i think what parliament would like to know is not only the names of the people but the actual nature of the work they are doing <e>", "<cs> i think we are all grateful to the noble earl for having raised this point and opening up an area of very considerable concern <e> <s> i was wondering if the same laxity and the same delays apply to the contribution made by clients to their part of the legal aid costs outwith the legal aid <e> <s> as the lord advocate will know assessment is made of the likely costs and assessment is made of the contribution that the client will have to make towards these costs taking into account the legal aid aspect <e> <s> are they subject to the same delay <e> <s> are they given the same freedom to wait for as many years as my noble friend had to wait for his fee <e> <s> i doubt it very much <e> <s> in fact it is done in a very different style <e>", "<cs> i did not say that <e> <s> it was the royal commission on legal services in scotland <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord the lord advocate replies to that has my noble and learned friend read the second reading speeches that were delivered when we introduced legal aid <e> <s> i was there and i believe i even made a speech <e>

now he tells us that even if they are to get legal aid if they do not get enough they will not work for legal aid fees <e> <s> i do not believe that <e> <s> i still hold to the great traditions of the legal profession in scotland which saw to it that people were defended adequately and that able lawyers did not run away from what were their legal obligations in respect of the poor <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble earl the minister for repeating the statement made by his right honourable friend in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell me who is doing the explaining <e> <s> also will he further elucidate whether the syllabuses will be internal or external ones <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether this has a purely english application <e>",

treasury derives very considerable benefit from both football and racing directly and indirectly will the minister remember that this is endangered as well as the stability of football clubs by the present unfair system of valuation in scotland <e> <s> will he further explain to the house that valuation in scotland is not done as in england by the inland revenue it is fairly cheap in this part

is so much more kindly disposed to every suggestion that comes from a secretary of state that he makes draftsmen available for this kind of thing <e>", "<cs> here we have not only a highways bill but

policy <e> <s> with the changes which we advised the minister of state to make it could have been less grudging and less mean and rightly could have been seen as a breakthrough for scotland although at the same time the british tourist authority regarded it as the thin end of the wedge <e>", "<cs> my lords i would find the minister of state convincing if i had not listened to his arguments on the

possibly come into it as a roads authority <e>", "<cs> my lords this makes a lot of sense far better sense than it was before where you referred to a requisite number and then had to wait until you got a few sections further on to discover what a requisite number was all about <e> <s> there is an indication of hasty draftsmanship <e> <s> bearing in mind that the draftsmen in the scottish office

snow <e> <s> i think a special medal should be struck for the draftsman who thought of that one <e> <s> but at the same time i do not think they have done very well at least they could have done it much more neatly in meeting the wishes of chief constables <e> <s> my first objection would be to the fact that the wording says snow is rendering and so on <e> <s> why not just use the word made <e>

hear that the government have not finished <e> <s> now that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has got the telecommunications bill out of his blood it may be that he too will be able to look

customary clarity <e> <s> if someone else had been introducing this particular bill i expect that the noble earl would have had something to say about one or two of the clauses so when we come to committee stage i will look forward to hearing some of the noble earls own opinions because he always enlivens with his individual aspect some of the matters which come before us <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that the noble lord has been far too long in england <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord should try the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not entirely accept what the noble and

the roads authority if they did not for some reason or other clear the snow <e>", "<cs> my lords no i did not say the vocabulary even that is not within the power of the lord advocate from the legal vocabulary yes <e>", "<cs> my lords this just shows you the difficulties that you get into when you start mucking about with something in which previously there was no confusion <e> <s> we all knew what street traders street walkers street lighting and all the rest of it was without all this confusion of roads <e> <s> look at that section and at the number of acts of parliament in which the word

of work unpaid for laymen occasionally we help the lawyers <e> <s> we have to be convinced that what is being said is reasonable <e> <s> i did not like the easy definition of the noble and learned lord of reasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate did not go further in accepting my amendment and suggest that subsection as well should not be an interpretation <e> <s> the noble and learned lord conceded one point because if i remember rightly clause was part of the interpretation and it does make nonsense when you confuse things by putting in this question of powers and non-powers in respect of footpaths owned or managed <e> <s> with all due respect it is not interpretation <e> <s> so between now and another place if it is going to travel the whole road i hope the noble and learned lord will look at this think again and give us something much more sensible from the point of view of scottish legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords we have it clearly attractive discounts come and buy <e> <s> no choice because you can only buy the house you are in if you are a secure tenant <e> <s> there is not very much choice about that <e> <s>

am amending <e> <s> it was not in the original act of <e> <s> noble lords who have come more recently to this place will remember the flap that there was in another place when on an english tenants rights bill i think it was just about the last day of the session we passed an amendment which completely altered the attitude of the english authorities to the sale of houses for old people <e> <s> there was a tremendous furore that went on in another place <e> <s> discussions were held between not so much the usual channels as the respective housing and shadow housing ministers and they eventually came up with a solution and promised that something would be done in scotland as well <e> <s> in the same year as they passed the original act they passed the amendment act <e> <s> so we had an extension from the exemption for sheltered housing to this one <e>", "<cs> my lords no i want this amendment put to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the minister of states first objection to my amendment was that it seemed to cover many more people than i had originally thought <e> <s> i thank him very much for that because i believe that all the financial responsibility for this should rest with the secretary of state <e> <s> it is not the local authorities which asked for this to be done be it in respect of their own tenants or tenants of other houses

government who say to the local authority you shall sell and it is the government who say to the local authority you shall sell at such a discount <e>", "<cs> my lords i get more than a feeling that

would leave the islands authorities sole judge in their own cause <e> <s> he keeps on saying this <e> <s> the first amendment i produced last week was frankly an amendment supplied to me by the western islands authority <e> <s> it gave the right of appeal to the lands tribunal <e>", "<cs> my lords i have known times when even under-secretaries did not know about it <e> <s> that can be confirmed by the noble lord lord drumalbyn who was an under-secretary at the scottish office <e> <s> i remember him and the late lord brooke on a certain town and country planning act that was applied to scotland because it was purely academic <e> <s> he will remember the occasion in committee room no <e> <s> on that bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will of course see this as important but

authority can close any school it likes and there is no reference or appeal to the secretary of state <e> <s> there is only an appeal to the secretary of state when he proposes to do that for catholic schools <e> <s> if they can trust the local authority with that in fact the decision is final why not trust them with this simple matter of a house with an appeal to another body be it the lands tribunal or the sheriff <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case it should have been solved in respect of non-denominational schools but that has been taken away <e>", "<cs> my lords one is more important than the other <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has been very generous in trying to take all these matters together <e> <s> i would have been happier if we had talked first of all simply about the scheme <e> <s> we keep hearing about the scheme that we will be discussing with the local authorities <e> <s> one group of people who do not know anything about the scheme are the legislators <e> <s>

used the power to refuse to allow the local authority to spend as <e> <s> regards capital equipment <e> <s> if we take <e>", "<cs> discontent <e>", "<cs> my lords while i agree with the noble lord that this was a very important bill on rate capping may i ask whether he is aware that three days later an equally important bill for scotland came before your lordships <e> <s> it did not enhance the reputation of this house which always seeks to deny devolution to scotland that there were never more than six people on the government benches on that day <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very disappointing that we should get the kind of answer we have had from the minister of state <e> <s> i should like to tell him that this is not a political matter <e> <s> we are not dealing with the principle of whether or not the houses should be sold we are accepting that <e> <s> all that is beside the point <e> <s> as the noble lord lord grimond said the government themselves seized on the lightness of the claim that was being made by the islands councils <e> <s> that is why the clause was put in the bill <e> <s> our complaint is about how they are doing it <e> <s> it is rather silly to use this factor that because they are all-purpose authorities they would not deal fairly with the matter <e> <s> up to now that has not been the case <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for the way in which the minister belatedly has sensed the feeling of the committee in relation to this <e> <s> we have not put the proposal forward in any sort of party spirit at all <e> <s> in scotland the whole thing is creaking it just cries out for it <e> <s> and when the noble lord says this is what we are doing in this bill does he not realise that if the bill takes rush beds out of rating and reduces rates on caravan parks it just means that the burden on a narrow base is greater for the others <e> <s> it is this we are complaining about and there must be some other way <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the minister so early but when he started speaking on the last one he was not sympathetic at all <e>", "<cs> the minister of state suggests that this would serve no useful purpose and would lead only to duplication <e> <s> i do not know whether he has recently been in touch with members of local authorities <e> <s> i can well remember meeting them and the one big meeting used to be the rate support grant meeting when we had a great round table and everyone said his piece <e> <s> i have never had any difficulty at all with local authorities <e> <s> the fact of the matter now is that it is not so much a meeting as a monologue <e> <s> the government tell the local authorities they no longer discuss with the local authorities <e> <s> this is absolutely clear from the nature of this kind of legislation <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the noble lord but i do not know whether he has read his own clause <e> <s> to suggest that the dropping of these words will deprive the secretary of state of flexibility is absolute nonsense <e> <s> in any case if the noble lord refers to the acts of parliament setting this up i think in but i do not want to go too much into this he will find that

on a particular occasion <e> <s> but it is a purely hypothetical point that he raises <e> <s> the words may well have been there and the noble lord just did not realise what he was doing when he agreed to them and he may now have learnt what he should have done on that occasion <e> <s> but i do not know of any particular occasion when this matter was raised with me <e> <s> i am raising it now

negativing my opinion about this have no statutory authority at all <e> <s> when they were first mentioned in parliament it was said oh there is nothing rigid about this this is just a guideline <e>

from each authority according to the heinousness of their crime in the opinion of the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the minister of state realises how all this is done <e> <s> there are three elements in respect of rate support grant <e> <s> the government do not do anything except say what proportion they will meet <e> <s> it has been reduced from per cent <e> <s> to just over per cent <e> <s> in the last five years <e> <s> then the committees get together with the government to work out what will be the apportionment in respect of needs resources and the domestic element <e> <s> now we see that the government have introduced a new element called guidelines <e> <s> this year a change in the distribution formula saw the district councils have their total guidelines upped by per cent <e> <s> the islands by per cent <e> <s> and the regions by only per cent <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord knew very much about it he would know that i resigned from that government in april <e> <s> he would also appreciate that guidelines carried no mandatory authority <e> <s> they were not followed up by things such as clawback and penalising of local authorities for not paying enough attention strict attention to conforming that is the word in the bill to guidelines <e> <s> the whole thing has changed and it is because it has changed and because apportionment of penalty now relates to guidelines that parliament should know a little more about the guidelines <e>", "<cs> the guidelines are discussed but who makes the decision <e> <s> it is the government who hand it down to the local authorities <e> <s> the local authorities have no argument they just have to accept them <e> <s> if the guidelines came before parliament the government would have to justify them publicly in the house of commons which i think is right <e> <s> not only that the individual members from outside who have got to cope with the problems of cuts in expenditure and the effect they have upon their constituents would be able to get up and argue the case in respect of their particular local authorities <e>", "<cs> as i understand it if we pass an amendment here it goes to another place <e> <s> therefore we will not be offending the other place the other place will have an opportunity to say what it thinks about our amendment and if we have offended them then they can either turn the amendment down or they can amend the amendment <e> <s> that is possible in respect of amendments <e> <s> so do not come crying to us about offending another place <e> <s> we remember a lot of the history of the relations between the one house and the other <e>", "<cs> but surely it is far far better to vote on each individual one rather than the whole lot together <e> <s> a government which has the kind of majority that this present government have in another place find it very easy to deal with one order and to get it out of the way rather than as the noble lord suggests to withdraw the order <e> <s> i can remember that being done on only about four or five occasions <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord looks at the report for last year he will discover that reports were issued in respect of glasgow stirling lothian and i think central <e> <s> there were four or five individual orders <e> <s> the decision of parliament was to take them all together <e> <s> they sought to divide up the time but it did not work out that way because there was not enough time for the proper discussion of them all or for the proper voting on them all and the question of voting was quite easy on that occasion because they were separate orders <e> <s> that practice is followed often and it can work <e>", "<cs> this is a completely new power that the government are taking <e> <s> i am still waiting for the justification of that <e> <s> it may be that we shall get it on clause stand part but the noble lord has not told us just why they need it <e> <s> when he tells me that the effect of my amendment would be to make it difficult and he suggested even unworkable i am not exactly weeping tears over that because i do not want the clause at all <e>", "<cs> when i first read the amendment i wondered what it meant <e> <s> i had the feeling which has not left me that it was misplaced and that it would be better placed in part ii of the bill <e> <s> the government spokesman said something which would have been ruled out of order in another place <e> <s> he told us about his sympathy for commercial businesses <e> <s> i do not have the same amount of sympathy for commercial businesses <e> <s> the government should know if nobody else knows that the basis of commercial business valuation is rental <e> <s> the noble lord lord mackie of benshie spoke about his lack of sympathy for big department stores and objected to people claiming that big department stores create many more new jobs <e> <s> he quite rightly said that big department stores mean the departure of small businesses and small shops <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to speak again because it means that the minister will have time to read over his brief again and find another bit that he missed and plague us withit <e> <s> may i add to his long catalogue of how the government are aiding business <e> <s> it may be of interest to the noble lord lord mackie on a future amendment <e> <s> there is something called an enterprise zone there is postponement there is a per cent <e> <s> rebate for a period on rates in an enterprise zone <e> <s> so there are plenty of precedents for doing something for small businesses either along the way mentioned by the noble lord lord mackie or in some other way which is more specifically related to the actual size of the business <e>", "<cs> i heard most of what the noble lord said <e> <s> so far as i can gather he does not like the amendment <e> <s> it would give a certain measure of justification to the government for doing this if in that year they decided that by way of rate support grant they would meet the same percentage as they had the previous year <e> <s> there would require to have been some serious runaway or proposed runaway of expenditure in respect of the rates to justify the kind of increases that would mean government intervention <e> <s> there might then be some justification for it <e> <s> but the government themselves may make the position of local authorities intolerable by reducing their share of the reckonable expenditure <e> <s> that is only the part of the expenditure not met outside of housing and beyond that met by specific grants which is covered by the block grant and after deduction of income be it from charges property or that kind of thing <e> <s> that is then the aggregate of reckonable expenditure <e> <s> at the moment in scotland the government meet per cent <e> <s> it is under that for england <e>", "<cs> no i just still do not understand it <e> <s> you see you get a maximum or a minimum <e> <s> there is certain latitude each way <e> <s> but if an authority does not fix its rates and remember a rate is a fixed rate it is not within a range it <e>", "<cs> yes but they have not <e> <s> the point is that the power that the secretary of state takes is to determine a maximum or a minimum <e> <s> then it is up to the local authority to comply by fixing a rate which is within the maximum or as the case may be the minimum <e> <s> however when they have not done anything but it is deemed that they have and it is said that the matter must be ended in relation to the original order nobody has fixed anything <e> <s> nobody has fixed anything within the maximum or within the minimum <e> <s> so how can you possibly deem it as having been done <e> <s> if the government had said this is a figure and they refused to fix that as the figure then you can deem that figure which has been laid down by the secretary of state as the figure <e> <s> but it is not a figure it is a maximum or a minimum <e>", "<cs> it does not say that <e>", "<cs> i gather that the intention is that if a local authority does not comply then automatically it is deemed that the increase is the maximum laid down

another look at this and see that it is much more clear <e> <s> the only latitude a local authority has is to be within the maximum or within the minimum <e> <s> if they do not determine the rate they have no option <e> <s> it will be either the maximum or the minimum <e> <s> i presume that that is the case but it is not clearly stated <e>", "<cs> this is the important clause <e> <s> it is the clause that deals with rate capping <e> <s> i could not possibly allow this clause to stand part of the bill without saying a word or two <e> <s> we have come to a pretty sorry pass when we have so to interfere with local democracy as to deny the right of local authorities even as a last resort to fix their own rates <e> <s> the government keep coming to this business of last resort <e> <s> if the powers are there in a bill the secretary of state will use them <e> <s> it was the powers in the act that started us all on this <e> <s> they stemmed i think from an act of carried through in consolidation and the rest of it <e> <s> eventually they were used and used by the present government <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will allow me if the noble lord looks at the bill which we are seeking to amend in clause on page he will see the reference to section b which is an insertion into section a of the local government scotland <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will not consider withdrawing the amendment in view of the figures that have been produced by the noble lord <e> <s> i can quote figures as well <e> <s> i can give him a figure <e>", "<cs> i still think that it could be unduly troublesome <e> <s> it may well not be so but if i were one of the ratepayers or if there were a group with myself we could cause endless trouble to those setting the rates not that i should ever dream of doing it <e> <s> but there are troublesome people in scotland quite apart from ross who are interested in the details of politics <e> <s> i see the noble lord lord stodart with a revived interest in these things <e> <s> i am sure that he will make life difficult for local authorities who presume to do things and deny him the right to go out at a time inconvenient to them but convenient to him <e>", "<cs> it is more than probing <e> <s> i have been asking for justice <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> the noble lord read his brief very nicely <e> <s> it was not like the minister about whose sermons complaints were made among the congregation <e> <s> it was said about a sermon first that it was read secondly that it was not very well read and thirdly that it was not worth reading <e> <s> that has applied to one or two of the briefs which the noble lord has been inflicting on us <e> <s> i wish that the civil servants would remember that we have to listen to what is said <e> <s> but i was doing more than probing i was seeking justice <e> <s> when the secretary of state actually fixes the rates and is making these determinations as he does under some of these other sections other people are entitled to be satisfied that they have all the information and have something to do with it <e> <s> they want to know that they are part and parcel of this business of consultation in respect of rates <e> <s> but i shall not inflict this very much longer on the noble lord <e> <s> the hour approaches and we had better make a little more progress <e> <s> but meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> no i shall not because the subsection does not make sense <e> <s> the certificate is not conclusive if it can be appealed against and that is what the next words say <e>", "<cs> yes that is right which means that they are not conclusive <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e> <s> they are not conclusive <e>", "<cs> i know it is fair and democratic but we are not talking about that <e> <s> we are talking about the words in the legislation and these two lines are unnecessary <e>", "<cs> i think that i shall withdraw this amendment <e> <s> the whole scottish office and i hope the secretary of state the lord advocate and the solicitor-general will all be brought in to discuss this point as it is so terribly important <e> <s> it is so terribly important that it amazes me that a minister of state does not have the guts to get up and say of course you are right and withdraw the objection <e> <s> but i shall not let this amendment go to the determination of the committee <e> <s> i shall withdraw it to give the government time to have another look at it <e>", "<cs> in view of that unsatisfactory answer i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think i expressed my intention of suggesting that we leave out clause <e> <s> it is not that i object to the clause rather that i should like the government to give us some information about it <e> <s> for generations we have had this power in scotland to spend up to two pence in the rates on various matters that a local authority considers conducive to the good of the town and in respect of which it has not been the custom or the requirement to keep separate accounts <e> <s> as far a i know there has been little or no complaint about it <e> <s> if there is any complaint about anything that local authorities do in scotland the time to voice that complaint and do something about it was last thursday <e> <s> judging by the results of the local elections in scotland last thursday i do not see any justification for the government to take a more grandmotherly approach to scottish local authorities <e> <s> in edinburgh tories lost seat after seat after seat and eventually lost control of the council <e> <s> then in glasgow that place where they had high hopes there is less than a handful of tories left i think it is four or five out of a council of <e>", "<cs> to say that it was welcomed in another place is an abuse of words <e> <s> it was not objected to apart from i think one member who <e>", "<cs> i do not regard this as a privilege by the way i regard it as a right and i think that the minister of state would probably wish to withdraw what he said about this being a privilege <e> <s> it is a right <e> <s> i do not object to it but i would ask how have we managed to live without it for all these years <e> <s> i have seen no great bands of people protesting to local authorities in respect of this <e> <s> when the minister says dont worry there are not going to be many people using it but it is there i am still not satisfied with the phrase any persons interested <e>", "<cs> is this an affirmative resolution or a negative resolution <e>", "<cs> we are not yet finished with this clause and the noble lord may be able to get the information <e> <s> so far as i recollect it is the negative procedure <e> <s> but in view of the discussions that we have had i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister has ever looked at some of the judgments given by her majestys judges in scotland in respect of the interpretation of statutes <e> <s> they are governed by the words that are there <e> <s> there is nothing about unreasonable or reasonable or limitation of any kind <e>", "<cs> this has proved to be an important clause which is worthy of a few words <e> <s> remembering what happened last thursday it is right that we should give expression to those few words <e> <s> we have been promised that the words any persons interested will be looked at again <e> <s> the minister has also said he will look again at the words <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give me the information i sought on whether he expected any increase of scrutiny of these accounts arising from the new right given in respect of the tenants right of repairs the right to do repairs themselves and send the bills to the local authority <e> <s> would those bills be subject to the same scrutiny <e>", "<cs> is the minister now telling me that the phrase about which we spoke earlier any interested party is one that will be decided upon by any local council <e> <s> that is what he is saying <e> <s> is even this decision about any interested party one that can be ruled out by the decision of a local council with there being an appeal to the courts in respect of it <e> <s> this is very different from what he said earlier <e>", "<cs> i asked the minister specifically about the new rights under the tenants rights and the right of a ratepayer or any other interested party or any party to ask to see vouchers accounts and all the rest <e> <s> i hope that the minister will read the words he used because it is those words to which i took objection <e> <s> he seemed to imply that the local authority could decide whether they would show these documents to a particular person and as to whether that person had a right to see them <e>", "<cs> i should like to be given a little more information about the limits of the consideration that is given by the advisory council because surely they consider it within the limits of the present system <e> <s> i am asking them to look beyond the present system to a fairer and better one and to give us their advice on that <e> <s> i can understand that they also should be in a better position than most because since they have dealt with all the anomalies that have arisen one after the other and it gets to the point that if you have dealt with a whole accumulation of anomalies you can see whether or not you are virtually toppling over a system that was rocking at the very start and which was subject to considerable difficulties <e>", "<cs> in recent days we have been talking so much of peoples rights in regard to local government bills and extending rights to this and that person <e> <s> but when you postpone revaluation you take away a persons right to appeal <e> <s> i can speak about my own case <e> <s> we have just about finished the valuation roll and the appeals for the last revaluation as a result of what happened in troon and lots of people feel that they have a right to consider what happened there in respect of a right to their own appeal <e> <s> i feel the same in relation to a part of ayr that was dealt with in a very hard way <e> <s> the secretary of state will know all about it because a considerable number of people have written to him <e> <s> if you postpone the revaluation you postpone the chance to get the position rectified <e>", "<cs> as to pitches for static caravans i just want an explantion in respect of this because this is one of the cases where a judgment in respect of a decision of assessors has been upheld by the scottish courts the valuation courts but the government have seen fit by reason of what has happened in england to make a change here <e>", "<cs> i am prepared to accede to the request by the government in respect of that but i wanted a little more information as to what the secretary of state proposes <e> <s> it may well come under clause stand part <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> is the noble and learned lord the lord advocate now able to tell us what the effect of this clause will be <e> <s> it is headed percentage derating of static caravans <e> <s> this means that the secretary of state is taking the power to derate static caravans <e> <s> upon what will the noble and learned lord base his decision about the percentage <e>", "<cs> i need a little more information than that <e> <s> i should like to know exactly what the percentage is <e> <s> i should also like to know exactly what in aggregate this will mean for scotland <e> <s> what is the assessed loss of revenue to a local authority <e> <s> do the government intend to make up in any way this loss of potential revenue to local authorities <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate or somebody else will find out exactly how much it is in aggregate before we reach the next stage of the bill <e> <s> this is bound very considerably to affect tourist areas <e> <s> it will affect very considerably kyle and carrick and other places on the ayrshire coast where there is a heavy concentration of static caravans <e> <s> it might affect my own rates <e> <s> i have to pay higher rates because of the generosity of the secretary of state towards these areas <e> <s> the highlands of scotland and elsewhere might also be affected <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate will appreciate that many parts of scotland will be unaffected while many other areas will be very seriously affected <e> <s> the ratepayers in those areas will have to make up this loss of rateable value of <e> <s> it is a quite serious point <e> <s> when these points are added together they result in a very considerable increase in the burden on particular groups of ratepayers <e> <s> we tend to forget the effect that the accumulation of these correcting provisions will have because of the unfairness of the valuation system <e>", "<cs> that is very very disappointing <e> <s> but could i say thanks for the response that i have had from the committee from the noble lord lord polwarth <e> <s> from the noble lord lord elphinstone and from the noble baroness herself and usually when she speaks the front bench quakes <e> <s> i think we will need to consider this again and probably at a more reasonable time <e> <s> i think i even had the support of the noble viscount <e> <s> lord massereene <e>", "<cs> that is twice in two debates <e> <s> he will need to watch himself he is getting a terrible reputation about himself <e> <s> but with all due respect to the lord advocate he was not all that convincing <e> <s> he mentioned that the rule had been breached by the reference to storage heaters and his suggestion that you can just lift them away <e> <s> of course they are all linked up to the electricity system <e> <s> in most cases it has meant that the heaters have had to be specially wired in order to do that <e> <s> it means in many cases also that there has to be a special meter in respect of that system <e> <s> so from that point of view there are very considerable changes to the property <e> <s> there are forms of electric heating quite apart from storage heaters that have breached this general rule because there is a notional feeling that you could take them away <e> <s> if you take them away you leave a great deal of material which has had to be put there in order to get the value out of these heaters <e> <s> now these are changes as well <e>", "<cs> getting on for it <e> <s> you must be coming near edinburgh then <e> <s> i think the noble and learned lord the lord advocate will know of the rigours in certain parts of scotland <e> <s> we want to encourage and you do not encourage by penalising by imposing an extra tax <e> <s> i hope that the government will look at this matter again <e> <s> in view of the enthusiasm for this particular amendment i have to withdraw it but i will put it on the marshalled list again <e> <s> i will write it much more carefully next time so that even the noble earl lord caithness himself will probably go to the back-benches and get up and support me <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for the attention he has paid to this aspect in the short time we have had available to us <e> <s> would prefer to study what he has said and its implications <e> <s> i felt that there was a slight jump in the latter part of his argument in relation to the notional rent being equated with the burden of rates which he said i hoped to meet by the addition of the words in my amendment taking into account the actual rates paid <e> <s> he said that that point was met but i am not too happy with what he said <e> <s> i am prepared to consider his comments and in view of the lateness of the hour and the fact that we shall have another chance to approach this subject i hope at a more convenient time i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the government are right to refute this amendment <e> <s> in covering the whole bill i <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that investment in these industries did not start four years ago <e> <s> is he further aware that there were more people employed in these industries in scotland five years ago than there are today <e> <s> hewlett packard has been there for a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords it is ironic is it not that it falls to the present minister to receive congratulations from a former minister that former minister being a member of the government which established bathgate as a truck plant over years ago <e> <s> from scotlands point of view it is just another addition to the dismal catalogue of disasters that we have had in the past five years <e> <s> will the noble lord tell us how many people are being made redundant here <e> <s> is it of the order of and then the knock-on unemployment following from that <e> <s> is it the case that unemployment in the bathgate area will rise to probably over per cent <e> <s> the noble lord stated just a minute ago that the capacity for survival depended on the ability to adjust to change <e> <s> will the noble lord tell me what these men have got to change to because there is no new industry of that nature coming into scotland <e>", "<cs> so my lords what we have on the government front bench is pretty well a second xi <e> <s> they may surprise us <e> <s> i trust they are going to surprise us by accepting this first amendment <e> <s> the house will remember that i was asked to withdraw this new clause <e> <s> i think it was not so much on the merits of the clause but that the government thought they were going to be defeated <e> <s> except the minister every single person who spoke supported the clause the noble earl lord perth from the independent benches the noble lord lord stodart of leaston the noble lord lord drumalbyn and i think there were at least two other speakers on that side of the house <e> <s> from this side the noble lord lord mackie of benshie the noble lord lord grimond the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside and my noble friend lord carmichael supported the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down will she give me her reaction to the governments statement in their white paper reply to the green paper and the discussions that followed that the rating system is basically right <e> <s> does she accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords i find the ministers reply very disappointing indeed <e> <s> when we were asked by the government to withdraw this clause there was no suggestion then that our clause was a trick <e> <s> but the noble baroness lady carnegy has suggested that it was a trick <e> <s> i am not given to tricks like that <e> <s> i have been in politics a long long time and i take it very ill when a noble baroness comes along and tells me that i

baroness to expand on something we got another speech from her <e> <s> the government tell us oh <e> <s> we have looked at this <e> <s> we have looked at layfield <e> <s> what was the date of layfield <e> <s> <e> <s> what was the date of the conservative manifesto in which they said they were going to carry out reform <e> <s> <e> <s> that was when domestic rates were going out <e> <s> why did we in scotland postpone our revaluations which should have taken place in <e> <s> we did so because the secretary of state had in mind to change the rating system <e> <s> he had his mind made up <e> <s> i can read out what he said <e> <s> on th december when talking about revaluation mr <e> <s> younger said <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment has been tabled because the bill refers to any guidance issued by him that is the secretary of state <e> <s> it says any guidance no matter how stupid <e> <s> that is what it means <e> <s> guidance and guidelines have floated around local government for about years <e> <s> perhaps i may draw the minister of states attention to what his witness from the scottish office said to the parliamentary joint committee on statutory instruments on th july <e>

amendment referring to consult each local authority <e> <s> if a local authority is going to be dealt with in this way it is entitled to be heard and not to be heard more or less in proxy by the convention <e> <s> that is the point i am raising here <e> <s> if local authorities are going to be dealt with in this particular way before the secretary of state tells them that as they have not conformed with guidelines or guidance which has been issued to them i do not know when then the rates shall be determined in a particular way by him he should consult all the local authorities affected <e>", "<cs> it is the accepted form my lords <e> <s> when did it become the accepted form for the government to take over the rights of local authorities and to fix the rate of every district every region and every island authority <e> <s> that never has been accepted <e> <s> that is a constitutional monstrosity that has been thought up by this government <e> <s> how will they determine the rates without getting information from every local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords it shows just how disappointing the secretary of state has been to cosla when they have demanded meetings of that nature <e> <s> normally i only had to meet them once and they agreed with what i suggested to them <e> <s> but there is such confrontation now in local government <e> <s> he will have to meet them two or three times over this bill when it becomes an act of parliament about how they will do it because the secretary of state will not just determine the rates but will virtually run the local officials as well <e> <s> he cannot determine any rate without getting information from the local authorities so the local authorities will have to bow to the will of the secretary of state at the same time as he is telling them to employ fewer people and to cut down the work <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not withdraw this amendment <e> <s> i listened with interest to the speech of the noble lord lord gray of contin <e> <s> it had nothing to do with the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord talked about clause general abatement general clawback and how that clawback will be met <e> <s> that was clause <e>

happy about some of the amending preferences that we have put down but of course the various linkings of paragraphs here are endless <e> <s> when they come to it there will be plenty of opportunity in the scottish grand committee to try out all these types of amendments <e> <s> quite frankly i base my arguments purely and simply on the fact that the scottish law commission which is a rather more important body than the scottish valuation advisory committee was the body which recommended the complete abolition of this preference <e> <s> i do not like the argument of why should so and so do this <e> <s> it reminds me of the old scottish music hall joke why should the blind man pay for the lobby gas or why should he pay for street lighting when he gets no benefit out of it <e> <s> that is the kind of false argument which we are getting from the noble lord the lord advocate on this occasion <e> <s> but i shall leave it to others to argue at very considerable length on another occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i can always understand that phrase not acceptable <e> <s> it is when the lord advocate forgets where he is and starts to use words such as indisputable that my hackles begin to rise <e> <s> he says that he can see no argument i do not know that one sees arguments but rather one hears them for further restrictions on the crown <e> <s> it depends on ones point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been a general acceptance of the benefits of this bill <e> <s> it is a welcome updating of the law <e> <s> of course it was a monumental effort by the law commission and it is good to see here the speedy enactment of their recommendations <e> <s> i am sorry and i express my regret that the decisions and recommendations of the law <e>", "<cs> my lords we extended a welcome to this bill on second reading and we confirm that welcome now <e> <s> we do so for three reasons <e> <s> the bill deals with and clarifies the law and makes it more certain although from my own experience that does not always happen when we seek to clarify the law <e> <s> secondly it comprehensively deals with the subject it covers aliment financial provision on divorce and matrimonial property <e> <s> sadly those are matters of increasing importance to a growing number of people <e> <s> it is probably a sad reflection on the mores of the present age but we have to face the facts <e> <s> thirdly it implements promptly and faithfully two reports which have received widespread support from those mainly concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the whole argument for the sale of council houses was that it would give local authorities control of funds which they could spend on housing as they liked <e> <s> the government are now changing that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister make it clear that he is talking about england and wales <e> <s> in scotland water is a local government service <e> <s> that may be why it is so much easier for the secretary of state to reduce rate support grant and thereby pass on the burden of the cost of water to the local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understood the statement it consisted purely of what the banks have done in reacting to a situation <e> <s> we have not heard a word of what the government have done or of what they are going to do in this situation or in respect of the consequences to industry <e> <s> there is a complacency being shown that is really frightening <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us what are the implications of this change of policy for the important research and other work done at dounreay in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords we now return to an important matter relating to scotland after the exodus has taken place <e> <s> we are grateful to the minister of state lord gray of contin for his explanation of the bill <e> <s> one of the first things i should do is to give him a little good news <e> <s> unfortunately one member of your lordships house who would have liked to take part in this debate lord perth cannot be here <e> <s> he left it to me to read a letter that he has written giving some of his ideas about the bill <e> <s> this is probably about the best time to do it so that should cheer up for a moment the minister of state <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i would never do a thing like that <e> <s> it is all very well having an enabling bill but what will it enable us to do <e> <s> we are not in the dark we are in limbo until this board reports <e> <s> while i am on my feet perhaps i could raise one other matter <e> <s> the noble lord said something about the museum of scotland being free-standing <e> <s> i hope that we shall not be told that it will not be free-standing was that the implication of the noble lords remark <e>", "<cs> but when <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble earl for the trouble he has taken with these orders <e> <s> i will not ask him if he understood them all <e> <s> in fact to my knowledge there was only one member of parliament who was able to understand these public undertakings rateable value formulae <e> <s> he retired and is now dead so that leaves us in the schleswig-holstein situation that no one understands them at all <e>", "<cs> where was he <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in a letter i have here the chairman of the ugc states that the actual reason for the closure is the continuing cuts in the real income of universities since <e> <s> in respect of heriot-watt is the noble earl aware that there is student demand and that there is a professional need in scotland for this pharmacy department <e> <s> is he further aware that that demand cannot properly be met by extending the number of places available in nottingham university or in chelsea <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl was inquiring about the letter which i mentioned <e> <s> it was from the chairman sir peter swinnerton-dyer frs to the principal of heriot-watt university <e> <s> i will gladly provide the noble earl with a copy <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister send a copy of this exchange to the secretary of state for scotland from whom we expect action <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a fascinating debate <e> <s> i think the noble viscount must be congratulated for raising the subject once again <e> <s> i say that because yesterday i took the trouble to read the last debates that we had on this subject <e> <s> that was when the noble lord lord strathcona courageously sought to improve matters on the step by step approach with a private bill on the same subject <e> <s> i read the noble viscounts speech and lo <e> <s> and behold it was all about district boards the need for reorganisation and the need for powers <e> <s> therefore he certainly has not let me down <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister say how much we paid into this expensive organisation <e>", "<cs> it would be agreeable to me but it will mean another speech <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether it is clear to noble lords who have not studied this matter very carefully or for very long but it is certainly not clear to me as to what the government are after <e> <s> i am not being rude but the minister of state keeps talking about the concept of the museum of scotland and the concept has to have a national dimension <e> <s> what we want is not a concept we want a museum and that is the one thing we are just not going to get <e>", "<cs> concept <e>", "<cs> that is not a concept it is just a name <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a few words here <e> <s> the minister of state has further confused us because he has given us two possibilities of what requires legislation <e> <s> his answer to the direct question which was asked just now according to the advice he gave us should have been no <e> <s> he said yes it could be <e> <s> now that is quite wrong <e> <s> what we do require is time to think about this <e> <s> between now and the next stage i hope that the minister of state will go into this question of legislation again because we do not want to pass a bill only to discover that we need to have another one and wait for about five or six years and then have the secretary of state say i cant devote resources to that because we have not even decided on names <e> <s> so let us leave that point <e>", "<cs> the point made by the noble lord lord howie of troon is well made <e> <s> if we are to have a long list it is very difficult to turn things down <e> <s> i am going to press architectural on the noble lord <e> <s> after all all living in the sense of abiding and residing is dependent very much on the development of architecture and we should view it as such <e> <s> moreover we have something to be proud of in the way of architecture <e> <s> if you go to the ussr and look at the summer palace you will find that it was designed by a scotsman called cameron who is probably better known outside scotland than within it <e> <s> we have the adams brothers i nearly said the adams family but that might have been mistaken for something else <e> <s> there are also robert lorimer playfair and rennie mackintosh <e> <s> we have been very slow to recognise the value of our architects <e> <s> there are some outstanding examples of architecture <e>", "<cs> i think that we really want them to be taken in chronological order <e> <s> what the noble earl lord perth is saying is that when he first put his amendment down and when i first saw it i understood it to read page line and not line <e> <s> therefore we would be taking it in chronological order if we took it now before i deal with my amendment amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however it does not matter very much <e>", "<cs> it is to the end of line <e>", "<cs> it is on the marshalled list as to end of line and i am not objecting to it <e> <s> i beg to move the amendment on the marshalled list <e> <s> the noble earl can read it for himself <e>", "<cs> i think it is exactly the same <e> <s> when we come to amendment no <e> <s> i shall move it or not move it <e> <s> the arguments are exactly the same <e>", "<cs> yes but the board can only exercise any powers which are the secretary of states powers if the secretary of state directs it so to do <e> <s> therefore if we must have this provision it indicates a failure to trust the secretary of state <e> <s> he alone can give the board that power <e> <s> the subsection begins <e>", "<cs> if the minister is now arguing that the board can do this although it is legislative he had better take this out of the bill because there is a complete bar on the board <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> i rise to ask one simple point <e> <s> the clause provides <e>", "<cs> the minister says that he is not going to take out architectural <e> <s> does that mean he is going to put it in <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister is making rather heavy weather of this <e> <s> we are not asking for the secretary of states views or for his approval but that he should be notified and informed of what the board are doing <e> <s> it may be said that this is far too light a burden to place on the secretary of state in respect of the disposal in this way by the sale exchange or gift of an object by the board <e> <s> many people may think that this amendment does not go far enough <e> <s> subsection referring to the board uses the words <e>", "<cs> yes it is a new power and so we have to be careful about it <e> <s> the bill does not say that it is with the approval of the secretary of state with or without conditions <e> <s> if that was included there might be less suspicion on our part that we are doing something unwise <e>", "<cs> it is not <e>", "<cs> have they at any time been restricted <e> <s> have the public been refused access <e> <s> i recall the commonwealth games <e> <s> if my memory is correct a garden party was held there <e> <s> i was not there <e> <s> in fact i was not even secretary of state believe it or not <e> <s> i missed it by a month <e> <s> having arranged the commonwealth games i was not even asked to go to them <e> <s> however these are the things that happen in political life <e>", "<cs> no i am not surprised <e> <s> you see i was counting the quota what we had already received <e> <s> i had already made up my mind how many more we were to get <e> <s> even though on this occasion i had not the help of the noble baroness lady elliot all the same i am grateful to her because she was looking daggers at the minister in case he did not accept this one <e>", "<cs> i moved the amendment <e> <s> in fact we could not talk about it unless i had moved it <e>", "<cs> the point has been made that the faculty of advocates merits what it got because years ago it sold its library <e> <s> it was bought by sir alexander grant <e> <s> that is why he was specifically mentioned in this statute of <e> <s> of course he did more than that he also gave a sum of money in respect of new building that was necessary <e> <s> i am very glad that the noble and learned lord lord fraser of tullybelton made the remark that he did because he reminded me that it

antiquaries of scotland who are the people who created the national museum of antiquities of scotland <e> <s> they were not even mentioned when it came to taking over the whole of that museum and including it in the national museums of scotland which is referred to in clause <e>", "<cs> he only started in <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord will not accept that argument and withdraw the amendment <e> <s> this matter was raised when the act was going through parliament <e> <s> the chairman of the national trust at that time was the marquess of bute and he has risen very high in the opinion of the secretary of state because he has made him chairman of the advisory committee <e> <s> i quoted on second reading part of the correspondence that passed between the secretary of state and the chairman of the national trust for scotland at that time <e>", "<cs> with all due respect i have got a good memory too <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble earl was concerned with the argument as to whether or not we should have in scotland a commission instead of the advisory committee that we have got for historic monuments and historic houses <e> <s> the national trust in scotland decided that we did not want it but that was in <e> <s> we did not get the bill until after that and when the bill appeared and we discovered that england was given these additional powers of support in respect of what is as much the task of scotland as it is of england then the position changed <e> <s> we did not want the new structure in scotland but we wanted the same kind of support for the heritage in scotland that now was being given or made possible for england <e>", "<cs> can the minister go further and tell us whether the secretary of state is doing this <e> <s> i understood that he was <e>", "<cs> it was not gaelic <e>", "<cs> we are very grateful for what small assurances we have in respect of this <e> <s> we have tried very hard to get the word scotland into this we have tried very hard now to get gaelic into it <e> <s> we have not had a great deal of success <e> <s> if we are not going to deal with matters of gaelic culture in a heritage bill in what kind of bill are we going to deal with them <e>", "<cs> when the noble earl looks at it again will he remember that everything he mentioned the national heritage memorial fund helped the national trust of scotland with fyvie castle and also with canna and other places is equally available in england <e> <s> if he had been reading his papers he would have seen that there are three historic and worthwhile buildings which have been supported by the memorial fund within the past fortnight <e> <s> that is available for england but this power particularly in respect of gardens is not available in scotland <e> <s> i doubt whether it is available even to the secretary of state in statute <e>", "<cs> i follow what is said from one amendment to another <e> <s> when i hear the minister of state complaining that this would be unbalanced and would introduce the element of appointment i go back to amendment no <e> <s> when i drew attention to the fact that the national library of scotland had members <e> <s> according to the bill <e>", "<cs> she will be if she is on this new board <e>", "<cs> in view of what the government themselves propose to do and in the hope that they will have a look at this again to see whether they can do even better than they are doing i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder if at this stage we could have an answer to the question raised by the noble earl lord perth about adding at least one member <e>", "<cs> i think that we can congratulate the government on having moved this amendment and on having anticipated amendment no <e> <s> which i have tabled and which is in the same words except for one important change <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an important matter for the highland region and i do not think that anyone would wish to delay to any great extent the passing of the order confirmation bill <e> <s> however there is one matter that concerns me <e> <s> the highland region requires all the financial help that it can get

presently existing museums the royal scottish museum and the national museum of antiquities <e> <s> now we are told that they can create another umbrella organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords with permission may i continue my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i was coming to the point of withdrawing the amendments <e> <s> i am very glad that the noble earl has entered our debate because this is what

the names of these institutions will be <e> <s> one institution has had its name since and the other one since about <e> <s> these unknown faceless men will come along and will decide what the names will be no matter how nonsensical museum and museum or whatever else it may be <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of the usual things <e> <s> we get draftsmens adornments coming into bills that do not really mean anything at all and now we are told that because we allowed it in the act that was the english act and unfortunately the noble lord lord grimond was not here and i do not take any great interest in english acts it was allowed to pass <e> <s> but i believe lord grimond is right <e> <s> it does not mean a thing <e> <s> we could leave these words out altogether <e> <s> certainly if it means anything it means that the secretary of state has no right to direct them to do a certain thing which they have no power to do <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is indebted to the noble earl lord perth for his persistence in respect of this matter <e> <s> between the second reading and committee stage he went to the united states and spent most of his time in washington getting in touch with the public bills office here and myself in respect of his concern about the lack of any evidence of the government producing the museum of scotland <e> <s> i believe he has been very helpful to the secretary of state <e> <s> such a reference should he here and i am very grateful that the draftsmen from the crown office have been as helpful to him indeed probably more so as they have been to the

friend lord kirkhill whether he was ever invited or whether he ever turned up when he was the lord provost of aberdeen <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord the minister well knows i would not allow

that the influence of a board depends upon people who never turn up <e> <s> that is quite nonsensical <e> <s> this is the first time that he has actually tried to justify these <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be allowed to ask a nasty supplementary question <e> <s> can we be assured by the minister of state for scotland that because of the redistribution the central institutions in scotland will not be deprived of their share of the moneys allocated to scotland in order to enable the secretary of state to damp down the tory revolt on rates in scotland <e> <s> he said he is going to take million from the rest of the money and that this will come from other services including education and higher education <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not speaking about the universities <e>

that the boy was due to be released just six days after the date of this tragic event but that he was going to face further charges in aberdeen <e> <s> can the noble and learned lord say how long the boy had been waiting for his case to be heard in respect of those charges <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl make it perfectly clear that what we are trading is independence for being a

cavalry around him to go and get the figures <e> <s> will he say what was the percentage of relevant expenditure by the local authorities that was met by the scottish office by the government in rate support grant in say compared with today <e> <s> if he does not have the figure and wants to get it in order to save <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister of state for his information <e> <s> they produced the bill on rd may but they had a meeting with cosla on th june so they did not consult cosla about the bill <e> <s> i am not accusing the government of a con trick or anything else <e> <s> i am just accusing them of panic and not doing the right thing <e> <s> the only people who could have given them reasonable figures were cosla <e> <s> they did not get the information from cosla until after the bill was printed <e> <s> that is negligence <e> <s> they have dug their own hole so far as this financial mess is concerned <e> <s> they have nobody to blame but themselves <e>", "<cs> we have here a reference to the rebates and the fact that local authority rebates will be met in full by the government <e> <s> the one matter that concerns me is the cost of administration of this scheme which will be quite considerable <e> <s> when we first heard of this bill the rebates were to be paid in response to claims <e> <s> now i understand that there are not to be any claims <e> <s> it is up to the local rating authority to go through the valuation roll pick out those whose valuations have risen by three times or more and to calculate whether or not there is an <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister of state for that <e> <s> will he answer this absolutely clearly <e> <s> is there any power here to pay the local authority moneys in respect of the administration expense <e> <s> i can read <e> <s> subsection says <e>", "<cs> this is highly unsatisfactory <e> <s> it really is getting quite beyond it the scheme is brought about by unfair assessments and hardship is caused to individuals who are paying rates in scotland that the local authority has got to meet the additional costs <e> <s> i am very glad that the minister mentioned them because he also mentioned interest charges <e> <s> the local authority will not know what on earth they are going to get <e> <s> everyone should be paying their first half years rates by the end of june <e> <s> i do not know how many people are going to do that <e> <s> i am not paying mine not at that time unless i see some certainty about what the rates are going to be <e>", "<cs> the noble lord would learn a lot if he came into scottish debates at the right time <e> <s> one of the things he would learn would be not to be haphazard to jump to conclusions and to interrupt scottish speakers be they on his own side or on the opposition side far too readily <e> <s> he is far too impatient and ill-informed <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is prepared to argue with the minister of state about whether or not he is talking sense because as soon as the bill is passed irrespective of whether it says two weeks or six months the secretary of state can go ahead in respect of his order-making power that is within the bill <e> <s> but for the noble lord to suggest that this will hold things up in any way <e> <s> he knows as well as i do that the order has already been drawn up <e> <s> i have seen the latest draft order and i shall tell him what is in it <e> <s> so if anything rather than holding up anything it would expedite the matter and for the noble lord to say that it is common practice i can tell him it is not common practice <e> <s> there are many statutes in which there is no mention at all a bill automatically comes into force when it is passed <e> <s> there are other statutes where it says one month there are others where it says six months there are some which say three months and in some cases a particular date is given <e> <s> simply because he has said it once there is no reason why he should keep on saying it when it is wrong <e> <s> that is what gets me it is the smallness and the triviality of this <e> <s> here is something which really ought to have come into force as soon as it received royal assent <e> <s> there is no reason for this figure of two months <e>", "<cs> on their bikes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble viscount on having changed his mind <e> <s> when a bill goes through in a truncated form in another place it is all the more necessary that in this house we should preserve our rights to criticise <e> <s> i think that if the noble viscount looks at the bill we are dealing with and probably the government have already discovered blemishes he will agree that we will need that amount of time in this particular case <e>", "<cs> my lords i merely wish to express my appreciation for the changes which the government have made in respect of this bill <e> <s> my noble friends lord jacques and lord houghton should be glad that their voices have been heard their advice taken and that something has been done <e> <s> maybe it is not everything they wanted but it shows that their continued interest in the trustee savings bank movement has borne some fruit in relation to the changes which have now been made <e>", "<cs> i know my lords but the noble lord disppeared for some time <e> <s> when he came back i was not available to take part in any discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords that means we shall eventually see the bill back in your lordships house and we can then see how that amendment measures up to what was promised in the letter and the question of a certain measure of parliamentary control <e> <s> therefore to that extent this is not the last word <e> <s> we can make our study then as to how far this compromise has gone <e> <s> however let us face it this is a compromise and it is not one that will entirely meet the wishes of those people in scotland who have been concerned about the future of the trustee savings bank scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords it is much to the advantage of the subject and to the wellbeing of parliament itself that we in this house have taken it upon ourselves to insist upon our right to discuss the bill fully and also to have time between one stage of its progress and another to consider its proposals <e> <s> that is only right and only fair <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but i am afraid that that was what uefa and fifa did and we had better face the facts <e> <s> the scottish position is that we stopped the carrying of these things on buses minibuses and so on but we did not mention trains <e> <s> however if the noble lord lord wigoder had been here he would have heard that we discussed the matter and suggested that it ought also to apply to trains <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may express my appreciation on behalf of those scots members in another place who raised this matter and pointed out that you could have trains travelling between london and glasgow under one regime while they were in england and another regime while they were in scotland <e> <s> i am very grateful indeed that the bill has been so altered that the scottish experience will continue and will be applied to england <e> <s> i think it is very sensible <e> <s> it carries out a pledge that was made in another place <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will take note of this single point when he refers to the watchfulness of the scots and the possibility of changing scottish legislation because of what may happen in england <e> <s> i advise the minister to leave well alone <e> <s> when we included such items as fruit juice bottles it was because they can be pretty powerful weapons <e> <s> all one has to do is take such a bottle and break it against the heel of ones shoe and it becomes a powerful weapon <e> <s> long before we ever talked about violence at football grounds in the terms we are now i have known such to be used as a weapon in certain parts of scotland <e>", "<cs> may i ask what happens to the chairman in this new set-up <e>", "<cs> surely it does not fall to be considered <e> <s> surely under the existing legislation of the chairman is automatic in relation to the formula laid down there <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble viscount can let the committee know the nature of that election of the chairman <e>", "<cs> that is right <e> <s> it is the proprietors also the upper proprietors and the lower proprietors as so defined <e> <s> i do not know who is defining them nowadays <e> <s> in the original act the commissioners defined them <e> <s> the proprietor with the largest amount on the valuation roll shall be the chairman and he shall have not only a deliberative vote but also a casting vote <e> <s> so there is the set-up <e> <s> the set-up is purely and simply one of the proprietors of the fishings <e> <s> this is not something on which i should base the restructuring and regeneration of the whole industry important as that is <e> <s> i do not think this is the way to do it <e>", "<cs> not content <e>", "<cs> now we have clause and this is the basic structure on which we are to reorganise scottish fishing in these rivers <e> <s> one of the things that suprises me is that if this is such a good idea why is it in such a weak and parlous state <e> <s> there was power to create boards and further power was taken in to achieve district boards there was a distinct lack of enthusiasm for them by giving power to two proprietors <e> <s> it is still on the statute book <e> <s> can we not use that <e> <s> it takes just two proprietors to get at the secretary of state and have a fishery board constituted <e> <s> why has it not happened <e> <s> i do not think it is as simple as the noble viscount says <e> <s> this is just not enough <e>", "<cs> the suggestion that i am not an angler does not mean that i do not have any interest in angling <e> <s> i have a considerable interest in angling <e> <s> i would not like to list the angling associations not on the clyde but in ayrshire of which i am the president and have been the president for quite a long time <e> <s> i am interested in the future of our rivers and in salmon fishing <e> <s> i think it right to say that the government themselves are looking at this from the point of view of much more comprehensive legislation <e> <s> indeed if the noble viscount had been fair he would have been concerned about the trouble i took over the hunter report as i think it was called which bedevilled me for many years and in respect of which some action over certain rivers was taken in i think or or later <e>", "<cs> not-content <e>", "<cs> the proposed new clause would give considerable new powers of intervention to the secretary of state and it is not altogether clear <e> <s> i notice that it says the district boards shall consult <e> <s> they have no option and must do so <e> <s> having consulted they <e>", "<cs> we are grateful to the noble lord for his intervention <e> <s> we are getting some balance into this <e> <s> salmon fishing is worth talking about <e> <s> we have talked about it many times in your lordships house <e> <s> it is an abiding interest of both front benches and its importance has been pressed in both houses <e>", "<cs> i have never accused the noble viscount of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i too can declare this measure of interest i did not vote either way on the original motion <e> <s> i had not my mind made up as to whether it would be a good thing or a had thing hut i appreciated the value of an experiment <e> <s> the decision the house took was that we would have the experiment for six months then we would have a considered report and having debated and considered that we would make up our minds <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister of state for repeating the statement made by his right honourable friend the secretary of state in another place <e> <s> there is no doubt at all about the gravity of the events which caused the establishment of dr chiswicks inquiry and the working party to be set up <e> <s> when one considers seven deaths self-inflicted injury cases and about people at risk and under strict suicide observation in three and a half years the importance of the matter becomes very clear indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords but surely one of the points is this <e> <s> we know that contrary advice was given in by mr murray that his opinion which was sought by the tsb at that time was to the effect that the bank was owned by the depositors or members <e> <s> since that time of course he has been asked to put forward a case and as an advocate he has put forward a case for the tsb and suggested that if anybody it might possibly be the central board who owned the bank <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord the lord advocate sits down may i ask him this <e> <s> he said the preponderance of the advice so there was conflicting advice <e> <s> surely the only way to end the conflict was to ask the courts to decide <e> <s> why did not the government proceed in that way or invite the tsb to proceed in that way <e> <s> all that we have heard about this preponderance of advice is that nobody owns the bank which is an absurd position <e>", "<cs> my lords if i heard the noble lord correctly he said that the boards of the new banks would be elected by the new company <e> <s> as <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words on this matter <e> <s> one of our mistakes in respect of the original amendment which was eventually passed was that we did not carry it through the bill <e> <s> as a result it made virtually nonsense of the bill <e> <s> the government were not willing to go the whole way with us which would have meant dealing with the other aspects of the bill which affected scotland <e> <s> they felt themselves tied by the fact that they had reached third reading and therefore the matter would probably have had to be recommitted which of course they could have done in order to clear it up <e> <s> however they were not prepared to accept a completely independent scottish bank <e> <s> it would probably have meant that they would have done with this bill what they did the other day with the bill dealing with corporal punishment in schools they would have forgotten about it and produced yet another one <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords as a matter of fact i thought that it was a gowrie slip <e> <s> it is as tangled a skein as the bill itself to whom the grief referred whether it was the government or whether it was the noble lord <e> <s> however the noble lord lord taylor pointed out as we have pointed out more than once and as was pointed out in another place by no less a person than a former solicitor-general for scotland mr nicholas fairbairn that unless assurances are actually in the bill they do not mean a thing <e> <s> there is no guarantee that they can be changed <e> <s> other people can come along with other ideas <e> <s> once the bill has passed through this house once it is a statute it is the statute which matters <e> <s> therefore there is no guarantee regarding the assurances in relation to the registered office of the company being in scotland and the company holding its annual meeting there <e> <s> someone will probably suggest that it should be during the edinburgh festival when it would suit them all to be there <e>", "<cs> my lords if you know anything about the scots you will know that there is no more litigious race than the scots <e> <s> that is why they are doing so well in the legal profession in scotland <e> <s> i have known matters to be prompted by individuals and to be carried on by individuals for years and years <e> <s> i do not think that this can just be denigrated as a political stunt any more than the noble lords amendment should have been <e> <s> the house did not accept it as a political stunt when that was suggested from the front bench opposite and elsewhere <e> <s> however we have improved the bill <e> <s> it will be interesting to see what kind of mess the government get themselves into if the matter goes for decision by scottish law <e>", "<cs> my lords since we have already had a consultation paper from this government and that was followed by a white paper and then by a decision that there was nothing basically wrong with the rating system is the noble lord aware that a scottish office minister i think it was lord ancram has said that promises are not enough <e> <s> but the government still have taken no definite action on getting the reform for which everyone in scotland is anxious <e> <s> when is it going to take place <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord the lord advocate the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside and my noble friend lord morton have shown natural concern about the importance of this matter <e> <s> but the noble and learned lord the lord advocate said that he was demonstrating his concern by the fact that there is to be a review of the working of the act which after all has not been on the statute book for very long <e> <s> are we to hear anything about this <e> <s> is the review to be published or have we just to understand that it is finished when he makes some change or does not make any change at all in respect of guidelines how is parliament to be informed about the result of this review and what action are the government to take <e>", "<cs> i turned it down <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to press the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he make it clear whether the saving of million which he suggested i heard a higher figure is not related to scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the lord advocate for taking his time in answering the debate <e> <s> the fact that he did so was an indication of the importance of this which he probably did not appreciate when he moved the amendment on report <e> <s> in a way i felt rather sorry for him <e> <s> all the speeches that were delivered from the cross-benches from his own benches from the liberal benches and from these benches were against him <e> <s> he had not a friend in the place <e> <s> but i suppose that he will say i am the representative of the government <e> <s> i represent this great majority and what not <e>", "<cs> my lords the house should be grateful to my noble friend lady turner of camden for raising this very timely unstarred question regarding gartcosh and steel <e> <s> i welcome the fact that the matter was raised by someone with london roots and not by a scotsman because if a scotsman had raised it everyone would say ah the scots are greeting again <e> <s> my noble friend dealt with the matter correctly because she was thinking in terms of the nation and not in terms even of scotland or lanarkshire or the west of scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has used something that i have already seen in some of the pro-government propaganda in respect of the number of people employed at the present time <e> <s> the noble lord is comparing it with when the industry was dying not when it was flourishing <e> <s> that was the weakness of his argument <e> <s> the noble lord seemed to say i must say something for the government when all he had to do was to attack the government and let them know their job which is to save gartcosh and to save ravenscraig <e> <s> if you want to save ravenscraig you must first of all save gartcosh <e>", "<cs> my lords how long will that last without any reinvestment and modernisation <e>", "<cs> my lords have i understood the noble earl to say that the government are considering asking other people to consider doing something <e>", "<cs> that is what i said <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is only right to express appreciation for the governments action and the action in the commons in respect of these changes that were consequential on an amendment that i moved on third reading <e> <s> it shows that the government accept the will of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords we should certainly approve this order <e> <s> scotsmen fairly widely have been pressing for this for a long time and hoping that we could get this north atlantic conservation going <e> <s> however it will not solve all our problems <e> <s> the noble lord lord balfour was right when he said that <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will be aware that the flotation of shares in this bank in which we now find there are if not owners beneficiaries who have not agreed to such a flotation cannot go ahead as quickly as was expected <e> <s> i have been accused of helping the government <e> <s> i never sought to help the government <e> <s> i am not guilty ofthat <e> <s> what we did was to warn the government that what the minister now calls firm legal advice was not firm at all <e> <s> the person who gave that legal advice in that direction had at an earlier stage given legal advice along the lines of the judgment that has now been given <e> <s> surely this flotation is not going ahead now <e> <s> in the light of this judgment can we be assured that it will not go ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords can i explain to my noble friend that having looked at this after church yesterday i did not see many scottish firms open they were all firms based in this pagan land <e>", "<cs> i would not have ventured to intervene on this purely english matter but for the fact that the noble lord has mentioned scotland <e> <s> does he know what is happening to sunday in scotland now <e> <s> as a result of the changes that are taking place with multiples opening on sundays the smaller and more localised shops are being forced to open as well <e> <s> there is not all that much more money to be spent in the week and if someone is grabbing it someone is losing it

criticised by my noble friend in respect of his television performance <e> <s> i think he is to be congratulated especially on the tribute he paid to the workers at the naval dockyard at rosyth for their efficiency and at a later date i shall quote his very words and their safety records <e> <s> it is a <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether i am right in my feeling that this debate started rather sweetly but towards the end with the contributions by the noble lord lord burton and the noble marquess lord lansdowne it became a wee bit sour in respect of the welcome that was being given to this particular bill <e> <s> i am perfectly sure that many people are thinking that when it comes to sour notes there is none better than ross to deliver them <e> <s> but it will not be quite so bad as that <e>", "<cs> who said long my lords <e> <s> we have had only two speakers from this side of the house <e> <s> all the rest have been from the other side <e> <s> that is why i say that in scottish debates i am entitled to five times as long as anyone else just to make up and give the due weight and balance that we are looking for in our approach to the salmon rivers <e>", "<cs> yes my lords by eight hours <e> <s> i am sorry <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not bad but let us hope that it is confirmed and not only confirmed but that we get some result <e> <s> does the noble lord not agree with me that something of this sort should actually be in the bill <e> <s> we should be very much happier with that rather than that there should be some administrative arrangement between a minister and a water board <e> <s> in fact will there be an english bill <e> <s> we should like to know because i think a point made by the noble lord lord clinton was that many of the problems which we are facing are problems faced in the west country as well <e> <s> so will there be an english bill or not <e>", "<cs> my lords i should love to expatiate on that subject but it is only fair to the rest of the house and to the minister who has been waiting for a long time to wind up and have his go at the rest of us if i just leave it at that <e>", "<cs> i must give fulsome thanks to the noble lord lord gray of contin for that <e> <s> there must be something wrong with it <e>", "<cs> i do not entirely agree with everything that was said by the noble lord lord burton but i must say that this clause is a very very difficult one to understand <e> <s> one of the difficulties is that people expected and thought that the changes in relation to the salmon industry and all the aspects of fishing merited a complete new organisation for the management of fishing and we are still building up on the acts and so on <e> <s> this is not quite good enough <e> <s> it leads us into all sorts of difficulties in trying to read and understand this matter <e>", "<cs> we are grateful to the noble lord for his helpful elucidation <e> <s> as i understand the position now the existing districts will remain but they are redefined and power is given to the secretary of state to designate the same term salmon fishery districts is used again and within these fishery districts something will happen <e> <s> the secretary of state can only designate them according to the schedule if particular people ask for them to be designated <e> <s> if they do not ask for designation then they just remain as they are today with the unsatisfactory position about which the noble lord lord burton and to a certain extent the noble earl lord perth are concerned <e>", "<cs> with all due respect they are in clause <e>",

pondered for quite a long time over the first amendment <e> <s> i am disappointed <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord is doing justice to anglers and anglers associations <e> <s> from what the noble lord has said they are to be considered on the basis of co-option with all its limitations unless certain amendments are accepted <e> <s> it is disappointing that it is to be left entirely to the fishery boards or proprietors <e>", "<cs> they have to be made known anyway <e> <s> the secretary of state has an overall responsibility as regards all the salmon fishery districts in respect of the annual close times <e> <s> he should know that <e> <s> what we are asking for under this amendment is for particular people to put forward their proposals <e> <s> that does not mean to say that those proposals will be the proposals eventually within the order <e> <s> so far as i can see leaving this out does not make any difference at all <e> <s> the secretary of state still has to decide what <e>", "<cs> it is not information <e> <s> it is a proposal <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i hate to see the minister so disappointed and tearful about this <e>", "<cs> there is just one point <e> <s> the last item paragraph says <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down will he draw attention to the other fact that any of these regulations about these intimate things that we heard about have to come before parliament because the regulations are subject to the negative procedure <e> <s> much as i like waiting up at night especially in your lordships chamber

amendment of the noble viscount lord ridley <e> <s> it is a far better amendment than mine and much more explicit <e>", "<cs> i think that the second point made by the minister is quite reasonable <e>

provision been used <e> <s> if it has not been used let us forget it <e> <s> if it has been used tell us or write a letter to the solicitor-general or someone or other <e>", "<cs> i asked the minister whether he could produce any figures or any information about how often this provision had been used since <e> <s> the main reason he gave at first was that it had been there since and they want to carry it on <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the minister of state for making a speech lasting fully half a minute and not even mentioning the purpose of the amendment <e> <s> he mentioned the right to borrow with which i fully agreed that is to say the right to borrow an amount not exceeding twice the amount of the fishery assessment collected <e> <s> that is something agreed <e> <s> it is a power given by the secretary of state in the bill <e>", "<cs> well at least the noble lord mentioned the amendment this time perhaps i read the right page <e> <s> i still think it is not <e> <s> the purpose of bringing in the secretary of state is that he will see whether or not it is reasonable in the circumstances to do this <e> <s> some people may go well ahead of what is wanted to be done and entirely neglect the financial burden that they may eventually be putting on the smaller man <e> <s> it may be a group of smaller men <e> <s> i know at least one board where there is only one lower proprietor and about upper ones <e> <s> however when it comes to financial muscle the man who has the financial muscle is the one lower proprietor and if he wants something done there you are of course <e> <s> it could be done in this particular way and not be desired by anyone else <e> <s> i wish it worked the other way that one could have the minority man with the good idea getting something done that he wanted done despite the financial muscle in that way <e> <s> this is one of the difficulties with the reconstitution of boards with exactly the same kind of financial powers and muscle based upon that and nothing else <e> <s> i think it is hoped that we shall get better management out of this <e> <s> i doubt very much whether we shall because i think we are still tied far too much to the past <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the pressure being placed on the minister must put him into some difficulty bearing in mind the support which the same members of the committee gave him on another matter <e>", "<cs> gladly <e>", "<cs> well i must get into the burton area of scotland and find out that houses are very much cheaper there than in any other part of scotland <e> <s> perhaps

fishery assessment collected in the year <e> <s> i shall now gladly give way to the noble duke the duke of atholl <e>", "<cs> i am beginning to get rather confused about the financial position of

if the schedule is as perfect as the minister would have us believe and it does not require any variation why has he taken the power to vary the schedule because that is what is given in clause which says <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no limitation on the power of the secretary of state to vary the provisions of schedule <e> <s> it is without limitation in the statute <e>", "<cs> my lords before

lines of drafting <e> <s> in terms of the thousands of copies of this bill which have to be reprinted later on we have saved four lines <e> <s> the government have done a good job now <e>", "<cs> my

worried about the idiocy of the local authorities and generally variations of fees why should we be worried in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i will say very briefly that i would be prepared to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords surely we are purely and simply discussing an amendment to the amendment of the noble viscount lord trenchard <e> <s> i should like to speak to his amendment

spent minutes on this particular amendment <e> <s> i give due notice that i have a date with a lady to take her to the station <e> <s> we will catch the train leaving here at twenty-minutes past ten <e>", "<cs> my lords to my mind this is a very modest amendment <e> <s> it surprises me that the amendment proposes that we wait three years before taking action when so far as the debates in this house are concerned the general opinion is that the power is necessary <e> <s> i am sorry about the noble viscount lord thurso who seems to be on his own on this occasion but he need not worry <e> <s> if he looks at the power which is asked for he will see that it is a power to permit district salmon fishery boards to take action if they want to <e> <s> everything is so beautiful and wonderful in the noble viscounts area and we know the influence that he declared he has in that district salmon fishery boards that they do not need to apply <e>", "<cs> my lords i may say that i too have had my doubts about this particular clause and my doubts have swayed between the difficulties of proof and making it far far too easy to find someone guilty of a new offence <e> <s> and let us remember this when we are talking about blackguards before ever you begin to try them and before ever the noble and learned lord lord denning gets them into court all these epithets derogatory to the individual are not very good i think from the point of view of looking at justice <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pity that the noble lord lord burton is not with us right at the moment <e> <s> i do not know whether he hopes to be with us <e>", "<cs> my lords if i give the noble lord time to sit down by saying a couple more sentences he will be able to get up and congratulate the government for having accepted his ideas which he pursued right from second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to nit-pick but the minister used the words private land <e> <s> he did mean to say public land did he not <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this is an appropriate point at which to ask a question about the original amendment moved by the noble lord lord belstead <e> <s> but if i may make one comment the latent concern of the house for the future of salmon has been clearly shown by the attempts made to drag into the debate on this amendment important as the amendment is on its own and we were all satisfied to get that amendment on its own all sorts of things which may be important but quite frankly and i speak as one who has had quite a lot to do with legislation are quite irrelevant and indeed probably detract from the actual importance of what we are doing here <e> <s> what we are doing here is getting action on something that has troubled us for decades <e> <s> it may not be as

amendment tabled in my name is included in the list <e> <s> to expedite the business and because the government might accept it i do not propose to move the amendment <e> <s> i am not joking when i say that <e> <s> the acceptance of the amendment can be taken out of the brief of the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very important statement from the point of view of scotland where this strike has been going on for the better part of two years <e> <s> i thank the minister for repeating the statement by the secretary of state in another place <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the secretary of state himself for having taken this very important initiative <e> <s> when one considers the damage that has been done and the damage to childrens education is not just damage for the moment but could be damage that is lasting and may have already affected the educational progress of children and possibly their future careers and outlook in

amendment whether he knows anything about the bill and whether he is just an emanation of his civil servants saying resist <e> <s> well he should resist the lures of the civil service who will accept

benefit but they will be denied representation even to further their claim <e>", "<cs> it is only possible if the government actually do what they now take the power to do raise the limits rather than

figures in a downward direction <e> <s> i do not see very much in the retention of this alternative power to limit it to people on supplementary benefit which gives us any great hope at all that the

worse off <e>", "<cs> one of the points that is clear is that one cannot do it here because one cannot construe sports clubs in any way as domestic subjects so it is out of place <e> <s> we all accept

we be assured that this is the last list of acts that have to be fouled and suitably changed <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord realises that there is one page without any numbers at all

noble lord lord burton with a crofter is like saying that we can all go and live at the ritz we have the freedom to do that <e> <s> the noble lord suggested that practically all the crofters have very

of state to say that this should be done with each individual authority <e> <s> it is quite wrong for the noble lord to suggest that <e> <s> that is why i am so angry about it <e>", "<cs> having been secretary of state for about eight years i think i lasted there just about as long as the noble lord lasted at national insurance if he remembers <e>", "<cs> no i do not want to make anything of this

that it would be done in one order <e> <s> with regard to prescription one of the things that we are concerned about is to find out what the government are going to do <e> <s> the minister told us

be prescribed <e>", "<cs> the minister has a wonderful brief and he will tell us what the clause means <e> <s> i have read it and i do not know what it means <e> <s> i hope that he will tell us what clause is all about <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord had taken the words of his brief and put them into the statute they would be much more readily understood than those in the statute and they would have been much shorter <e> <s> will he take a message back to the draftsmen that they should study his speeches after they have briefed him and then write the statute rather than the other way round <e>", "<cs> this is one of the inevitabilities of the fact that here is an element of law in which the government have intervened parliament has intervened and it may well be to the detriment of private persons <e> <s> so far as i know there is no arbitration court in respect of this <e> <s> if it requires a certain measure of compromise between people as the minister suggests as one of the ways out i do not think it will work because it will be to some persons advantage and somebody elses disadvantage <e>", "<cs> i do not think that this is quite the small point that the noble lord suggests <e> <s> where someone has a beneficial interest under a deed and it is related to assessed rental and net rental there will be changes in respect of that <e> <s> we have known areas of ground that have had no value in one year and a tremendous value in the next year <e> <s> here we are freezing it at st april <e> <s> the assessor could quite easily enter into the roll an estimated value

not prepared to pursue this matter further <e> <s> the minister has suggested that he will look at the matter but he makes no promises at all <e> <s> he is a good scottish servant of the civil service

before we leave this matter i shall ask once again for elucidation <e> <s> we have complained time and again that many aspects of this bill are unexplained <e> <s> so far the most repeated phrase in

further forward <e>", "<cs> i did not say that <e> <s> i did not even suggest that this place is an old peoples home <e>", "<cs> yes they are connected <e> <s> i shall speak on them later <e> <s> i do not want to speak to them now <e> <s> i want an initial response from the minister <e>", "<cs> it does not surprise me that the government find them unacceptable <e> <s> what surprises me are the arguments used by the minister to justify the personal community contribution and the objection to its being called a poll tax <e> <s> i know that the minister is new at this business but if he had been here in he would have seen a white paper published by the government in which they listed the alternatives to the present rating system <e> <s> what they suggested then and later was that one of the alternatives was a poll tax <e> <s> therefore i am taking the words poll tax from an official government paper <e>", "<cs> we are talking about a group of amendments because i thought that that is what the minister was talking about <e> <s> he must not listen to me but to his leader <e> <s> if possible the noble lord should get a copy of the list that is provided though it is not provided very freely because it is never available in any number on which the groupings are suggested <e> <s> we are now taking amendments together <e> <s> we wish to call things what they are so that the personal community charge will become a poll tax <e>", "<cs> of course it would not and the minister should know <e> <s> what is in a name <e> <s> a community charge by any other name is a tax <e> <s> i want to get right down to the matter and if it is a tax to call it a tax <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e> <s> we want people to accept the fact that it is a tax <e> <s> i hope that we will accept that taxes are far more appropriate so that we should have standard property tax and a collective contribution tax <e> <s> when one considers the standard tax and the collective tax they depart entirely from the main thrust of the bill <e> <s> this is a tax which everyone has to pay themselves <e> <s> they are not going to pay themselves if it is a standard charge <e> <s> it is going to be people who are using the property in question <e> <s> it may well be paid to someone who is the owner of the property and the owner of the property is the person under the obligation <e> <s> it is really a property tax <e>", "<cs> i would never infer that from my noble friend lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> i was concerned about the minister <e> <s> when he thinks that i am shaking my head because i am agreeing with him i am merely shaking my head in incredulity at the simplicity of the minister <e>", "<cs> it was shaken in despair at the answers i got from the minister <e> <s> the noble lord lord stodart is not the only one with experience of me <e> <s> i see one or two good friends of mine with whom i debated in another place <e> <s> i think they will appreciate that generally speaking i am fair in my arguments and usually mean what i say <e>", "<cs> i am sorely tempted but at this hour of the night it would be unfair to defeat the government so i reluctantly seek leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this is of course only an estimate that was given when the bill was originally published towards the end of november last year <e> <s> i wonder whether the figure is the same now <e> <s> as i understand it considerable expenditures have arisen since then <e> <s> i wonder what the governments own expenditure has been in putting the bill through <e> <s> i see a tremendous number of civil servants from scotland sitting in the chamber <e> <s> i wonder what the travel expenses have been since the month of december and <e>", "<cs> there is one other figure that i should like to have <e> <s> it is not connected with the amendment nor does it bear on local government but it is a matter of interest for everyone <e>", "<cs> if the minister means no it can be said in one word <e>", "<cs> and she may not <e>", "<cs> that is a very important point because many of the students in certain city universities live at home <e> <s> i presume that the register will ask how many people over the age of live at the students home <e> <s> would it not be just as easy to have them registered there and save the complications <e> <s> who will register them at the university <e> <s>

or seven of them together and who pay rent to a landlady who is either present or not present <e> <s> will they pay the collective charge or could it possibly arise that they would pay the collective charge as well as the personal charge <e> <s> there are so many complications here that i do not wish the government to be hasty about these things but i want them to start thinking now about what a tangled web they have weaved in respect of this whole business <e>", "<cs> i am not talking about students being required to pay but that can happen <e> <s> when will they know about it when they get two bills one from the university registrar or assessor they may have thought up a new word when students were involved because there is a registrar at universities as well and a personal bill at their home <e>", "<cs> the government have had to deal with these amendments in the other place as well as here <e> <s> the amendments have been down on the marshalled list and the government have had the opportunity to study them one by one as well as collectively <e> <s> it is unfortunate that they may have been grouped together i tend to agree with the noble earl lord perth on that but it is not good enough just to say i will take them away and look at them <e>", "<cs> that is what i said <e> <s> that is as far as the noble lord can go <e> <s> he does not have the power to accept that amendment <e> <s> i trust that he has already gone over this amendment with his officials and has it all clearly marked where he should give a soft answer or resist <e> <s> the noble lord forgets that i was in that position for a long time and it is probably a formula that i have used myself though not very often <e>", "<cs> this debate has been fascinating <e> <s> we have a well-known saying in scotland <e>", "<cs> we either move this amendment here and now or we do not move it <e> <s> but if the noble lord insists that i do so <e>", "<cs> i thought for a minute that the noble lord was saying that we would not come back full-stop <e> <s> however i do not object to the motion <e>", "<cs> it is a fascinating subject which could go on for quite a long time because there is such a variety of occupancy and payment in respect of tied cottages <e> <s> and you cannot do anything for tied cottages without suddenly having the thought that there are people who are not in tied cottages

even talking about that <e> <s> i am giving figures as i know them <e> <s> i do not have proportions any more than the minister with all his department at hand can tell me how many people there are between and who will be hit by this bill and who have probably never paid rates in their lives before <e> <s> i am just stating the minimum <e> <s> you can add to it if you like <e> <s> it still makes it unequal that that year-old in his humble bungalow should be subject to the same tax as the noble lord lord burton <e>", "<cs> anyone who knows anything about the struggles and tribulations of one

baroness decides to be convinced of something else <e> <s> it shows a commendable flexibility that coming from her rather surprised me <e> <s> i applaud it <e>", "<cs> i received the answer in a nod from the minister so i do not move the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thought i understood this until i heard the explanation <e> <s> if there was ever utter gibberish it was the explanation of what appeared at one time to be simple <e> <s> however there is a reason for it we can blame the hurry and haste of the draftsmanship <e>", "<cs> if that is the purpose why could it not have been said <e> <s> it would be much easier to understand than what is said in the paragraph <e> <s> in view of the explanation given i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this is all very surprising <e> <s> the lecture took place last friday in the chapel royal stirling <e> <s> it referred to pipe major william ross <e>", "<cs> oh of course they were charming and i daresay the noble lord was even more

like the word adequate i can think of many others <e>", "<cs> i did not <e>", "<cs> at this moment i should not seek to encourage the minister to make another long extensive speech <e> <s> the minister should quit when he is winning <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not think that that is enough <e> <s> dates of birth will be made available to local authorities <e> <s> i presume that everyone in the local <e>", "<cs> i trust that the noble lord will answer when i sit down in keeping with the rules of this place <e> <s> i shall be glad to sit down <e>", "<cs> we have all had this difficulty in respect of two names which are similar or the same in a particular household <e> <s> but i remember an election in wales where there were about four candidates all with the same name <e> <s> believe it or not the electors were evidently very much more far seeing than the officers who are to be appointed to this job at a very big salary because they managed to understand the situation without any debate <e>", "<cs> and they are not available to anyone else <e> <s> another helpful point was raised in respect of the electoral registration officer <e> <s> he has been appointed because he has some experience of this kind <e> <s> on the electoral register there is a number <e> <s> if people are going to report that someone has moved south of the border or elsewhere that number will be sufficient <e> <s> in this case it may be that there will be no numbers <e> <s> but i believe that it will be discovered later that there ought to be a number for ease of issuing these notices that are going out to people <e> <s> the simplest way of all is to put a number in respect of all the various people who are on the register as paying these community charges <e>", "<cs> i can understand that the government like to have a free hand <e> <s> however it will be troublesome from the point of view of the assessors we now call them registration officers unless they are given some information <e>", "<cs> i think we should be reasonably assured of what we are going to get but i should like to know what the plainer language is going to be <e> <s> one thing we must not do is to have this suddenly thrust upon people so that they ask whats this <e> <s> we should be starting fairly early after the bill is passed to let people know what is coming to them <e> <s> even though it is in the middle of an election period i think you have to take time to let people know the present that is coming to them of the benefits of paying these charges particularly the year-olds <e> <s> since they are not paying any rates the sooner they are told that the government think that they should all pay equally about a year the better <e> <s> they can be told dont worry it is subject to certain rebates if you havent got the money and you will not get it all but youll get some <e>", "<cs> i do not think that is at all a reasonable compromise <e> <s> there is a very considerable difference between three years and three months <e> <s> it must be borne in mind that the act will come into force on st april and it will be three years after that before there can be what is admittedly the maximum figure which is far too high <e> <s> i hope that the government will look at this again to see whether or not they can reduce the maximum <e> <s> common sense should make them do it especially in relation to the likelihood of someone paying the maximum fine for a three years lapse of community charge <e> <s> maybe we shall return to this at another time <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if the minister does not want to get tied in knots here is a knot he can get rid of in view of the fact that he will spend the whole of the easter recess looking at these matters again <e> <s> let us not forget that when people such as the government chief whip and others are having a nice easy time we shall have to prepare for the next stage of this bill which must take place the day after we come back <e> <s> he is a hard hard man he is the hammer of the scots and we shall not forget it <e> <s> i hope that the minister will study the amendment <e> <s> five minutes may lead him to the conclusion that the word not should be removed and the word but should be changed to and <e> <s> however in view of what has been said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the house should be grateful for the detailed information we have received from the noble baroness in respect of this bill <e> <s> she said that she had had some help from the scottish office <e> <s> i reckon that mr mcquarrie obtained the bill from the scottish office <e> <s> for some reason the scottish office is anxious to proceed with this bill almost as anxious as it is to proceed with another <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i ask him when he is having a look at this to have a look at clause which relates to fees <e> <s> in paragraph <e>", "<cs> i should not mind if we adjourned the committee for a quarter of an hour to look at that point <e>", "<cs> this is quite an important point <e> <s> one of the troubles about this bill is that it is so hasty <e> <s> the government want it to be efficient and that may well mean cutting corners to the detriment of fairness to those who have to pay these unfair community charges and the like <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> covers the case where there is an appeal against a decision by the community charges registration officer <e> <s> if a reply does not reach the person who is appealing after a certain time the request is deemed to be refused but i think it should be the other way around <e> <s> the person who has to respond to the payer is the community charges registration officer and if he does not reply within a certain time it should be conceded that he has allowed the request <e>", "<cs> i think the minister appreciates the sense of the committee <e> <s> the technicalities may be such as suit the business <e> <s> this very much suits the registration officer <e> <s> on the other <e>", "<cs> the point raised by the noble lord lord burton shows the dangers of the registration officer trying to get as full and accurate information as possible <e> <s> we had a report recently supported by the home secretary which drew attention to the fact that a great many people are not on the electoral roll <e> <s> the committee should remember that in scotland the same person who draws up the electoral roll will be drawing up this register <e>", "<cs> the important point is that a man who has security of tenure by virtue of one appointment then has two other appointments <e> <s> is the minister telling us that that security of tenure carries over <e> <s> suppose the registration officer turns out to be a hopeless failure <e> <s> one cannot get rid of him without having a voice majority in the council <e> <s> let the minister think about that situation because it raises another very serious problem <e> <s> however in view of what he has said i shall certainly give him time to look over the matter <e> <s> i shall leave my telephone number with him <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not disagree with that suggestion <e> <s> i am surprised the minister had not read through the list of amendments to see exactly what he was to move later on <e> <s> there is also the question raised by the noble lord lord burton <e> <s> the information will be of limited value <e> <s> it will give the names of the householder the person who pays the rates <e> <s> of course they are not to be included in future <e> <s> if you are concerned about who else is living in a house you will not find out from the district authority and let us not be surprised that there are more people than the person who pays the rates <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the minister has decided to look again at this matter <e> <s> we may look at it lightheartedly but this is one of the more important aspects of the bill <e> <s> it is not a question of canvassing to see who in the household is to go on to the election roll <e> <s> people do not mind about that <e> <s> we want to be more accurate <e> <s> is this the way to achieve that accuracy <e> <s> if there is no agreement the community registration officer can say you are the responsible person <e> <s> he might be the most irresponsible person in the place but as soon as the registration officer nominates him the matter is decided although he can go to the sheriff eventually <e> <s> i had intended to move amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> a great many amendments i was not going to move but i might as well move them <e> <s> the minister may be querying that point <e> <s> we had an amendment that covered the whole provision and we could have started with that leaving out subsection to <e> <s> however in the interests of time we decided not to move it <e>", "<cs> no i shall not be moving those <e>", "<cs> the only thing that enables me to withdraw the amendment is that there is going to be a report stage <e> <s> obviously we have not nearly enough time to debate these matters <e> <s> we are dealing here purely and simply with someone being liable on st april or becoming liable on or after that date <e> <s> it is asking far too much to spoil anybodys birthday by saying notify the registration officer that you are and you are ready to pay <e> <s> i do not know what the precedent is for that but i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if it had been convincing and if it was as clear as the noble lord suggests i should not have put the amendment down <e> <s> however i shall not hold the committee up on this point at the moment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am certainly glad to withdraw the amendment for the sake of getting on with the business <e>", "<cs> i do not think that there is any doubt that it is very unusual indeed to have such principles encompassed in a schedule <e> <s> we have been moving along this line for a long time since about and it springs from legislation that the government said started in about the right of the government to interfere in excessive expenditure <e> <s> that has changed its meaning and also the purpose for which governments originally included it in bills has changed <e> <s> it is like an old woman being proud of a brush saying that it has been in the family for years and has had only three heads and two shafts <e> <s> the whole thing is different and i have been in most of the arguments about this kind of thing <e>", "<cs> this is a very interesting argument but it does not have an awful lot to do with what we are supposed to be discussing <e> <s> i remind the noble lord if he is interested in local government finances that in the government paid per <e>", "<cs> i think that the point raised by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter as to whether this matter should be debarred from discussion in this chamber is very important <e> <s> if he looks at clause he will be interested to discover as will the committee that in the whole of the bill there is not a single rule or regulation that has to be drawn up by the secretary of state that will come to this chamber because they all come under the annulment procedure resolution of either house <e> <s> we seldom see them particularly if the other place decides to have a prayer <e> <s> it is difficult for us to accept this proposal <e> <s> i have tabled an amendment to clause <e> <s> it does not cover this point <e> <s> i was going to withdraw it because we can tighten up the amendment at the next stage of the bill <e> <s> that will give us the opportunity properly to debate the subject on report <e>", "<cs> this specification is already there in statute <e> <s> admittedly it was not in the schedule but in the bill <e> <s> why is there the departure here <e> <s> it makes it far easier for the secretary of state he has all the flexibility in the world <e> <s> if government place the responsibility on him he is the person who will determine it <e> <s> local government will say he will fix it <e> <s> there is already sufficient criticism of the way these matters work but if the power is to be taken entirely without restriction by the secretary of state people will say more and more that government are laying down the law and that there might as well not be a local authority <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we have certainly discovered today the complexity of the bill the difficulties of the register and the difficulties of collection <e> <s> in the past rates were easy to collect and there was no trouble about that <e> <s> now we are looking at something through a glass darkly in respect of the poorest section of the population people who have more claim on our help in this respect than any other section of the community <e> <s> right away we come up against the simple fact it is not an argument but a fact and i said so on second reading that there is not a single member of the committee who will be worse off as a result of the bill <e> <s> every noble lord will be better off <e> <s> when we were discussing rebates i wish that we had all made clear our personal interest in the bill <e>", "<cs> why could the noble lord not accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> it says that this is in respect of the year so it is not this year but next year <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this would definitely bring out the whole genesis of this bill with its pandering to panic and to self-interest <e> <s> i have already said that certain people will benefit from the bill <e> <s> the poorest of the poor will not <e> <s> but i think that blinded by the storms of perth the government have given way <e>", "<cs> because the women did not have a vote there so one has to be very careful about that <e> <s> however we shall have an opportunity in scotland before very long to let parliament know exactly what we think of the government not only in respect of this bill but also other legislation and policy items that have been passed to the detriment of scotland <e> <s> that will be the best and fairest way <e> <s> everyone who has a vote will be on their toes to ensure that the noble lord lord glenarthur perhaps comes over to this side of the chamber and people more suitably representative of scotland go on the other side <e>", "<cs> his last visit to the scottish grand committee <e> <s> i am going to jog his memory <e>", "<cs> i shall remind the noble lord <e> <s> it was when he became prime minister and member of parliament for i think perth and kinross <e> <s> for reasons best known to themselves his constituents took him to the second reading of a scottish bill in the scottish grand committee <e> <s> i do not know whether it was the fact that he was there or whether he did not like what he heard but that bill has never been heard of again <e> <s> probably the noble lord lord polwarth will remember the bill to which i am referring <e> <s> in scotland we called it the bed tax bill where a tax would be put on every room in a hotel so much per night <e> <s> it never saw a committee stage <e> <s> it applied only to scotland <e> <s> it was seen to be a bit of nonsense <e> <s> this bill applies only to scotland <e> <s> the noble lord lord home is here again <e>", "<cs> my lords admittedly it is the report stage of this bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord home has already had some influence on the noble lord lord glenarthur through some of the things he has said and done <e> <s> he probably saved the noble lord from a couple of defeats in committee by telling him <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not been unusually illogical as the noble lord suggested his hearing has been slightly defective <e> <s> i was referring to the government gaining popularity with their own declining supporters the people at the tory party conference in perth <e> <s> those are the people <e> <s> they saw their party support declining <e> <s> the government are not worried about the people in the housing schemes or in the working class areas of scotland <e> <s> they do not vote for them anyway <e> <s> they were after their own people <e> <s> that is why the bill is so unfair and so one-sided <e>", "<cs> my lords crofters <e> <s> before the noble lord sits down would he like to look at the act <e>", "<cs> which makes it statutory <e> <s> the reduction in rates for crofters is per cent <e> <s> by statute <e>", "<cs> my lords i think no one would be more surprised than the party opposite if i withdrew this amendment <e> <s> i want to express my thanks to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for the praise he gave me <e> <s> i do not know what for because he did not have much praise for what i was saying today but neither had i for what he said <e> <s> we have heard about this widow on every sort of bill we have had but he has not answered the point <e> <s> that widow a poor pensioner widow with nothing at all can be living beside a wealthy widow <e> <s> they are not being treated equably because the poor widow will pay exactly the same as the wealthy widow <e> <s> in fact there may be a poor pensioner couple living next door and that couple will pay double what the wealthy widow pays <e> <s> there is no equity there is no fairness in a poll tax <e>", "<cs> i have not sat down my lords <e> <s> the noble lord had an opportunity to explain and he did not <e> <s> we have already had complaints that there have been far too many speeches but i shall gladly give way to the noble lady <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a bold effort <e> <s> we are talking not about employees but purely and simply about how a person is concerned with the rates he pays for his house and the fact that he will not be paying in relation to his house but in respect of himself and those in that house who are over <e> <s> he has no responsibility for them only for himself <e> <s> as the noble lord says he will find it difficult to work out but i could find it out in about two minutes with that computer in inverness a look at the valuation that has been placed upon his house and what he actually pays for it <e> <s> there is no secret about it <e> <s> it is there for everybody to see <e> <s> we are sorry about his plight <e> <s> i do not think it is the computer that has broken down i think it is simply his capacity in respect of mathematics <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the minister appreciates that with this amendment we are expressing our concern about the efficacy of the eventual introduction of the legislation <e> <s> that will be april <e> <s> he will be aware of course that after the regulations are laid local authorities will have to get on with the business of drawing up schemes and making the system work <e> <s> they have a complicated register to draw up <e> <s> the matter does not end there <e> <s> there is the question of finance <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there is a lot more in this than has been given credit <e> <s> we are getting rid of domestic rates after one and a half centuries but the philosophy behind the idea of domestic rating was ability to pay <e> <s> before the war indeed probably earlier than that people tended to live in a house that did not flaunt but pretty well represented their wealth the kind of house that they were able to afford one that showed that they were a little better off than others and they tended to live in particular places and parts of towns <e> <s> therefore ability to pay was a consideration originally and lasted for a long time <e> <s> everybody knows that a small town can be divided up <e> <s> one can say people are pretty wealthy there and here is where the poor live <e> <s> the house on which one paid rates or rent was that indication <e> <s> i say this because to what one is prepared to pay in rent theoretically the rates would be added in scotland <e> <s> that is simple but true <e>", "<cs> the noble lord was very distinguished in that office <e> <s> i can remember some very complicated legislation that he put through <e> <s> the world was waiting for it <e> <s> the graduated pension scheme does he remember that one <e> <s> i wonder what happened to that <e> <s> that was going to save us from all the trials and tribulations about the pension fund and such-like <e> <s> i remember the noble lord taking that through <e> <s> i believe that it was douglas houghton and myself on the other side and i remember all the arguments <e>", "<cs> i am trying to finish in a couple of minutes <e>", "<cs> rhetorical questions are not meant to be answered <e> <s> sedentary interventions are not expected in this house <e> <s> manners are supposed to be very much better here <e> <s> the noble lord made quite a considerable speech <e> <s> i want to curtail my speeches this is about the second <e>", "<cs> what chance have i when there are interventions all round the place encouraging me to speak on <e>", "<cs> i wish to finish very quickly and i believe that we may finish with a division <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not giving way and i said that <e> <s> i want to finish my speech and to finish it within one minute <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that <e> <s> i said that it was already being paid and it is still being paid <e> <s> i did not object <e> <s> it is not being collected <e>", "<cs> my lords the lights in the chamber have dimmed <e> <s> that is the problem with accepting an amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble lords speech <e> <s> i had in mind a caravan park at maidens which has a shop cafs and so on <e> <s> those are on the grounds and because they were not there before the caravan park are definitely related to the caravan park <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us how the national trust houses and the other places that he mentioned will be dealt with under the new system <e>", "<cs> my lords i am dealing with properties that are held for the purpose of their preservation for the benefit of the nation <e> <s> in future how will they be dealt with as regards rating and in relation to all the new personal charges selective standard charges and so on that are causing concern and worry <e> <s> how will they be dealt with <e> <s> at what point do the worries of these people arise and are they right to be worried or is there some misconception in their minds that they will be subject to burdens of rates or charges that they do not have at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know it <e>", "<cs> my lords there is culzean and brodick castle <e>", "<cs> my lords i was merely adding culzean and brodick castle to the list <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not <e>", "<cs> my lords that is certainly a very illuminating reply and i am a little more enlightened <e> <s> certainly i am not in the dark <e> <s> i could have guessed what the answer was going to be but i was fascinated with the fact that the government were prepared to leave this apportionment not to prescription or anything else but to trust the local authority to do the right thing by the people concerned <e> <s> i am still concerned about the words <e>", "<cs> my lords by the leave of the house i thank the minister for repeating a second time what he said the first time <e> <s> he probably said it a little better but the fact is that at the start he did not have a clue as to what i was talking about <e> <s> maybe i have more knowledge of what stair-heads are like than he has having been brought up with one <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the minister realises that we already have a rebate scheme for non-domestic rates <e> <s> it is now in its second year <e> <s> it was introduced at the time of revaluation when million was made available by the treasury and a formula was drawn up whereby people would receive a rebate in respect of the increase in their valuation <e> <s> that applied for the first year it is now in its second year and it is still being applied <e> <s> will the minister look at that matter because it sponsored our suggestion in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is there and it may have to be continued <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is any force in the arguments put forward by the government <e> <s> what we should be talking about are the costs of the services of the local authority <e> <s> those costs have no relation at all to the retail price index which is outmoded and outdated <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not fully understand or completely follow the argument of the minister <e> <s> i accept that the responsibility is mine as i was preoccupied at the time <e> <s> i am sure i did not miss very much and that he was turning down the amendment <e> <s> however i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords that is interesting <e> <s> i am very glad to note that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter realised from where i had obtained my facts in relation to the amendment <e> <s> the idea came from the tory manifesto <e> <s> it was inspired by the then minister for education a lady called mrs margaret thatcher <e> <s> that was her idea not mine <e> <s> i thought it might have commended itself to the party opposite in view of its reverence for that ladys ideas <e> <s> it is not my idea at all <e> <s> that takes us right back to what the tory reform group said and it has to be discussed sooner or later <e> <s> i admit that the amendment takes us further along the path of centralisation <e>", "<cs> well well my lords what a long explanation <e> <s> logically if one says that liability starts when someone moves into the area it should end when he moves out of the area <e> <s> in the first place it is not when he goes on the register and in the second place it is when he is taken off the register <e> <s> there should have been no difficulty at all about accepting this amendment because the questions of when the individual goes on to the register and when he comes off the register or ceases to be resident are subject to further procedures in relation to this bill <e> <s> there is nothing that mentions as from the date when he becomes so resident <e> <s> that is dealt with later in the bill <e> <s> someone moving into an area has to notify the registrar that he is there and the registrar puts his name on the register <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the quick answer to the noble lords question is that nurses are above the rebate scheme <e> <s> however the point being made is that compared to people with a similar occupation in england they will have about a week deducted from their salaries <e> <s> at present they pay a week in respect of rent <e> <s> they will be at least a weeek worse off than nurses in england and wales <e> <s> if we lose nurses then the noble lord will remember that he has been applauding a change that does not include nurses unless we are going to be surprised and told that also includes nurses in training <e> <s> we do not know <e> <s> we do not know what a full-time course of education is <e> <s> we do not know who is in it <e> <s> we do not know what the community charge will be <e> <s> we do not know what the rebate scheme will be <e> <s> but let the noble lord go round scotland and tell people who are sympathetic towards the nurses in respect of this that they should go to the dhss and ask for a rebate he will get a quick answer from the scots to that one <e>", "<cs> my lords was the figure of accurate <e>", "<cs> my lords that is quite easy <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the scottish office <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to begin by thanking the government for accepting in part the amendment that i put down at the committee stage and which i have repeated at this report stage where i linked the severely handicapped physically and mentally together <e> <s> i think they could have gone a little further <e> <s> in many ways the tightness of the first part of the ministers acceptance of this in relation to mental handicap is very cruel <e> <s> when you take the tightness of that definition in his amendment no <e> <s> i do not think it goes nearly far enough towards what most rather sensitive people would have expected in respect of this <e> <s> even now we do not quite know <e> <s> it is going to be left to some unnamed experts to arrive at some definition that we are going to get in a regulation later <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that it is not confined to certain hospitals that are registered and the like <e> <s> i hope the minister appreciates what another part of the scottish office is doing <e> <s> at the moment the noble baroness lady carnegy is busy with matters about which i shall have something to say next thursday if there is a next thursday in parliamentary time in relation to changes made in establishments that are registered under the acts mentioned by my noble friend namely the social work act and the nursing home act <e> <s> has he looked at that matter and the effect there may well be on the proposed changes <e>", "<cs> my lords i said earlier when we spoke about this that it is all very well to stand at the dispatch box and say that the concerns will be taken into account <e> <s> it is the secretary of state who makes all the decisions <e> <s> he can have all the discussions he likes with the local authorities but when they come down to the business of the revenue support grant the aggregate expense of the local authority is determined by the secretary of state <e> <s> i have never known the local authorities in recent years to accept as fair what the government have decided <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt whether it provides clarity <e> <s> the subsection reads <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a lawyer with no sense of humour suggesting that it is not the cavalry but the crocodile <e> <s> i thought it was america that the crocodile went to not the house of lords <e>", "<cs>

charge based on a multiplier of between one and two <e> <s> there is no power to vary it either up or down <e> <s> it is a standard charge <e> <s> it will be welcomed by some it will not be understood by another who has an uncomfortable but enjoyable little cottage in argyll <e>", "<cs> my lords did the minister say that it would be undesirable or impracticable to bring forward the regulations within this timescale <e> <s> i appreciate that it will be impracticable within days of the passing of the act <e> <s> we are now within about a week of the passing of the act somewhere around th may <e> <s> if we allow days after that i think ministers will be preoccupied with other matters and they would not be able to bring forward the regulations as we probably would suggest <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of that very clear explanation i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind what the noble lord said about my next amendment i think i had better withdraw this one quickly <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the hour the date and the year will be noted and marked down <e> <s> i express my thanks to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not argue with the noble lord at this time of night <e> <s> however the amendment was well intended and worthwhile <e> <s> if he had any sense he would have accepted it <e> <s> since he has not and since he has taken so many words to say no i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the explanation is anything but straightforward <e> <s> it does anything but make sense <e> <s> the registration officer would know that if he did not comply with the request by a certain time then he would have to allow it <e> <s> there is no gap in amending the register <e> <s> however it is obvious that the government are not going to make any change in this respect <e> <s> i am anxious to save time <e> <s> we do not have a lot of time <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment and i shall not move the next amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords they should be taken separately <e> <s> that is a different point altogether <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the government for having made the change <e> <s> noble lords should appreciate that being named even against your will as the responsible person brings with it possible penalties <e> <s> you may be fined on the say-so of the registration officer not any court of law because you have given false information or because you say i am not going to give that information it wouldnt be right for me to give it <e> <s> if you do that having been appointed to this position which you did not want you can be fined in the first instance <e> <s> you are not fined because it is a civil debt a strange new idea that you empower a registration officer carrying out the task which parliament has laid on him by this if he does not get the right information or gets false information

explanation before more than once <e> <s> the difficulty is in relation to the whole business <e> <s> it is easy enough for rating purposes to know that there is a house in a particular area <e> <s> that house is valued by the assessor who in scotland is the same person as the electoral registration officer <e> <s> the noble lady lady saltoun filled in a form <e> <s> that form was sent to her <e> <s> but no form is being sent to anyone here <e> <s> that is what i want <e>", "<cs> my lords we could have avoided all this nonsense with the person who knows about registration <e> <s> the person who is subject to all the regulations in respect of registration is the ccro the community charge registration officer <e> <s> it is far easier to say ccro than community charge registration officer <e> <s> really they should satisfy him about reasonableness or otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords surely it is appreciated that the address may not itself be in the area of that ccro <e> <s> from that point of view it is essential that the factual information be there <e> <s> if you are going to charge somebody for at least three months you need to know where the liability was incurred and it may be more than one address <e> <s> from the point of view of the individual who is being levied with this civil debt the address or addresses should be there <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not convinced of that <e> <s> if you are going to charge someone for three months backdated you want the address at which the liability was incurred and not paid <e> <s> i will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister has not lost the support of the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls by doing that he having explained how right the government were and indeed always and no matter how stupid are the proposals put forward <e> <s> he has been let down and i may say it serves him right <e> <s> he should have been a little more hesitant the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter did not rise to this one <e> <s> he probably realised that there was something in the amendment <e> <s> what the government meant by their reply was we dont really know and they have done the sensible thing <e> <s> they can do without this and i thank the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed but not surprised <e> <s> if only the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls had spoken in favour of the government we might have had a chance <e> <s> there will need to be in existance two or three registers there must be one which is complete and one which gives only certain information <e> <s> the existence of a complete register holds the danger that other people will obtain it in some way or another <e> <s> the names addresses and ages of people are to be shown on the register <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not speaking of anyone as young as the noble baroness <e> <s> i believe that she appreciates the difficulties when information is given to some people but not to others <e> <s> it can fall into the wrong hands <e> <s> i have always argued that the fact that one appears on the register makes it unnecessary for the age to be shown one is obviously over years of age <e> <s> that is all that people need to know from the point of view of liability for this tax <e> <s> however i do not think we are going to get anything from the government by way of this and i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment having sounded the warning about the difficulty of these registers about limiting them and safeguarding them as far as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house one of the penalties of putting down even a drafting amendment is that we have to endure a scottish office explanation <e>", "<cs> did anybody understand it <e> <s> did anybody understand why we have to have the word standard added to the words monthly payment or monthly instalment <e> <s> all that needed to be said was a monthly instalment <e> <s> that is one meaning of standard <e> <s> it is not only the personal charge you have a standard community charge and so you have a standard monthly payment of a standard community charge <e> <s> it is rather ridiculous <e> <s> the scottish office is getting worse <e> <s> bring back the noble earl lord mansfield that is what i say <e> <s> however i am not going to risk another explanation from the minister and so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that there is flexibility and that it is not mandatory for the housing local authority to collect from people from whom it does not normally collect this will make easier the method by which the charges will be collected <e> <s> it is easier to collect the rates with the rents so much so that people in some areas do not know the rents of their houses and talk about rent when they mean rent and rates because they make one payment <e> <s> however the local authority never collects from people other than the tenant or spouse <e> <s> therefore i am not very happy about this way of doing it <e> <s> it is true that may rather than shall provides a certain measure of flexibility <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is all very well for the minister to plead me and my perfection of draftsmanship when giving powers to the secretary of state but he will remember what has happened since then <e> <s> what was the proportion of that relevant expenditure that i gave which was determined after the aggregate of grant had been drawn up <e> <s> the reason why there has been no demand for an explanation hitherto is because i was so generous to local authorities <e> <s> there was no outcry from the local authorities in <e>", "<cs> that is right <e> <s> rates have increased because the government have not been paying their due share of much that is national expenditure <e> <s> that is not determined by the local authorities themselves but by the actions of this house by decisions of the government in respect of <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think we are going to get any more joy from the government so i may as well ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friends concern is well justified <e> <s> we are working on the basis at the moment of what is going to happen in where it is easy to determine a persons income in relation to pensions and other things which are universal throughout the whole country <e> <s> in per cent <e> <s> rent rebates will be admitted and per cent <e> <s> rates rebates within that <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord mackie of benshie has probably been less than generous to the highlands <e> <s> he read a report from the highlands region <e> <s> i read it with interest and thought that it proved its case very well <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not disagree with what is said in the act or in the amendment <e> <s> i think that i mentioned it when i spoke about the amendment <e> <s> the amendment is even less generous in respect of the suggested reduction than was the act <e> <s> it shows how reasonable my noble friend is being on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to interrupt too much <e> <s> but that is looked after by the share and the apportionment in respect of the rate support grant <e> <s> whereas glasgow receives per cent <e> <s> the highland region receives far more <e> <s> that is a recognition of more costly services <e> <s> it is already dealt with <e> <s> the government pay their share through the apportionment of the rate support grant <e>", "<cs> like students <e>", "<cs> my lords we have made some headway in that the government are considering whether there should be special arrangements in respect of registration <e> <s> apart from that am i to understand that such people will be liable no matter how they are registered <e> <s> we must remember that it is not only the people in the forces who are more or less permanently resident in scotland there are their wives and children who may be grown up <e> <s> as far as i can see they will be registered but we have not yet reached a conclusion on how they will be registered and that is the moot point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad of that reply <e> <s> it is an important point because although there are around of our own forces in scotland they tend to be concentrated in particular areas <e> <s> from the local authoritys point of view it is important how much it will gain or lose by this breach of the general principle that everybody will be treated alike <e> <s> in view of the explanation i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i suggest that we know at least what is being done in principle here <e> <s> we are left with the words <e>", "<cs> the government think that anything is reasonable after this hotch-potch <e> <s> remember my lords that we have different matters in respect of which we have regulations <e> <s> i am sure that the government have forgotten something <e> <s> this bill is quite unique <e> <s> somebody asked me how to spell this word the other day and i must therefore use it <e> <s> in scottish we call it a mouger <e> <s> i am sure that the minister does not know how to spell it even if he knows what it means <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> could we have some information about clause <e> <s> i have been concerned about this voluntary registration <e> <s> it says one queer thing <e> <s> i considered putting down an amendment but thought better of it <e> <s> in any case we have another stage to come and i could put it down then if we are not satisfied <e> <s> why have we got this phrase <e>", "<cs> surely they are registered not with the local authority as schools but with the secretary of state so that the powers in respect of inspection and so on do not rest with the education authorities but rest with the secretary of state for the scottish office <e> <s> schools were the entire responsibility of the secretary of state <e> <s> for years and years since this government came to power and it may well be before that for all i know they have been trying to get rid of them because the full cost fell on the secretary of states estimates <e> <s> certainly the local authorities had a responsibility in that they paid for every child who went there <e> <s> now that has been changed <e>", "<cs> but what is the effect of subsection on those affected by this clause and subsection <e>", "<cs> i think i should have asked the noble baroness lady carnegy about this <e> <s> subsection says <e>", "<cs> no i am not <e> <s> i am referring first to subsection of clause and i am linking that up with what is written in subsection a of clause <e>", "<cs> i think that it is but it still does not make sense when one sees what is written here <e> <s> i hope that somebody will clarify my mind <e>", "<cs> i admit that i have not had the time to go carefully through all the various acts <e> <s> however i looked at them quickly after i had eventually discovered the acts in the library <e> <s> one of them had been missing for a long time <e> <s> i do not know who was studying it <e> <s> it may be that the noble lord lord ferrier has been studying it <e> <s> he indicates that he is not guilty <e> <s> we must try to discover the identity of the person who has been anxious to obtain the act and blind us all with science <e> <s> maybe it was the draftsmen who took it out but then thought they would do better without it <e>", "<cs> does this also relate to clause <e>", "<cs> very well <e>", "<cs> i thought the noble baroness said she was taking some other amendments with this one <e> <s> i did not quite see how this fitted in with clauses and in respect of nursing homes because i did not think that we were up to the point where we had even mentioned nursing homes <e> <s> i do not see any reference to that apart from subsection of clause which we have not quite come to yet <e> <s> i am quite willing however to take the point <e>", "<cs> this is subject to what is already laid down in i think section of the act <e> <s> those who are going to apply for registration under the act will need to comply with all the other regulations already there <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble earl is aware of this but they have this control over the persons who are employed and the persons who run the establishments <e> <s> there has to be either a qualified resident i stress resident medical practitioner or qualified nurse <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness may think that it will not be a very large amount <e> <s> but as i understand it there will also be a continuing annual fee in respect of inspection and the like <e> <s> that is something else <e> <s> i am thinking about the people who own such establishments and what they have to do <e> <s> if they come under clause then obviously it will be their task to collect the personal community charge <e> <s> it may well be that the people with whom they are dealing are not exactly those who can easily fill up forms in respect of rebates and so on <e> <s> that is something else that will be at the cost of the people concerned <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for that explanation <e> <s> i shall not oppose her amendment but i shall think about it in connection with the future progress of the bill <e>", "<cs> well my lords all sorts of things can happen but that is most unlikely <e> <s> however there may be a change of government there may not be a change of government <e> <s> if there is a change of government there will be a change of secretary of state <e> <s> very difficult things can happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested to hear of the confidence of the minister of state <e> <s> he will remember that there was to be a transition period of three years because it was said this proposal could not possibly be implemented overnight and it had to be worked in gently <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is desirable from the point of view of truth and just to keep the government right at it <e> <s> i have with me their rates paper by the department of the environment and the welsh office as well as the scottish one <e> <s> in paragraph they do not even mention the community charge <e> <s> it reads <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i take that point and i entirely agree with the noble lady lady saltoun <e> <s> it is seldom that premises are not requiring local government services but i suggest that a small caravan site is less in need of services compared with a mansion <e> <s> here we have whether the government like it or not a property tax <e> <s> the bill says <e>", "<cs> my lord it is a pity about that because every organisation that has written to us about this has been opposed to it from the point of view of the complexity of organisation and the fairness of it <e> <s> i was glad that at least the noble lord said that this would not apply to nursing homes or residential homes <e> <s> i hope that he is right because this has to be determined not by the government but by the registration officers <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble lord was in the house yes he was there when we dealt with lords amendments to the reorganisation of local government in scotland <e> <s> the government found it possible to put in a considerable number of other amendments particularly in relation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that the minister justifies the differential <e> <s> he talks about the varying burdens of household expenses and so on but we are not discussing a varying burden we are considering the community charge which is exactly the same for the young non-earner as it is for the young earner <e> <s> it places the unemployed in the same situation as the employed <e> <s> they pay the same sum of <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will remember that he tried to justify the differentiation <e> <s> that is what worries me <e> <s> he justified the differentiation in treatment between the to -year-olds and those over although they are both paying the same <e> <s> there should be no differentiation there <e> <s> if that is the ministers last word i beg leave to have the house decide the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish that we had been advanced by that explanation but as i understood it the minister said that there would be no per cent <e> <s> rebate <e> <s> he held by the fact that everyone should make a contribution <e> <s> that means that the poorest of the poor namely the vulnerable groups will make a contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords that is correct <e> <s> i am glad that we have had it reconfirmed because the regulations will apply to the community charge in scotland <e> <s> they should be different to those in england because the burden is scottish not english <e> <s> however in view of what has been said and as i realise that the minister appreciated the importance of what he said about rebates for the vulnerable groups in connection with the community charge i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we are getting a bit nearer the end of that road <e> <s> we leave a problem for the other house with the considerable number of amendments that we have made <e> <s> i should have liked to list all those that were of great advantage <e> <s> some of <e>", "<cs> my lords will similar statistics be produced by the secretary of state for scotland in relation to scotland <e> <s> if they are they will show quite clearly that what we are dealing with here as evidenced in the courts is an english disease <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that there has been nothing but praise for the behaviour of the scottish supporters who went to gothenburg just the other week <e>", "<cs> my lords i had the impression that in the last hurried days of this parliament everything we were doing in asking for the indulgence of members was related to urgency <e> <s> i do not know whether noble lords have had a look at the definition of capital expenses scotland order <e>", "<cs> my lords april was not that long away and we were busy with other things <e> <s> what date in april was this <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the minister realises it but the advisory committee will meet fairly soon to discuss the whole question of the definition of capital expenditure <e> <s> would it not be far better also to remit this to them for consideration <e> <s> why should there be haggling between the government and the local authorities about this kind of thing <e> <s> it creates distrust and eventually leads to confrontation <e> <s> the government have plenty of time <e> <s> why do they not withdraw this order <e> <s> they can always bring it back they have time to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down does he not appreciate that he is simply doing as he is told by the treasury <e> <s> they are just carrying forward the kind of cavilling procedure of tying up the local authorities as much as possible <e> <s> my information in relation to the working party is entirely different from his <e> <s> my information is that they are going to discuss the difference between capital and revenue expenditure <e> <s> i do not know where the noble lord gets his information but i get mine directly from someone concerned in this <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been very carefully through the amendments and all the discussions that took place on them <e> <s> i know that all scotland is waiting for the bill <e> <s> far be it for me to hold it up by one minute <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we should spend a little time on these there are a great many <e> <s> we do not want to cause any trouble to the government front bench by going too quickly <e> <s> perhaps there is one amendment on which the minister would like me to concentrate <e> <s> i shall be happy to listen to his explanation of one that is not too technical <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we could take the rest as well <e> <s> i hope that the minister will not disappoint me <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that the government cannot say they were not warned about what was going to happen in scotland will he take heed of that warning <e> <s> the government <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not rather out of place to refer to scotland at all in this respect <e> <s> has not the clydesdale bank already been taken over by the midland bank <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of what is happening in presbyterian scotland which is traditionally anti-sabbatarian as regards sunday trading <e> <s> one can see what is happening there where there is no law to enforce <e>", "<cs> it is a great pity that three authorities particularly three councils in scotland which are unique in being single-tier authorities should be delaying the committee at this the prime time of the day <e> <s> would it not have been better to do what we should have done before <e> <s> if a proposal is made that applies to scotland it should be covered in an act of parliament for scotland <e> <s> i seem to remember that in the last session a point was raised in the chamber as to the manner in which scotland is woven into english legislation <e> <s> often there is no application to england and wales at all <e> <s> there are no such authorities in

back-benchers in another place and the result is the worst of all worlds <e> <s> scottish legislation is tied into english legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister of state was not in this house

start <e> <s> we knew years ago that there would be a problem in relation to the closing of schools <e> <s> in the very act that passed the power from the secretary of state to the local authority is the power in which effectively they resurrect the power of the secretary of state to intervene <e> <s> we object to the strange use of regulations stemming from an act which reduced the power of the secretary of state effectively to sneer at local democracy <e> <s> is this doctrinaire <e> <s> there is nothing doctrinaire about dealing with a situation in which the government have been asking
