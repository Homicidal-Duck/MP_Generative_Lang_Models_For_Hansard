["<cs> my lords we are at a slight disadvantage here because we are talking about new clause a even though we have not yet come to it and <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but with all due respect even the noble lord cannot change the rules of order <e> <s> the amendment cannot possibly be moved before due timei think i am right in that respect <e> <s> we are jumping over what i regard as other relevant amendments <e> <s> i am not entirely happy with clause a and i suppose that as everyone else has been discussing it i might as well have a go too <e> <s> i am not entirely happy that the government have not seen fit to remove the phrase employee or <e> <s> if the noble lord recollects the discussion that took place at the previous stage of the bill he will know that very considerable objection was taken to the word permitsyet that word is still included <e> <s> i do not think that your lordships were entirely satisfied with regard to what was expected of the driver in the particular circumstances of the bus going along the road <e> <s> what are the new words now <e> <s> without his consent or connivance <e> <s> let us suppose that in the first instance the driver had not consented or connived but had done all that he reasonably could to prevent there being alcohol on the bus but then sees someone <e>", "<cs> my lords what i suggest is that the responsibility is his and that he should put an agent on the bus to ensure that the requirement is carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl really should read the working partys report on football crowd behaviour <e> <s> special regard is to be paid by local authorities and other people concerned to get these buses parked beside the ground for the simple reason that much of the trouble arises after the game is over <e> <s> people are probably slightly less alcoholically inclined but they are <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it may well be that we slipped up ourselves in this house <e> <s> not long ago we had before us a provisional order from the greater glasgow passenger transport executive <e> <s> i think that the noble earl lord mansfield will remember this <e> <s> i dared to ask one or two questions in my youthful innocence just having arrived in your lordships house <e> <s> but having retrieved this order from the place where i had thrown it i discover of course that the police are the greater glasgow passenger executive and will be concerned with this <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am perfectly sure that the noble earl has done his best but it is not really good enough <e> <s> when he says it was not suggested that this in any way was going to cure all the evils of vandalism he should appreciate what <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we should congratulate the noble lord lord reigate for having summed up the feelings of the house and express our appreciation and thanks to the noble lord the minister for his receptiveness <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships house will support this amendment if the government do not accept it <e> <s> it is a very special body that we are creating <e> <s> it is national and the purpose of this national body is something that is very dear to the hearts of everyone <e> <s> we discussed for quite a long time whether the word memorial should be included and we decided to keep it in <e> <s> when we consider the nature of the body there is nothing that would mark it out as more special than any other than that the appointment should be by the crown <e> <s> it is right that it should be <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the noble earl and i shall do so very briefly <e> <s> i cannot accept the assurance that ministers will at all times be in the same place and readily available <e> <s> there have been occasions when ministers have been held up in isolated places <e> <s> i can remember an instance when the noble lord lord butler of saffron walden could not get away from an island in scotland for some days and some days may be vital in certain cases as regards acceptance <e>", "<cs> these phrases are used within this clause <e> <s> it is the guidance to the education authorities <e> <s> surely in the first instance under clause <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will appreciate the wording of the letter <e> <s> the letter said <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the minister has said about a review and as the minister intends to keep in touch with both sides the failure to do so previously was a great mistake- shall not press the matter <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness replies i should like to raise one very short point <e> <s> if this scheme is so wonderful if it is going to <e>", "<cs> i have sat and listened to most of this debate <e>", "<cs> yes because we have dropped some amendments and not moved others which were worthy of consideration <e> <s> it is over years since i as a young teacher in the gorbals in glasgow as part of my duties handed out free milk <e> <s> in fact it was not free milk because in those days a third of a pint of milk cost a halfpenny <e> <s> most of the class got it for nothing but many of the children were not all that happy to say that they got their milk free because it designated their parents as unemployed and thus unable to pay that sum <e> <s> but since that time it has been the duty of the local authority to provide milk or to make provision for it <e>", "<cs> you never mentioned them <e>", "<cs> my lords cannot the minister ask the bbc to look again at ways and means of finding the necessary money <e> <s> there has been and the bbc scottish symphony orchestra played a part in it a considerable resurgence of musical life in scotland <e> <s> these cuts will be disastrous <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that this is not the time to impoverish scotland or the regions <e>", "<cs> what we are debating applies equally to scotland as to england and wales <e> <s> in actual fact i want to save some time and trouble for your lordships because i am prepared to accept the decision we take on this clause as applicable to a later scottish clause <e> <s> i feel myself very privileged indeed to take part in a debate on education and to do so after the noble lord lord butler <e> <s> i was not fortunate enough to be in the house in but no man has played a greater part in the reorganisation and progress of education in england and incidentally on overspill in scotland as well <e>", "<cs> may i ask the government what their intention is in regard to the scottish clause <e>", "<cs> that is only the first of them but i shall not list them tonight <e> <s> if we had not had that duty i do not think our progress would have been as good as it has been <e> <s> the provision in the act has been there for a long time and there has never been any dubiety in scotland about the fact that the duty was there and as i say the act mentions not only nursery schools but nursery classes so there need not be any difficulty over defining what we are talking about <e>", "<cs> that would be one good reason for leaving the proposal out of this bill altogether
